AB  - Cloud computing is the de facto platform for deploying resource- and data-intensive real-time applications due to the collaboration of large scale resources operating in cross-administrative domains. For example, real-time systems are generated by smart devices (e.g., sensors in smart homes that monitor surroundings in real-time, security cameras that produce video streams in real-time, cloud gaming, social media streams, etc.). Such low-end devices form a microgrid which has low computational and storage capacity and hence offload data unto the cloud for processing. Cloud computing still lacks mature time-oriented scheduling and resource allocation strategies which thoroughly deliberate stringent QoS. Traditional approaches are sufficient only when applications have real-time and data constraints, and cloud storage resources are located with computational resources where the data are locally available for task execution. Such approaches mainly focus on resource provision and latency, and are prone to missing deadlines during tasks execution due to the urgency of the tasks and limited user budget constraints. The timing and data requirements exacerbate the efficient task scheduling and resource allocation problems. To cope with the aforementioned gaps, we propose a time- and cost-efficient resource allocation strategy for smart systems that periodically offload computational and data-intensive load to the cloud. The proposed strategy minimizes the data files transfer overhead to computing resources by selecting appropriate pairs of computing and storage resources. The celebrated results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in terms of resource selection and tasks processing within time and budget constraints when compared with the other counterparts.

AB  - Smart Cities sensing is an emerging paradigm to facilitate the transition into smart city services. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the widespread use of mobile devices with computing and sensing capabilities has motivated applications that require data acquisition at a societal scale. These valuable data can be leveraged to train advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models that serve various smart services that benefit society in all aspects. Despite their effectiveness, legacy data acquisition models backed with centralized Machine Learning models entail security and privacy concerns, and lead to less participation in large-scale sensing and data provision for smart city services. To overcome these challenges, Federated Learning is a novel concept that can serve as a solution to the privacy and security issues encountered within the process of data collection. This survey article presents an overview of smart city sensing and its current challenges followed by the potential of Federated Learning in addressing those challenges. A comprehensive discussion of the state-of-the-art methods for Federated Learning is provided along with an in-depth discussion on the applicability of Federated Learning in smart city sensing; clear insights on open issues, challenges, and opportunities in this field are provided as guidance for the researchers studying this subject matter.

AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have contributed to advances in Occupational Health and Safety, improving the security of workers. The use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) based on ICTs reduces the risk of accidents in the workplace, thanks to the capacity of the equipment to make decisions on the basis of environmental factors. Paradigms such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) make it possible to generate PPE models feasibly and create devices with more advanced characteristics such as monitoring, sensing the environment and risk detection between others. The working environment is monitored continuously by these models and they notify the employees and their supervisors of any anomalies and threats. This paper presents a smart helmet prototype that monitors the conditions in the workers’ environment and performs a near real-time evaluation of risks. The data collected by sensors is sent to an AI-driven platform for analysis. The training dataset consisted of 11,755 samples and 12 different scenarios. As part of this research, a comparative study of the state-of-the-art models of supervised learning is carried out. Moreover, the use of a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is proposed for the detection of possible occupational risks. The data are processed to make them suitable for the CNN and the results are compared against a Static Neural Network (NN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), where the CNN had an accuracy of 92.05% in cross-validation.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 21
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have been used in many studies for ship detection because they can be captured without being affected by time and weather. In recent years, the development of deep learning techniques has facilitated studies on ship detection in SAR images using deep learning techniques. However, because the noise from SAR images can negatively affect the learning of the deep learning model, it is necessary to reduce the noise through preprocessing. In this study, deep learning vessel detection was performed using preprocessed SAR images, and the effects of the preprocessing of the images on deep learning vessel detection were compared and analyzed. Through the preprocessing of SAR images, (1) intensity images, (2) decibel images, and (3) intensity difference and texture images were generated. The M2Det object detection model was used for the deep learning process and preprocessed SAR images. After the object detection model was trained, ship detection was performed using test images. The test results are presented in terms of precision, recall, and average precision (AP), which were 93.18%, 91.11%, and 89.78% for the intensity images, respectively, 94.16%, 94.16%, and 92.34% for the decibel images, respectively, and 97.40%, 94.94%, and 95.55% for the intensity difference and texture images, respectively. From the results, it can be found that the preprocessing of the SAR images can facilitate the deep learning process and improve the ship detection performance. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the development of deep learning-based ship detection techniques in SAR images in the future.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The ability to precisely map urban land use types can significantly aid urban planning and urban system understanding. In recent years, remote sensing images and social sensing data have been frequently used for urban land use mapping. However, there still remains a problem: what is the best basic unit for fusing remote sensing images with social sensing data? The aim of this study is to explore the impact of spatial units on urban land use mapping, with remote sensing images and social sensing data of Shenzhen City, China. Three different basic units were first applied to delineate urban land use types, and for each unit, a word dictionary was built by fusing natural&ndash;physical features from high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images and the socioeconomic semantic features from point of interest (POI) data. The latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm and random forest methods were then applied to map the land use of the Futian district&mdash;the core region of Shenzhen. The experiment demonstrates that: (1) No matter what kind of spatial unit, it is beneficial to fuse multisource data to improve the performance. However, when using different spatial units, the importances of features are different. (2) Using block-based spatial units results in the final map looking the best. However, a great challenge of this approach is that the scale is too coarse to handle mixed functional areas. (3) Using grid- and object-based units, the problem of mixed functional areas can be better solved. Additionally, the object-based land use map looks better from our visual interpretation. Accordingly, the results of this study could give other researchers references and advice for future studies.

T2  - ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Herein, we propose a novel indoor structure extraction (ISE) method that can reconstruct an indoor planar structure with a feature structure map (FSM) and enable indoor robot navigation using a navigation structure map (NSM). To construct the FSM, we first propose a two-staged region growing algorithm to segment the planar feature and to obtain the original planar point cloud. Subsequently, we simplify the planar feature using quadtree segmentation based on cluster fusion. Finally, we perform simple triangulation in the interior and vertex-assignment triangulation in the boundary to accomplish feature reconstruction for the planar structure. The FSM is organized in the form of a mesh model. To construct the NSM, we first propose a novel ground extraction method based on indoor structure analysis under the Manhattan world assumption. It can accurately capture the ground plane in an indoor scene. Subsequently, we establish a passable area map (PAM) within different heights. Finally, a novel-form NSM is established using the original planar point cloud and the PAM. Experiments are performed using three public datasets and one self-collected dataset. The proposed plane segmentation approach is evaluated on two simulation datasets and achieves a recall of approximately 99%, which is 5% higher than that of the traditional plane segmentation method. Furthermore, the triangulation performance of our method compared with the traditional greedy projection triangulation show that our method performs better in terms of feature representation. The experimental results reveal that our ISE method is robust and effective for extracting indoor structures.

TI  - The Deep 3D Convolutional Multi-Branching Spatial-Temporal-Based Unit Predicting Citywide Traffic Flow
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 21
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Recently, for public safety and traffic management, traffic flow prediction is a crucial task. The citywide traffic flow problem is still a big challenge in big cities because of many complex factors. However, to handle some complex factors, e.g., spatial-temporal and some external factors in the intelligent traffic flow forecasting problem, spatial-temporal data for urban applications (i.e., travel time estimation, trajectory planning, taxi demand, traffic congestion, and the regional rainfall) is inherently stochastic and unpredictable. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based novel model called &ldquo;multi-branching spatial-temporal attention-based long-short term memory residual unit (MBSTALRU)&rdquo; for the citywide traffic flow from lower-level layers to high-level layers, simultaneously. In our work, initially, we have modeled the traffic flow with spatial correlations multiple 3D volume layers and propose the novel multi-branching scheme to control the spatial-temporal features. Our approach is useful for exploring temporal dependencies through the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) multiple branches, which aim to merge the spatial-temporal characteristics of historical data with three-time intervals, namely closeness, daily, and weekly, and we have embedded features by attention-based long-short term memory (LSTM). Then, we capture the correlation between traffic inflow and outflow with residual layers units. In the end, we merge the external factors dynamically to predict citywide traffic flow simultaneously. The simulation results have been performed on two real-world datasets, BJTaxi and NYCBike, which show better performance and effectiveness of the proposed method than previous state-of-the-art models.

AB  - A systematic review of the literature is presented related to the usage of blockchain technology (BCT) for cyber-threats in the context of Industry 4.0. BCT plays a crucial role in creating smart factories and it is recognized as a core technology that triggers a disruptive revolution in Industry 4.0. Beyond security, authentication, asset tracking and the exchange of smart contracts, BCTs allow terminals to exchange information according to mutually agreed rules within a secured manner. Consequently, BCT can play a crucial role in industrial sustainability by preserving the assets and the environment and by enhancing the quality of life of citizens. In this work, a classification of the most important cyber-attacks that occurred in the last decade in Industry 4.0 is proposed based on four classes. The latter classes cover scanning, local to remote, power of root and denial of service (DoS). BCT is also defined and various types belong to BCT are introduced and highlighted. Likewise, BCT protocols and implementations are discussed as well. BCT implementation includes linear structure and directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology. Then, a comparative study of the most relevant works based on BCT in Industry 4.0 is conducted in terms of confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy and multifactor authentication features. Our review shows that the integration of BCT in industry can ensure data confidentiality and integrity and should be enforced to preserve data availability and privacy. Future research directions towards enforcing BCT in the industrial field by considering machine learning, 5G/6G mobile systems and new emergent technologies are presented.

AB  - Mental health is the foundation of health and happiness as well as the basis for an individual&rsquo;s meaningful life. The environmental and social health of a city can measure the mental state of people living in a certain areas, and exploring urban dwellers&rsquo; mental states is an important factor in understanding and better managing cities. New dynamic and granular urban data provide us with a way to determine the environmental factors that affect the mental states of urban dwellers. The characteristics of the maximal information coefficient can identify the linear and nonlinear relationships so that we can fully identify the physical and social environmental factors that affect urban dwellers&rsquo; mental states and further test these relationships through linear and nonlinear modeling. Taking the Greater London as an example, we used data from the London Datastore to discover the environmental factors that had the highest correlation with urban mental health from 2015 to 2017 and to prove that they had a high nonlinear correlation through neural network modeling. This paper aimed to use a data-driven approach to find environmental factors that had not yet received enough attention and to provide a starting point for research by establishing hypotheses for further exploration of the impact of environmental factors on mental health.

AB  - Interdisciplinary cross-cultural and cross-organizational research offers great opportunities for innovative breakthroughs in the field of smart cities, yet it also presents organizational and knowledge development hurdles. Smart cities must be large towns able to sustain the needs of their citizens while promoting environmental sustainability. Smart cities foment the widespread use of novel information and communication technologies (ICTs); however, experimenting with these technologies in such a large geographical area is unfeasible. Consequently, smart campuses (SCs), which are universities where technological devices and applications create new experiences or services and facilitate operational efficiency, allow experimentation on a smaller scale, the concept of SCs as a testbed for a smart city is gaining momentum in the research community. Nevertheless, while universities acknowledge the academic role of a smart and sustainable approach to higher education, campus life and other student activities remain a mystery, which have never been universally solved. This paper proposes a SC concept to investigate the integration of building information modeling tools with Internet of Things- (IoT)-based wireless sensor networks in the fields of environmental monitoring and emotion detection to provide insights into the level of comfort. Additionally, it explores the ability of universities to contribute to local sustainability projects by sharing knowledge and experience across a multi-disciplinary team. Preliminary results highlight the significance of monitoring workspaces because productivity has been proven to be directly influenced by environment parameters. The comfort-monitoring infrastructure could also be reused to monitor physical parameters from educational premises to increase energy efficiency.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a new socioeconomic revolution in which data and immediacy are the main ingredients. IoT generates large datasets on a daily basis but it is currently considered as &ldquo;dark data&rdquo;, i.e., data generated but never analyzed. The efficient analysis of this data is mandatory to create intelligent applications for the next generation of IoT applications that benefits society. Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are very well suited to identifying hidden patterns and correlations in this data deluge. In particular, clustering algorithms are of the utmost importance for performing exploratory data analysis to identify a set (a.k.a., cluster) of similar objects. Clustering algorithms are computationally heavy workloads and require to be executed on high-performance computing clusters, especially to deal with large datasets. This execution on HPC infrastructures is an energy hungry procedure with additional issues, such as high-latency communications or privacy. Edge computing is a paradigm to enable light-weight computations at the edge of the network that has been proposed recently to solve these issues. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of emergent edge computing architectures that include low-power Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to speed-up these workloads. Our analysis includes performance and power consumption figures of the latest Nvidia&rsquo;s AGX Xavier to compare the energy-performance ratio of these low-cost platforms with a high-performance cloud-based counterpart version. Three different clustering algorithms (i.e., k-means, Fuzzy Minimals (FM), and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)) are designed to be optimally executed on edge and cloud platforms, showing a speed-up factor of up to 11&times; for the GPU code compared to sequential counterpart versions in the edge platforms and energy savings of up to 150% between the edge computing and HPC platforms.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has various network applications and has attracted the interest of many research and industrial communities. Particularly, the number of vulnerable or unprotected IoT devices has drastically increased, along with the amount of suspicious activity, such as IoT botnet and large-scale cyber-attacks. In order to address this security issue, researchers have deployed machine and deep learning methods to detect attacks targeting compromised IoT devices. Despite these efforts, developing an efficient and effective attack detection approach for resource-constrained IoT devices remains a challenging task for the security research community. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective IoT botnet attack detection approach. The proposed approach relies on a Fisher-score-based feature selection method along with a genetic-based extreme gradient boosting (GXGBoost) model in order to determine the most relevant features and to detect IoT botnet attacks. The Fisher score is a representative filter-based feature selection method used to determine significant features and discard irrelevant features through the minimization of intra-class distance and the maximization of inter-class distance. On the other hand, GXGBoost is an optimal and effective model, used to classify the IoT botnet attacks. Several experiments were conducted on a public botnet dataset of IoT devices. The evaluation results obtained using holdout and 10-fold cross-validation techniques showed that the proposed approach had a high detection rate using only three out of the 115 data traffic features and improved the overall performance of the IoT botnet attack detection process.

AB  - Supply chain 4.0 denotes the fourth revolution of supply chain management systems, integrating manufacturing operations with telecommunication and Information Technology processes. Although the overarching aim of supply chain 4.0 is the enhancement of production systems within supply chains, making use of global reach, increasing agility and emerging technology, with the ultimate goal of increasing efficiency, timeliness and profitability, Supply chain 4.0 suffers from unique and emerging operational and cyber risks. Supply chain 4.0 has a lack of semantic standards, poor interoperability, and a dearth of security in the operation of its manufacturing and Information Technology processes. The technologies that underpin supply chain 4.0 include blockchain, smart contracts, applications of Artificial Intelligence, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things. Each of these technologies, individually and combined, create cyber security issues that should be addressed. This paper explains the nature of the military supply chains 4.0 and how it uniquely differs from the commercial supply chain, revealing their strengths, weaknesses, dependencies and the fundamental technologies upon which they are built. This encompasses an assessment of the cyber risks and opportunities for research in the field, including consideration of connectivity, sensing and convergence of systems. Current and emerging semantic models related to the standardization, development and safety assurance considerations for implementing new technologies into military supply chains 4.0 are also discussed. This is examined from a holistic standpoint and through technology-specific lenses to determine current states and implications for future research directions.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) coupled with big data analytics is emerging as the core of smart and sustainable systems which bolsters economic, environmental and social sustainability. Cloud-based data centers provide high performance computing power to analyze voluminous IoT data to provide invaluable insights to support decision making. However, multifarious servers in data centers appear to be the black hole of superfluous energy consumption that contributes to 23% of the global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in ICT (Information and Communication Technology) industry. IoT-related energy research focuses on low-power sensors and enhanced machine-to-machine communication performance. To date, cloud-based data centers still face energy&ndash;related challenges which are detrimental to the environment. Virtual machine (VM) consolidation is a well-known approach to affect energy-efficient cloud infrastructures. Although several research works demonstrate positive results for VM consolidation in simulated environments, there is a gap for investigations on real, physical cloud infrastructure for big data workloads. This research work addresses the gap of conducting real physical cloud infrastructure-based experiments. The primary goal of setting up a real physical cloud infrastructure is for the evaluation of dynamic VM consolidation approaches which include integrated algorithms from existing relevant research. An open source VM consolidation framework, Openstack NEAT is adopted and experiments are conducted on a Multi-node Openstack Cloud with Apache Spark as the big data platform. Open sourced Openstack has been deployed because it enables rapid innovation, and boosts scalability as well as resource utilization. Additionally, this research work investigates the performance based on service level agreement (SLA) metrics and energy usage of compute hosts. Relevant results concerning the best performing combination of algorithms are presented and discussed.

The accelerating utilization of D&amp;AI has stirred the discussion concerning the responsible application of technologies for assisting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). D&amp;AI can raise productivity, lower costs, reduce resource intensity, and enable efficient public services. However, there are also risks and downsides that we all must identify and tackle to address any potential short-/long-term undesired impact. Notably, there exists a gap in knowledge about the mutual relationships between D&amp;AI and the 17 SDGs. To address this gap and gather broader perspectives of experts on the potential uses and pitfalls of D&amp;AI for SDGs and their respective indicators, we propose a participatory research approach: the Digitalization&ndash;Sustainability Matrix (DSM). The DSM serves as a means for collaborative methods, such as participatory action research (PAR), for the knowledge production process. We exercised the DSM in the Digitainable Thinkathon event, a gathering of experts from diverse sectors and backgrounds for capturing the action-oriented dialogues concerning the use of D&amp;AI technologies for the indicators of SDGs 4 (Education) and 13 (Climate Action). As a tool, the DSM aided in the discussion by systematically capturing transdisciplinary knowledge generated on several aspects, such as: (1) the need for research&ndash;practice nexus action; (2) data-capturing efforts and social considerations; (3) collaborative planning for utilizing the power of D&amp;AI; (4) lessons from the diverse community to encourage the purposeful use of technologies. Overall, the proposed approach effectively triggered a discussion on the crucial aspects that need to be considered for D&amp;AI&rsquo;s practices, a step towards deep-rooting the transdisciplinary perspectives for meaningful use of D&amp;AI for SDGs.

AB  - Understanding how, where, and when a city is expanding can inform better ways to make our cities more resilient, sustainable, and equitable. This paper explores urban volumetry using the Building 3D Density Index (B3DI) in 2001, 2010, 2019, and quantifies changes in the volume of buildings and urban expansion in Luxembourg City over the last two decades. For this purpose, we use airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud (2019) and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) of aerial orthophotos (2001, 2010) to extract 3D models, footprints of buildings and calculate the volume of individual buildings and B3DI in the frame of a 100 &times; 100 m grid, at the level of parcels, districts, and city scale. Findings indicate that the B3DI has notably increased in the past 20 years from 0.77 m3/m2 (2001) to 0.9 m3/m2 (2010) to 1.09 m3/m2 (2019). Further, the increase in the volume of buildings between 2001&ndash;2019 was +16 million m3. The general trend of changes in the cubic capacity of buildings per resident shows a decrease from 522 m3/resident in 2001, to 460 m3/resident in 2019, which, with the simultaneous appearance of new buildings and fast population growth, represents the dynamic development of the city.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Automated vulnerability detection is one of the critical issues in the realm of software security. Existing solutions to this problem are mostly based on features that are defined by human experts and directly lead to missed potential vulnerability. Deep learning is an effective method for automating the extraction of vulnerability characteristics. Our paper proposes intelligent and automated vulnerability detection while using deep representation learning and heterogeneous ensemble learning. Firstly, we transform sample data from source code by removing segments that are unrelated to the vulnerability in order to reduce code analysis and improve detection efficiency in our experiments. Secondly, we represent the sample data as real vectors by pre-training on the corpus and maintaining its semantic information. Thirdly, the vectors are fed to a deep learning model to obtain the features of vulnerability. Lastly, we train a heterogeneous ensemble classifier. We analyze the effectiveness and resource consumption of different network models, pre-training methods, classifiers, and vulnerabilities separately in order to evaluate the detection method. We also compare our approach with some well-known vulnerability detection commercial tools and academic methods. The experimental results show that our proposed method provides improvements in false positive rate, false negative rate, precision, recall, and F1 score.

AB  - The unprecedented urban growth of recent years requires improved urban planning and management to make urban spaces more inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Additionally, humanity faces the COVID pandemic, which especially complicates the management of Smart Cities. A possible solution to address these two problems (environmental and health) in Smart Cities may be the use of Machine Learning techniques. One of the objectives of our work is to thoroughly analyze the link between the concepts of Smart Cities, Machine Learning techniques and their applicability. In this work, an exhaustive study of the relationship between Smart Cities and the applicability of Machine Learning (ML) techniques is carried out with the aim of optimizing sustainability. For this, the ML models, analyzed from the point of view of the models, techniques and applications, are studied. The areas and dimensions of sustainability addressed are analyzed, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are discussed. The main objective is to propose a model (EARLY) that allows us to tackle these problems in the future. An inclusive perspective on applicability, sustainability scopes and dimensions, SDGs, tools, data types and Machine Learning techniques is provided. Finally, a case study applied to an Andalusian city is presented.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - With the tremendous increase of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the different service requirements of these IoT applications, machine-type communication (MTC) has attracted considerable attention from both industry and academia. Owing to the prominent advantages of supporting pervasive connectivity and wide area coverage, the cellular network is advocated as the potential wireless solution to realize IoT deployment for MTC, and this creative network paradigm is called the cellular IoT (C-IoT). In this paper, we propose the three-layer structured C-IoT architecture for MTC and review the challenges for deploying green C-IoT. Then, effective strategies for realizing green C-IoT are presented, including the energy efficient and energy harvesting schemes. We put forward several strategies to make the C-IoT run in an energy-saving manner, such as efficient random access and barring mechanisms, self-adapting machine learning predictions, scheduling optimization, resource allocation, fog computing, and group-oriented transmission. As for the energy harvesting schemes, the ambient and dedicated energy harvesting strategies are investigated. Afterwards, we give a detailed case study, which shows the effectiveness of reducing power consumption for the proposed layered C-IoT architecture. Additionally, for real-time and non-real-time applications, the power consumption of different on-off states for MTC devices is discussed.

AB  - This work presents a strategy to implement a distributed form of genetic algorithm (GA) on low power, low cost, and small-sized memory aiming for increased performance and reduction of energy consumption when compared to standalone GAs. This strategy focuses on making a distributed version of GA feasible to run as a low cost and a low power consumption embedded system utilizing devices such as 8-bit microcontrollers (&micro;Cs) and Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) for data transmission between those devices. Details about how the distributed GA was designed from a previous standalone implementation made by the authors and how the project is structured are presented. Furthermore, this work investigates the implementation limitations and shows results about its proper operation, most of them collected with the Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) technique, and resource consumption such as memory and processing time. Finally, some scenarios are analyzed to identify where this distributed version can be utilized and how it is compared to the single-node standalone implementation in terms of performance and energy consumption.

AB  - The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications and their interference with our daily life tasks have led to a large number of IoT devices and enormous sizes of IoT-generated data. The resources of IoT devices are limited; therefore, the processing and storing IoT data in these devices are inefficient. Traditional cloud-computing resources are used to partially handle some of the IoT resource-limitation issues; however, using the resources in cloud centers leads to other issues, such as latency in time-critical IoT applications. Therefore, edge-cloud-computing technology has recently evolved. This technology allows for data processing and storage at the edge of the network. This paper studies, in-depth, edge-computing architectures for IoT (ECAs-IoT), and then classifies them according to different factors such as data placement, orchestration services, security, and big data. Besides, the paper studies each architecture in depth and compares them according to various features. Additionally, ECAs-IoT is mapped according to two existing IoT layered models, which helps in identifying the capabilities, features, and gaps of every architecture. Moreover, the paper presents the most important limitations of existing ECAs-IoT and recommends solutions to them. Furthermore, this survey details the IoT applications in the edge-computing domain. Lastly, the paper recommends four different scenarios for using ECAs-IoT by IoT applications.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Smart buildings and smart cities are not the future perspectives anymore&mdash;the smart building integration into a smart city is an actual question for today and tomorrow. Development of smart buildings not only enhances the smart city concept but also promotes positivity to the urban development and national economy, and increases the quality of life of the whole population reacting to global challenges of sustainability. The innovative smart building and smart city technologies enable us to overcome these challenges by being employed through all real estate (RE) project development stages. The Evaluation Framework for Real Estate Development in Smart Cities created by the authors provides the possibility to assess the existing as well as to forecast future RE projects integration into a smart city during the whole life-cycle stage. The practical application of the presented evaluation framework was illustrated by the comparative case study. Based on the created smart building integration into a smart city evaluation framework for real estate development, 10 RE projects in Lithuania and over the world were assessed and rated by selected criteria relevant to different RE development stages. The evaluation results revealed that, especially at the design and construction stages, the existing intelligence of RE projects and/or cities is insufficient. Although real estate projects are technologically advanced as single entities, the integration into smart city networks is limited by interoperability capabilities of the cities or by different strategic goals settled by real estate developers.

AB  - The growing attention to emerging technologies has raised several doubts regarding the sustainability aspects. Among the new technologies, blockchain has laid the foundations for a revolution in the financial field but also in the energy, tourism, medical, industrial and supply chains sectors. Through a systematic literature review, 37 documents were analyzed to describe the sustainable aspects generated using blockchain in supply chains. Therefore, the results achieved provide two levels of analysis. The former highlights the impact of the adoption of blockchain in supply chains based on the three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. The latter shows the positive and negative impacts of each form of sustainability. The purpose of the work is to summarize the current state of the art in order to propose a future development agenda based on the need to simulate and define a measurability for each dimension of sustainability. Finally, the study provides a broad overview of practical and managerial implications for entrepreneurs and researchers. On the one hand, the work shows how the use of blockchain improves the profits and reputation of companies. On the other hand, it highlights several research gaps to be investigated and considered by researchers.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In many developed countries with a long history of urbanization, there is an increasing need for automated computer vision (CV)-based inspection to replace conventional labor-intensive visual inspection. This paper proposes a technique for the automated detection of multiple concrete damage based on a state-of-the-art deep learning framework, Mask R-CNN, developed for instance segmentation. The structure of Mask R-CNN, which consists of three stages (region proposal, classification, and segmentation) is optimized for multiple concrete damage detection. The optimized Mask R-CNN is trained with 765 concrete images including cracks, efflorescence, rebar exposure, and spalling. The performance of the trained Mask R-CNN is evaluated with 25 actual test images containing damage as well as environmental objects. Two types of metrics are proposed to measure localization and segmentation performance. On average, 90.41% precision and 90.81% recall are achieved for localization and 87.24% precision and 87.58% recall for segmentation, which indicates the excellent field applicability of the trained Mask R-CNN. This paper also qualitatively discusses the test results by explaining that the architecture of Mask R-CNN that is optimized for general object detection purposes, can be modified to detect long and slender shapes of cracks, rebar exposure, and efflorescence in further research.

Despite the advantages gained from this evolution, there are several existing as well as emerging security threats that can severely impact the agricultural domain. The present paper provides an overview of the main existing and potential threats for agriculture. Initially, the paper presents an overview of the evolution of ICT solutions and how these may be utilized and affect the agriculture sector. It then conducts an extensive literature review on the use of ICT in agriculture, as well as on the associated emerging threats and vulnerabilities. The authors highlight the main ICT innovations, techniques, benefits, threats and mitigation measures by studying the literature on them and by providing a concise discussion on the possible impacts these could have on the agri-sector.

Thus, in this paper we propose and present a one-stage object detection model for finding vehicles in satellite images using the RetinaNet architecture and the Cars Overhead With Context dataset. By analyzing the results obtained by the proposed model, we show that it has a very good vehicle detection accuracy and a very low detection time, which shows that it can be employed to successfully extract data from real-time satellite or drone data.

AB  - Big data applications are currently used in many application domains, ranging from statistical applications to prediction systems and smart cities. However, the quality of these applications is far from perfect, such as functional error, failure and low performance. Consequently, assuring the overall quality for big data applications plays an increasingly important role. This paper aims at summarizing and assessing existing quality assurance (QA) technologies addressing quality issues in big data applications. We have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) by searching major scientific databases, resulting in 83 primary and relevant studies on QA technologies for big data applications. The SLR results reveal the following main findings: (1) the quality attributes that are focused for the quality of big data applications, including correctness, performance, availability, scalability and reliability, and the factors influencing them; (2) the existing implementation-specific QA technologies, including specification, architectural choice and fault tolerance, and the process-specific QA technologies, including analysis, verification, testing, monitoring and fault and failure prediction; (3) existing strengths and limitations of each kind of QA technology; (4) the existing empirical evidence of each QA technology. This study provides a solid foundation for research on QA technologies of big data applications and can help developers of big data applications apply suitable QA technologies.

AB  - The number of wireless sensors in use&mdash;for example, the global positioning system (GPS) intelligent sensor&mdash;has increased in recent years. These intelligent sensors generate a vast amount of spatiotemporal data, which can assist in finding patterns of movements. These movement patterns can be used to predict the future location of moving objects; for example, the movement of an emergency vehicle can be predicted for health care decision-making. Although there is a body of research work regarding motion trajectory prediction, there are no guidelines for choosing algorithms best suited for individual needs in uncertain and complex situations and as per the application domains. In this paper, we surveyed existing trajectory prediction algorithms. These algorithms are further ranked scientifically in terms of accuracy (performance), ease of use, and best fit as per the available datasets. Our results show three top algorithms, namely NextPlace, the Markov model, and the hidden Markov model. This study can be beneficial for multicriteria decision-making for various disciplines, including health care.

VL  - 3

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies used in developing smart cities solutions, Machine Learning (ML) and recently Deep Learning (DL), rely more on utilising best representative training datasets and features engineering and less on the available domain expertise. We argue that such an approach to solution development makes the outcome of solutions less explainable, i.e., it is often not possible to explain the results of the model. There is a growing concern among policymakers in cities with this lack of explainability of AI solutions, and this is considered a major hindrance in the wider acceptability and trust in such AI-based solutions. In this work, we survey the concept of &lsquo;explainable deep learning&rsquo; as a subset of the &lsquo;explainable AI&rsquo; problem and propose a new solution using Semantic Web technologies, demonstrated with a smart cities flood monitoring application in the context of a European Commission-funded project. Monitoring of gullies and drainage in crucial geographical areas susceptible to flooding issues is an important aspect of any flood monitoring solution. Typical solutions for this problem involve the use of cameras to capture images showing the affected areas in real-time with different objects such as leaves, plastic bottles etc., and building a DL-based classifier to detect such objects and classify blockages based on the presence and coverage of these objects in the images. In this work, we uniquely propose an Explainable AI solution using DL and Semantic Web technologies to build a hybrid classifier. In this hybrid classifier, the DL component detects object presence and coverage level and semantic rules designed with close consultation with experts carry out the classification. By using the expert knowledge in the flooding context, our hybrid classifier provides the flexibility on categorising the image using objects and their coverage relationships. The experimental results demonstrated with a real-world use case showed that this hybrid approach of image classification has on average 11% improvement (F-Measure) in image classification performance compared to DL-only classifier. It also has the distinct advantage of integrating experts&rsquo; knowledge on defining the decision-making rules to represent the complex circumstances and using such knowledge to explain the results.

SN  - 2199-8531

AB  - In the context of the application of artificial intelligence in an intellectual property trading platform, the number of demanders and suppliers that exchange scarce resources is growing continuously. Improvement of computational power promotes matching efficiency significantly. It is necessary to greatly reduce energy consumption in order to realize the machine learning process in terminals and microprocessors in edge computing (smart phones, wearable devices, automobiles, IoT devices, etc.) and reduce the resource burden of data centers. Machine learning algorithms generated in an open community lack standardization in practice, and hence require open innovation participation to reduce computing cost, shorten algorithm running time, and improve human-machine collaborative competitiveness. The purpose of this study was to find an economic range of the granularity in a decision tree, a popular machine learning algorithm. This work addresses the research questions of what the economic tree depth interval is and what the corresponding time cost is with increasing granularity given the number of matches. This study also aimed to balance the efficiency and cost via simulation. Results show that the benefit of decreasing the tree search depth brought by the increased evaluation granularity is not linear, which means that, in a given number of candidate matches, the granularity has a definite and relatively economical range. The selection of specific evaluation granularity in this range can obtain a smaller tree depth and avoid the occurrence of low efficiency, which is the excessive increase in the time cost. Hence, the standardization of an AI algorithm is applicable to edge computing scenarios, such as an intellectual property trading platform. The economic granularity interval can not only save computing resource costs but also save AI decision-making time and avoid human decision-maker time cost.

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The highly competitive and rapidly advancing autonomous vehicle race has been on for several years now, and it has made the driver-assistance systems a shadow of their former self. Nevertheless, automated vehicles have many obstacles on the way, and until we have them on the roads, promising solutions that can be achievable in the near future should be sought-after. Driving-support technologies have proven themselves to be effective in the battle against car crashes, and with Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) supporting them, their efficiency is expected to rise steeply. In this work, we propose and implement a driving-support system which, on the one hand, could immensely benefit from major advancement of VANETs, but on the other hand can effectively be implemented as a stand-alone system. The proposed system consists of a non-intrusive integrated fuzzy-based system able to detect a risky situation in real time and alert the driver about the danger. It makes use of the information acquired from various in-car sensors as well as from communications with other vehicles and infrastructure to evaluate the condition of the considered parameters. The parameters include factors that affect the driver&rsquo;s ability to drive, such as his/her current health condition and the inside environment in which he/she is driving, the vehicle speed, and factors related to the outside environment such as the weather and road condition. We show the effect of these parameters on the determination of the driving risk level through simulations and experiments and explain how these risk levels are translated into actions that can help the driver to manage certain risky situations, thus improving the driving safety.

TI  - Methodology for Quantifying the Energy Saving Potentials Combining Building Retrofitting, Solar Thermal Energy and Geothermal Resources

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - New technological, societal and legislative developments are necessary to support transitions to low-carbon energy systems. The building sector is responsible for almost 36% of the global final energy and 40% of CO2 emissions, so this sector has high potential to contribute to the expansion of positive energy districts. With this aim, a new digital Geographic Information System (GIS) platform has been developed to quantify the energy savings obtained through the implementation of refurbishment measures in residential buildings, including solar thermal collectors and geothermal technologies and assuming the postal district as the representative unit for the territory. Solar resources have been estimated from recently updated solar irradiation maps, whereas geothermal resources have been estimated from geological maps. Urbanistic data have been estimated from official cadastre databases. For representative buildings, the annual energy demand and savings are obtained and compared with reference buildings, both for heating and cooling. The GIS platform provides information on average results for each postal district, as well as estimates for buildings with particular parameters. The methodology has been applied to the Asturian region, an area of about 10,600 km2 on the Cantabrian coast of Spain, with complex orography and scattered population, qualified as a region in energy transition. High rehabilitation potentials have been achieved for buildings constructed before the implementation of the Spanish Technical Building Code of 2006, being higher for isolated houses than for collective buildings. Some examples of results are introduced in specific localities of different climatic zones.

TI  - Distributed Algorithm for Base Station Assignment in 4G/5G Machine-Type Communication Scenarios with Backhaul Limited Conditions

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A progressive paradigm shift from centralized to distributed network architectures has been consolidated since the 4G communication standard, calling for novel decision-making mechanisms with distributed control to operate at the network edge. This situation implies that each base station (BS) must manage resources independently to meet the quality of service (QoS) of existing human-type communication devices (HTC), as well as the emerging machine type communication (MTC) devices from the internet of things (IoT). In this paper, we address the BS assignment problem, whose aim is to determine the most appropriate serving BS to each mobile device. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem for maximizing the system throughput and imposing constraints on the air interface and backhaul resources. The assignment problem is challenging to solve, so we present a simple yet valid reformulation of the original problem while using dual decomposition theory. Subsequently, we propose a distributed price-based BS assignment algorithm that performs at each BS the assignment process, where a novel pricing update scheme is presented. The simulation results show that our proposed solution outperforms traditional maximum signal to interference plus noise ratio (Max-SINR) and minimum path-loss (Min-PL) approaches in terms of system throughput.

TI  - An Energy Saving Road Sweeper Using Deep Vision for Garbage Detection
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Road sweepers are ubiquitous machines that help preserve our cities cleanliness and health by collecting road garbage and sweeping out dirt from our streets and sidewalks. They are often very mechanical instruments, needing to operate in harsh conditions dealing with all sorts of abandoned trash and natural garbage. They are usually composed of rotating brushes, collector belts and bins, and sometimes water or air streams. All of these mechanical tools are usually high in power demand and strongly subject to wear and tear. Moreover, due to the simple working logic often implied by these cleaning machines, these tools work in an &ldquo;always on&rdquo;/&ldquo;max power&rdquo; state, and any further regulation is left to the pilot. Therefore, adding artificial intelligence able to correctly operate these tools in a semi-automatic way would be greatly beneficial. In this paper, we propose an automatic road garbage detection system, able to locate with great precision most types of road waste, and to correctly instruct a road sweeper in order to handle them. With this simple addition to an existing sweeper, we will be able to save more than 80% electrical power currently absorbed by the cleaning systems and reduce by the same amount brush weariness (prolonging their lifetime). This is done by choosing when to use the brushes and when not to, with how much strength, and where. The only hardware components needed by the system will be a camera and a PC board able to read the camera output (and communicate via CanBus). The software of the system will be mainly composed of a deep neural network for semantic segmentation of images, and a real-time software program to control the sweeper actuators with the appropriate timings. To prove the claimed results, we run extensive tests onboard of such a truck, as well as benchmark tests for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and inference speed of the system.

AB  - IoT networks are increasingly popular nowadays to monitor critical environments of different nature, significantly increasing the amount of data exchanged. Due to the huge number of connected IoT devices, security of such networks and devices is therefore a critical issue. Detection systems assume a crucial role in the cyber-security field: based on innovative algorithms such as machine learning, they are able to identify or predict cyber-attacks, hence to protect the underlying system. Nevertheless, specific datasets are required to train detection models. In this work we present MQTTset, a dataset focused on the MQTT protocol, widely adopted in IoT networks. We present the creation of the dataset, also validating it through the definition of a hypothetical detection system, by combining the legitimate dataset with cyber-attacks against the MQTT network. Obtained results demonstrate how MQTTset can be used to train machine learning models to implement detection systems able to protect IoT contexts.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The understanding of occupancy patterns has been identified as a key contributor to achieve improvements in energy efficiency in buildings since occupancy information can benefit different systems, such as HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioners), lighting, security, and emergency. This has meant that in the past decade, researchers have focused on improving the precision of occupancy estimation in enclosed spaces. Although several works have been done, one of the less addressed issues, regarding occupancy research, has been the availability of data for contrasting experimental results. Therefore, the main contributions of this work are: (1) the generation of two robust datasets gathered in enclosed spaces (a fitness gym and a living room) labeled with occupancy levels, and (2) the evaluation of three Machine Learning algorithms using different temporal resolutions. The results show that the prediction of 3&ndash;4 occupancy levels using the temperature, humidity, and pressure values provides an accuracy of at least 97%.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is considered a public health emergency of international concern. The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that caused this pandemic has spread rapidly to over 200 countries, and has drastically affected public health and the economies of states at unprecedented levels. In this context, efforts around the world are focusing on solving this problem in several directions of research, by: (i) exploring the origin and evolution of the phylogeny of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome; (ii) developing nanobiosensors that could be highly effective in detecting the new coronavirus; (iii) finding effective treatments for COVID-19; and (iv) working on vaccine development. In this paper, an overview of the progress made in the development of nanobiosensors for the detection of human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is presented, along with specific techniques for modifying the surface of nanobiosensors. The newest detection methods of the influenza virus responsible for acute respiratory syndrome were compared with conventional methods, highlighting the newest trends in diagnostics, applications, and challenges of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 causative virus) nanobiosensors.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Over the last decade, particular interest in using state-of-the-art emerging technologies for inspection, assessment, and management of civil infrastructures has remarkably increased. Advanced technologies, such as laser scanners, have become a suitable alternative for labor intensive, expensive, and unsafe traditional inspection and maintenance methods, which encourage the increasing use of this technology in construction industry, especially in bridges. This paper aims to provide a thorough mixed scientometric and state-of-the-art review on the application of terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) in bridge engineering and explore investigations and recommendations of researchers in this area. Following the review, more than 1500 research publications were collected, investigated and analyzed through a two-fold literature search published within the last decade from 2010 to 2020. Research trends, consisting of dominated sub-fields, co-occurrence of keywords, network of researchers and their institutions, along with the interaction of research networks, were quantitatively analyzed. Moreover, based on the collected papers, application of TLS in bridge engineering and asset management was reviewed according to four categories including (1) generation of 3D model, (2) quality inspection, (3) structural assessment, and (4) bridge information modeling (BrIM). Finally, the paper identifies the current research gaps, future directions obtained from the quantitative analysis, and in-depth discussions of the collected papers in this area.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The rapid development and spread of communication technologies is now becoming a global information revolution. Customers have a need for communication services, which could be flexibly configured in accordance with their Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements. Realizing the close connection between customer experience and profitability, the service provider has been placing more and more attention on customer experience and QoE. The traditional quality of service management method based on SLA (Service Level Agreement) is not sufficient as a means to provide QoE-related contracts between service providers and customers. The current SLA method is mostly limited and focused on technical aspects of QoS (Quality of Service). Furthermore, they do not follow on the network the principles and semantic approach to the QoS specification for a communication service using QoE parameters. In this paper, we propose a customer-oriented quality of service management method for future IBN (Intent-Based Networking). It is based on a new QoE metric on a scale from 1 to 5, which allows one to take into account the commercial value of e-services for customers. Based on this approach, the network configuration and functionality of network equipment automatically changes depending on customer requirements. To implement the new method of service quality management, an algorithm for routing data packets in the network was developed, taking into account the current load of the forecast path. The algorithm of billing system functioning in conditions of customer-oriented quality management in telecommunication networks has been created. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method of service quality management with the traditional SLA method, we developed a simulation network model with the implementation of two approaches. By conducting a simulation, it was determined that the proposed method gives an average gain of 2&ndash;5 times for the criterion of the number of customers who require high quality of experience of the service.

AB  - The pandemic declared by the World Health Organization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) awakened us to a reality that most of us were previously unaware of&mdash;isolation, confinement and the massive use of information and communication technologies, as well as increased knowledge of the difficulties and limitations of their use. This article focuses on the rapid implementation of low-cost technologies, which allow us to answer a fundamental question: how can near real-time monitoring and follow-up of the elderly and their health conditions, as well as their homes, especially for those living in isolated and remote areas, be provided within their care and protect them from risky events? The system proposed here as a proof of concept uses low-cost devices for communication and data processing, supported by Long-Range (LoRa) technology and connection to The Things Network, incorporating various sensors, both personal and in the residence, allowing family members, neighbors and authorized entities, including security forces, to have access to the health condition of system users and the habitability of their homes, as well as their urgent needs, thus evidencing that it is possible, using low-cost systems, to implement sensor networks for monitoring the elderly using the LoRa gateway and other support infrastructures.

AB  - Nowadays, sustainability is one of the strategic goals of smart cities. They are the essential solution to creating the sustainable future. On the other hand, the smart city is intended to deal with the problems of energy management. This paper examines the influence of the smart sustainable cities concept on energy management from the labor market perspective. The paper fulfills the research gap about energy manager profession transformation considering smart sustainable city concept. The aim of the paper is to create an up-to-date holistic energy manager skill model with a focus on emerging technologies. The skill model reflects the synergy of two methodological approaches: the theoretical and practical approaches. Descriptive statistics are used to present the labor market research results. It is concluded that the core elements of the smart sustainable city concept have an impact on energy management are sustainability and big data. The labor market research also draws differences in the amount and structure of demand on energy manager skills by countries, but at the same time similar skills requirements are found. The skill model of the energy manager profession is built around several main groups associated with specific knowledge, social skills, and behavior skills. The findings of the present research can contribute to knowledge and practice by applying it in the process of developing energy manager competency models in commercial and non-commercial enterprises as well as in education programs and training courses.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing interest in travel applications that provide on-site personalized tourist spot recommendations. While generally helpful, most available options offer choices based solely on static information on places of interest without consideration of such dynamic factors as weather, time of day, and congestion, and with a focus on helping the tourist decide what single spot to visit next. Such limitations may prevent visitors from optimizing the use of their limited resources (i.e., time and money). Some existing studies allow users to calculate a semi-optimal tour visiting multiple spots in advance, but their on-site use is difficult due to the large computation time, no consideration of dynamic factors, etc. To deal with this situation, we formulate a tour score approach with three components: static tourist information on the next spot to visit, dynamic tourist information on the next spot to visit, and an aggregate measure of satisfaction associated with visiting the next spot and the set of subsequent spots to be visited. Determining the tour route that produces the best overall tour score is an NP-hard problem for which we propose three algorithms variations based on the greedy method. To validate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we applied the three algorithms to 20 points of interest in Higashiyama, Kyoto, Japan, and confirmed that the output solution was superior to the model route for Kyoto, with computation times of the three algorithms of 1.9&plusmn;0.1, 2.0&plusmn;0.1, and 27.0&plusmn;1.8 s.

AB  - The construction industry is experiencing changes in its processes and work methods, and the advancement of new technologies in recent decades has led to a new concept known as Construction 4.0, coined in 2016 in Germany. Since its definition is still diffuse, it was deemed necessary to conduct a review on the publications in this field to grasp how this concept is being understood. For that purpose, a bibliometric analysis was conducted among 260 research articles using seven keywords. The results reveal that the number of publications is growing exponentially, with the USA, the UK, and China being leaders in this field; besides, four technologies are essential to understand Construction 4.0 at present time: 3D printing, big data, virtual reality, and Internet of Things. The results of this review suggest that further reviews should be conducted every 3 years to grasp the rapid evolution of Construction 4.0.

AB  - An efficient and credible approach to road traffic management and prediction is a crucial aspect in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It can strongly influence the development of road structures and projects. It is also essential for route planning and traffic regulations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that combines extreme learning machine (ELM) and ensemble-based techniques to predict the future hourly traffic of a road section in Tangier, a city in the north of Morocco. The model was applied to a real-world historical data set extracted from fixed sensors over a 5-years period. Our approach is based on a type of Single hidden Layer Feed-forward Neural Network (SLFN) known for being a high-speed machine learning algorithm. The model was, then, compared to other well-known algorithms in the prediction literature. Experimental results demonstrated that, according to the most commonly used criteria of error measurements (RMSE, MAE, and MAPE), our model is performing better in terms of prediction accuracy. The use of Akaike&rsquo;s Information Criterion technique (AIC) has also shown that the proposed model has a higher performance.

AB  - In the smart city context, Big Data analytics plays an important role in processing the data collected through IoT devices. The analysis of the information gathered by sensors favors the generation of specific services and systems that not only improve the quality of life of the citizens, but also optimize the city resources. However, the difficulties of implementing this entire process in real scenarios are manifold, including the huge amount and heterogeneity of the devices, their geographical distribution, and the complexity of the necessary IT infrastructures. For this reason, the main contribution of this paper is the PADL description language, which has been specifically tailored to assist in the definition and operationalization phases of the machine learning life cycle. It provides annotations that serve as an abstraction layer from the underlying infrastructure and technologies, hence facilitating the work of data scientists and engineers. Due to its proficiency in the operationalization of distributed pipelines over edge, fog, and cloud layers, it is particularly useful in the complex and heterogeneous environments of smart cities. For this purpose, PADL contains functionalities for the specification of monitoring, notifications, and actuation capabilities. In addition, we provide tools that facilitate its adoption in production environments. Finally, we showcase the usefulness of the language by showing the definition of PADL-compliant analytical pipelines over two uses cases in a smart city context (flood control and waste management), demonstrating that its adoption is simple and beneficial for the definition of information and process flows in such environments.

TI  - Multi-Modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks for Visual Question Answering
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 23
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Visual question answering (VQA) is a multi-modal task involving natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), which requires models to understand of both visual information and textual information simultaneously to predict the correct answer for the input visual image and textual question, and has been widely used in smart and intelligent transport systems, smart city, and other fields. Today, advanced VQA approaches model dense interactions between image regions and question words by designing co-attention mechanisms to achieve better accuracy. However, modeling interactions between each image region and each question word will force the model to calculate irrelevant information, thus causing the model&rsquo;s attention to be distracted. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a novel model called Multi-modal Explicit Sparse Attention Networks (MESAN), which concentrates the model&rsquo;s attention by explicitly selecting the parts of the input features that are the most relevant to answering the input question. We consider that this method based on top-k selection can reduce the interference caused by irrelevant information and ultimately help the model to achieve better performance. The experimental results on the benchmark dataset VQA v2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Our best single model delivers 70.71% and 71.08% overall accuracy on the test-dev and test-std sets, respectively. In addition, we also demonstrate that our model can obtain better attended features than other advanced models through attention visualization. Our work proves that the models with sparse attention mechanisms can also achieve competitive results on VQA datasets. We hope that it can promote the development of VQA models and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology related to VQA in various aspects.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the Internet of Things (IoT) + Fog + Cloud architecture, with the unprecedented growth of IoT devices, one of the challenging issues that needs to be tackled is to allocate Fog service providers (FSPs) to IoT devices, especially in a game-theoretic environment. Here, the issue of allocation of FSPs to the IoT devices is sifted with game-theoretic idea so that utility maximizing agents may be benign. In this scenario, we have multiple IoT devices and multiple FSPs, and the IoT devices give preference ordering over the subset of FSPs. Given such a scenario, the goal is to allocate at most one FSP to each of the IoT devices. We propose mechanisms based on the theory of mechanism design without money to allocate FSPs to the IoT devices. The proposed mechanisms have been designed in a flexible manner to address the long and short duration access of the FSPs to the IoT devices. For analytical results, we have proved the economic robustness, and probabilistic analyses have been carried out for allocation of IoT devices to the FSPs. In simulation, mechanism efficiency is laid out under different scenarios with an implementation in Python.

SN  - 2504-2289

AB  - In recent years, the demand for collective mobility services registered significant growth. In particular, the long-distance coach market underwent an important change in Europe, since FlixBus adopted a dynamic pricing strategy, providing low-cost transport services and an efficient and fast information system. This paper presents a methodology, called DA4PT (Data Analytics for Public Transport), for discovering the factors that influence travelers in booking and purchasing bus tickets. Starting from a set of 3.23 million user-generated event logs of a bus ticketing platform, the methodology shows the correlation rules between booking factors and purchase of tickets. Such rules are then used to train machine learning models for predicting whether a user will buy or not a ticket. The rules are also used to define various dynamic pricing strategies with the purpose of increasing the number of tickets sales on the platform and the related amount of revenues. The methodology reaches an accuracy of 95% in forecasting the purchase of a ticket and a low variance in results. Exploiting a dynamic pricing strategy, DA4PT is able to increase the number of purchased tickets by 6% and the total revenue by 9% by showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - The evolution of intelligent manufacturing has had a profound and lasting effect on the future of global manufacturing. Industry 4.0 based smart factories merge physical and cyber technologies, making the involved technologies more intricate and accurate; improving the performance, quality, controllability, management, and transparency of manufacturing processes in the era of the internet-of-things (IoT). Advanced low-cost sensor technologies are essential for gathering data and utilizing it for effective performance by manufacturing companies and supply chains. Different types of low power/low cost sensors allow for greatly expanded data collection on different devices across the manufacturing processes. While a lot of research has been carried out with a focus on analyzing the performance, processes, and implementation of smart factories, most firms still lack in-depth insight into the difference between traditional and smart factory systems, as well as the wide set of different sensor technologies associated with Industry 4.0. This paper identifies the different available sensor technologies of Industry 4.0, and identifies the differences between traditional and smart factories. In addition, this paper reviews existing research that has been done on the smart factory; and therefore provides a broad overview of the extant literature on smart factories, summarizes the variations between traditional and smart factories, outlines different types of sensors used in a smart factory, and creates an agenda for future research that encompasses the vigorous evolution of Industry 4.0 based smart factories.

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - This research was to conduct a pilot study for two consecutive days in order to assess fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure of an entire population in a community. We aimed to construct a surveillance system by analyzing the observed spatio-temporal variation of exposure. Guro-gu in Seoul, South Korea, was divided into 2,204 scale grids of 100 m each. Hourly exposure concentrations of PM2.5 were modeled by the inverse distance weighted method, using 24 sensor-based air monitoring instruments and the indoor-to-outdoor concentration ratio. Population distribution was assessed using mobile phone network data and indoor residential rates, according to sex and age over time. Exposure concentration, population distribution, and population exposure were visualized to present spatio-temporal variation. The PM2.5 exposure of the entire population of Guro-gu was calculated by population-weighted average exposure concentration. The average concentration of outdoor PM2.5 was 42.1 &micro;g/m3, which was lower than the value of the beta attenuation monitor measured by fixed monitoring station. Indoor concentration was estimated using an indoor-to-outdoor PM2.5 concentration ratio of 0.747. The population-weighted average exposure concentration of PM2.5 was 32.4 &micro;g/m3. Thirty-one percent of the population exceeded the Korean Atmospheric Environmental Standard for PM2.5 over a 24 h average period. The results of this study can be used in a long-term aggregate and cumulative PM2.5 exposure assessment, and as a basis for policy decisions on public health management among policymakers and stakeholders.

IS  - 4
SN  - 2504-2289

AB  - To make healthcare available and easily accessible, the Internet of Things (IoT), which paved the way to the construction of smart cities, marked the birth of many smart applications in numerous areas, including healthcare. As a result, smart healthcare applications have been and are being developed to provide, using mobile and electronic technology, higher diagnosis quality of the diseases, better treatment of the patients, and improved quality of lives. Since smart healthcare applications that are mainly concerned with the prediction of healthcare data (like diseases for example) rely on predictive healthcare data analytics, it is imperative for such predictive healthcare data analytics to be as accurate as possible. In this paper, we will exploit supervised machine learning methods in classification and regression to improve the performance of the traditional Random Forest on healthcare datasets, both in terms of accuracy and classification/regression speed, in order to produce an effective and efficient smart healthcare application, which we have termed eGAP. eGAP uses the evolutionary game theoretic approach replicator dynamics to evolve a Random Forest ensemble. Trees of high resemblance in an initial Random Forest are clustered, and then clusters grow and shrink by adding and removing trees using replicator dynamics, according to the predictive accuracy of each subforest represented by a cluster of trees. All clusters have an initial number of trees that is equal to the number of trees in the smallest cluster. Cluster growth is performed using trees that are not initially sampled. The speed and accuracy of the proposed method have been demonstrated by an experimental study on 10 classification and 10 regression medical datasets.

TI  - Intelligent Fog-Enabled Smart Healthcare System for Wearable Physiological Parameter Detection
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 12
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Wearable technology plays a key role in smart healthcare applications. Detection and analysis of the physiological data from wearable devices is an essential process in smart healthcare. Physiological data analysis is performed in fog computing to abridge the excess latency introduced by cloud computing. However, the latency for the emergency health status and overloading in fog environment becomes key challenges for smart healthcare. This paper resolves these problems by presenting a novel tri-fog health architecture for physiological parameter detection. The overall system is built upon three layers as wearable layer, intelligent fog layer, and cloud layer. In the first layer, data from the wearable of patients are subjected to fault detection at personal data assistant (PDA). To eliminate fault data, we present the rapid kernel principal component analysis (RK-PCA) algorithm. Then, the faultless data is validated, whether it is duplicate or not, by the data on-looker node in the second layer. To remove data redundancy, we propose a new fuzzy assisted objective optimization by ratio analysis (FaMOORA) algorithm. To timely predict the user&rsquo;s health status, we enable the two-level health hidden Markov model (2L-2HMM) that finds the user&rsquo;s health status from temporal variations in data collected from wearable devices. Finally, the user&rsquo;s health status is detected in the fog layer with the assist of a hybrid machine learning algorithm, namely SpikQ-Net, based on the three major categories of attributes such as behavioral, biomedical, and environment. Upon the user&rsquo;s health status, the immediate action is taken by both cloud and fog layers. To ensure lower response time and timely service, we also present an optimal health off procedure with the aid of the multi-objective spotted hyena optimization (MoSHO) algorithm. The health off method allows offloading between overloaded and underloaded fog nodes. The proposed tri-fog health model is validated by a thorough simulation performed in the iFogSim tool. It shows better achievements in latency (reduced up to 3 ms), execution time (reduced up to 1.7 ms), detection accuracy (improved up to 97%), and system stability (improved up to 96%).

SN  - 2412-3811

AB  - Transport engineering has recently undergone several significant changes and innovations, one of which is the appearance and spread of autonomous vehicles; with this technology becoming more common and ordinary by the day, it is now necessary to implement some systems and contexts to facilitate autonomous vehicle operations. Consequently, a different perspective is now arising when dealing with road infrastructures, aiming to simplify and improve efficiency and maintenance of the existing roads, increase the life cycle of newly built ones, and minimize the economic and financial impact at the same time. Roadway pavements are one of the primary factors affecting vehicle operations; over time, this distinctive aspect has gone through various mechanical and physical changes due to the adoption of new materials or design methods. Consequently, to the spread of autonomous vehicles, scientific research has begun to study and develop systems to make road pavements and platforms not exclusively aimed at bearing loads, but rather at considering them as a means of communication and information exchange, if not even as a source of energy. This new approach introduces the so-called &ldquo;Smart Roads,&rdquo; i.e., road infrastructures capable of communicating with vehicles and self-monitoring fundamental perspectives concerning driverless vehicles and the roadway platform life cycle. This paper examines the characteristics of Smart Roads, considering their broad field of application and their potential advantages and drawbacks. This paper also pursues the objective of describing the global vision, the possible future direction of these innovations concerning the automotive and transport industries, and a particular focus on infrastructures and roadways.

AB  - Planning is a crucial component of short- and long-term municipal waste management. Establishing the relationships between the factors that determine the amount of waste generated by municipalities and forecasting the waste management needs plays a fundamental role in the development of effective planning strategies and implementation of sustainable development. Artificial Neural Network employed for verifying the forecasts pertaining to the amount of rainfall in Poland were presented in the studies. The proposed models included selected explanatory indices in order to reflect the impact of social, demographic and economic factors on the amount of generated waste. Mean squared error (MSE) and regression value (R) are used as indices of efficiency of the developed models. The ANN models exhibited high accuracy of forecasts at high R values (R = 0.914, R = 0.989) and low MSE values. Derived from the socioeconomic data for 2003&ndash;2019, the model predicts that the future waste generation in 2024 will increase by 2%. The results indicate that the employed ANN models are effective in predicting the amount of waste and can be considered a cost-effective approach to planning integrated waste management systems.

PY  - 2020

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Air pollution is one of the world&rsquo;s most significant challenges. Predicting air pollution is critical for air quality research, as it affects public health. The Air Pollution Index (API) is a convenient tool to describe air quality. Air pollution predictions can provide accurate information on the future pollution situation, effectively controlling air pollution. Governments have expressed growing concern about air pollution due to its global effect on human health and sustainable growth. This paper proposes a novel forecasting model using One-Dimensional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and Exponential Adaptive Gradients (EAG) optimization to predict API for a selected location, Klang, a city in Malaysia. The proposed 1D-CNN&ndash;EAG exponentially accumulates past model gradients to adaptively tune the learning rate and converge in both convex and non-convex areas. We use hourly air pollution data over three years (January 2012 to December 2014) for training. Parameter optimization and model evaluation was accomplished by a grid-search with k-folds cross-validation. Results have confirmed that the proposed approach achieves better prediction accuracy than the benchmark models in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the Correlation Coefficient (R-Squared) with values of 2.036, 2.354, 4.214 and 0.966, respectively, and time complexity.

AB  - As we stand at the cusp of the fourth industrial revolution, digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, the Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain, Robotics, 3D technologies, and many more have become the means and solutions to many of the world&rsquo;s problems. Most recently, these technologies have assisted in the global fight of the COVID-19 pandemic and other societal problems. Together with these innovative techniques, the concept of circular economy and its relevant tools such as life cycle costing, life cycle impact assessment, materials passports, and circularity measurements have been implemented in a number of sectors in different countries for the transition from a linear &ldquo;take, make, and dispose&rdquo; model towards a more circular model, which has shown positive results for the environment and economy. In this article, with the help of implementation, prototyping, and case studies, we explore how these technological advancements and innovative techniques are used in different sectors such as information and communications technology, the built environment, mining and manufacturing, education, healthcare, the public sectors, and others to provide an opportunity to understand and resolve the agreed upon framework in 2015 by 193 countries, that is, the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Nowadays, we are witnessing a shift in the way emergencies are being managed. On the one hand, the availability of big data and the evolution of geographical information systems make it possible to manage and process large quantities of information that can hugely improve the decision-making process. On the other hand, digital humanitarianism has shown to be very beneficial for providing support during emergencies. Despite this, the full potential of combining automatic big data processing and digital humanitarianism approaches has not been fully realized, though there is an initial body of research. This paper aims to provide a reference architecture for emergency management that instantiates the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture to provide a common language and enable the comparison of solutions for solving similar problems.

AB  - With reference to the MeSmart project, the Municipality of Messina is making a great investments to deploy several types of cameras and digital devices across the city for carrying out different tasks related to mobility management, such as traffic flow monitoring, number plate recognition, video surveillance etc. To this aim, exploiting specific devices for each task increases infrastructure and management costs, reducing flexibility. On the contrary, using general-purpose devices customized to accomplish multiple tasks at the same time can be a more efficient solution. Another important approach that can improve the efficiency of mobility services is moving computation tasks at the Edge of the managed system instead of in remote centralized serves, so reducing delays in event detection and processing and making the system more scalable. In this paper, we investigate the adoption of Edge devices connected to high-resolution cameras to create a general-purpose solution for performing different tasks. In particular, we use the Function as a Service (FaaS) paradigm to easily configure the Edge device and set up new services. The key results of our work is deploying versatile, scalable and adaptable systems able to respond to smart city&rsquo;s needs, even if such needs change over time. We tested the proposed solution setting up a vehicle counting solution based on OpenCV, and automatically deploying necessary functions into an Edge device. From experimental results, it results that computing performance at the Edge overtakes the performance of a device specifically designed for vehicle counting under certain conditions and thanks to our reconfigurable functions.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 12
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Existing research recognizes the critical role of quality data in the current big-data and Internet of Things (IoT) era. Quality data has a direct impact on model results and hence business decisions. The growth in the number of IoT-connected devices makes it hard to access data quality using traditional assessments methods. This is exacerbated by the need to share data across different IoT domains as it increases the heterogeneity of the data. Data-shared IoT defines a new perspective of IoT applications which benefit from sharing data among different domains of IoT to create new use-case applications. For example, sharing data between smart transport and smart industry can lead to other use-case applications such as intelligent logistics management and warehouse management. The benefits of such applications, however, can only be achieved if the shared data is of acceptable quality. There are three main practices in data quality (DQ) determination approaches that are restricting their effective use in data-shared platforms: (1) most DQ techniques validate test data against a known quantity considered to be a reference; a gold reference. (2) narrow sets of static metrics are used to describe the quality. Each consumer uses these metrics in similar ways. (3) data quality is evaluated in isolated stages throughout the processing pipeline. Data-shared IoT presents unique challenges; (1) each application and use-case in shared IoT has a unique description of data quality and requires a different set of metrics. This leads to an extensive list of DQ dimensions which are difficult to implement in real-world applications. (2) most data in IoT scenarios does not have a gold reference. (3) factors endangering DQ in shared IoT exist throughout the entire big-data model from data collection to data visualization, and data use. This paper aims to describe data-shared IoT and shared data pools while highlighting the importance of sharing quality data across various domains. The article examines how we can use trust as a measure of quality in data-shared IoT. We conclude that researchers can combine such trust-based techniques with blockchain for secure end-to-end data quality assessment.

VL  - 9

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Numerous works focus on the data privacy issue of the Internet of Things (IoT) when training a supervised Machine Learning (ML) classifier. Most of the existing solutions assume that the classifier&rsquo;s training data can be obtained securely from different IoT data providers. The primary concern is data privacy when training a K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classifier with IoT data from various entities. This paper proposes secure K-NN, which provides a privacy-preserving K-NN training over IoT data. It employs Blockchain technology with a partial homomorphic cryptosystem (PHC) known as Paillier in order to protect all participants (i.e., IoT data analyst C and IoT data provider P) data privacy. When C analyzes the IoT data of P, both participants&rsquo; privacy issue arises and requires a trusted third party. To protect each candidate&rsquo;s privacy and remove the dependency on a third-party, we assemble secure building blocks in secure K-NN based on Blockchain technology. Firstly, a protected data-sharing platform is developed among various P, where encrypted IoT data is registered on a shared ledger. Secondly, the secure polynomial operation (SPO), secure biasing operations (SBO), and secure comparison (SC) are designed using the homomorphic property of Paillier. It shows that secure K-NN does not need any trusted third-party at the time of interaction, and rigorous security analysis demonstrates that secure K-NN protects sensitive data privacy for each P and C. The secure K-NN achieved 97.84%, 82.33%, and 76.33% precisions on BCWD, HDD, and DD datasets. The performance of secure K-NN is precisely similar to the general K-NN and outperforms all the previous state of art methods.

AB  - Numerous investigations assess the technical, technological, and managerial aspects of disaster response related to large technical systems. This paper deals with the possibility of synthesizing these aspects in a disaster response methodology, thus combining the technical, technological methods, tools, and software with the art of management. Its objective is to develop a preliminary methodology that supports the response management decision making processes related to earthquake-damaged large technical systems. The introduced methodology is demonstrated with the example of railway systems. It utilizes a combination of (i) a probabilistic model of railway system damage caused by earthquakes, (ii) a Markov model related to the damage and recovery phases, (iii) a probabilistic model of aftershocks, (iv) a statistical model of secondary effects, (v) impact models of management support actions, and (vi) response process management supported by a Markov Decision Process. The simulation results validate the concept. Based on these research results, the authors recommend that the described preliminary response management approach be further specified and implemented in disaster management procedures.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - In recent years, there has been a big data revolution in smart cities dues to multiple disciplines such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, and smart community. However, most services in these areas of smart cities have become data-driven, thus generating big data that require sharing, storing, processing, and analysis, which ultimately consumes massive amounts of energy. The accumulation process of these data from different areas of a smart city is a challenging issue. Therefore, researchers have started aiming at the Internet of vehicles (IoV), in which smart vehicles are equipped with computing and storage capabilities to communicate with surrounding infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a subcategory of IoV as the Internet of buses (IoB), where public buses enable a service as a data carrier in a smart city by introducing a neural network-based sustainable data dissemination system (NESUDA), where opportunistic sensing comprises delay-tolerant data collection, processing and disseminating from one place to another place around the city. The objective was to use public transport to carry data from one place to another and to reduce the traffic from traditional networks and energy consumption. An advanced neural network (NN) algorithm was applied to locate the realistic arrival time of public buses for data allocation. We used the Auckland transport (AT) buses data set from the transport agency to validate our model for the level of accuracy in predicted bus arrival time and scheduled arrival time to disseminate data using bus services. Data were uploaded onto buses as per their dwelling time at each stop and terminals within the coverage area of deployed RSU. The offloading capacity of our proposed data dissemination system showed that it could be utilized to effectively complement traditional data networks. Moreover, the maximum offloading capacity at each parent stop could reach up to 360 GB with a huge saving of energy consumption.

SN  - 2624-831X

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has the potential to improve the production and business processes by enabling the extraction of valuable information from industrial processes. The mining industry, however, is rather traditional and somewhat slow to change due to infrastructural limitations in communication, data management, storage, and exchange of information. Most research efforts so far on applying IIoT in the mining industry focus on specific concerns such as ventilation monitoring, accident analysis, fleet and personnel management, tailing dam monitoring, and pre-alarm system while an overall IIoT architecture suitable for the general conditions in the mining industry is still missing. This article analyzes the current state of Information Technology in the mining sector and identifies a major challenge of vertical fragmentation due to the technological variety of various systems and devices offered by different vendors, preventing interoperability, data distribution, and the exchange of information securely between devices and systems. Based on guidelines and practices from the major IIoT standards, a high-level IIoT architecture suitable for the mining industry is then synthesized and presented, addressing the identified challenges and enabling smart mines by automation, interoperable systems, data distribution, and real-time visibility of the mining status. Remote controlling, data processing, and interoperability techniques of the architecture evolve all stages of mining from prospecting to reclamation. The adoption of such IIoT architecture in the mining industry offers safer mine site for workers, predictable mining operations, interoperable environment for both traditional and modern systems and devices, automation to reduce human intervention, and enables underground surveillance by converging operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT). Significant open research challenges and directions are also studied and identified in this paper, such as mobility management, scalability, virtualization at the IIoT edge, and digital twins.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology with an increasing popularity and applications in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. Although many of these areas closely relate to the urban context, there is limited understanding of the trending AI technologies and their application areas&mdash;or concepts&mdash;in the urban planning and development fields. Similarly, there is a knowledge gap in how the public perceives AI technologies, their application areas, and the AI-related policies and practices of our cities. This study aims to advance our understanding of the relationship between the key AI technologies (n = 15) and their key application areas (n = 16) in urban planning and development. To this end, this study examines public perceptions of how AI technologies and their application areas in urban planning and development are perceived and utilized in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories. The methodological approach of this study employs the social media analytics method, and conducts sentiment and content analyses of location-based Twitter messages (n = 11,236) from Australia. The results disclose that: (a) digital transformation, innovation, and sustainability are the most popular AI application areas in urban planning and development; (b) drones, automation, robotics, and big data are the most popular AI technologies utilized in urban planning and development, and; (c) achieving the digital transformation and sustainability of cities through the use of AI technologies&mdash;such as big data, automation and robotics&mdash;is the central community discussion topic.

TI  - Exploring the Attractiveness of Residential Areas for Human Activities Based on Shared E-Bike Trajectory Data

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Human activities generate diverse and sophisticated functional areas and may impact the existing planning of functional areas. Understanding the relationship between human activities and functional areas is key to identifying the real-time urban functional areas based on trajectories. Few previous studies have analyzed the interactive information on humans and regions for functional area identification. The relationship between human activities and residential areas is the most representative for urban functional areas because residential areas cover a wide range and are closely connected with human life. The aim of this paper is to propose the CARA (Commuting Activity and Residential Area) model to quantify the correlation between human activities and urban residential areas. In this model, human activities are represented by hot spots extracted by the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm while residential areas are represented by POI (point of interest) data. The model shows that human activities and residential areas present a logarithmic relationship. The CARA model is further assessed by retrieving urban residential areas in Tengzhou City from shared e-bike trajectories. Compared with the actual map, the accuracy reaches 83.3%, thus demonstrating the model&rsquo;s reliability and feasibility. This study provides a new method for functional areas identification based on trajectory data, which is helpful for formulating the urban people-oriented policies.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption in a user&rsquo;s head of an electromagnetic field (EMF) emitted by the Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth module of a wearable small Internet of Things (IoT) electronic device (emitting EMF of up to 100 mW), in order to test the hypothesis that EMF has an insignificant influence on humans, and to compare the levels of such EMF absorption in various scenarios when using this device. The modelled EMF source was a meandered inverted-F antenna (MIFA)-type antenna of the ESP32-WROOM-32 radio module used in wearable devices developed within the reported study. To quantify the EMF absorption, the specific energy absorption rate (SAR) values were calculated in a multi-layer ellipsoidal model of the human head (involving skin, fat, skull bones and brain layers). The obtained results show up to 10 times higher values of SAR from the MIFA located in the headband, in comparison to its location on the helmet. Only wearable IoT devices (similar in construction and way of use to the investigated device) emitting at below 3 mW equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) from Wi-Fi/Bluetooth communications modules may be considered environmentally insignificant EMF sources.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The interactive development of economic globalization, informatization, marketization, and urbanization has reshaped the urban commercial landscape and society, and poses new requirements for the business environment. New commerce forms that are based on information technology and electronic payment and integrate online and offline forms are growing rapidly in China. However, the relationship between new commerce forms and the business environment has not received sufficient academic attention. Using 29 major cities in China, this paper constructs a new business index system consisting of the following six sub-indexes: the characteristic hotels index, the Starbucks index, the Freshhema index, the concept bookstores index, the smart convenience stores index, and the healthcare and medical examination index. The entropy coupled with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method was used for quantitative evaluation of urban new business vitality. We found that the Freshhema index and smart convenient store index are the two most important evaluation factors. The relationship between the new business index and the business environment was examined through multiple linear regression (MLR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) analysis. We found that the MLR is not a valid model, and instead, the nonlinear GPR model has good explanatory power for this relationship. The results show that human capital has a more important effect than the economic development level on business vitality. The rise and development of new commercial forms depend on the innovation and optimization of the business environment.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - With the unprecedented growing demand for communication between Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the upcoming 5G and 6G technologies will pave the path to a widespread use of ultra-reliable low-latency applications in such networks. However, with most of the sensitive data being transmitted over wireless links, security, privacy and trust management are emerging as big challenges to handle. IoT applications vary, from self-driving vehicles, drone deliveries, online shopping, IoT smart cities, e-healthcare and robotic assisted surgery, with many applications focused on Voice over IP (VoIP) and require securing data from potential eavesdroppers and attackers. One well-known technique is a hidden exchange of secret data between the devices for which security can be achieved with audio steganography. Audio steganography is an efficient, reliable and low-latency mechanism used for securely communicating sensitive data over wireless links. MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3&rsquo;s (MP3&rsquo;s) bit rate falls within the acceptable sound quality required for audio. Its low level of noise distortion does not affect its sound quality, which makes it a good carrier medium for steganography and watermarking. The strength of any embedding technique lies with its undetectability measure. Although there are many detection techniques available for both steganography and watermarking, the detection accuracy of secret data has been proven erroneous. It has yet to be confirmed whether different bit rates or a constant sampling rate for embedding eases detection. The accuracy of detecting hidden information in MP3 files drops with the influence of the compression rate or increases. This drop or increase is caused by either the increase in file track size, the sampling rate or the bit rate. This paper presents an experimental study that evaluates the detection accuracy of the secret data embedded in MP3. Training data were used for the embedding and detection of text messages in MP3 files. Several iterations were evaluated. The experimental results show that the used approach was effective in detecting the embedded data in MP3 files. An accuracy rate of 97.92% was recorded when detecting secret data in MP3 files under 128-kbps compression. This result outperformed the previous research work.

AB  - The reliability in data collection is essential in Smart Farming supported by the Internet of Things (IoT). Several IoT and Fog-based works consider the reliability concept, but they fall short in providing a network&rsquo;s edge mechanisms for detecting and replacing outliers. Making decisions based on inaccurate data can diminish the quality of crops and, consequently, lose money. This paper proposes an approach for providing reliable data collection, which focuses on outlier detection and treatment in IoT-based Smart Farming. Our proposal includes an architecture based on the continuum IoT-Fog-Cloud, which incorporates a mechanism based on Machine Learning to detect outliers and another based on interpolation for inferring data intended to replace outliers. We located the data cleaning at the Fog to Smart Farming applications functioning in the farm operate with reliable data. We evaluate our approach by carrying out a case study in a network based on the proposed architecture and deployed at a Colombian Coffee Smart Farm. Results show our mechanisms achieve high Accuracy, Precision, and Recall as well as low False Alarm Rate and Root Mean Squared Error when detecting and replacing outliers with inferred data. Considering the obtained results, we conclude that our approach provides reliable data collection in Smart Farming.

AB  - The large-scale deployment of pervasive sensors and decentralized computing in modern smart grids is expected to exponentially increase the volume of data exchanged by power system applications. In this context, the research for scalable and flexible methodologies aimed at supporting rapid decisions in a data rich, but information limited environment represents a relevant issue to address. To this aim, this paper investigates the role of Knowledge Discovery from massive Datasets in smart grid computing, exploring its various application fields by considering the power system stakeholder available data and knowledge extraction needs. In particular, the aim of this paper is dual. In the first part, the authors summarize the most recent activities developed in this field by the Task Force on &ldquo;Enabling Paradigms for High-Performance Computing in Wide Area Monitoring Protective and Control Systems&rdquo; of the IEEE PSOPE Technologies and Innovation Subcommittee. Differently, in the second part, the authors propose the development of a data-driven forecasting methodology, which is modeled by considering the fundamental principles of Knowledge Discovery Process data workflow. Furthermore, the described methodology is applied to solve the load forecasting problem for a complex user case, in order to emphasize the potential role of knowledge discovery in supporting post processing analysis in data-rich environments, as feedback for the improvement of the forecasting performances.

AB  - In recent years, the widespread deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications has contributed to the development of smart cities. A smart city utilizes IoT-enabled technologies, communications and applications to maximize operational efficiency and enhance both the service providers&rsquo; quality of services and people&rsquo;s wellbeing and quality of life. With the growth of smart city networks, however, comes the increased risk of cybersecurity threats and attacks. IoT devices within a smart city network are connected to sensors linked to large cloud servers and are exposed to malicious attacks and threats. Thus, it is important to devise approaches to prevent such attacks and protect IoT devices from failure. In this paper, we explore an attack and anomaly detection technique based on machine learning algorithms (LR, SVM, DT, RF, ANN and KNN) to defend against and mitigate IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city. Contrary to existing works that have focused on single classifiers, we also explore ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting and stacking to enhance the performance of the detection system. Additionally, we consider an integration of feature selection, cross-validation and multi-class classification for the discussed domain, which has not been well considered in the existing literature. Experimental results with the recent attack dataset demonstrate that the proposed technique can effectively identify cyberattacks and the stacking ensemble model outperforms comparable models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score, implying the promise of stacking in this domain.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Human activities embedded in crowdsourced data, such as social media trajectory, represent individual daily styles and patterns, which are valuable in many applications. However, the accurate identification of human activity types (HATs) from social media is challenging, possibly because interactions between posts and users at different time are overlooked. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model that introduces the interactions hidden in social media and synthesizes Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying HAT. The model first characterizes interactions among words, posts, dates, and users, and then derives a Time Gated Human Activity Graph Convolutional Network (TG-HAGCN) to predict the HATs of social media trajectory. To examine the proposed model performance, we built a new dataset including interactions between post content, post time, and users from the open Yelp dataset. Experimental results show that exploiting interactions hidden in social media to recognize HATs achieves state-of-the-art performance with high accuracy. The study indicates that interactions among social media promotes ability of machine learning on social media data mining and intelligent applications, and offers a reference solution for how to fuse multi-type heterogeneous data in social media.

AB  - Wireless and mobile health applications promote the development of smart healthcare. Effective diagnosis and feedbacks of remote health data pose significant challenges due to streaming data, high noise, network latency and user privacy. Therefore, we explore efficient edge and cloud design to maintain electrocardiogram classification performance while reducing the communication cost. These contributions include: (1) We introduce a hybrid smart medical architecture named edge convolutional neural networks (EdgeCNN) that balances the capability of edge and cloud computing to address the issue for agile learning of healthcare data from IoT devices. (2) We present an effective deep learning model for electrocardiogram (ECG) inference, which can be deployed to run on edge smart devices for low-latency diagnosis. (3) We design a data enhancement method for ECG based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network to expand ECG data volume. (4) We carried out experiments on two representative datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the deep learning model of ECG classification based on EdgeCNN. EdgeCNN shows superior to traditional cloud medical systems in terms of network Input/Output (I/O) pressure, architecture cost and system high availability. The deep learning model not only ensures high diagnostic accuracy, but also has advantages in aspect of inference time, storage, running memory and power consumption.

AB  - Urban systems involve a multitude of closely intertwined components, which are more measurable than before due to new sensors, data collection, and spatio-temporal analysis methods. Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the &lsquo;forest&rsquo; of data, and to miss the &lsquo;trees&rsquo; of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole &lsquo;forest&rsquo; of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Home Automation Systems (HAS) attracted much attention during the last decade due to the developments in new wireless technologies, such as Bluetooth 4.0, 5G, WiFi 6, etc. In order to enable automation as a service in smart homes, a number of challenges must be addressed, such as fulfilling the electrical energy demands, scheduling the operational time of appliances, applying machine learning models in real-time, optimal human appliances interaction, etc. In order to address the aforementioned challenges and control the wastage of energy due to the lifestyle of the home users, we propose a system for automatically controlling the energy consumption by employing machine and deep learning techniques to smart home networks. The proposed system works in three phases, (1) feature extraction and classification based on 1-dimensional Deep Convolutional Neural Network (1D-DCNN) which extract important energy patterns from the historic energy data, (2) a load forecasting system based on Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to forecast the load based on the extracted features in phase 1 and (3) a scheduling algorithm based on the forecasted data obtained from phase 2 is designed to schedule the operational time of smart home appliances. The proposed scheme efficiently automates the smart home appliances to consume less energy while adapting to the lifestyle of smart home users. The validation of the proposed scheme is tested with a number of simulation scenarios incorporating datasets from authentic data sources. The simulation results show that the proposed smart home automation system can be a game-changer in fulfilling the energy demands of the home users without installing renewable and other energy sources in the future.

AB  - Mobility services facilitate various tasks related to transportation and passenger movements. Because of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the importance of mobility services has been recognized by many countries. Thus, research is ongoing to provide more convenience to passengers and to obtain more efficient transportation systems. In the Republic of Korea, the officials of Gyeonggi Province are interested in providing an advanced mobility service to its residents; however, they still do not have any specific or detailed policies. This study aimed at deriving the key issues facing mobility services, especially in the case of Gyeonggi Province, by using a text mining technique and a clustering algorithm. First, a survey was taken by traffic and urban experts to collect reasonable plans for Gyeonggi-Province-type mobility service, and a morpheme analysis was then used for text mining. Second, the results reveal that the term frequency&ndash;inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm has better performance than frequency analysis. Third, the K-means application results in six clusters and six mobility service policy issues were determined by combining the words in each cluster. Finally, the methodology confirmed the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method by showing that the results reflect the current situation in the province.

AB  - Activity recognition can provide useful information about an older individual&rsquo;s activity level and encourage older people to become more active to live longer in good health. This study aimed to develop an activity recognition algorithm for smartphone accelerometry data of older people. Deep learning algorithms, including convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), were evaluated in this study. Smartphone accelerometry data of free-living activities, performed by 53 older people (83.8 &plusmn; 3.8 years; 38 male) under standardized circumstances, were classified into lying, sitting, standing, transition, walking, walking upstairs, and walking downstairs. A 1D CNN, a multichannel CNN, a CNN-LSTM, and a multichannel CNN-LSTM model were tested. The models were compared on accuracy and computational efficiency. Results show that the multichannel CNN-LSTM model achieved the best classification results, with an 81.1% accuracy and an acceptable model and time complexity. Specifically, the accuracy was 67.0% for lying, 70.7% for sitting, 88.4% for standing, 78.2% for transitions, 88.7% for walking, 65.7% for walking downstairs, and 68.7% for walking upstairs. The findings indicated that the multichannel CNN-LSTM model was feasible for smartphone-based activity recognition in older people.

AB  - In this work, a mobile application is developed to assist patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or Asthma that will reduce the dependency on hospital and clinic based tests and enable users to better manage their disease through increased self-involvement. Due to the pervasiveness of smartphones, it is proposed to make use of their built-in sensors and ever increasing computational capabilities to provide patients with a mobile-based spirometer capable of diagnosing COPD or asthma in a reliable and cost effective manner. Data collected using an experimental setup consisting of an airflow source, an anemometer, and a smartphone is used to develop a mathematical model that relates exhalation frequency to air flow rate. This model allows for the computation of two key parameters known as forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) that are used in the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. The developed platform has been validated using data collected from 25 subjects with various conditions. Results show that an excellent match is achieved between the FVC and FEV1 values computed using a clinical spirometer and those returned by the model embedded in the mobile application.

AB  - Recently, developing countries have steadily been pushing for the construction of stream-oriented smart cities, breaking away from the existing old-town-centered development in the past. Due to the accelerating effects of climate change along with such urbanization, it is imperative for urban rivers to establish a flood warning system that can predict the amount of high flow rates of accuracy in engineering, compared to using the existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models for disaster prevention. In this study, in the case of streams where missing data existed or only small observations were obtained, the variation in flow rates could be predicted with only the appropriate deep learning models, using only limited time series flow data. In addition, the selected deep learning model allowed the minimum number of input learning data to be determined. In this study, the time series flow rates were predicted by applying the deep learning models to the Han River, which is a highly urbanized stream that flows through the capital of Korea, Seoul and has a large seasonal variation in the flow rate. The deep learning models used are Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Sequence lengths for time series runoff data were determined first to assess the accuracy and applicability of the deep learning models. By analyzing the forecast results of the outflow data of the Han River, sequence length for 14 days was appropriate in terms of the predicted accuracy of the model. In addition, the GRU model is effective for deep learning models that use time series data of the region with large fluctuations in flow rates, such as the Han River. Furthermore, through this study, it was possible to propose the minimum number of training data that could provide flood warning system with an effective flood forecasting system although the number of input data such as flow rates secured in new towns developed around rivers was insufficient.

AB  - Advancement of accurate models for predicting real estate price is of utmost importance for urban development and several critical economic functions. Due to the significant uncertainties and dynamic variables, modeling real estate has been studied as complex systems. In this study, a novel machine learning method is proposed to tackle real estate modeling complexity. Call detail records (CDR) provides excellent opportunities for in-depth investigation of the mobility characterization. This study explores the CDR potential for predicting the real estate price with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). Several essential mobility entropy factors, including dweller entropy, dweller gyration, workers’ entropy, worker gyration, dwellers’ work distance, and workers’ home distance, are used as input variables. The prediction model is developed using the machine learning method of multi-layered perceptron (MLP) trained with the evolutionary algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO). Model performance is evaluated using mean square error (MSE), sustainability index (SI), and Willmott’s index (WI). The proposed model showed promising results revealing that the workers’ entropy and the dwellers’ work distances directly influence the real estate price. However, the dweller gyration, dweller entropy, workers’ gyration, and the workers’ home had a minimum effect on the price. Furthermore, it is shown that the flow of activities and entropy of mobility are often associated with the regions with lower real estate prices.

SN  - 2227-7390

AB  - Monitoring the distribution of vehicles across the city is of great importance for urban traffic control. In particular, information on the number of vehicles entering and leaving a city, or moving between urban areas, gives a valuable estimate on potential bottlenecks and congestions. The possibility of predicting such flows in advance is even more beneficial, allowing for timely traffic management strategies and targeted congestion warnings. Our work is inserted in the context of short-term forecasting, aiming to predict rapid changes and sudden variations in the traffic volume, beyond the general trend. Moreover, it concurrently targets multiple locations in the city, providing an instant prediction outcome comprising the future distribution of vehicles across several urban locations. Specifically, we propose a multi-target deep learning regressor for simultaneous predictions of traffic volumes, in multiple entry and exit points among city neighborhoods. The experiment focuses on an hourly forecasting of the amount of vehicles accessing and moving between New York City neighborhoods through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) bridges and tunnels. By leveraging a single training process for all location points, and an instant one-step volume inference for every location at each time update, our sequential modeling approach is able to grasp rapid variations in the time series and process the collective information of all entry and exit points, whose distinct predicted values are outputted at once. The multi-target model, based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network layers, was tested on a real-world dataset, achieving an average prediction error of 7% and demonstrating its feasibility for short-term spatially-distributed urban traffic forecasting.

AB  - In the last few years, with the exponential diffusion of smartphones, services for turn-by-turn navigation have seen a surge in popularity. Current solutions available in the market allow the user to select via an interface the desired transportation mode, for which an optimal route is then computed. Automatically recognizing the transportation system that the user is travelling by allows to dynamically control, and consequently update, the route proposed to the user. Such a dynamic approach is an enabling technology for multi-modal transportation planners, in which the optimal path and its associated transportation solutions are updated in real-time based on data coming from (i) distributed sensors (e.g., smart traffic lights, road congestion sensors, etc.); (ii) service providers (e.g., car-sharing availability, bus waiting time, etc.); and (iii) the user&rsquo;s own device, in compliance with the development of smart cities envisaged by the 5G architecture. In this paper, we present a series of Machine Learning approaches for real-time Transportation Mode Recognition and we report their performance difference in our field tests. Several Machine Learning-based classifiers, including Deep Neural Networks, built on both statistical feature extraction and raw data analysis are presented and compared in this paper; the result analysis also highlights which features are proven to be the most informative ones for the classification.

AB  - The main aims of this paper are to examine the technological trajectories of city innovation, to provide a picture of the current state in the most significant technologies, and to propose an explanation for the long-run evolutionary trajectories of technological developments that contribute to the quality of urban life through innovation. In the conceptual part of the paper, we develop the argument that the explanation may rest on the interrelationships between the concept of urban transformative capacity and the theory of path dependence. In the empirical part, we analyze patent data on city-related innovations to examine the trajectories of technological developments over the period 1980&ndash;2020. Our main findings at a technological field level (i) confirm the path dependence theory in general and the institutional approach in particular, (ii) acknowledge the rapid transformation towards &lsquo;smart cities&rsquo; through the explosive growth of digital technologies, and (iii) confirm the environmental sustainability concerns when developing new technologies. In our study, we focus particularly on the technological sectors (&lsquo;clusters&rsquo;) that provide a significant contribution to quality of urban life, namely environment, public services, and leisure and participation. Our findings provide theoretical, managerial, and policy implications for future research activities on the technological developments that benefit quality of urban life.

AB  - In this work, an exhaustive revision is given of the literature associated with advanced information and communication technologies in agriculture within a window of 25 years using bibliometric tools enabled to detect of the main actors, structure, and dynamics in the scientific papers. The main findings are a trend of growth in the dynamics of publications associated with advanced information and communication technologies in agriculture productivity. Another assertion is that countries, like the USA, China, and Brazil, stand out in many publications due to allocating more resources to research, development, and agricultural productivity. In addition, the collaboration networks between countries are frequently in regions with closer cultural and idiomatic ties; additionally, terms&rsquo; occurrence are obtained with Louvain algorithm predominating four clusters: precision agriculture, smart agriculture, remote sensing, and climate smart agriculture. Finally, the thematic-map characterization with Callon&rsquo;s density and centrality is applied in three periods. The first period of thematic analysis shows a transition in detecting the variability of a nutrient, such as nitrogen, through the help of immature georeferenced techniques, towards greater remote sensing involvement. In the transition from the second to the third stage, the maturation of technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, wireless sensor networks, and the machine learning area, is observed.

AB  - Air pollution is becoming a rising and serious environmental problem, especially in urban areas affected by an increasing migration rate. The large availability of sensor data enables the adoption of analytical tools to provide decision support capabilities. Employing sensors facilitates air pollution monitoring, but the lack of predictive capability limits such systems&rsquo; potential in practical scenarios. On the other hand, forecasting methods offer the opportunity to predict the future pollution in specific areas, potentially suggesting useful preventive measures. To date, many works tackled the problem of air pollution forecasting, most of which are based on sequence models. These models are trained with raw pollution data and are subsequently utilized to make predictions. This paper proposes a novel approach evaluating four different architectures that utilize camera images to estimate the air pollution in those areas. These images are further enhanced with weather data to boost the classification accuracy. The proposed approach exploits generative adversarial networks combined with data augmentation techniques to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves robust accuracy of up to 0.88, which is comparable to sequence models and conventional models that utilize air pollution data. This is a remarkable result considering that the historic air pollution data is directly related to the output&mdash;future air pollution data, whereas the proposed architecture uses camera images to recognize the air pollution&mdash;which is an inherently much more difficult problem.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - During the last decade, the Internet of Things acted as catalyst for the big data phenomenon. As result, modern edge devices can access a huge amount of data that can be exploited to build useful services. In such a context, artificial intelligence has a key role to develop intelligent systems (e.g., intelligent cyber physical systems) that create a connecting bridge with the physical world. However, as time goes by, machine and deep learning applications are becoming more complex, requiring increasing amounts of data and training time, which makes the use of centralized approaches unsuitable. Federated learning is an emerging paradigm which enables the cooperation of edge devices to learn a shared model (while keeping private their training data), thereby abating the training time. Although federated learning is a promising technique, its implementation is difficult and brings a lot of challenges. In this paper, we present an extension of Stack4Things, a cloud platform developed in our department; leveraging its functionalities, we enabled the deployment of federated learning on edge devices without caring their heterogeneity. Experimental results show a comparison with a centralized approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of both training time and model accuracy.

AB  - This paper focuses on proposing a new access barring scheme for internet of things (IoT) devices in long term evolution advanced (LTE/LTE-A) and 5G networks. Massive number of IoT devices communicating simultaneously is one of the hallmarks of the future communication networks such as 5G and beyond. The problem of congestion also comes with this massive communication for which access barring is one of the solutions. So, it is required that sophisticated access barring techniques are designed such that the congestion is avoided and these devices get served in less time. Legacy access barring schemes like access class barring (ACB) and extended access barring (EAB) suffer from high energy consumption and high access delay respectively. However, our proposed scheme provides less energy consumption than ACB while giving less access delay than EAB. The proposed scheme maximizes the success probability while reducing the number of collisions at the same time. The scheme is based on an approximation of the number of IoT devices based on details available to the eNodeB of the number of idle, successful and collided preambles. Extensive Matlab simulations are performed to validate our claims and analysis.

AB  - With the Industry 4.0 paradigm comes the convergence of the Internet Technologies and Operational Technologies, and concepts, such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), cloud manufacturing, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and so on. These concepts bring industries into the big data era and allow for them to have access to potentially useful information in order to optimise the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE); however, most European industries still rely on the Computer-Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) model, where the production systems run as independent systems (i.e., without any communication with the upper levels). Those production systems are controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller, in which a static and rigid program is implemented. This program is static and rigid in a sense that the programmed routines cannot evolve over the time unless a human modifies it. However, to go further in terms of flexibility, we are convinced that it requires moving away from the aforementioned old-fashioned and rigid automation to a ML-based automation, i.e., where the control itself is based on the decisions that were taken by ML algorithms. In order to verify this, we applied a time series classification method on a scale model of a factory using real industrial controllers, and widened the variety of parts the production line has to treat. This study shows that satisfactory results can be obtained only at the expense of the human expertise (i.e., in the industrial process and in the ML process).

AB  - The significant advances in wireless networks in the past decade have made a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) use cases possible, greatly facilitating many operations in our daily lives. IoT is only expected to grow with 5G and beyond networks, which will primarily rely on software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization for achieving the promised quality of service. The prevalence of IoT and the large attack surface that it has created calls for SDN-based intelligent security solutions that achieve real-time, automated intrusion detection and mitigation. In this paper, we propose a real-time intrusion detection and mitigation solution for SDN, which aims to provide autonomous security in the high-traffic IoT networks of the 5G and beyond era, while achieving a high degree of interpretability by human experts. The proposed approach is built upon automated flow feature extraction and classification of flows while using random forest classifiers at the SDN application layer. We present an SDN-specific dataset that we generated for IoT and provide results on the accuracy of intrusion detection in addition to performance results in the presence and absence of our proposed security mechanism. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed security approach is promising for achieving real-time, highly accurate detection and mitigation of attacks in SDN-managed IoT networks.

In this study, we investigate the main drivers with the potential to increase urban mobility intelligence and assign them a priority. Following on from a systematic review of the literature, we conducted broad and detailed bibliographic research based on the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). We also surveyed 181 professionals working in the field concerned to confirm the importance of different drivers and assign them a level of priority. The results show that 27 drivers identified in the literature were considered important, of which seven, related to city governance and technical solutions, were considered the most important to increase urban mobility intelligence.

AB  - Urbanization is a challenge faced by most countries worldwide and leads to several problems. Due to rapid communication capabilities, conforming the megacities into Ubiquitous cities (U-cities) seems to be a potential solution to mitigate the problems caused by urbanization. Extensive reliance and dependencies of U-cities on information and communication technologies (ICTs) bring forth a new set of risks and vulnerabilities to these megacities. This research investigates the vulnerabilities of ICTs against man-made and natural hazards in a systematic way using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The study identifies the vulnerabilities of different ICTs in U-cities and helps in improving the system&rsquo;s resistivity against various hazards. The task is performed by evaluating the level of disruption on the different technologies and areas under the identified man-made and natural hazards. The research provides an insight into the working mechanisms of involved ICTs. It also helps to manage U-cities with more secure and sustainable services. The research identified that the new ICTs-based hazards have emerged and have become among the most influential hazards. The research has concluded that the vulnerabilities of U-cities are significantly different from that of conventional cities and need further studies to develop further understandings. The research recommends similar vulnerability studies for regional areas as well.

AB  - The semantic segmentation of a brain tumor is of paramount importance for its treatment and prevention. Recently, researches have proposed various neural network-based architectures to improve the performance of segmentation of brain tumor sub-regions. Brain tumor segmentation, being a challenging area of research, requires improvement in its performance. This paper proposes a 2D image segmentation method, BU-Net, to contribute to brain tumor segmentation research. Residual extended skip (RES) and wide context (WC) are used along with the customized loss function in the baseline U-Net architecture. The modifications contribute by finding more diverse features, by increasing the valid receptive field. The contextual information is extracted with the aggregating features to get better segmentation performance. The proposed BU-Net was evaluated on the high-grade glioma (HGG) datasets of the BraTS2017 Challenge&mdash;the test datasets of the BraTS 2017 and 2018 Challenge datasets. Three major labels to segmented were tumor core (TC), whole tumor (WT), and enhancing core (EC). To compare the performance quantitatively, the dice score was utilized. The proposed BU-Net outperformed the existing state-of-the-art techniques. The high performing BU-Net can have a great contribution to researchers from the field of bioinformatics and medicine.

AB  - Enhancement of Cultural Heritage such as historical images is very crucial to safeguard the diversity of cultures. Automated colorization of black and white images has been subject to extensive research through computer vision and machine learning techniques. Our research addresses the problem of generating a plausible colored photograph of ancient, historically black, and white images of Nepal using deep learning techniques without direct human intervention. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning techniques in image processing, a feed-forward, deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in combination with Inception- ResnetV2 is being trained by sets of sample images using back-propagation to recognize the pattern in RGB and grayscale values. The trained neural network is then used to predict two a* and b* chroma channels given grayscale, L channel of test images. CNN vividly colorizes images with the help of the fusion layer accounting for local features as well as global features. Two objective functions, namely, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), are employed for objective quality assessment between the estimated color image and its ground truth. The model is trained on the dataset created by ourselves with 1.2 K historical images comprised of old and ancient photographs of Nepal, each having 256 &times; 256 resolution. The loss i.e., MSE, PSNR, and accuracy of the model are found to be 6.08%, 34.65 dB, and 75.23%, respectively. Other than presenting the training results, the public acceptance or subjective validation of the generated images is assessed by means of a user study where the model shows 41.71% of naturalness while evaluating colorization results.

VL  - 9
IS  - 12
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In order to detect the vehicle presence in parking slots, different approaches have been utilized, which range from image recognition to sensing via detection nodes. The last one is usually based on getting the presence data from one or more sensors (commonly magnetic or IR-based), controlled and processed by a micro-controller that sends the data through radio interface. Consequently, given nodes have multiple components, adequate software is required for its control and state-machine to communicate its status to the receiver. This paper presents an alternative, cost-effective beacon-based mechanism for sensing the vehicle presence. It is based on the well-known effect that, once the metallic obstacle (i.e., vehicle) is on top of the sensing node, the signal strength will be attenuated, while the same shall be recognized at the receiver side. Therefore, the signal strength change conveys the information regarding the presence. Algorithms processing signal strength change at the receiver side to estimate the presence are required due to the stochastic nature of signal strength parameters. In order to prove the concept, experimental setup based on LoRa-based parking sensors was used to gather occupancy/signal strength data. In order to extract the information of presence, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) was employed with accuracy of up to 96%, while the Neural Network (NN) approach reaches an accuracy of up to 97%. The given approach reduces the costs of the sensor production by at least 50%.

AB  - This paper uses a neural network approach transformer of taxi driver behavior to predict the next destination with geographical factors. The problem of predicting the next destination is a well-studied application of human mobility, for reducing traffic congestion and optimizing the electronic dispatching system&rsquo;s performance. According to the Intelligent Transport System (ITS), this kind of task is usually modeled as a multi-class problem. We propose the novel model Deep Wide Spatial-Temporal-Based Transformer Networks (DWSTTNs). In our approach, the encoder and decoder are the transformer&rsquo;s primary units; with the help of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN), we encode the geographical information based on visited semantic locations. In particular, we trained our model for the exact longitude and latitude coordinates to predict the next destination. The benefit in the real world of this kind of research is to reduce the customer waiting time for a ride and driver waiting time to pick up a customer. Taxi companies can also optimize their management to improve their company&rsquo;s service, while urban transport planner can use this information to better plan the urban traffic. We conducted extensive experiments on two real-word datasets, Porto and Manhattan, and the performance was improved compared to the previous models.

AB  - During the past few decades, the need to intervene in underwater scenarios has grown due to the increasing necessity to perform tasks like underwater infrastructure inspection and maintenance or archaeology and geology exploration. In the last few years, the usage of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) has eased the workload and risks of such interventions. To automate these tasks, the AUVs have to gather the information of their surroundings, interpret it and make decisions based on it. The two main perception modalities used at close range are laser and video. In this paper, we propose the usage of a deep neural network to recognise pipes and valves in multiple underwater scenarios, using 3D RGB point cloud information provided by a stereo camera. We generate a diverse and rich dataset for the network training and testing, assessing the effect of a broad selection of hyperparameters and values. Results show F1-scores of up to 97.2% for a test set containing images with similar characteristics to the training set and up to 89.3% for a secondary test set containing images taken at different environments and with distinct characteristics from the training set. This work demonstrates the validity and robust training of the PointNet neural in underwater scenarios and its applicability for AUV intervention tasks.

SN  - 2073-431X

AB  - Interpersonal trust mediates multiple socio-technical systems and has implications for personal and societal well-being. Consequently, it is crucial to devise novel machine learning methods to infer interpersonal trust automatically using mobile sensor-based behavioral data. Considering that social relationships are often affected by neighboring relationships within the same network, this work proposes using a novel neighbor-aware deep learning architecture (NADAL) to enhance the inference of interpersonal trust scores. Based on analysis of call, SMS, and Bluetooth interaction data from a one-year field study involving 130 participants, we report that: (1) adding information about neighboring relationships improves trust score prediction in both shallow and deep learning approaches; and (2) a custom-designed neighbor-aware deep learning architecture outperforms a baseline feature concatenation based deep learning approach. The results obtained at interpersonal trust prediction are promising and have multiple implications for trust-aware applications in the emerging social internet of things.

TI  - Electricity Consumption Forecasting Based on a Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory Artificial Neural Network
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The accurate forecasting of the hourly month-ahead electricity consumption represents a very important aspect for non-household electricity consumers and system operators, and at the same time represents a key factor in what regards energy efficiency and achieving sustainable economic, business, and management operations. In this context, we have devised, developed, and validated within the paper an hourly month ahead electricity consumption forecasting method. This method is based on a bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) artificial neural network (ANN) enhanced with a multiple simultaneously decreasing delays approach coupled with function fitting neural networks (FITNETs). The developed method targets the hourly month-ahead total electricity consumption at the level of a commercial center-type consumer and for the hourly month ahead consumption of its refrigerator storage room. The developed approach offers excellent forecasting results, highlighted by the validation stage&rsquo;s results along with the registered performance metrics, namely 0.0495 for the root mean square error (RMSE) performance metric for the total hourly month-ahead electricity consumption and 0.0284 for the refrigerator storage room. We aimed for and managed to attain an hourly month-ahead consumed electricity prediction without experiencing a significant drop in the forecasting accuracy that usually tends to occur after the first two weeks, therefore achieving a reliable method that satisfies the contractor&rsquo;s needs, being able to enhance his/her activity from the economic, business, and management perspectives. Even if the devised, developed, and validated forecasting solution for the hourly consumption targets a commercial center-type consumer, based on its accuracy, this solution can also represent a useful tool for other non-household electricity consumers due to its generalization capability.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) cloud-based applications deliver advanced solutions for smart cities to decrease traffic accidents caused by driver fatigue while driving on the road. Environmental conditions or driver behavior can ultimately lead to serious roadside accidents. In recent years, the authors have developed many low-cost, computerized, driver fatigue detection systems (DFDs) to help drivers, by using multi-sensors, and mobile and cloud-based computing architecture. To promote safe driving, these are the most current emerging platforms that were introduced in the past. In this paper, we reviewed state-of-the-art approaches for predicting unsafe driving styles using three common IoT-based architectures. The novelty of this article is to show major differences among multi-sensors, smartphone-based, and cloud-based architectures in multimodal feature processing. We discussed all of the problems that machine learning techniques faced in recent years, particularly the deep learning (DL) model, to predict driver hypovigilance, especially in terms of these three IoT-based architectures. Moreover, we performed state-of-the-art comparisons by using driving simulators to incorporate multimodal features of the driver. We also mention online data sources in this article to test and train network architecture in the field of DFDs on public available multimodal datasets. These comparisons assist other authors to continue future research in this domain. To evaluate the performance, we mention the major problems in these three architectures to help researchers use the best IoT-based architecture for detecting DFDs in a real-time environment. Moreover, the important factors of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) and 5th generation (5G) networks are analyzed in the context of deep learning architecture to improve the response time of DFD systems. Lastly, it is concluded that there is a research gap when it comes to implementing the DFD systems on MEC and 5G technologies by using multimodal features and DL architecture.

AB  - Ensuring the confidentiality of private data stored in our technological devices is a fundamental aspect for protecting our personal and professional information. Authentication procedures are among the main methods used to achieve this protection and, typically, are implemented only when accessing the device. Nevertheless, in many occasions it is necessary to carry out user authentication in a continuous manner to guarantee an allowed use of the device while protecting authentication data. In this work, we first review the state of the art of Continuous Authentication (CA), User Profiling (UP), and related biometric databases. Secondly, we summarize the privacy-preserving methods employed to protect the security of sensor-based data used to conduct user authentication, and some practical examples of their utilization. The analysis of the literature of these topics reveals the importance of sensor-based data to protect personal and professional information, as well as the need for exploring a combination of more biometric features with privacy-preserving approaches.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - There is a need to apply lean approaches in construction projects. Both BIM and IoT are increasingly being used in the construction industry. However, using BIM in conjunction with IoT for sustainability purposes has not received enough attention in construction. In particular, the capability created from the combination of both technologies has not been exploited. There is a growing consensus that the future of construction operation tends to be smart and intelligent, which would be possible by a combination of both information systems and sensors. This investigation aims to find out the recent efforts of utilizing BIM for lean purposes in the last decade by critically reviewing the published literature and identifying dominant clusters of research topics. More specifically, the investigation is further developed by identifying the gaps in the literature to utilize IoT in conjunction with BIM in construction projects to facilitate applying lean techniques in a more efficient way in construction projects. A systematic review method was designed to identify scholarly papers covering both concepts &ldquo;lean&rdquo; and &ldquo;BIM&rdquo; in construction and possibilities of using IoT. A total of 48 scholarly articles selected from 26 construction journals were carefully reviewed thorough perusal. The key findings were discussed with industry practitioners. The transcriptions were analyzed employing two coding and cluster analysis techniques. The results of the cluster analysis show two main directions, including the recent practice of lean and BIM interactions and issues of lean and BIM adoption. Findings revealed a large synergy between lean and BIM in control interactions and reduction in variations, and surprisingly there are many uncovered areas in this field. The results also show that the capability of IoT is also largely not considered in recent developments. The number of papers covering both lean and BIM is very limited, and there is a large clear gap in understanding synergetic interactions of lean concepts applying in BIM and IoT in specific fields of construction such as sustainable infrastructure projects.

AB  - Providing citizens with the ability to move around in an accessible way is a requirement for all cities today. However, modeling city infrastructures so that accessible routes can be computed is a challenge because it involves collecting information from multiple, large-scale and heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we propose and validate the architecture of an information system that creates an accessibility data model for cities by ingesting data from different types of sources and provides an application that can be used by people with different abilities to compute accessible routes. The article describes the processes that allow building a network of pedestrian infrastructures from the OpenStreetMap information (i.e., sidewalks and pedestrian crossings), improving the network with information extracted obtained from mobile-sensed LiDAR data (i.e., ramps, steps, and pedestrian crossings), detecting obstacles using volunteered information collected from the hardware sensors of the mobile devices of the citizens (i.e., ramps and steps), and detecting accessibility problems with software sensors in social networks (i.e., Twitter). The information system is validated through its application in a case study in the city of Vigo (Spain).

T2  - Energies

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has seen rapid growth in the development of real-time applications due to its ease of management and cost-effective attributes. However, the balance between optimization of network lifetime and load distribution between sensor nodes is a critical matter for the development of energy-efficient routing solutions. Recently, many solutions have been proposed for constraint-based networks using the cloud paradigm. However, they achieve network scalability with the additional cost of routing overheads and network latency. Moreover, the sensors&rsquo; data is transmitted towards application users over the uncertain medium, which leads to compromised data security and its integrity. Therefore, this work proposes a light-weight secure and energy-efficient fog-based routing (SEFR) protocol to minimize data latency and increase energy management. It exploits the Quality of Service (QoS) factors and facilitates time-sensitive applications with network edges. Moreover, the proposed protocol protects real-time data based on two levels of cryptographic security primitives. In the first level, a lightweight data confidentiality scheme is proposed between the cluster heads and fog nodes, and in the second level, a high-performance asymmetric encryption scheme is proposed among fog and cloud layers. The analysis of simulation-based experiments has proven the significant outcomes of the proposed protocol compared to existing solutions in terms of routing, security, and network management.

AB  - Location-based applications (LBAs) capture the user’s physical location via satellite navigation sensors and integrate it as part of the digital application. Because of this connection, the real-world environment needs to be accounted for in LBA design. In this work, we focused on creating a database of geographically distributed points of interest (PoIs) that is optimal for learning local history. First, we conducted a requirements elicitation study at three outdoor archaeological sites and identified issues in existing solutions. Second, we designed a multi-layered prototype solution. Third, we evaluated the solution with nine experts who had prior experience with LBAs or similar systems. We incorporated their feedback to our design to iteratively improve it. As a whole, our work contributes to the LBA design literature by proposing a solution that is optimized for the learning of local history.

AB  - Robotics technology has become increasingly common both for businesses and for private citizens. Primary and secondary schools, as a mirror of societal evolution, have increasingly integrated science, technology, engineering and math concepts into their curricula. Our research questions are: &ldquo;In teaching robotics to primary and secondary school students, which pedagogical-methodological interventions result in better understanding and knowledge in the use of sensors in educational robotics?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;In teaching robotics to primary and secondary school students, which analytical methods related to Learning Analytics processes are proposed to analyze and reflect on students&rsquo; behavior in their learning of concepts and skills of sensors in educational robotics?&rdquo;. To answer these questions, we have carried out a systematic review of the literature in the Web of Science and Scopus databases regarding robotics sensors in primary and secondary education, and Learning Analytics processes. We applied PRISMA methodology and reviewed a total of 24 articles. The results show a consensus about the use of the Learning by Doing and Project-Based Learning methodologies, including their different variations, as the most common methodology for achieving optimal engagement, motivation and performance in students&rsquo; learning. Finally, future lines of research are identified from this study.

TI  - SIoT: A New Strategy to Improve the Network Lifetime with an Efficient Search Process
T2  - Future Internet

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) means that every node can use a set of nodes that are considered as friends to search for a specific service. However, this is a slow process because each node is required to manage a high number of friends. Thus, the SIoT issue consists of how to select the right friends that improve the network navigability. The enhancement of the network navigability boosts the search for a service to be rapid but not guaranteed. Furthermore, sending requests from the shortest paths involves the rapid search, but the network lifetime can be reduced due to the number of requests that can be transmitted and processed by the nodes that have low power energy. This paper proposes a new approach that improves the network navigability, speeds up the search process, and increases the network lifetime. This approach aims at creating groups dynamically by nodes where each group has a master node, second, using a consensus algorithm between master nodes to agree with a specific capability, finally adopting a friendship selection method to create a social network. Thus, the friends will be sorted periodically for the objective of creating simultaneously a balance between the energy consumption and the rapid search process. Simulation results on the Brightkite location-based online social network dataset demonstrate that our proposal outperforms baseline methods in terms of some parameters of network navigability, path length to reach the providers, and network lifetime.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Because of extensive variations in occupancy patterns around office space environments and their use of electrical equipment, accurate occupants&rsquo; behaviour detection is valuable for reducing the building energy demand and carbon emissions. Using the collected occupancy information, building energy management system can automatically adjust the operation of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to meet the actual demands in different conditioned spaces in real-time. Existing and commonly used &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; schedules for HVAC systems are not sufficient and cannot adjust based on the dynamic changes in building environments. This study proposes a vision-based occupancy and equipment usage detection method based on deep learning for demand-driven control systems. A model based on region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) was developed, trained and deployed to a camera for real-time detection of occupancy activities and equipment usage. Experiments tests within a case study office room suggested an overall accuracy of 97.32% and 80.80%. In order to predict the energy savings that can be attained using the proposed approach, the case study building was simulated. The simulation results revealed that the heat gains could be over or under predicted when using static or fixed profiles. Based on the set conditions, the equipment and occupancy gains were 65.75% and 32.74% lower when using the deep learning approach. Overall, the study showed the capabilities of the proposed approach in detecting and recognising multiple occupants&rsquo; activities and equipment usage and providing an alternative to estimate the internal heat emissions.

AB  - The demand for electricity is increased due to the development of the industry, the electrification of transport, the rise of household demand, and the increase in demand for digitally connected devices and air conditioning systems. For that, solutions and actions should be developed for greater consumers of electricity. For instance, MG (Micro-grid) buildings are one of the main consumers of electricity, and if they are correctly constructed, controlled, and operated, a significant energy saving can be attained. As a solution, hybrid RES (renewable energy source) systems are proposed, offering the possibility for simple consumers to be producers of electricity. This hybrid system contains different renewable generators connected to energy storage systems, making it possible to locally produce a part of energy in order to minimize the consumption from the utility grid. This work gives a concise state-of-the-art overview of the main control approaches for energy management in MG systems. Principally, this study is carried out in order to define the suitable control approach for MGs for energy management in buildings. A classification of approaches is also given in order to shed more light on the need for predictive control for energy management in MGs.

AB  - Detection of weeds and crops is the key step for precision spraying using the spraying herbicide robot and precise fertilization for the agriculture machine in the field. On the basis of k-mean clustering image segmentation using color information and connected region analysis, a method combining multi feature fusion and support vector machine (SVM) was proposed to identify and detect the position of corn seedlings and weeds, to reduce the harm of weeds on corn growth, and to achieve accurate fertilization, thereby realizing precise weeding or fertilizing. First, the image dataset for weed and corn seedling classification in the corn seedling stage was established. Second, many different features of corn seedlings and weeds were extracted, and dimensionality was reduced by principal component analysis, including the histogram of oriented gradient feature, rotation invariant local binary pattern (LBP) feature, Hu invariant moment feature, Gabor feature, gray level co-occurrence matrix, and gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix. Then, the classifier training based on SVM was conducted to obtain the recognition model for corn seedlings and weeds. The comprehensive recognition performance of single feature or different fusion strategies for six features is compared and analyzed, and the optimal feature fusion strategy is obtained. Finally, by utilizing the actual corn seedling field images, the proposed weed and corn seedling detection method effect was tested. LAB color space and K-means clustering were used to achieve image segmentation. Connected component analysis was adopted to remove small objects. The previously trained recognition model was utilized to identify and label each connected region to identify and detect weeds and corn seedlings. The experimental results showed that the fusion feature combination of rotation invariant LBP feature and gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix based on SVM classifier obtained the highest classification accuracy and accurately detected all kinds of weeds and corn seedlings. It provided information on weed and crop positions to the spraying herbicide robot for accurate spraying or to the precise fertilization machine for accurate fertilizing.

AB  - In smart city scenarios, the huge proliferation of monitoring cameras scattered in public spaces has posed many challenges to network and processing infrastructure. A few dozen cameras are enough to saturate the city&rsquo;s backbone. In addition, most smart city applications require a real-time response from the system in charge of processing such large-scale video streams. Finding a missing person using facial recognition technology is one of these applications that require immediate action on the place where that person is. In this paper, we tackle these challenges presenting a distributed system for video analytics designed to leverage edge computing capabilities. Our approach encompasses architecture, methods, and algorithms for: (i) dividing the burdensome processing of large-scale video streams into various machine learning tasks; and (ii) deploying these tasks as a workflow of data processing in edge devices equipped with hardware accelerators for neural networks. We also propose the reuse of nodes running tasks shared by multiple applications, e.g., facial recognition, thus improving the system&rsquo;s processing throughput. Simulations showed that, with our algorithm to distribute the workload, the time to process a workflow is about 33% faster than a naive approach.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Cloud computing use is exponentially increasing with the advent of industrial revolution 4.0 technologies such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and digital transformations. These technologies require cloud data centers to process massive volumes of workloads. As a result, the data centers consume gigantic amounts of electrical energy, and a large portion of data center electrical energy comes from fossil fuels. It causes greenhouse gas emissions and thus ensuing in global warming. An adaptive resource utilization mechanism of cloud data center resources is vital to get by with this huge problem. The adaptive system will estimate the resource utilization and then adjust the resources accordingly. Cloud resource utilization estimation is a two-fold challenging task. First, the cloud workloads are sundry, and second, clients&rsquo; requests are uneven. In the literature, several machine learning models have estimated cloud resources, of which artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown better performance. Conventional ANNs have a fixed topology and allow only to train their weights either by back-propagation or neuroevolution such as a genetic algorithm. In this paper, we propose Cartesian genetic programming (CGP) neural network (CGPNN). The CGPNN enhances the performance of conventional ANN by allowing training of both its parameters and topology, and it uses a built-in sliding window. We have trained CGPNN with parallel neuroevolution that searches for global optimum through numerous directions. The resource utilization traces of the Bitbrains data center is used for validation of the proposed CGPNN and compared results with machine learning models from the literature on the same data set. The proposed method has outstripped the machine learning models from the literature and resulted in 97% prediction accuracy.

AB  - This paper compares the operation of a decentralized Nash bargaining traffic signal controller (DNB) to the operation of state-of-the-art adaptive and gating traffic signal control. Perimeter control (gating), based on the network fundamental diagram (NFD), was applied on the borders of a protected urban network (PN) to prevent and/or disperse traffic congestion. The operation of gating control and local adaptive controllers was compared to the operation of the developed DNB traffic signal controller. The controllers were implemented and their performance assessed on a grid network in the INTEGRATION microscopic simulation software. The results show that the DNB controller, although not designed to solve perimeter control problems, successfully prevents congestion from building inside the PN and improves the performance of the entire network. Specifically, the DNB controller outperforms both gating and non-gating controllers, with reductions in the average travel time ranging between 21% and 41%, total delay ranging between 40% and 55%, and emission levels/fuel consumption ranging between 12% and 20%. The results demonstrate statistically significant benefits of using the developed DNB controller over other state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized gating/adaptive traffic signal controllers.

AB  - Predictive maintenance is a field of research that has emerged from the need to improve the systems in place. This research focuses on controlling the degradation of photovoltaic (PV) modules in outdoor solar panels, which are exposed to a variety of climatic loads. Improved reliability, operation, and performance can be achieved through monitoring. In this study, a system capable of predicting the output power of a solar module was implemented. It monitors different parameters and uses automatic learning techniques for prediction. Its use improved reliability, operation, and performance. On the other hand, automatic learning algorithms were evaluated with different metrics in order to optimize and find the best configuration that provides an optimal solution to the problem. With the aim of increasing the share of renewable energy penetration, an architectural proposal based on Edge Computing was included to implement the proposed model into a system. The proposed model is designated for outdoor predictions and offers many advantages, such as monitoring of individual panels, optimization of system response, and speed of communication with the Cloud. The final objective of the work was to contribute to the smart Energy system concept, providing solutions for planning the entire energy system together with the identification of suitable energy infrastructure designs and operational strategies.

AB  - Health 4.0 is an extension of the Industry standard 4.0 which is aimed at the virtualization of health-care services. It employs core technologies and services for integrated management of electronic health records (EHRs), captured through various sensors. The EHR is processed and transmitted to distant experts for better diagnosis and improved healthcare delivery. However, for the successful implementation of Heath 4.0 many challenges do exist. One of the critical issues that needs attention is the security of EHRs in smart health systems. In this work, we have developed a new interpolation scheme capable of providing better quality cover media and supporting reversible EHR embedding. The scheme provides a double layer of security to the EHR by firstly using hyperchaos to encrypt the EHR. The encrypted EHR is reversibly embedded in the cover images produced by the proposed interpolation scheme. The proposed interpolation module has been found to provide better quality interpolated images. The proposed system provides an average peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) of 52.38 dB for a high payload of 0.75 bits per pixel. In addition to embedding EHR, a fragile watermark (WM) is also encrypted using the hyperchaos embedded into the cover image for tamper detection and authentication of the received EHR. Experimental investigations reveal that our scheme provides improved performance for high contrast medical images (MI) when compared to various techniques for evaluation parameters like imperceptibility, reversibility, payload, and computational complexity. Given the attributes of the scheme, it can be used for enhancing the security of EHR in health 4.0.

Smart manufacturing&rsquo;s practical and meaningful design follows data, information, and operational technology through the blockchain, edge computing, and machine learning to develop and facilitate the smart manufacturing system. This process&rsquo;s proposed smart manufacturing system considers the integration of blockchain, edge computing, and machine learning approaches.

VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - While low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies have been studied extensively for a broad spectrum of smart city applications, their potential for water distribution system monitoring in high temporal resolution has not been studied in detail. However, due to their low power demand, these technologies offer new possibilities for operating pressure-monitoring devices for near real-time leak detection in water distribution systems (WDS). By combining long-distance wireless communication with low power consumption, LPWAN technologies promise long periods of maintenance-free device operation without having to rely on an external power source. This is of particular importance for pressure-based leak detection where optimal sensor positions are often located in the periphery of WDS without a suitable power source. To assess the potential of these technologies for replacing widely-used wireless communication technologies for leak detection, GPRS is compared with the LPWAN standards Narrowband IoT, long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) and Sigfox. Based on sampling and transmission rates commonly applied in leak detection, the ability of these three technologies to replace GPRS is analyzed based on a self-developed low-power pressure-monitoring device and a simplified, linear energy-consumption model. The results indicate that even though some of the analyzed LPWAN technologies may suffer from contractual and technical limitations, all of them offer viable alternatives, meeting the requirements of leak detection in WDS. In accordance with existing research on data transmission with these technologies, the findings of this work show that even while retaining a compact design, which entails a limited battery capacity, pressure-monitoring devices can exceed runtimes of 5 years, as required for installation at water meters in Austria. Thus, LPWAN technologies have the potential to advance the wide application of near real-time, pressure-based leak detection in WDS, while simultaneously reducing the cost of device operation significantly.

AB  - The purpose of this review is to provide insight and a comparison of the current status of district heating (DH) systems for selected Baltic Sea countries (Denmark, Germany, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden), especially from viewpoints of application and solutions of novel smart asset management (SAM) approaches. Furthermore, this paper considers European projects ongoing from 2016, involving participants from the Baltic Sea Region, concerning various aspects of DH systems. The review presents the energy sources with particular attention to renewable energy sources (RES), district heating generations, and the exploitation problems of DH systems. The essential point is a comparison of traditional maintenance systems versus SAM solutions for optimal design, operating conditions, and controlling of the DH networks. The main conclusions regarding DH systems in Baltic Sea countries are commitment towards a transition to 4th generation DH, raising the quality and efficiency of heat supply systems, and simultaneously minimizing the costs. The overall trends show that applied technologies aim to increase the share of renewable energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, examples presented in this review underline the importance of the implementation of a smart asset management concept to modern DH systems.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, there has been a massive increase in the amount of Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as the data generated by such devices. The participating devices in IoT networks can be problematic due to their resource-constrained nature, and integrating security on these devices is often overlooked. This has resulted in attackers having an increased incentive to target IoT devices. As the number of attacks possible on a network increases, it becomes more difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) to cope with these attacks efficiently. In this paper, we highlight several machine learning (ML) methods such as k-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and logistic regression (LR) that can be used in IDS. In this work, ML algorithms are compared for both binary and multi-class classification on Bot-IoT dataset. Based on several parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss, we experimentally compared the aforementioned ML algorithms. In the case of HTTP distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the accuracy of RF is 99%. Furthermore, other simulation results-based precision, recall, F1 score, and log loss metric reveal that RF outperforms on all types of attacks in binary classification. However, in multi-class classification, KNN outperforms other ML algorithms with an accuracy of 99%, which is 4% higher than RF.

AB  - Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) applications have been increasingly deployed in smart domains, such as homes, buildings, and so on. A wide variety of smart devices and solutions bring improved lifestyles. However, current provider-oriented and individual application deployment leads to the separation of a smart domain into respective regions by providers and applications. Such heterogeneous environments hinder unified operation and the utilization of smart IoT applications. Therefore, this Article firstly addresses analyses on conventional smart domain technologies&mdash;smart home, smart building, etc.&mdash; and deployment in the real world with heterogeneous IoT technologies; then, a novel smart domain strategy for inter-cloud and inter-service operability and mobile-user-attached interactivity is proposed. Performance is compared in terms of user experience and service availability. Finally, numeric analyses are provided to prove the proposed strategy, and the proof-of-concept is presented to show feasibility and performances.

AB  - The modern control infrastructure that manages and monitors the communication between the smart machines represents the most effective way to increase the efficiency of the industrial environment, such as smart grids. The cyber-physical systems utilize the embedded software and internet to connect and control the smart machines that are addressed by the internet of things (IoT). These cyber-physical systems are the basis of the fourth industrial revolution which is indexed by industry 4.0. In particular, industry 4.0 relies heavily on the IoT and smart sensors such as smart energy meters. The reliability and security represent the main challenges that face the industry 4.0 implementation. This paper introduces a new infrastructure based on machine learning to analyze and monitor the output data of the smart meters to investigate if this data is real data or fake. The fake data are due to the hacking and the inefficient meters. The industrial environment affects the efficiency of the meters by temperature, humidity, and noise signals. Furthermore, the proposed infrastructure validates the amount of data loss via communication channels and the internet connection. The decision tree is utilized as an effective machine learning algorithm to carry out both regression and classification for the meters&rsquo; data. The data monitoring is carried based on the industrial digital twins&rsquo; platform. The proposed infrastructure results provide a reliable and effective industrial decision that enhances the investments in industry 4.0.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Improving road safety through artificial intelligence is now crucial to achieving more secure smart cities. With this objective, a mobile app based on the integration of the smartphone sensors and a fuzzy logic strategy to determine the pedestrian&rsquo;s crossing intention around crosswalks is presented. The app developed also allows the calculation, tracing and guidance of safe routes thanks to an optimization algorithm that includes pedestrian areas on the paths generated over the whole city through a cloud database (i.e., zebra crossings, pedestrian streets and walkways). The experimentation carried out consisted in testing the fuzzy logic strategy with a total of 31 volunteers crossing and walking around a crosswalk. For that, the fuzzy logic approach was subjected to a total of 3120 samples generated by the volunteers. It has been proven that a smartphone can be successfully used as a crossing intention detector system with an accuracy of 98.63%, obtaining a true positive rate of 98.27% and a specificity of 99.39% according to a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Finally, a total of 30 routes were calculated by the proposed algorithm and compared with Google Maps considering the values of time, distance and safety along the routes. As a result, the routes generated by the proposed algorithm were safer than the routes obtained with Google Maps, achieving an increase in the use of safe pedestrian areas of at least 183%.

We contribute to the literature on sustainable cyber-physical production systems by showing that the technological and operations management features of cyber-physical systems constitute the components of data-driven sustainable smart manufacturing. Throughout September 2020, we performed a quantitative literature review of the Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases, with search terms including &ldquo;sustainable industrial value creation&rdquo;, &ldquo;cyber-physical production systems&rdquo;, &ldquo;sustainable smart manufacturing&rdquo;, &ldquo;smart economy&rdquo;, &ldquo;industrial big data analytics&rdquo;, &ldquo;sustainable Internet of Things&rdquo;, and &ldquo;sustainable Industry 4.0&rdquo;. As we inspected research published only in 2019 and 2020, only 323 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria. By eliminating controversial findings, outcomes unsubstantiated by replication, too imprecise material, or having similar titles, we decided upon 119, generally empirical, sources. Future research should investigate whether Industry 4.0-based manufacturing technologies can ensure the sustainability of big data-driven production systems by use of Internet of Things sensing networks and deep learning-assisted smart process planning.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Assuring the safety of automated vehicles is essential for their timely introduction and acceptance by policymakers and the public. To assess their safe design and robust decision making in response to all possible scenarios, new methods that use a scenario-based testing approach are needed, as testing on public roads in normal traffic would require driving millions of kilometres. We make use of the scenario-based testing approach and propose a method to model simulated scenarios using Gaussian Process based models to predict untested scenario outcomes. This enables us to efficiently determine the performance boundary, where the safe and unsafe scenarios can be evidently distinguished from each other. We present an iterative method that optimises the parameter space of a logical scenario towards the most critical scenarios on this performance boundary. Additionally, we conduct a novel probabilistic sensitivity analysis by efficiently computing several variance-based sensitivity indices using the Gaussian Process models and evaluate the relative importance of the scenario input parameters on the scenario outcome. We critically evaluate and investigate the usefulness of the proposed Gaussian Process based approach as a very efficient surrogate model, which can model the logical scenarios effectively in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied on an exemplary logical scenario and shows viability in finding concrete critical scenarios. The reported results, derived from the proposed approach, could pave the way to more efficient testing of automated vehicles and instruct further physical tests on the determined critical scenarios.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Herein, we proposed a multi-scale multi-band dilated time-frequency densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) with long short-term memory (LSTM) for audio source separation. Because the spectrogram of the acoustic signal can be thought of as images as well as time series data, it is suitable for convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) architecture. We improved the audio source separation performance by applying the dilated block with a dilated convolution to CRNN architecture. The dilated block has the role of effectively increasing the receptive field in the spectrogram. In addition, it was designed in consideration of the acoustic characteristics that the frequency axis and the time axis in the spectrogram are changed by independent influences such as speech rate and pitch. In speech enhancement experiments, we estimated the speech signal using various deep learning architectures from a signal in which the music, noise, and speech were mixed. We conducted the subjective evaluation on the estimated speech signal. In addition, speech quality, intelligibility, separation, and speech recognition performance were also measured. In music signal separation, we estimated the music signal using several deep learning architectures from the mixture of the music and speech signal. After that, the separation performance and music identification accuracy were measured using the estimated music signal. Overall, the proposed architecture shows the best performance compared to other deep learning architectures not only in speech experiments but also in music experiments.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The development of the smart city concept and inhabitants&rsquo; need to reduce travel time, in addition to society&rsquo;s awareness of the importance of reducing fuel consumption and respecting the environment, have led to a new approach to the classic travelling salesman problem (TSP) applied to urban environments. This problem can be formulated as &ldquo;Given a list of geographic points and the distances between each pair of points, what is the shortest possible route that visits each point and returns to the departure point?&rdquo;. At present, with the development of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and increased capabilities of sensors, a large amount of data and measurements are available, allowing researchers to model accurately the routes to choose. In this work, the aim is to provide a solution to the TSP in smart city environments using a modified version of the metaheuristic optimization algorithm Teacher Learner Based Optimization (TLBO). In addition, to improve performance, the solution is implemented by means of a parallel graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture, specifically a Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) implementation.

TI  - Integrating Speculation Detection and Deep Learning to Extract Lung Cancer Diagnosis from Clinical Notes

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Despite efforts to develop models for extracting medical concepts from clinical notes, there are still some challenges in particular to be able to relate concepts to dates. The high number of clinical notes written for each single patient, the use of negation, speculation, and different date formats cause ambiguity that has to be solved to reconstruct the patient&rsquo;s natural history. In this paper, we concentrate on extracting from clinical narratives the cancer diagnosis and relating it to the diagnosis date. To address this challenge, a hybrid approach that combines deep learning-based and rule-based methods is proposed. The approach integrates three steps: (i) lung cancer named entity recognition, (ii) negation and speculation detection, and (iii) relating the cancer diagnosis to a valid date. In particular, we apply the proposed approach to extract the lung cancer diagnosis and its diagnosis date from clinical narratives written in Spanish. Results obtained show an F-score of 90% in the named entity recognition task, and a 89% F-score in the task of relating the cancer diagnosis to the diagnosis date. Our findings suggest that speculation detection is together with negation detection a key component to properly extract cancer diagnosis from clinical notes.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Security in IoT networks is currently mandatory, due to the high amount of data that has to be handled. These systems are vulnerable to several cybersecurity attacks, which are increasing in number and sophistication. Due to this reason, new intrusion detection techniques have to be developed, being as accurate as possible for these scenarios. Intrusion detection systems based on machine learning algorithms have already shown a high performance in terms of accuracy. This research proposes the study and evaluation of several preprocessing techniques based on traffic categorization for a machine learning neural network algorithm. This research uses for its evaluation two benchmark datasets, namely UGR16 and the UNSW-NB15, and one of the most used datasets, KDD99. The preprocessing techniques were evaluated in accordance with scalar and normalization functions. All of these preprocessing models were applied through different sets of characteristics based on a categorization composed by four groups of features: basic connection features, content characteristics, statistical characteristics and finally, a group which is composed by traffic-based features and connection direction-based traffic characteristics. The objective of this research is to evaluate this categorization by using various data preprocessing techniques to obtain the most accurate model. Our proposal shows that, by applying the categorization of network traffic and several preprocessing techniques, the accuracy can be enhanced by up to 45%. The preprocessing of a specific group of characteristics allows for greater accuracy, allowing the machine learning algorithm to correctly classify these parameters related to possible attacks.

AB  - The use of spatial data for coastal community resilience applications has diversified as a consequence of the increasing availability of data, and extensive development in data processing. However, the true value of spatial data is not fully exploited as a result of lacking scientific managerial models that incorporate spatial data into decision-making. This article synthesizes the cross-disciplinary literature review on deploying spatial data for coastal community resilience from the managerial perspective. It systematically reviews research addressing the topic of deploying spatial data for coastal resilience operations from the earliest available to 1999. The review uses 142 studies to address three research questions: (1) What kind of data can be obtained for coastal resilience situational awareness? (2) What outcomes have spatial data attributed to coastal resilience applications? and (3) What are the missing pieces (gaps) in connecting the spatial data with coastal resilience applications? In addressing these research questions, the authors review articles based on three dimensions including the availability of spatial data, the availability of applications, and limitations. Based on the findings of the analysis, the authors conclude that the managerial perspective of deploying spatial data in coastal hazards are understudies, and outline problem formulation, mission prioritization, and information salience as an agenda for future research.

AB  - An urban environment defines a specific micro-climate which directly affects the quality of life in urbanized areas and often has a negative impact on urban populations. Phenomena like urban heat and surface heat islands are direct products of an urban lifestyle. Urban meteorological networks (UMNs) are a tool that can help to better understand and analyze the current situation and make the right decisions about future urban development. Deployed to monitor and record different objects and their states inside urban areas, UMNs build a long-term meteorological data time series database. The most commonly used systems for achieving this goal include wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This paper presents a combined experience in deploying three different WSN systems. During seven years of research in this field, the authors have recognized the importance of data reliability in data acquisition. More importantly, due to the lack of research addressing the reliability of the data received from WSNs by the core segment of the server (processes used in receiving, validating, parsing, and storing data into a database instance), the received data are used in scientific studies without questioning their reliability. To determine the possibility of shifting information provided by the data measured from sensor networks before it is stored in a desired form of database, this paper proposes a highly reliable socket server model. The model is built with high reliability and performance in mind and it includes three major processes, which use a combination of signals and control messages to pass information about their states. A case study is performed using high-end hardware, running a Linux operating system stressed to its limits. Repetition testing revealed inconsistency in the information provided by the operating system to the application layer, which could lead to the loss of information about short-term and rarely occurring monitored objects. The results lead to the conclusion that there is a clear need for a higher level of data reliability in the process of data acquisition by UMNs. The proposed socket server should fill this gap within the server&rsquo;s core segment.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Forestry 4.0 is inspired by the Industry 4.0 concept, which plays a vital role in the next industrial generation revolution. It is ushering in a new era for efficient and sustainable forest management. Environmental sustainability and climate change are related challenges to promote sustainable forest management of natural resources. Internet of Forest Things (IoFT) is an emerging technology that helps manage forest sustainability and protect forest from hazards via distributing smart devices for gathering data stream during monitoring and detecting fire. Stream processing is a well-known research area, and recently, it has gained a further significance due to the emergence of IoFT devices. Distributed stream processing platforms have emerged, e.g., Apache Flink, Storm, and Spark, etc. Querying windowing is the heart of any stream-processing platform which splits infinite data stream into chunks of finite data to execute a query. Dynamic query window-based processing can reduce the reporting time in case of missing and delayed events caused by data drift.In this paper, we present a novel dynamic mechanism to recommend the optimal window size and type based on the dynamic context of IoFT application. In particular, we designed a dynamic window selector for stream queries considering input stream data characteristics, application workload and resource constraints to recommend the optimal stream query window configuration. A research gap on the likelihood of adopting smart IoFT devices in environmental sustainability indicates a lack of empirical studies to pursue forest sustainability, i.e., sustainable forestry applications. So, we focus on forest fire management and detection as a use case of Forestry 4.0, one of the dynamic environmental management challenges, i.e., climate change, to deliver sustainable forestry goals. According to the dynamic window selector&rsquo;s experimental results, end-to-end latency time for the reported fire alerts has been reduced by dynamical adaptation of window size with IoFT stream rate changes.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Wastage of perishable and non-perishable products due to manual monitoring in shopping malls creates huge revenue loss in supermarket industry. Besides, internal and external factors such as calendar events and weather condition contribute to excess wastage of products in different regions of supermarket. It is a challenging job to know about the wastage of the products manually in different supermarkets region-wise. Therefore, the supermarket management needs to take appropriate decision and action to prevent the wastage of products. The fog computing data centers located in each region can collect, process and analyze data for demand prediction and decision making. In this paper, a product-demand prediction model is designed using integrated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means Unsupervised Learning (UL) algorithms and a decision making model is developed using State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. Our proposed method can cluster the products into low, medium, and high-demand product by learning from the designed features. Taking the derived cluster model, decision making for distributing low-demand to high-demand product can be made using SARSA. Experimental results show that our proposed method can cluster the datasets well with a Silhouette score of &ge;60%. Besides, our adopted SARSA-based decision making model outperforms over Q-Learning, Monte-Carlo, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Actor-Critic algorithms in terms of maximum cumulative reward, average cumulative reward and execution time.

SN  - 2073-445X

AB  - Urban centers are expanding rapidly due to quickly-increasing population which results in microclimate change due to lack of urban planning. Factors like degradation of green areas, trees, and vegetation are defining a new regime of urban environment giving rise to a lack of drinking water and lowering water tables. Consequently, unplanned urban sprawl with all its varied facets is having adverse impacts on the environment. Rapid variations in some of its climatic factors in the immediate vicinity are alarming and need to redress at war footings. This paper is an endeavor to present a hypothesis that urban sprawl plays a vital role in impacting and the influencing the microclimate of the city or the area. In this research, geospatial approaches were adopted to identify urban sprawl. Rise in land surface temperature (LST) for the last 25 years (from 1990 to 2016) has been highlighted using Landsat (5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 TIRS) satellite images. Weather data collected from Meteorological Department is used to identify temperature rising trends. Result of the research clearly indicates that rapid urban sprawl has adverse impacts on microclimate by increasing LST. Built-up area has been changed from 178 to 477 sq. km within the years of 1990 to 2016. Vegetated area has decreased from 770 to 602 sq. km. Water areas have been decreased from 524 to 360 sq. km within the span of last 26 years. The bare land has increased from 494 sq. km to 742 sq. km. LST in winters has risen from 17 &deg;C to 23 &deg;C and at times shot up to 31 &deg;C, which is alarming. Annual mean air temperature increased by 3 &deg;C to 4 &deg;C from the 1980s to 2016. During summers, the average air temperature rose to a startling 33 &deg;C from 28 &deg;C and LST has had a steady rise from 28.4 &deg;C to 35 &deg;C. The alarming urban sprawl in relation to temperature rise warrants measures which are required to plan the urban planning, forestation, and ecological measures to mitigate the disastrous trends which may result in flash floods, landslides, soil erosion and sediment transport endangering downstream reservoirs, water quality and depletion in ground water table in the valley.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Urban functional zones are important space carriers for urban economic and social function. The accurate and rapid identification of urban functional zones is of great significance to urban planning and resource allocation. However, the factors considered in the existing functional zone identification methods are not comprehensive enough, and the recognition of functional zones stops at their categories. This paper proposes a framework that combines multisource heterogeneous data to identify the categories of functional zones and draw the portraits of functional zones. The framework comprehensively describes the features of functional zones from four aspects: building-level metrics, landscape metrics, semantic metrics, and human activity metrics, and uses a combination of ensemble learning and active learning to balance the identification accuracy of functional zones and the labeling cost during large-scale generalization. Furthermore, sentiment analysis, word cloud analysis, and land cover proportion maps are added to the portraits of typical functional zones to make the image of functional zones vivid. The experiment carried out within the Fifth Ring Road, Haidian District, Beijing, shows that the overall accuracy of the method reached 82.37% and the portraits of the four typical functional zones are clear. The method in this paper has good repeatability and generalization, which is helpful to carry out quantitative and objective research on urban functional zones.

AB  - The proliferation of smart devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks creates significant security challenges for the communications between such devices. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed technology that can potentially tackle the security problems within the 5G-enabled IoT networks. This paper proposes a Multi layer Blockchain Security model to protect IoT networks while simplifying the implementation. The concept of clustering is utilized in order to facilitate the multi-layer architecture. The K-unknown clusters are defined within the IoT network by applying techniques that utillize a hybrid Evolutionary Computation Algorithm while using Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms. The chosen cluster heads are responsible for local authentication and authorization. Local private blockchain implementation facilitates communications between the cluster heads and relevant base stations. Such a blockchain enhances credibility assurance and security while also providing a network authentication mechanism. The open-source Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain platform is deployed for the proposed model development. Base stations adopt a global blockchain approach to communicate with each other securely. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm performs well when compared to the earlier reported approaches. The proposed lightweight blockchain model is also shown to be better suited to balance network latency and throughput as compared to a traditional global blockchain.

AB  - A successful e-participation campaign in urban planning relies on good two-way communication between the expert and the citizen. While the presentation of information from planners to citizens is one concern of that topic, we address in this paper the question of how citizens&rsquo; inputs can be evaluated for map-based e-participation tools. The interest is, on the one side, in the usefulness of the input for the planner and, on the other side, in performing a quick assessment which can provide feedback to the participant via the tool&rsquo;s interface. We use a test dataset that was acquired with an online city planning tool that uses 3D geometries and develop analysis methods from it that can also be generalized for other map-based e-participation tools. These analysis methods are meant to be applied to large datasets and to enhance e-participation methods in urban planning and design to citizen (design) science approaches. The methods range from the calculation of simple parameters and heatmaps over clustering to point pattern analysis. We evaluate the presented approaches by their computation time and their usefulness for the planner and non-expert citizen and investigate their potential to serve as a composite analysis. We found that functions of the point pattern analysis reveal relevant information of the users&rsquo; inputs but require a simplified presentation. We introduce a spatial dispersion index as an example to present the relations between objects in a clear way.

AB  - As a dynamic way to raise funds for professional and private projects in recent years, crowdfunding has made tremendous progress, especially through online platforms. However, research on this subject is still young, leaving room for different perspectives. We therefore approach the marketing mix adaptability of online crowdfunding platforms and its impact on campaign efficiency and company strategy in two major economies: Germany and China. With the help of case examples based on secondary data, we performed an in-depth analysis of the 4E marketing mix benefits on crowdfunding, highlighting best practice approaches. We critically discuss the 4Es marketing mix approach, focusing on experience, value exchange, and marketing scales, and clarify the compatibility between crowdfunding and 4Es to better understand how these theories are applied to crowdfunding activities. As a result, the suitability of the 4E marketing mix adapted to crowdfunding needs is shown. From a market-oriented perspective, managers of crowdfunding platforms, as well as project owners from Germany and China, will be better able to attract their target audience by applying the 4E adaptation provided.

AB  - The extensive proliferation of urban transit cards and smartphones has witnessed the feasibility of the collection of citywide travel behaviors and the estimation of traffic status in real-time. In this paper, an urban public traffic dynamic network based on the cyber-physical-social system (CPSS-UPTDN) is proposed as a universal framework for advanced public transportation systems, which can optimize the urban public transportation based on big data and AI methods. Firstly, we introduce three modules and two loops which composes of the novel framework. Then, the key technologies in CPSS-UPTDN are studied, especially collecting and analyzing traffic information by big data and AI methods, and a particular implementation of CPSS-UPTDN is discussed, namely the artificial system, computational experiments, and parallel execution (ACP) method. Finally, a case study is performed. The data sources include both traffic congestion data from physical space and cellular data from social space, which can improve the prediction performance for traffic status. Furthermore, the service quality of urban public transportation can be promoted by optimizing the bus dispatching based on the parallel execution in our framework.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In December 2016, the wastewater treatment plant of Baarle-Nassau, Netherlands, failed. The failure was caused by the illegal disposal of high volumes of acidic waste into the sewer network. Repairs cost between 80,000 and 100,000 EUR. A continuous monitoring system of a utility network such as this one would help to determine the causes of such pollution and could mitigate or reduce the impact of these kinds of events in the future. We have designed and tested a data fusion system that transforms the time-series of sensor measurements into an array of source-localized discharge events. The data fusion system performs this transformation as follows. First, the time-series of sensor measurements are resampled and converted to sensor observations in a unified discrete time domain. Second, sensor observations are mapped to pollutant detections that indicate the amount of specific pollutants according to a priori knowledge. Third, pollutant detections are used for inferring the propagation of the discharged pollutant downstream of the sewage network to account for missing sensor observations. Fourth, pollutant detections and inferred sensor observations are clustered to form tracks. Finally, tracks are processed and propagated upstream to form the final list of probable events. A set of experiments was performed using a modified variant of the EPANET Example Network 2. Results of our experiments show that the proposed system can narrow down the source of pollution to seven or fewer nodes, depending on the number of sensors, while processing approximately 100 sensor observations per second. Having considered the results, such a system could provide meaningful information about pollution events in utility networks.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Smart Cities (or Cities 2.0) are an evolution in citizen habitation. In such cities, transport commuting is changing rapidly with the proliferation of contemporary vehicular technology. New models of vehicle ride sharing systems are changing the way citizens commute in their daily movement schedule. The use of a private vehicle per single passenger transportation is no longer viable in sustainable Smart Cities (SC) because of the vehicles&rsquo; resource allocation and urban pollution. The current research on car ride sharing systems is widely expanding in a range of contemporary technologies, however, without covering a multidisciplinary approach. In this paper, the focus is on performing a multidisciplinary research on car riding systems taking into consideration personalized user mobility behavior by providing next destination prediction as well as a recommender system based on riders&rsquo; personalized information. Specifically, it proposes a predictive vehicle ride sharing system for commuting, which has impact on the SC green ecosystem. The adopted system also provides a recommendation to citizens to select the persons they would like to commute with. An Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled weighted pattern matching model is used to assess user movement behavior in SC and provide the best predicted recommendation list of commuting users. Citizens are then able to engage a current trip to next destination with the more suitable user provided by the list. An experimented is conducted with real data from the municipality of New Philadelphia, in SC of Athens, Greece, to implement the proposed system and observe certain user movement behavior. The results are promising for the incorporation of the adopted system to other SCs.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) demand technologies so they can not only fly autonomously, but also communicate with base stations, flight controllers, computers, devices, or even other UAVs. Still, UAVs usually operate within unlicensed spectrum bands, competing against the increasing number of mobile devices and other wireless networks. Combining UAVs with Cognitive Radio (CR) may increase their general communication performance, thus allowing them to execute missions where the conventional UAVs face limitations. CR provides a smart wireless communication which, instead of using a transmission frequency defined in the hardware, uses software transmission. CR smartly uses free transmission channels and/or chooses them according to application&rsquo;s requirements. Moreover, CR is considered a key enabler for deploying technologies that require high connectivity, such as Smart Cities, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and the Internet of Flying Things (IoFT). This paper presents an overview on the field of CR for UAV communications and its state-of-the-art, testbed alternatives for real data experiments, as well as specifications to build a simple and low-cost testbed, and indicates key opportunities and future challenges in the field.

AB  - This paper compares and contrasts three disruptive models of potential and actual new kinds of spatial planning. These include “seasteading”, “smart neighbourhoods” and “renewable spatial systems”. Each is labelled with distinctive discursive titles, respectively: “Attention Capitalism”; “Surveillance Capitalism” and “Sustainable Capitalism” denoting the different lineaments of each, although they all have their origins in the Silicon Valley techno-entrepreneurial milieu. In each case, while the path dependences of trajectories have diverged the progenitors were often erstwhile business partners at the outset. The paper is interested in qualitative methodology and proposes “pattern recognition” as a means to disclose the deep psychological, sociological, political and economic levels that inform the surface appearances and functions of the diverse spatial planning modes and designs that have been advanced or inferred from empirically observable initiator practice. “Dark Triad” analysis is entailed in actualising psychological deep structures. Each of the three models is discussed and the lineaments of their initiators’ ideas are disclosed. Each “school” has a designated mentor(s), respectively: academic B. J. Fogg and venture capitalist Peter Thiel for “Attention Capitalism”, “smart city” planner Dan Doctoroff for “Surveillance Capitalism” and “renewable energineer” and Elon Musk for “Sustainable Capitalism”, the eventual winner of this existential “dark versus light triad” urban planning contest.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Improvements in the science of health monitoring and maintenance have facilitated the observation of damage and defects in existing structures and infrastructures, such as bridges and railways. The need to extend sensing technology through the use of wireless sensors as well as the lack of description tools for understanding, visualizing, and documenting sensor outputs has encouraged researchers to use powerful tools such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) systems. BIM has become important because of conducting tools widely used in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry to present and manage information on structural systems and situations. Since combining health monitoring and maintenance results with BIM models is a new field of study, and most projects utilize various aspects of it, we have conducted a review of important work related to this subject published from 2010 to November of 2020. After reviewing 278 journal articles, research trends, approaches, methods, gaps, and future agenda related to BIM in monitoring and maintenance were highlighted. This paper, through a bibliometric and content analysis, concludes that besides main improvements, some limitations now exist which affect the modeling and maintenance process. These limitations are related to extending the IFC schema, optimizing sensor data, interoperability among various BIM platforms, optimization of various sensing technologies for fault detection and management of huge amounts of data, besides consideration of environmental effects on monitoring hazards and underground objects. Finally, this paper aims to help to solve the mentioned limitation through a comprehensive review of existing research.

AB  - With the advances in sensor technology, big data, and artificial intelligence, unobtrusive in-home health monitoring has been a research focus for decades. Following up our research on smart vehicles, within the framework of unobtrusive health monitoring in private spaces, this work attempts to provide a guide to current sensor technology for unobtrusive in-home monitoring by a literature review of the state of the art and to answer, in particular, the questions: (1) What types of sensors can be used for unobtrusive in-home health data acquisition? (2) Where should the sensors be placed? (3) What data can be monitored in a smart home? (4) How can the obtained data support the monitoring functions? We conducted a retrospective literature review and summarized the state-of-the-art research on leveraging sensor technology for unobtrusive in-home health monitoring. For structured analysis, we developed a four-category terminology (location, unobtrusive sensor, data, and monitoring functions). We acquired 912 unique articles from four relevant databases (ACM Digital Lib, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Scopus) and screened them for relevance, resulting in n=55 papers analyzed in a structured manner using the terminology. The results delivered 25 types of sensors (motion sensor, contact sensor, pressure sensor, electrical current sensor, etc.) that can be deployed within rooms, static facilities, or electric appliances in an ambient way. While behavioral data (e.g., presence (n=38), time spent on activities (n=18)) can be acquired effortlessly, physiological parameters (e.g., heart rate, respiratory rate) are measurable on a limited scale (n=5). Behavioral data contribute to functional monitoring. Emergency monitoring can be built up on behavioral and environmental data. Acquired physiological parameters allow reasonable monitoring of physiological functions to a limited extent. Environmental data and behavioral data also detect safety and security abnormalities. Social interaction monitoring relies mainly on direct monitoring of tools of communication (smartphone; computer). In summary, convincing proof of a clear effect of these monitoring functions on clinical outcome with a large sample size and long-term monitoring is still lacking.

AB  - Spatiotemporal prediction of crime is crucial for public safety and smart cities operation. As crime incidents are distributed sparsely across space and time, existing deep-learning methods constrained by coarse spatial scale offer only limited values in prediction of crime density. This paper proposes the use of deep inception-residual networks (DIRNet) to conduct fine-grained, theft-related crime prediction based on non-emergency service request data (311 events). Specifically, it outlines the employment of inception units comprising asymmetrical convolution layers to draw low-level spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in crime events and complaint records in the 311 dataset. Afterward, this paper details how residual units can be applied to capture high-level spatiotemporal features from low-level spatiotemporal dependencies for the final prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed DIRNet is evaluated based on theft-related crime data and 311 data in New York City from 2010 to 2015. The results confirm that the DIRNet obtains an average F1 of 71%, which is better than other prediction models.

AB  - Co-working spaces (CWSs) have emerged as a distinctive phenomenon in the sharing economy. They are collaborative environments that feed innovation and creativity under the slogan &ldquo;working alone together&rdquo;. While policy makers and scholars were optimistic about their role in promoting entrepreneurial endeavours and fostering growth, the spread of the COVID-19 across the world has drastically changed the way we work, communicate, and navigate daily life. This study offers a comprehensive review of the existing literature on CWSs. To do so, a bibliometric analysis is proposed, combining the use of traditional bibliometric tools with science mapping techniques. A total of 118 documents are reviewed and the results are presented at two different levels: (1) descriptive analysis of the status of the research on a CWS and (2) its conceptual structure (topics and trends). The study concludes with some directions for future research. Specifically, based on the recurrent topics discussed up to date in the literature, it is possible to identify four key areas&mdash;i.e., geographical location, physical space, business models and inclusive communities&mdash;that are promising for research and that may bring useful insights for defining co-working&rsquo;s place in a post-pandemic society.

AB  - With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), many different smart home technologies are commercially available. However, the adoption of such technologies is slow as many of them are not cost-effective and focus on specific functions such as energy efficiency. Recently, IoT devices and sensors have been designed to enhance the quality of personal life by having the capability to generate continuous data streams that can be used to monitor and make inferences by the user. While smart home devices connect to the home Wi-Fi network, there are still compatibility issues between devices from different manufacturers. Smart devices get even smarter when they can communicate with and control each other. The information collected by one device can be shared with others for achieving an enhanced automation of their operations. This paper proposes a non-intrusive approach of integrating and collecting data from open standard IoT devices for personalised smart home automation using big data analytics and machine learning. We demonstrate the implementation of our proposed novel technology instantiation approach for achieving non-intrusive IoT based big data analytics with a use case of a smart home environment. We employ open-source frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache NiFi and FB-Prophet along with popular vendor tech-stacks such as Azure and DataBricks.

AB  - Energy consumption in buildings depends on the local climate, building characteristics, and user behavior. Focusing on user interaction, this research work developed a novel approach to monitoring and interaction with local users by providing in situ context information through graphic descriptions of energy consumption and indoor/outdoor environment parameters: temperature, luminosity, and humidity, which are routinely measured in real-time and stored to identify consumption patterns and other savings actions. To involve local users, collected data are represented in 3D color representation using building 3d models. A simplified color scale depicts environmental comfort (low/comfortable/high temperature/relative humidity) and energy consumption (above/below usual patterns). We found that these indices induced user commitment and increased their engagement and participation in saving actions like turning off lights and better management of air conditioning systems.

TI  - Transfer Learning by Similarity Centred Architecture Evolution for Multiple Residential Load Forecasting
T2  - Smart Cities

PY  - 2021
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - The development from traditional low voltage grids to smart systems has become extensive and adopted worldwide. Expanding the demand response program to cover the residential sector raises a wide range of challenges. Short term load forecasting for residential consumers in a neighbourhood could lead to a better understanding of low voltage consumption behaviour. Nevertheless, users with similar characteristics can present diversity in consumption patterns. Consequently, transfer learning methods have become a useful tool to tackle differences among residential time series. This paper proposes a method combining evolutionary algorithms for neural architecture search with transfer learning to perform short term load forecasting in a neighbourhood with multiple household load consumption. The approach centres its efforts on neural architecture search using evolutionary algorithms. The neural architecture evolution process retains the patterns of the centre-most house, and later the architecture weights are adjusted for each house in a multihouse set from a neighbourhood. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure model performance. Experimental results on a large dataset containing hourly load consumption for ten houses in London, Ontario showed that the performance of the proposed approach performs better than the compared techniques. Moreover, the proposed method presents the average accuracy performance of 3.17 points higher than the state-of-the-art LSTM one shot method.

AB  - The need for effective freight and human transportation systems has consistently increased during the last decades, mainly due to factors such as globalization, e-commerce activities, and mobility requirements. Traditionally, transportation systems have been designed with the main goal of reducing their monetary cost while offering a specified quality of service. During the last decade, however, sustainability concepts are also being considered as a critical component of transportation systems, i.e., the environmental and social impact of transportation activities have to be taken into account when managers and policy makers design and operate modern transportation systems, whether these refer to long-distance carriers or to metropolitan areas. This paper reviews the existing work on different scientific methodologies that are being used to promote Sustainable Transportation Systems (STS), including simulation, optimization, machine learning, and fuzzy sets. This paper discusses how each of these methodologies have been employed to design and efficiently operate STS. In addition, the paper also provides a classification of common challenges, best practices, future trends, and open research lines that might be useful for both researchers and practitioners.

This paper poses a research question and introduces a corresponding systematic literature review, focusing on machine learning techniques’ contributions applied to bike-sharing systems to improve cities’ mobility. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method was adopted to identify specific factors that influence bike-sharing systems, resulting in an analysis of 35 papers published between 2015 and 2019, creating an outline for future research. By means of systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis, machine learning algorithms were identified in two groups: classification and prediction.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Forecasting energy demand within a distribution network is essential for developing strategies to manage and optimize available energy resources and the associated infrastructure. In this study, we consider remote communities in the Arctic located at the end of the radial distribution network without alternative energy supply. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an accurate forecasting model to manage and optimize the limited energy resources available. We first compare the accuracy of several models that perform short-and medium-term load forecasts in rural areas, where a single industrial customer dominates the electricity consumption. We consider both statistical methods and machine learning models to predict energy demand. Then, we evaluate the transferability of each method to a geographical rural area different from the one considered for training. Our results indicate that statistical models achieve higher accuracy on longer forecast horizons relative to neural networks, while the machine-learning approaches perform better in predicting load at shorter time intervals. The machine learning models also exhibit good transferability, as they manage to predict well the load at new locations that were not accounted for during training. Our work will serve as a guide for selecting the appropriate prediction model and apply it to perform energy load forecasting in rural areas and in locations where historical consumption data may be limited or even not available.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Worldwide, energy consumption and saving represent the main challenges for all sectors, most importantly in industrial and domestic sectors. The internet of things (IoT) is a new technology that establishes the core of Industry 4.0. The IoT enables the sharing of signals between devices and machines via the internet. Besides, the IoT system enables the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to manage and control the signals between different machines based on intelligence decisions. The paper’s innovation is to introduce a deep learning and IoT based approach to control the operation of air conditioners in order to reduce energy consumption. To achieve such an ambitious target, we have proposed a deep learning-based people detection system utilizing the YOLOv3 algorithm to count the number of persons in a specific area. Accordingly, the operation of the air conditioners could be optimally managed in a smart building. Furthermore, the number of persons and the status of the air conditioners are published via the internet to the dashboard of the IoT platform. The proposed system enhances decision making about energy consumption. To affirm the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed approach, intensive test scenarios are simulated in a specific smart building considering the existence of air conditioners. The simulation results emphasize that the proposed deep learning-based recognition algorithm can accurately detect the number of persons in the specified area, thanks to its ability to model highly non-linear relationships in data. The detection status can also be successfully published on the dashboard of the IoT platform. Another vital application of the proposed promising approach is in the remote management of diverse controllable devices.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Accurate air quality monitoring requires processing of multi-dimensional, multi-location sensor data, which has previously been considered in centralised machine learning models. These are often unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this article, we address this challenge by: (1) designing a novel hybrid deep learning model for hourly PM2.5 pollutant prediction; (2) optimising the obtained model for edge devices; and (3) examining model performance running on the edge devices in terms of both accuracy and latency. The hybrid deep learning model in this work comprises a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict hourly PM2.5 concentration. The results show that our proposed model outperforms other deep learning models, evaluated by calculating RMSE and MAE errors. The proposed model was optimised for edge devices, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (RPi3B+) and Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (RPi4B). This optimised model reduced file size to a quarter of the original, with further size reduction achieved by implementing different post-training quantisation. In total, 8272 hourly samples were continuously fed to the edge device, with the RPi4B executing the model twice as fast as the RPi3B+ in all quantisation modes. Full-integer quantisation produced the lowest execution time, with latencies of 2.19 s and 4.73 s for RPi4B and RPi3B+, respectively.

AB  - This paper aims to examine a theoretical framework of digital society and the ramifications of the digital revolution. The paper proposes that more attention has to be paid to cultural studies as a means for the understanding of digital society. The approach is based on the idea that the digital revolution’s essence is fully manifested in the cultural changes that take place in society. Cultural changes are discussed in connection with the digital society’s transformations, such as blurring the distinction between reality and virtuality and among people, nature, and artifacts, and the reversal from informational scarcity to abundance. The presented study develops a general model of culture. This model describes the spiritual, social, and technological facets of culture. Such new phenomena as individualization, transparisation, and so-called cognification (intellectualization of the surrounding environment) are suggested as the prominent trends characterizing the above cultural facets.

AB  - IoT plays an important role in daily life; commands and data transfer rapidly between the servers and objects to provide services. However, cyber threats have become a critical factor, especially for IoT servers. There should be a vigorous way to protect the network infrastructures from various attacks. IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is the invisible guardian for IoT servers. Many machine learning methods have been applied in IDS. However, there is a need to improve the IDS system for both accuracy and performance. Deep learning is a promising technique that has been used in many areas, including pattern recognition, natural language processing, etc. The deep learning reveals more potential than traditional machine learning methods. In this paper, sequential model is the key point, and new methods are proposed by the features of the model. The model can collect features from the network layer via tcpdump packets and application layer via system routines. Text-CNN and GRU methods are chosen because the can treat sequential data as a language model. The advantage compared with the traditional methods is that they can extract more features from the data and the experiments show that the deep learning methods have higher F1-score. We conclude that the sequential model-based intrusion detection system using deep learning method can contribute to the security of the IoT servers.

SN  - 2624-831X

AB  - The number of IoT sensors and physical objects accommodated on the Internet is increasing day by day, and traditional Cloud Computing would not be able to host IoT data because of its high latency. Being challenged of processing all IoT big data on Cloud facilities, there is not enough study on automating components to deal with the big data and real-time tasks in the IoT–Fog–Cloud ecosystem. For instance, designing automatic data transfer from the fog layer to cloud layer, which contains enormous distributed devices is challenging. Considering fog as the supporting processing layer, dealing with decentralized devices in the IoT and fog layer leads us to think of other automatic mechanisms to manage the existing heterogeneity. The big data and heterogeneity challenges also motivated us to design other automatic components for Fog resiliency, which we address as the third challenge in the ecosystem. Fog resiliency makes the processing of IoT tasks independent to the Cloud layer. This survey aims to review, study, and analyze the automatic functions as a taxonomy to help researchers, who are implementing methods and algorithms for different IoT applications. We demonstrated the automatic functions through our research in accordance to each challenge. The study also discusses and suggests automating the tasks, methods, and processes of the ecosystem that still process the data manually.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Attack detection problems in industrial control systems (ICSs) are commonly known as a network traffic monitoring scheme for detecting abnormal activities. However, a network-based intrusion detection system can be deceived by attackers that imitate the system’s normal activity. In this work, we proposed a novel solution to this problem based on measurement data in the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The proposed approach is called measurement intrusion detection system (MIDS), which enables the system to detect any abnormal activity in the system even if the attacker tries to conceal it in the system’s control layer. A supervised machine learning model is generated to classify normal and abnormal activities in an ICS to evaluate the MIDS performance. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed is developed to simulate the power generation units and exploit the attack dataset. In the proposed approach, we applied several machine learning models on the dataset, which show remarkable performances in detecting the dataset’s anomalies, especially stealthy attacks. The results show that the random forest is performing better than other classifier algorithms in detecting anomalies based on measured data in the testbed.

These smart farms are designed to be run by interconnected devices and vehicles. Some enormous potentials can be achieved by the integration of different IoT technologies to achieve automated operations with minimum supervision. This paper outlines some major applications of IoT and UAV in smart farming, explores the communication technologies, network functionalities and connectivity requirements for Smart farming. The connectivity limitations of smart agriculture and it’s solutions are analysed with two case studies. In case study-1, we propose and evaluate meshed Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) gateways to address connectivity limitations of Smart Farming. While in case study-2, we explore satellite communication systems to provide connectivity to smart farms in remote areas of Australia. Finally, we conclude the paper by identifying future research challenges on this topic and outlining directions to address those challenges.

AB  - Several Internet of Things (IoT) applications are booming which rely on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and, in particular, machine learning (ML) algorithms to assist the users and make decisions on their behalf in a large variety of contexts, such as smart homes, smart cities, smart factories. Although the traditional approach is to deploy such compute-intensive algorithms into the centralized cloud, the recent proliferation of low-cost, AI-powered microcontrollers and consumer devices paves the way for having the intelligence pervasively spread along the cloud-to-things continuum. The take off of such a promising vision may be hurdled by the resource constraints of IoT devices and by the heterogeneity of (mostly proprietary) AI-embedded software and hardware platforms. In this paper, we propose a solution for the AI distributed deployment at the deep edge, which lays its foundation in the IoT virtualization concept. We design a virtualization layer hosted at the network edge that is in charge of the semantic description of AI-embedded IoT devices, and, hence, it can expose as well as augment their cognitive capabilities in order to feed intelligent IoT applications. The proposal has been mainly devised with the twofold aim of (i) relieving the pressure on constrained devices that are solicited by multiple parties interested in accessing their generated data and inference, and (ii) and targeting interoperability among AI-powered platforms. A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is provided to showcase the viability and advantages of the proposed solution.

AB  - Air pollution is a global problem, especially in urban areas where the population density is very high due to the diverse pollutant sources such as vehicles, industrial plants, buildings, and waste. North Macedonia, as a developing country, has a serious problem with air pollution. The problem is highly present in its capital city, Skopje, where air pollution places it consistently within the top 10 cities in the world during the winter months. In this work, we propose using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models with long short-term memory units to predict the level of PM10 particles at 6, 12, and 24 h in the future. We employ historical air quality measurement data from sensors placed at multiple locations in Skopje and meteorological conditions such as temperature and humidity. We compare different deep learning models’ performance to an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The obtained results show that the proposed models consistently outperform the baseline model and can be successfully employed for air pollution prediction. Ultimately, we demonstrate that these models can help decision-makers and local authorities better manage the air pollution consequences by taking proactive measures.

AB  - An integrated smart home system (ISHS) is an effective way to improve the quality of life of the elderly. The elderly’s willingness is essential to adopt an ISHS; to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the elderly’s perception of ISHS. Consequently, this study aims to investigate the elderly’s perception of the ISHS by comprehensively evaluating its possible benefits and negative responses. A set of sensors required for an ISHS was determined, and interviews were designed based on four factors: perceived comfort, perceived usability, perceived privacy, and perceived benefit. Subsequently, technological trials of the sensor-set followed by two focus group interviews were conducted on nine independently living elderly participants at a senior welfare center in South Korea. Consistent with previous studies, the results of this investigation indicate that elderly participants elicited negative responses regarding usability complexity, and discomfort to daily activities. Despite such negative responses, after acquiring enough awareness about the ISHS’s benefits, the elderly acknowledged its necessity and showed a high level of willingness. Furthermore, these results indicate that for a better adoption of an ISHS, sufficient awareness regarding its benefits and development of elderly-friendly smart home sensors that minimize negative responses are required.

TI  - An Investigation into the Application of Deep Learning in the Detection and Mitigation of DDOS Attack on SDN Controllers

SN  - 2227-7080

AB  - Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm that revolutionizes the idea of a software-driven network through the separation of control and data planes. It addresses the problems of traditional network architecture. Nevertheless, this brilliant architecture is exposed to several security threats, e.g., the distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, which is hard to contain in such software-based networks. The concept of a centralized controller in SDN makes it a single point of attack as well as a single point of failure. In this paper, deep learning-based models, long-short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), are investigated. It illustrates their possibility and efficiency in being used in detecting and mitigating DDoS attack. The paper focuses on TCP, UDP, and ICMP flood attacks that target the controller. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the accuracy, recall, and true negative rate. We compared the performance of the deep learning models with classical machine learning models. We further provide details on the time taken to detect and mitigate the attack. Our results show that RNN LSTM is a viable deep learning algorithm that can be applied in the detection and mitigation of DDoS in the SDN controller. Our proposed model produced an accuracy of 89.63%, which outperformed linear-based models such as SVM (86.85%) and Naive Bayes (82.61%). Although KNN, which is a linear-based model, outperformed our proposed model (achieving an accuracy of 99.4%), our proposed model provides a good trade-off between precision and recall, which makes it suitable for DDoS classification. In addition, it was realized that the split ratio of the training and testing datasets can give different results in the performance of a deep learning algorithm used in a specific work. The model achieved the best performance when a split of 70/30 was used in comparison to 80/20 and 60/40 split ratios.

AB  - Air quality (AQ) in urban areas is deteriorating, thus having negative effects on people’s everyday lives. Official air quality monitoring stations provide the most reliable information, but do not always depict air pollution levels at scales reflecting human activities. They also have a high cost and therefore are limited in number. This issue can be addressed by deploying low cost AQ monitoring devices (LCAQMD), though their measurements are of far lower quality. In this paper we study the correlation of air pollution levels reported by such a device and by a reference station for particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide in Thessaloniki, Greece. On this basis, a corrective factor is modeled via seven machine learning algorithms in order to improve the quality of measurements for the LCAQMD against reference stations, thus leading to its on-field computational improvement. We show that our computational intelligence approach can improve the performance of such a device for PM10 under operational conditions.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - This framework for human behavior monitoring aims to take a holistic approach to study, track, monitor, and analyze human behavior during activities of daily living (ADLs). The framework consists of two novel functionalities. First, it can perform the semantic analysis of user interactions on the diverse contextual parameters during ADLs to identify a list of distinct behavioral patterns associated with different complex activities. Second, it consists of an intelligent decision-making algorithm that can analyze these behavioral patterns and their relationships with the dynamic contextual and spatial features of the environment to detect any anomalies in user behavior that could constitute an emergency. These functionalities of this interdisciplinary framework were developed by integrating the latest advancements and technologies in human–computer interaction, machine learning, Internet of Things, pattern recognition, and ubiquitous computing. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of ADLs, and the performance accuracies of these two functionalities were found to be 76.71% and 83.87%, respectively. The presented and discussed results uphold the relevance and immense potential of this framework to contribute towards improving the quality of life and assisted living of the aging population in the future of Internet of Things (IoT)-based ubiquitous living environments, e.g., smart homes.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Applications related to smart cities require virtual cities in the experimental development stage. To build a virtual city that are close to a real city, a large number of various types of human models need to be created. To reduce the cost of acquiring models, this paper proposes a method to reconstruct 3D human meshes from single images captured using a normal camera. It presents a method for reconstructing the complete mesh of the human body from a single RGB image and a generative adversarial network consisting of a newly designed shape–pose-based generator (based on deep convolutional neural networks) and an enhanced multi-source discriminator. Using a machine learning approach, the reliance on multiple sensors is reduced and 3D human meshes can be recovered using a single camera, thereby reducing the cost of building smart cities. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.1% in body shape recovery; it can also process 34 images per second. The method proposed in this paper approach significantly improves the performance compared with previous state-of-the-art approaches. Given a single view image of various humans, our results can be used to generate various 3D human models, which can facilitate 3D human modeling work to simulate virtual cities. Since our method can also restore the poses of the humans in the image, it is possible to create various human poses by given corresponding images with specific human poses.

AB  - ‘Smart cities’ are a new type of city where stakeholders are jointly responsible for urban management. City Information Management (CIM) is an output tool for smart city planning and management, which assists in achieving the sustainable development of urban infrastructure, and promotes smart cities to achieve the goals of stable global economic development, sustainable environmental development, and improvement of people’s quality of life. Existing research has so far established that blockchain and BIM have great potential to enhance construction project performance. However, there is little research on how blockchain and BIM can support sustainable building design and construction. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the potential impact of the integration of blockchain and BIM in a smart city environment on making buildings more sustainable within the context of CIM/Smart Cities. The paper explores the relationships between blockchain, BIM and sustainable building across the life cycle stage of a construction project. This paper queries the Web of Science (WoS) database with keywords to obtain relevant publication, and then uses the VOSviewer to visually analyze the relationships between blockchain, BIM, and sustainable building within the context of smart cities and CIM, which is conducted in bibliometric analysis followed by micro scheme analysis. The results demonstrate the value of this method in gauging the importance of these three topics, highlighting their interrelationships and identifying trends, giving researchers an objective research direction. Those aspects reported in the paper constitute an original contribution.

TI  - Enhancing the Encoding-Forecasting Model for Precipitation Nowcasting by Putting High Emphasis on the Latest Data of the Time Step
T2  - Atmosphere

PY  - 2021
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Nowcasting is an important technique for weather forecasting because sudden weather changes significantly affect human life. The encoding-forecasting model, which is a state-of-the-art architecture in the field of data-driven radar extrapolation, does not particularly focus on the latest data when forecasting natural phenomena. This paper proposes a weighted broadcasting method that emphasizes the latest data of the time step to improve the nowcasting performance. This weighted broadcasting method allows the most recent rainfall patterns to have a greater impact on the forecasting network by extending the architecture of the existing encoding-forecasting model. Experimental results show that the proposed model is 1.74% and 2.20% better than the existing encoding-forecasting model in terms of mean absolute error and critical success index, respectively. In the case of heavy rainfall with an intensity of 30 mm/h or higher, the proposed model was more than 30% superior to the existing encoding-forecasting model. Therefore, applying the weighted broadcasting method, which explicitly places a high emphasis on the latest information, to the encoding-forecasting model is considered as an improvement that is applicable to the state-of-the-art implementation of data-driven radar-based precipitation nowcasting.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The utilization of energy is on the rise in current trends due to increasing consumptions by households. Smart buildings, on the other hand, aim to optimize energy, and hence, the aim of the study is to forecast the cost of energy consumption in smart buildings by effectively addressing the minimal energy consumption. However, smart buildings are restricted, with limited power access and capacity associated with Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units. It further suffers from low communication capability due to device limitations. In this paper, a balanced deep learning architecture is used to offer solutions to address these constraints. The deep learning algorithm considers three constraints, such as a multi-objective optimization problem and a fitness function, to resolve the price management problem and high-level energy consumption in HVAC systems. The study analyzes and optimizes the consumption of power in smart buildings by the HVAC systems in terms of power loss, price management and reactive power. Experiments are conducted over various scenarios to check the integrity of the system over various smart buildings and in high-rise buildings. The results are compared in terms of various HVAC devices on various metrics and communication protocols, where the proposed system is considered more effective than other methods. The results of the Li-Fi communication protocols show improved results compared to the other communication protocols.

AB  - Academics and businesses alike tend to fail at understanding how the IoT revolution is monetized. We outline three main categories of how IoT will impact business models: (a) improved customer matching and tracking of marketing returns, (b) individualized offers and pricing when consumer demand and price elasticities can be identified, and (c) smart device and usage monitoring that allows for outcome-based contracts and servitization. Data convergence creates context-based-intelligence, which enables a shift from using consumer profiles for targeted advertising to individualized offers and pricing. The required depth of both consumer data and understanding of context will require collaborative efforts between companies and blur the lines between industrial- and consumer-IoT applications. Outlining concerns for privacy and cybersecurity, we find that consumer demand for decision-simplicity and relevant content aligns with the business model of “free” services in return for data, despite consumer concerns relating to data collection.

AB  - The application of Internet of Things (IoT) has been emerging as a new platform in wireless technologies primarily in the field of designing electric vehicles. To overcome all issues in existing vehicles and for protecting the environment, electric vehicles should be introduced by integrating an intellectual device called sensor all over the body of electric vehicle with less cost. Therefore, this article confers the need and importance of introducing electric vehicles with IoT based technology which monitors the battery life of electric vehicles. Since the electric vehicles are implemented with internet, an online monitoring system which is called Things Speak has been used for monitoring all the vehicles in a continuous manner (day-by-day). These online results will then be visualized in MATLAB after an effective boosting algorithm is integrated with objective function. The efficiency of proposed method is tested by visual analysis and performance results prove that the projected method on electric vehicle is improved when using IoT based technology. It is also observed that cost of implementation is lesser and capacity of electric vehicle is increased to about 74.3% after continuous monitoring with sensors.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 4
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - As one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, it is sensible to analysis historical urban land use characteristics and project the potentials of urban sustainable development for a smart city. The cellular automaton (CA) model is the widely applied in simulating urban growth, but the optimum parameters of variables driving urban growth in the model remains to be continued to improve. We propose a novel model integrating an artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) and CA for optimizing parameters of variables in the urban growth model and make a comparison between AFSA-CA and other five models, which is used to study a 40-year urban land growth of Wuhan. We found that the urban growth types from 1995 to 2015 appeared relatively consistent, mainly including infilling, edge-expansion and distant-leap types in Wuhan, which a certain range of urban land growth on the periphery of the central area. Additionally, although the genetic algorithms (GA)-CA model and the AFSA-CA model among the six models due to the distance variables, the parameter value of the GA-CA model is −15.5409 according to the fact that the population (POP) variable should be positively. As a result, the AFSA-CA model regardless of the initial parameter setting is superior to the GA-CA model and the GA-CA model is superior to all the other models. Finally, it is projected that the potentials of urban growth in Wuhan for 2025 and 2035 under three scenarios (natural urban land growth without any restrictions (NULG), sustainable urban land growth with cropland protection and ecological security (SULG), and economic urban land growth with sustainable development and economic development in the core area (EULG)) focus mainly on existing urban land and some new town centers based on AFSA-CA urban growth simulation model. An increasingly precise simulation can determine the potential increase area and quantity of urban land, providing a basis to judge the layout of urban land use for urban planners.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The number of smart cities is increasing rapidly around the world with the continuous increase of governments’ interest in exploiting Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to solve issues arising from rapid urbanization. Most smart city services rely fundamentally on ubiquitous sensing, enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies. However, WSNs in smart cities are naturally vulnerable to unavoidable external challenges like storms, fires, and other natural disasters. Such challenges pose a great threat to smart city infrastructure, including WSNs, as they might affect network connectivity or result in complete blockages of network services. However, some particular smart city services are critical, to the point where they must remain available in all situations, especially during disasters; to monitor the disaster and obtain sensory information needed for controlling it, limiting its danger, or for decision-making during rescue operations. Thus, it is crucial to design a smart-city network to maintain connectivity against such challenges. In this paper, we introduce MPResiSDN, a MultiPath Resilient routing system based on Software Defined Networking (SDN). The system introduced exploits SDN’s capabilities and aided-multipath routing to reactively provide connectivity in smart city networks in the presence of challenges. We evaluated our proposed system under simulations of different natural disasters. The results demonstrate that the system improved data delivery under the challenges by as much as 100% compared to the Spanning Tree Protocol when a suitable value for k diverse paths was selected.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 5
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Mountains are popular tourist destinations due to their climate, fresh atmosphere, breathtaking sceneries, and varied topography. However, they are at times exposed to accidents, such as fire caused due to natural hazards and human activities. Such unforeseen fire accidents have a social, economic, and environmental impact on mountain towns worldwide. Protecting mountains from such fire accidents is also very challenging in terms of the high cost of fire containment resources, tracking fire spread, and evacuating the people at risk. This paper aims to fill this gap and proposes a three-fold methodology for fire safety in the mountains. The first part of the methodology is an optimization model for effective fire containment resource utilization. The second part of the methodology is a novel ensemble model based on machine learning, the heuristic approach, and principal component regression for predictive analytics of fire spread data. The final part of the methodology consists of an Internet of Things-based task orchestration approach to notify fire safety information to safety authorities. The proposed three-fold fire safety approach provides in-time information to safety authorities for making on-time decisions to minimize the damage caused by mountain fire with minimum containment cost. The performance of optimization models is evaluated in terms of execution time and cost. The particle swarm optimization-based model performs better in terms of cost, whereas the bat algorithm performs better in terms of execution time. The prediction models’ performance is evaluated in terms of root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error. The proposed ensemble-based prediction model accuracy for fire spread and burned area prediction is higher than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. It is evident from the results that the proposed fire safety mechanism is a step towards efficient mountain fire safety management.

VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Recent improvements in the performance of the human face recognition model have led to the development of relevant products and services. However, research in the similar field of animal face identification has remained relatively limited due to the greater diversity and complexity in shape and the lack of relevant data for animal faces such as dogs. In the face identification model using triplet loss, the length of the embedding vector is normalized by adding an L2-normalization (L2-norm) layer for using cosine-similarity-based learning. As a result, object identification depends only on the angle, and the distribution of the embedding vector is limited to the surface of a sphere with a radius of 1. This study proposes training the model from which the L2-norm layer is removed by using the triplet loss to utilize a wide vector space beyond the surface of a sphere with a radius of 1, for which a novel loss function and its two-stage learning method. The proposed method classifies the embedding vector within a space rather than on the surface, and the model’s performance is also increased. The accuracy, one-shot identification performance, and distribution of the embedding vectors are compared between the existing learning method and the proposed learning method for verification. The verification was conducted using an open-set. The resulting accuracy of 97.33% for the proposed learning method is approximately 4% greater than that of the existing learning method.

AB  - The emerging of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0 (I4.0), from the advancement in several technologies is viewed not only to promote economic growth, but also to enable a greener future. The 2030 Agenda of the United Nations for sustainable development sets out clear goals for the industry to foster the economy, while preserving social well-being and ecological validity. However, the influence of I4.0 technologies on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) has not been conclusively or systematically investigated. By understanding the link between the I4.0 technologies and the SDGs, researchers can better support policymakers to consider the technological advancement in updating and harmonizing policies and strategies in different sectors (i.e., education, industry, and governmental) with the SDGs. To address this gap, academic experts in this paper have investigated the influence of I4.0 technologies on the sustainability targets identified by the UN. Key I4.0 element technologies have been classified to enable a quantitative mapping with the 17 SDGs. The results indicate that the majority of the I4.0 technologies can contribute positively to achieving the UN agenda. It was also found that the effects of the technologies on individual goals varies between direct and strong, and indirect and weak influences. The main insights and lessons learned from the mapping are provided to support future policy.

AB  - A reliable prediction of sustainable energy consumption is key for designing environmentally friendly buildings. In this study, three novel hybrid intelligent methods, namely the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), wind-driven optimization (WDO), and biogeography-based optimization (BBO), are employed to optimize the multitarget prediction of heating loads (HLs) and cooling loads (CLs) in the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Concerning the optimization of the applied algorithms, a series of swarm-based iterations are performed, and the best structure is proposed for each model. The GOA, WDO, and BBO algorithms are mixed with a class of feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs), which is called a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to predict the HL and CL. According to the sensitivity analysis, the WDO with swarm size = 500 proposes the most-fitted ANN. The proposed WDO-ANN provided an accurate prediction in terms of heating load (training (R2 correlation = 0.977 and RMSE error = 0.183) and testing (R2 correlation = 0.973 and RMSE error = 0.190)) and yielded the best-fitted prediction in terms of cooling load (training (R2 correlation = 0.99 and RMSE error = 0.147) and testing (R2 correlation = 0.99 and RMSE error = 0.148)).

AB  - With the limitedness of the sub-6 GHz bandwidth, the world is exploring a thrilling wireless technology known as massive MIMO. This wireless access technology is swiftly becoming key for 5G, B5G, and 6G network deployment. The massive MIMO system brings together antennas at both base stations and the user terminals to provide high spectral service. Despite the fact that massive MIMO offers astronomical benefits such as low latency, high data rate, improved array gain, and far better reliability, it faces several implementation challenges due to the hundreds of antennas at the base station. The signal detection at the base station during the uplink is one of the critical issues in this technology. Detection of user signal becomes computationally complex with a multitude of antennas present in the massive MIMO systems. This paper proposes a novel preconditioned and accelerated Gauss–Siedel algorithm referred to as Symmetric Successive Over-relaxation Preconditioned Gauss-Seidel (SSORGS). The proposed algorithm will address the signal detection challenges associated with massive MIMO technology. Furthermore, we enhance the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm by introducing a novel Symmetric Successive Over-relaxation preconditioner (SSOR) scheme and an initialization scheme based on the instantaneous channel condition between the base station and the user. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm referred to as Symmetric Successive Over-relaxation Preconditioned Gauss-Seidel (SSORGS) provides optimal BER performance. At BER =10−3, over the range of SNR, the SSORGS algorithm performs better than the traditional algorithms. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is computationally more efficient than the traditional algorithms. Furthermore, we designed a comprehensive hardware architecture for the SSORGS algorithm to find the interrelated components necessary to build the actual physical system.

AB  - In recent years, because of highly developed LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technologies, there has been increasing demand for 3D change detection in urban monitoring, urban model updating, and disaster assessment. In order to improve the effectiveness of 3D change detection based on point clouds, an approach for 3D change detection using point-based comparison is presented in this paper. To avoid density variation in point clouds, adaptive thresholds are calculated through the k-neighboring average distance and the local point cloud density. A series of experiments for quantitative evaluation is performed. In the experiments, the influencing factors including threshold, registration error, and neighboring number of 3D change detection are discussed and analyzed. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the approach using adaptive thresholds based on local point cloud density are effective and suitable.

AB  - In this paper, a brief survey of measurable factors affecting the adoption of cybersecurity enhancement methods in the smart grid is provided. From a practical point of view, it is a key point to determine to what degree the cyber resilience of power systems can be improved using cost-effective resilience enhancement methods. Numerous attempts have been made to the vital resilience of the smart grid against cyber-attacks. The recently proposed cybersecurity methods are considered in this paper, and their accuracies, computational time, and robustness against external factors in detecting and identifying False Data Injection (FDI) attacks are evaluated. There is no all-inclusive solution to fit all power systems requirements. Therefore, the recently proposed cyber-attack detection and identification methods are quantitatively compared and discussed.

AB  - Rapid developments in urbanization and smart city environments have accelerated the need to deliver safe, sustainable, and effective resource utilization and service provision and have thereby enhanced the need for intelligent, real-time video surveillance. Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have the capability to detect and localize salient objects in surveillance video streams; however, several practical issues remain unaddressed, such as diverse weather conditions, recording conditions, and motion blur. In this context, image de-raining is an important issue that has been investigated extensively in recent years to provide accurate and quality surveillance in the smart city domain. Existing deep convolutional neural networks have obtained great success in image translation and other computer vision tasks; however, image de-raining is ill posed and has not been addressed in real-time, intelligent video surveillance systems. In this work, we propose to utilize the generative capabilities of recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) as an image de-raining approach. We utilize the adversarial loss in GANs that provides an additional component to the loss function, which in turn regulates the final output and helps to yield better results. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that the proposed method outperforms most of the existing state-of-the-art models in terms of quantitative evaluations and visual appearance.

TI  - Compatibility of Automated Vehicles in Street Spaces: Considerations for a Sustainable Implementation
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 5
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Automated Vehicles (AVs) will bring a fundamental change in the mobility sector in the coming years. Whereas many studies emphasize opportunities with AVs, studies on the impacts of AVs on travel behavior particularly show an overall increase in traffic volume. This increase could impair the needs of other uses and users within street spaces and decrease the permeability of the street space for pedestrians and cyclists. However, only a few studies, so far, have looked at the changes of traffic volume due to AVs at the street level, and to what extent these impair the needs of other uses and users within different street spaces was not in the focus at all. This paper investigates the compatibility of AVs in street spaces, building on different modeling results of scenarios with AVs based on the Multi-Agent Traffic Simulation (MATSim) framework. Using the so-called compensatory approach and the whole street network of Vienna, Austria, as a case study, we examine how compatible AVs and their related changes in traffic volume are with the needs of other uses and users, i.e., pedestrians and cyclists, within different street spaces, by specifically considering the various characteristics of the latter. Results show that the effects of AVs on the compatibility of street spaces would be unevenly distributed across the city. For Shared Automated Vehicles (SAVs), a deterioration in compatibility is observable, especially in inner-city dense areas, because of an increase in traffic volume and an already high amount of competing uses. In contrast, especially (on main roads) in the outskirts, improvements in compatibility are possible. This particularly applies to SAVs with a stop-based service. However, private AVs interlinked with an overall capacity increase would lead to a deterioration in compatibility, especially in parts of the higher-level street network that already have incompatible traffic volumes, further increasing the separating or barrier effect of such streets. The results can provide insights for policymakers and stakeholders about where and how to facilitate AVs, to reach an implementation that is compatible with the different uses and needs of users within street spaces: While SAVs should be implemented particularly in the outskirts, as a complement for public transport, an implementation of AVs in the lower-level street network in inner parts of the city should not be facilitated, or it should at least be linked to measures that make street spaces more compatible with the needs of pedestrians and cyclists, e.g., implementation of walking and cycling infrastructure.

AB  - This study aims to produce accurate predictions of the NO2 concentrations at a specific station of a monitoring network located in the Bay of Algeciras (Spain). Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and sequence-to-sequence long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) were used to create the forecasting models. Additionally, a new prediction method was proposed combining LSTMs using a rolling window scheme with a cross-validation procedure for time series (LSTM-CVT). Two different strategies were followed regarding the input variables: using NO2 from the station or employing NO2 and other pollutants data from any station of the network plus meteorological variables. The ANN and LSTM-CVT exogenous models used lagged datasets of different window sizes. Several feature ranking methods were used to select the top lagged variables and include them in the final exogenous datasets. Prediction horizons of t + 1, t + 4 and t + 8 were employed. The exogenous variables inclusion enhanced the model’s performance, especially for t + 4 (ρ ≈ 0.68 to ρ ≈ 0.74) and t + 8 (ρ ≈ 0.59 to ρ ≈ 0.66). The proposed LSTM-CVT method delivered promising results as the best performing models per prediction horizon employed this new methodology. Additionally, per each parameter combination, it obtained lower error values than ANNs in 85% of the cases.

AB  - The escalated growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has started to reform and reshape our lives. The deployment of a large number of objects adhered to the internet has unlocked the vision of the smart world around us, thereby paving a road towards automation and humongous data generation and collection. This automation and continuous explosion of personal and professional information to the digital world provides a potent ground to the adversaries to perform numerous cyber-attacks, thus making security in IoT a sizeable concern.

AB  - Narrowband-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) displays high-quality connectivity underpinned by fifth-generation (5G) networks to cover a wide array of IoT applications. The devices’ development and integration into different smart systems require permanent control, supervision, and the study of power consumption models to determine the performance of the network topology and allow for the measurement of the efficiency of the network topology’s application. This paper reports on an architecture and open-sourced simulation that was developed to study NB-IoT in Device-to-Device (D2D) mode, which includes the Physical (PHY), network, and application layers, as well as a queuing model, the model for uplink and downlink delays, the throughput, the overall NB-IoT D2D network performance, and the energy consumption based on the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol. Our results prove that the suggested framework contributes to a reduction in power consumption, a minimization of queuing delays, a decrease in communication cost, a reduction in inter-cluster collisions, and the prevention of attacks from malicious nodes. Consequently, the framework manages the battery’s State of Charge (SOC), improves the battery’s State of Health (SOH), and maximizes the whole network lifetime. The proposed framework, the code of which has been open-sourced, can be effectively used for scientific research and development purposes to evaluate different parameters and improve the planning of NB-IoT networks.

AB  - In today’s Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment, where different systems interact with the physical world, the state proposed by the Industry 4.0 standards can lead to escalating vulnerabilities, especially when these systems receive data streams from multiple intermediaries, requiring multilevel security approaches, in addition to link encryption. At the same time taking into account the heterogeneity of the systems included in the IIoT ecosystem and the non-institutionalized interoperability in terms of hardware and software, serious issues arise as to how to secure these systems. In this framework, given that the protection of industrial equipment is a requirement inextricably linked to technological developments and the use of the IoT, it is important to identify the major vulnerabilities and the associated risks and threats and to suggest the most appropriate countermeasures. In this context, this study provides a description of the attacks against IIoT systems, as well as a thorough analysis of the solutions for these attacks, as they have been proposed in the most recent literature.

AB  - This work makes multiple scientific contributions to the field of Indoor Localization for Ambient Assisted Living in Smart Homes. First, it presents a Big-Data driven methodology that studies the multimodal components of user interactions and analyzes the data from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and BLE scanners to detect a user’s indoor location in a specific ‘activity-based zone’ during Activities of Daily Living. Second, it introduces a context independent approach that can interpret the accelerometer and gyroscope data from diverse behavioral patterns to detect the ‘zone-based’ indoor location of a user in any Internet of Things (IoT)-based environment. These two approaches achieved performance accuracies of 81.36% and 81.13%, respectively, when tested on a dataset. Third, it presents a methodology to detect the spatial coordinates of a user’s indoor position that outperforms all similar works in this field, as per the associated root mean squared error—one of the performance evaluation metrics in ISO/IEC18305:2016—an international standard for testing Localization and Tracking Systems. Finally, it presents a comprehensive comparative study that includes Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, k-NN, Gradient Boosted Trees, Deep Learning, and Linear Regression, to address the challenge of identifying the optimal machine learning approach for Indoor Localization.

AB  - As energy distribution systems evolve from a traditional hierarchical load structure towards distributed smart grids, flexibility is increasingly investigated as both a key measure and core challenge of grid balancing. This paper contributes to the theoretical framework for quantifying network flexibility potential by introducing a machine learning based node characterization. In particular, artificial neural networks are considered for classification of historic demand data from several network substations. Performance of the resulting classifiers is evaluated with respect to clustering analysis and parameter space of the models considered, while the bootstrapping based statistical evaluation is reported in terms of mean confusion matrices. The resulting meta-models of individual nodes can be further utilized on a network level to mitigate the difficulties associated with identifying, implementing and actuating many small sources of energy flexibility, compared to the few large ones traditionally acknowledged.

AB  - The reliability, scalability, and stability of routing schemes are open challenges in highly evolving vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). Cluster-based routing is an efficient solution to cope with the dynamic and inconsistent structure of VANETs. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based routing scheme (hereinafter referred to as connectivity-based clustering), where link connectivity is used as a metric for cluster formation and cluster head (CH) selection. Link connectivity is a function of vehicle density and transmission range in the proposed connectivity-based clustering scheme. Moreover, we used a heuristic approach of spectral clustering for the optimal number of cluster formation. Lastly, an appropriate vehicle is selected as a CH based on the maximum Eigen-centrality score. The simulation results show that the suggested connectivity-based clustering scheme performs well in the optimal number of cluster selections, strongly connected (STC) route selection, and route request messages (RRMs) in the discovery of a particular path to the destination. Thus, we conclude that link connectivity and the heuristic approach of spectral clustering are valuable additions to existing routing schemes for high evolving networks.

AB  - Diverse computer-aided diagnosis systems based on convolutional neural networks were applied to automate the detection of myocardial infarction (MI) found in electrocardiogram (ECG) for early diagnosis and prevention. However, issues, particularly overfitting and underfitting, were not being taken into account. In other words, it is unclear whether the network structure is too simple or complex. Toward this end, the proposed models were developed by starting with the simplest structure: a multi-lead features-concatenate narrow network (N-Net) in which only two convolutional layers were included in each lead branch. Additionally, multi-scale features-concatenate networks (MSN-Net) were also implemented where larger features were being extracted through pooling the signals. The best structure was obtained via tuning both the number of filters in the convolutional layers and the number of inputting signal scales. As a result, the N-Net reached a 95.76% accuracy in the MI detection task, whereas the MSN-Net reached an accuracy of 61.82% in the MI locating task. Both networks give a higher average accuracy and a significant difference of p &lt; 0.001 evaluated by the U test compared with the state-of-the-art. The models are also smaller in size thus are suitable to fit in wearable devices for offline monitoring. In conclusion, testing throughout the simple and complex network structure is indispensable. However, the way of dealing with the class imbalance problem and the quality of the extracted features are yet to be discussed.

AB  - This paper presents a novel incentive-based load shedding management scheme within a microgrid environment equipped with the required IoT infrastructure. The proposed mechanism works on the principles of reverse combinatorial auction. We consider a region of multiple consumers who are willing to curtail their load in the peak hours in order to gain some incentives later. Using the properties of combinatorial auctions, the participants can bid in packages or combinations in order to maximize their and overall social welfare of the system. The winner determination problem of the proposed combinatorial auction, determined using particle swarm optimization algorithm and hybrid genetic algorithm, is also presented in this paper. The performance evaluation and stability test of the proposed scheme are simulated using MATLAB and presented in this paper. The results indicate that combinatorial auctions are an excellent choice for load shedding management where a maximum of 50 users participate.
