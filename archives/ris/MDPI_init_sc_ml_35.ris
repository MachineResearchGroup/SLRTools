AB  - In many countries around the world, smart cities are becoming a reality. These cities contribute to improving citizens’ quality of life by providing services that are normally based on data extracted from wireless sensor networks (WSN) and other elements of the Internet of Things. Additionally, public administration uses these smart city data to increase its efficiency, to reduce costs and to provide additional services. However, the information received at smart city data centers is not always accurate, because WSNs are sometimes prone to error and are exposed to physical and computer attacks. In this article, we use real data from the smart city of Barcelona to simulate WSNs and implement typical attacks. Then, we compare frequently used anomaly detection techniques to disclose these attacks. We evaluate the algorithms under different requirements on the available network status information. As a result of this study, we conclude that one-class Support Vector Machines is the most appropriate technique. We achieve a true positive rate at least 56% higher than the rates achieved with the other compared techniques in a scenario with a maximum false positive rate of 5% and a 26% higher in a scenario with a false positive rate of 15%.

AB  - In recent years, the advancement of sensor technology has led to the generation of heterogeneous Internet-of-Things (IoT) data by smart cities. Thus, the development and deployment of various aspects of IoT-based applications are necessary to mine the potential value of data to the benefit of people and their lives. However, the variety, volume, heterogeneity, and real-time nature of data obtained from smart cities pose considerable challenges. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework that integrates the IoT with machine learning for smart cities. The proposed framework retrieves and models urban data for certain kinds of IoT applications based on semantic and machine-learning technologies. Moreover, we propose two case studies: pollution detection from vehicles and traffic pattern detection. The experimental results show that our system is scalable and capable of accommodating a large number of urban regions with different types of IoT applications.

AB  - Emerging sensor networks (ESNs) are an inevitable trend with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and intend to connect almost every intelligent device. Therefore, it is critical to study resource allocation in such an environment, due to the concern of efficiency, especially when resources are limited. By viewing ESNs as multi-agent environments, we model them with an agent-based modelling (ABM) method and deal with resource allocation problems with market models, after describing users’ patterns. Reinforcement learning methods are introduced to estimate users’ patterns and verify the outcomes in our market models. Experimental results show the efficiency of our methods, which are also capable of guiding topology management.

PY  - 2017
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - One of the main priorities of smart cities is improving the quality of life of their inhabitants. Traffic noise is one of the pollutant sources that causes a negative impact on the quality of life of citizens, which is gaining attention among authorities. The European Commission has promoted the Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END) to inform citizens and to prevent the harmful effects of noise exposure. The measure of acoustic levels using noise maps is a strategic issue in the END action plan. Noise maps are typically calculated by computing the average noise during one year and updated every five years. Hence, the implementation of dynamic noise mapping systems could lead to short-term plan actions, besides helping to better understand the evolution of noise levels along time. Recently, some projects have started the monitoring of noise levels in urban areas by means of acoustic sensor networks settled in strategic locations across the city, while others have taken advantage of collaborative citizen sensing mobile applications. In this paper, we describe the design of an acoustic low-cost sensor network installed on public buses to measure the traffic noise in the city in real time. Moreover, the challenges that a ubiquitous bus acoustic measurement system entails are enumerated and discussed. Specifically, the analysis takes into account the feature extraction of the audio signal, the identification and separation of the road traffic noise from urban traffic noise, the hardware platform to measure and process the acoustic signal, the connectivity between the several nodes of the acoustic sensor network to store the data and, finally, the noise maps’ generation process. The implementation and evaluation of the proposal in a real-life scenario is left for future work.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Web of Things (WoT) facilitates the discovery and interoperability of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a cyber-physical system (CPS). Moreover, a uniform knowledge representation of physical resources is quite necessary for further composition, collaboration, and decision-making process in CPS. Though several efforts have integrated semantics with WoT, such as knowledge engineering methods based on semantic sensor networks (SSN), it still could not represent the complex relationships between devices when dynamic composition and collaboration occur, and it totally depends on manual construction of a knowledge base with low scalability. In this paper, to addresses these limitations, we propose the semantic Web of Things (SWoT) framework for CPS (SWoT4CPS). SWoT4CPS provides a hybrid solution with both ontological engineering methods by extending SSN and machine learning methods based on an entity linking (EL) model. To testify to the feasibility and performance, we demonstrate the framework by implementing a temperature anomaly diagnosis and automatic control use case in a building automation system. Evaluation results on the EL method show that linking domain knowledge to DBpedia has a relative high accuracy and the time complexity is at a tolerant level. Advantages and disadvantages of SWoT4CPS with future work are also discussed.

AB  - The process of modernizing smart grid prominently increases the complexity and uncertainty in scheduling and operation of power systems, and, in order to develop a more reliable, flexible, efficient and resilient grid, electrical load forecasting is not only an important key but is still a difficult and challenging task as well. In this paper, a short-term electrical load forecasting model, with a unit for feature learning named Pyramid System and recurrent neural networks, has been developed and it can effectively promote the stability and security of the power grid. Nine types of methods for feature learning are compared in this work to select the best one for learning target, and two criteria have been employed to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction intervals. Furthermore, an electrical load forecasting method based on recurrent neural networks has been formed to achieve the relational diagram of historical data, and, to be specific, the proposed techniques are applied to electrical load forecasting using the data collected from New South Wales, Australia. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid models can not only satisfactorily approximate the actual value but they are also able to be effective tools in the planning of smart grids.

PY  - 2017
VL  - 1
IS  - 2
SN  - 2413-8851

AB  - In order for a risk assessment to deliver sensible results, exposure in the concerned area must be known or at least estimated in a reliable manner. Exposure estimation, though, may be tricky, especially in urban areas, where large-scale surveying is generally expensive and impractical; yet, it is in urban areas that most assets are at stake when a disaster strikes. Authoritative sources such as cadastral data and business records may not be readily accessible to private stakeholders such as insurance companies; airborne and especially satellite-based Earth-Observation data obviously cannot retrieve all relevant pieces of information. Recently, a growing interest is recorded in the exploitation of street-level pictures, procured either through crowdsourcing or through specialized services like Google Street View. Pictures of building facades convey a great amount of information, but their interpretation is complex. Recently, however, smarter image analysis methods based on deep learning started appearing in literature, made possible by the increasing availability of computational power. In this paper, we leverage such methods to design a system for large-scale, systematic scanning of street-level pictures intended to map floor numbers in urban buildings. Although quite simple, this piece of information is a relevant exposure proxy in risk assessment. In the proposed system, a series of georeferenced images are automatically retrieved from the repository where they sit. A tailored deep learning net is first trained on sample images tagged through visual interpretation, and then systematically applied to the entire retrieved dataset. A specific algorithm allows attaching “number of floors” tags to the correct building in a dedicated GIS (Geographic Information System) layer, which is finally output by the system as an “exposure proxy” layer.

AB  - The rapid development of new technologies and the changing landscape of the online world (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of All, cloud-based solutions) provide a unique opportunity for developing automated and robotic systems for urban farming, agriculture, and forestry. Technological advances in machine vision, global positioning systems, laser technologies, actuators, and mechatronics have enabled the development and implementation of robotic systems and intelligent technologies for precision agriculture. Herein, we present and review robotic applications on plant pathology and management, and emerging agricultural technologies for intra-urban agriculture. Greenhouse advanced management systems and technologies have been greatly developed in the last years, integrating IoT and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Machine learning, machine vision, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have been utilized and applied in agriculture for automated and robotic farming. Intelligence technologies, using machine vision/learning, have been developed not only for planting, irrigation, weeding (to some extent), pruning, and harvesting, but also for plant disease detection and identification. However, plant disease detection still represents an intriguing challenge, for both abiotic and biotic stress. Many recognition methods and technologies for identifying plant disease symptoms have been successfully developed; still, the majority of them require a controlled environment for data acquisition to avoid false positives. Machine learning methods (e.g., deep and transfer learning) present promising results for improving image processing and plant symptom identification. Nevertheless, diagnostic specificity is a challenge for microorganism control and should drive the development of mechatronics and robotic solutions for disease management.

AB  - Nowadays, the railway industry is in a position where it is able to exploit the opportunities created by the IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) and enabling communication technologies under the paradigm of Internet of Trains. This review details the evolution of communication technologies since the deployment of GSM-R, describing the main alternatives and how railway requirements, specifications and recommendations have evolved over time. The advantages of the latest generation of broadband communication systems (e.g., LTE, 5G, IEEE 802.11ad) and the emergence of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for the railway environment are also explained together with the strategic roadmap to ensure a smooth migration from GSM-R. Furthermore, this survey focuses on providing a holistic approach, identifying scenarios and architectures where railways could leverage better commercial IIoT capabilities. After reviewing the main industrial developments, short and medium-term IIoT-enabled services for smart railways are evaluated. Then, it is analyzed the latest research on predictive maintenance, smart infrastructure, advanced monitoring of assets, video surveillance systems, railway operations, Passenger and Freight Information Systems (PIS/FIS), train control systems, safety assurance, signaling systems, cyber security and energy efficiency. Overall, it can be stated that the aim of this article is to provide a detailed examination of the state-of-the-art of different technologies and services that will revolutionize the railway industry and will allow for confronting today challenges.

AB  - Considering the current advancements in biometric sensors and other related technologies, as well as the use of bio-inspired models for AI improvements, we can infer that the swarm intelligence paradigm can be implemented in human daily spheres through the connectivity between user gadgets connected to the Internet of Things. This is a first step towards a real Ambient Intelligence, but also of a Global Intelligence. This unconscious (by the user) connectivity may alter the way by which we feel the world. Besides, with the arrival of new augmented ways of capturing and providing information or radical new ways of expanding our bodies (through synthetic biology or artificial prosthesis like brain–computer connections), we can be very close to a change which may radically affect our experience of ourselves and of the feeling of collectivity. We call it the techno-phenomenological turn. We show social implications, present challenges, and and open questions for the new kind of swarm intelligence-enhanced society, and provide the taxonomy of the field of study. We will also explore the possible roadmaps of this next possible situation.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - One of the main aspects affecting the quality of life of people living in urban and suburban areas is their continued exposure to high Road Traffic Noise (RTN) levels. Until now, noise measurements in cities have been performed by professionals, recording data in certain locations to build a noise map afterwards. However, the deployment of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks (WASN) has enabled automatic noise mapping in smart cities. In order to obtain a reliable picture of the RTN levels affecting citizens, Anomalous Noise Events (ANE) unrelated to road traffic should be removed from the noise map computation. To this aim, this paper introduces an Anomalous Noise Event Detector (ANED) designed to differentiate between RTN and ANE in real time within a predefined interval running on the distributed low-cost acoustic sensors of a WASN. The proposed ANED follows a two-class audio event detection and classification approach, instead of multi-class or one-class classification schemes, taking advantage of the collection of representative acoustic data in real-life environments. The experiments conducted within the DYNAMAP project, implemented on ARM-based acoustic sensors, show the feasibility of the proposal both in terms of computational cost and classification performance using standard Mel cepstral coefficients and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The two-class GMM core classifier relatively improves the baseline universal GMM one-class classifier F1 measure by 18.7% and 31.8% for suburban and urban environments, respectively, within the 1-s integration interval. Nevertheless, according to the results, the classification performance of the current ANED implementation still has room for improvement.

AB  - In this paper, emerging 5G mobile services are investigated and categorized from the perspective of not service providers, but end-users. The development of 5G mobile services is based on an intensive analysis of the global trends in mobile services. Additionally, several indispensable service requirements, essential for realizing service scenarios presented, are described. To illustrate the changes in societies and in daily life in the 5G era, five megatrends, including the explosion of mobile data traffic, the rapid increase in connected devices, everything on the cloud, hyper-realistic media for convergence services and knowledge as a service enabled by big-data analysis, are examined. Based on such trends, we classify the new 5G services into five categories in terms of the end-users’ experience as follows: immersive 5G services, intelligent 5G services, omnipresent 5G services, autonomous 5G services and public 5G services. Moreover, several 5G service scenarios in each service category are presented, and essential technical requirements for realizing the aforementioned 5G services are suggested, along with a competitiveness analysis on 5G services/devices/network industries and the current condition of 5G technologies.

AB  - Over the years, advanced IT technologies have facilitated the emergence of new ways of generating and gathering data rapidly, continuously, and largely and are associated with a new research and application branch, namely, data stream mining (DSM). Among those multiple scenarios of DSM, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role, with a typical meaning of a tough and challenging computational case of big data. In this paper, we describe a self-adaptive approach to the pre-processing step of data stream classification. The proposed algorithm allows different divisions with both variable numbers and lengths of sub-windows under a whole sliding window on an input stream, and clustering-based particle swarm optimization (CPSO) is adopted as the main metaheuristic search method to guarantee that its stream segmentations are effective and adaptive to itself. In order to create a more abundant search space, statistical feature extraction (SFX) is applied after variable partitions of the entire sliding window. We validate and test the effort of our algorithm with other temporal methods according to several IoT environmental sensor monitoring datasets. The experiments yield encouraging outcomes, supporting the reality that picking significant appropriate variant sub-window segmentations heuristically with an incorporated clustering technique merit would allow these to perform better than others.

AB  - Advancements in medical science and technology, medicine and public health coupled with increased consciousness about nutrition and environmental and personal hygiene have paved the way for the dramatic increase in life expectancy globally in the past several decades. However, increased life expectancy has given rise to an increasing aging population, thus jeopardizing the socio-economic structure of many countries in terms of costs associated with elderly healthcare and wellbeing. In order to cope with the growing need for elderly healthcare services, it is essential to develop affordable, unobtrusive and easy-to-use healthcare solutions. Smart homes, which incorporate environmental and wearable medical sensors, actuators, and modern communication and information technologies, can enable continuous and remote monitoring of elderly health and wellbeing at a low cost. Smart homes may allow the elderly to stay in their comfortable home environments instead of expensive and limited healthcare facilities. Healthcare personnel can also keep track of the overall health condition of the elderly in real-time and provide feedback and support from distant facilities. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research and development in smart home based remote healthcare technologies.

AB  - Smart cities are demanding solutions for improved traffic efficiency, in order to guarantee optimal access to mobility resources available in urban areas. Intelligent video analytics deployed directly on board embedded sensors offers great opportunities to gather highly informative data about traffic and transport, allowing reconstruction of a real-time neat picture of urban mobility patterns. In this paper, we present a visual sensor network in which each node embeds computer vision logics for analyzing in real time urban traffic. The nodes in the network share their perceptions and build a global and comprehensive interpretation of the analyzed scenes in a cooperative and adaptive fashion. This is possible thanks to an especially designed Internet of Things (IoT) compliant middleware which encompasses in-network event composition as well as full support of Machine-2-Machine (M2M) communication mechanism. The potential of the proposed cooperative visual sensor network is shown with two sample applications in urban mobility connected to the estimation of vehicular flows and parking management. Besides providing detailed results of each key component of the proposed solution, the validity of the approach is demonstrated by extensive field tests that proved the suitability of the system in providing a scalable, adaptable and extensible data collection layer for managing and understanding mobility in smart cities.

In this article, we review deep learning techniques that can be applied to sensed data to improve prediction and decision making in smart health services. Furthermore, we present a comparison and taxonomy of these methodologies based on types of sensors and sensed data.

AB  - Energy consumption is a critical performance and user experience metric when developing mobile sensing applications, especially with the significantly growing number of sensing applications in recent years. As proposed a decade ago when mobile applications were still not popular and most mobile operating systems were single-tasking, conventional sensing paradigms such as opportunistic sensing and participatory sensing do not explore the relationship among concurrent applications for energy-intensive tasks. In this paper, inspired by social relationships among living creatures in nature, we propose a symbiotic sensing paradigm that can conserve energy, while maintaining equivalent performance to existing paradigms. The key idea is that sensing applications should cooperatively perform common tasks to avoid acquiring the same resources multiple times. By doing so, this sensing paradigm executes sensing tasks with very little extra resource consumption and, consequently, extends battery life. To evaluate and compare the symbiotic sensing paradigm with the existing ones, we develop mathematical models in terms of the completion probability and estimated energy consumption. The quantitative evaluation results using various parameters obtained from real datasets indicate that symbiotic sensing performs better than opportunistic sensing and participatory sensing in large-scale sensing applications, such as road condition monitoring, air pollution monitoring, and city noise monitoring.

AB  - Recent developments in data mining and machine learning approaches have brought lots of excitement in providing solutions for challenging tasks (e.g., computer vision). However, many approaches have limited interpretability, so their success and failure modes are difficult to understand and their scientific robustness is difficult to evaluate. Thus, there is an urgent need for better understanding of the scientific reasoning behind data mining and machine learning approaches. This requires taking a transdisciplinary view of data science and recognizing its foundations in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Focusing on the geospatial domain, we apply this crucial transdisciplinary perspective to five common geospatial techniques (hotspot detection, colocation detection, prediction, outlier detection and teleconnection detection). We also describe challenges and opportunities for future advancement.

To deal with these problems, an indoor scene constrained method for localization is proposed in this paper, which is inspired by the visual cognition ability of the human brain and the progress in the computer vision field regarding high-level image understanding. Furthermore, a multi-sensor fusion method is implemented on a commercial smartphone including cameras, WiFi and inertial sensors. Compared to former research, the camera on a smartphone is used to “see” which scene the user is in. With this information, a particle filter algorithm constrained by scene information is adopted to determine the final location. For indoor scene recognition, we take advantage of deep learning that has been proven to be highly effective in the computer vision community. For particle filter, both WiFi and magnetic field signals are used to update the weights of particles. Similar to other fingerprinting localization methods, there are two stages in the proposed system, offline training and online localization. In the offline stage, an indoor scene model is trained by Caffe (one of the most popular open source frameworks for deep learning) and a fingerprint database is constructed by user trajectories in different scenes. To reduce the volume requirement of training data for deep learning, a fine-tuned method is adopted for model training. In the online stage, a camera in a smartphone is used to recognize the initial scene. Then a particle filter algorithm is used to fuse the sensor data and determine the final location. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, an Android client and a web server are implemented. The Android client is used to collect data and locate a user. The web server is developed for indoor scene model training and communication with an Android client. To evaluate the performance, comparison experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that a positioning accuracy of 1.32 m at 95% is achievable with the proposed solution. Both positioning accuracy and robustness are enhanced compared to approaches without scene constraint including commercial products such as IndoorAtlas.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - The need to have equitable access to quality healthcare is enshrined in the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which defines the developmental agenda of the UN for the next 15 years. In particular, the third SDG focuses on the need to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”. In this paper, we build the case that 5G wireless technology, along with concomitant emerging technologies (such as IoT, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning), will transform global healthcare systems in the near future. Our optimism around 5G-enabled healthcare stems from a confluence of significant technical pushes that are already at play: apart from the availability of high-throughput low-latency wireless connectivity, other significant factors include the democratization of computing through cloud computing; the democratization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing (e.g., IBM Watson); and the commoditization of data through crowdsourcing and digital exhaust. These technologies together can finally crack a dysfunctional healthcare system that has largely been impervious to technological innovations. We highlight the persistent deficiencies of the current healthcare system and then demonstrate how the 5G-enabled healthcare revolution can fix these deficiencies. We also highlight open technical research challenges, and potential pitfalls, that may hinder the development of such a 5G-enabled health revolution.

AB  - To promote sustainable development, the smart city implies a global vision that merges artificial intelligence, big data, decision making, information and communication technology (ICT), and the internet-of-things (IoT). The ageing issue is an aspect that researchers, companies and government should devote efforts in developing smart healthcare innovative technology and applications. In this paper, the topic of disease diagnosis in smart healthcare is reviewed. Typical emerging optimization algorithms and machine learning algorithms are summarized. Evolutionary optimization, stochastic optimization and combinatorial optimization are covered. Owning to the fact that there are plenty of applications in healthcare, four applications in the field of diseases diagnosis (which also list in the top 10 causes of global death in 2015), namely cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, and tuberculosis, are considered. In addition, challenges in the deployment of disease diagnosis in healthcare have been discussed.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - With the rapid development of smart cities in the world, research relating to smart city evaluation has become a new research hotspot in academia. However, there are general problems of cognitive deprivation, lack of planning experience, and low level of coordination in smart cities construction. It is necessary for us to develop a set of scientific, reasonable, and effective evaluation index systems and evaluation models to analyze the development degree of urban wisdom. Based on the theory of the urban system, we established a comprehensive evaluation index system for urban intelligent development based on the people-oriented, city-system, and resources-flow (PSF) evaluation model. According to the characteristics of the comprehensive evaluation index system of urban intelligent development, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) combined with the experts’ opinions determine the index weight of this system. We adopted the neural network model to construct the corresponding comprehensive evaluation model to characterize the non-linear characteristics of the comprehensive evaluation indexes system, thus to quantitatively quantify the comprehensive evaluation indexes of urban intelligent development. Finally, we used the AHP, AHP-BP (Back Propagation), and AHP-ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) models to evaluate the intelligent development level of 151 cities in China, and compared them from the perspective of model accuracy and time cost. The final simulation results show that the AHP-ELM model is the best evaluation model.

AB  - The importance of detection of parking space availability is still growing, particularly in major cities. This paper deals with the design of a distributed wireless camera system for the management of parking spaces, which can determine occupancy of the parking space based on the information from multiple cameras. The proposed system uses small camera modules based on Raspberry Pi Zero and computationally efficient algorithm for the occupancy detection based on the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) feature descriptor and support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We have included information about the orientation of the vehicle as a supporting feature, which has enabled us to achieve better accuracy. The described solution can deliver occupancy information at the rate of 10 parking spaces per second with more than 90% accuracy in a wide range of conditions. Reliability of the implemented algorithm is evaluated with three different test sets which altogether contain over 700,000 samples of parking spaces.

AB  - Notably valuable efforts have focused on helping people with special needs. In this work, we build upon the experience from the BlindHelper smartphone outdoor pedestrian navigation app and present Blind MuseumTourer, a system for indoor interactive autonomous navigation for blind and visually impaired persons and groups (e.g., pupils), which has primarily addressed blind or visually impaired (BVI) accessibility and self-guided tours in museums. A pilot prototype has been developed and is currently under evaluation at the Tactual Museum with the collaboration of the Lighthouse for the Blind of Greece. This paper describes the functionality of the application and evaluates candidate indoor location determination technologies, such as wireless local area network (WLAN) and surface-mounted assistive tactile route indications combined with Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons and inertial dead-reckoning functionality, to come up with a reliable and highly accurate indoor positioning system adopting the latter solution. The developed concepts, including map matching, a key concept for indoor navigation, apply in a similar way to other indoor guidance use cases involving complex indoor places, such as in hospitals, shopping malls, airports, train stations, public and municipality buildings, office buildings, university buildings, hotel resorts, passenger ships, etc. The presented Android application is effectively a Blind IndoorGuide system for accurate and reliable blind indoor navigation.

AB  - According to UNESCO, education is a fundamental human right and every nation’s citizens should be granted universal access with equal quality to it. Because this goal is yet to be achieved in most countries, in particular in the developing and underdeveloped countries, it is extremely important to find more effective ways to improve education. This paper presents a model based on the application of computational intelligence (data mining and data science) that leads to the development of the student’s knowledge profile and that can help educators in their decision making for best orienting their students. This model also tries to establish key performance indicators to monitor objectives’ achievement within individual strategic planning assembled for each student. The model uses random forest for classification and prediction, graph description for data structure visualization and recommendation systems to present relevant information to stakeholders. The results presented were built based on the real dataset obtained from a Brazilian private k-9 (elementary school). The obtained results include correlations among key data, a model to predict student performance and recommendations that were generated for the stakeholders.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 2
IS  - 1
SN  - 2413-8851

AB  - Slums are a global urban challenge, with less developed countries being particularly impacted. To adequately detect and map them, data is needed on their location, spatial extent and evolution. High- and very high-resolution remote sensing imagery has emerged as an important source of data in this regard. The purpose of this paper is to critically review studies that have used such data to detect and map slums. Our analysis shows that while such studies have been increasing over time, they tend to be concentrated to a few geographical areas and often focus on the use of a single approach (e.g., image texture and object-based image analysis), thus limiting generalizability to understand slums, their population, and evolution within the global context. We argue that to develop a more comprehensive framework that can be used to detect and map slums, other emerging sourcing of geospatial data should be considered (e.g., volunteer geographic information) in conjunction with growing trends and advancements in technology (e.g., geosensor networks). Through such data integration and analysis we can then create a benchmark for determining the most suitable methods for mapping slums in a given locality, thus fostering the creation of new approaches to address this challenge.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Among the current challenges of the Smart City, traffic management and maintenance are of utmost importance. Road surface monitoring is currently performed by humans, but the road surface condition is one of the main indicators of road quality, and it may drastically affect fuel consumption and the safety of both drivers and pedestrians. Abnormalities in the road, such as manholes and potholes, can cause accidents when not identified by the drivers. Furthermore, human-induced abnormalities, such as speed bumps, could also cause accidents. In addition, while said obstacles ought to be signalized according to specific road regulation, they are not always correctly labeled. Therefore, we developed a novel method for the detection of road abnormalities (i.e., speed bumps). This method makes use of a gyro, an accelerometer, and a GPS sensor mounted in a car. After having the vehicle cruise through several streets, data is retrieved from the sensors. Then, using a cross-validation strategy, a genetic algorithm is used to find a logistic model that accurately detects road abnormalities. The proposed model had an accuracy of 0.9714 in a blind evaluation, with a false positive rate smaller than 0.018, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9784. This methodology has the potential to detect speed bumps in quasi real-time conditions, and can be used to construct a real-time surface monitoring system.

AB  - As the era of big data approaches, big data has attracted increasing amounts of attention from researchers. Various types of studies have been conducted and these studies have focused particularly on the management, organization, and correlation of data and calculations using data. Most studies involving big data address applications in scientific, commercial, and ecological fields. However, the application of big data to government management is also needed. This paper examines the application of multi-source government data to urban construction and supervision in Tianjin, China. The analytic hierarchy process and a new approach called the correlation degree algorithm are introduced to calculate the degree of correlation between different approval items in one construction project and between different construction projects. The results show that more than 75% of the construction projects and their approval items are highly correlated. The results of this study suggest that most of the examined construction projects are well supervised, have relatively high probabilities of satisfying the relevant legal requirements, and observe their initial planning schemes.

The City4Age H2020 project is working on the early detection of the risks related to mild cognitive impairment and frailty and on providing meaningful interventions that prevent these risks. As part of the risk detection process, we have developed a multilevel conceptual model that describes the user behaviour using actions, activities, and intra- and inter-activity behaviour. Using this conceptual model, we have created a deep learning architecture based on long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) that models the inter-activity behaviour. The presented architecture offers a probabilistic model that allows us to predict the user’s next actions and to identify anomalous user behaviours.

AB  - Mobility is a significant robotic task. It is the most important function when robotics is applied to domains such as autonomous cars, home service robots, and autonomous underwater vehicles. Despite extensive research on this topic, robots still suffer from difficulties when moving in complex environments, especially in practical applications. Therefore, the ability to have enough intelligence while moving is a key issue for the success of robots. Researchers have proposed a variety of methods and algorithms, including navigation and tracking. To help readers swiftly understand the recent advances in methodology and algorithms for robot movement, we present this survey, which provides a detailed review of the existing methods of navigation and tracking. In particular, this survey features a relation-based architecture that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of mobile intelligence. We first outline the key problems in robot systems and point out the relationship among robotics, navigation, and tracking. We then illustrate navigation using different sensors and the fusion methods and detail the state estimation and tracking models for target maneuvering. Finally, we address several issues of deep learning as well as the mobile intelligence of robots as suggested future research topics. The contributions of this survey are threefold. First, we review the literature of navigation according to the applied sensors and fusion method. Second, we detail the models for target maneuvering and the existing tracking based on estimation, such as the Kalman filter and its series developed form, according to their model-construction mechanisms: linear, nonlinear, and non-Gaussian white noise. Third, we illustrate the artificial intelligence approach—especially deep learning methods—and discuss its combination with the estimation method.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - New technologies such as sensor networks have been incorporated into the management of buildings for organizations and cities. Sensor networks have led to an exponential increase in the volume of data available in recent years, which can be used to extract consumption patterns for the purposes of energy and monetary savings. For this reason, new approaches and strategies are needed to analyze information in big data environments. This paper proposes a methodology to extract electric energy consumption patterns in big data time series, so that very valuable conclusions can be made for managers and governments. The methodology is based on the study of four clustering validity indices in their parallelized versions along with the application of a clustering technique. In particular, this work uses a voting system to choose an optimal number of clusters from the results of the indices, as well as the application of the distributed version of the k-means algorithm included in Apache Spark’s Machine Learning Library. The results, using electricity consumption for the years 2011–2017 for eight buildings of a public university, are presented and discussed. In addition, the performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using synthetic big data, which cab represent thousands of buildings in a smart city. Finally, policies derived from the patterns discovered are proposed to optimize energy usage across the university campus.

AB  - In this paper, we see the Data Centers (DCs) as producers of waste heat integrated with smart energy infrastructures, heat which can be re-used for nearby neighborhoods. We provide a model of the thermo-electric processes within DCs equipped with heat reuse technology, allowing them to adapt their thermal response profile to meet various levels of hot water demand. On top of the model, we have implemented computational fluid dynamics-based simulations to determine the cooling system operational parameters settings, which allow the heat to build up without endangering the servers’ safety operation as well as the distribution of the workload on the servers to avoid hot spots. This will allow for setting higher temperature set points for short periods of time and using pre-cooling and post-cooling as flexibility mechanisms for DC thermal profile adaptation. To reduce the computational time complexity, we have used neural networks, which are trained using the simulation results. Experiments have been conducted considering a small operational DC featuring a server room of 24 square meters and 60 servers organized in four racks. The results show the DCs’ potential to meet different levels of thermal energy demand by re-using their waste heat in nearby neighborhoods.

AB  - We are living in a data-driven society. Big Data and the Internet of Things are popular terms. Governments, universities and the private sector make great investments in collecting and storing data and also extracting new knowledge from these data banks. Technological enthusiasm runs throughout political discourses. “Algorithmic regulation” is defined as a form of data-driven governance. Big Data shall offer brand new opportunities in scientific research. At the same time, political criticism of data storage grows because of a lack of privacy protection and the centralization of data in the hands of governments and corporations. Calls for data-driven dynamic regulation have existed in the past. In Chile, cybernetic development led to the creation of Cybersyn, a computer system that was created to manage the socialist economy under the Allende government 1971–1973. My contribution will present this Cybersyn project created by Stafford Beer. Beer proposed the creation of a “liberty machine” in which expert knowledge would be grounded in data-guided policy. The paper will focus on the human–technological complex in society. The first section of the paper will discuss whether the political and social environment can completely change the attempts of algorithmic regulation. I will deal specifically with the development of technological knowledge in Chile, a postcolonial state, and the relationship between citizens and data storage in a socialist state. In a second section, I will examine the question of which measures can lessen the danger of data storage regarding privacy in a democratic society. Lastly, I will discuss how much data-driven governance is required for democracy and political participation. I will present a second case study: digital participatory budgeting (DPB) in Brazil.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Aiming for sustainable buildings and cities is critical to achieving a future that is socially just, ecologically regenerative, culturally rich, and economically viable. However, our current concepts of sustainability often exclude the essential domains of data, information, and the knowledge relating to the relationship between buildings and people that inhabit them. Thus, the research questions at the core of this paper have been as follows: Can technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) be used to create systems that enhance relationships between buildings and inhabitants? Can social networks and natural interactions support further research relating to human-centric design tools for the built environment? The Human Observation Meta-Environment (HOME) project was developed to address this question. The ICT architecture has been tested to observe and collect human behaviour data within a sentient room at the Politecnico di Torino (IT), where the inhabitants were strategically aware of their behaviours. Methods of analysis included technologies related to the domain of AI (such as Natural Language Analysis, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Deep Learning) that have been used in social network analysis in connection with the word &lsquo;comfort&rsquo;, and definitions resonate strongly with the realm of regenerative design. Results were used to further research the role of users that could serve as leverages to design (both spaces and related smart systems) according to actual user needs. People from very different disciplinary backgrounds interacted with the prototype in a workshop and provided stimuli for further considerations regarding the possible technological, psychological, cognitive, cultural, social, political, and aesthetical impacts of the use of these technologies inside sentient buildings. The paper enriches the discourse on how ICT data can be organised and read in a human-centric regenerative design process perspective.

AB  - Many municipalities express a wish to use digital technologies to achieve environmental aims. However, there is still a need for a better understanding of how this should practically be done, both among municipalities and among ICT developers. We have used workshops and literature studies to formulate technological abilities of digitalization. We use two EU directives that are relevant for municipal environmental goals and combine the activities that these directives indicate with technological abilities of digitalization, in order to formulate practical implementations of digital technology to help these activities and reach the directives&rsquo; goals. We suggest that this method can be used for any municipal goal, as follows: (1) Identify the objective (in our case set by the EU-directives); (2) Identify what activities these points will require or generate; (3a) From a municipal viewpoint: Based on the results of 1 and 2, formulate and structure ideas of how digitalization can support the objectives and how those ideas can be implemented; (3b) From a provider&rsquo;s viewpoint: Investigate what digital solutions supporting 1 and 2 exist, or how existing services can be tweaked to support the objectives and explore how new digital solutions supporting 1 and 2 can be developed.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Human activity recognition is a challenging problem for context-aware systems and applications. It is gaining interest due to the ubiquity of different sensor sources, wearable smart objects, ambient sensors, etc. This task is usually approached as a supervised machine learning problem, where a label is to be predicted given some input data, such as the signals retrieved from different sensors. For tackling the human activity recognition problem in sensor network environments, in this paper we propose the use of deep learning (convolutional neural networks) to perform activity recognition using the publicly available OPPORTUNITY dataset. Instead of manually choosing a suitable topology, we will let an evolutionary algorithm design the optimal topology in order to maximize the classification F1 score. After that, we will also explore the performance of committees of the models resulting from the evolutionary process. Results analysis indicates that the proposed model was able to perform activity recognition within a heterogeneous sensor network environment, achieving very high accuracies when tested with new sensor data. Based on all conducted experiments, the proposed neuroevolutionary system has proved to be able to systematically find a classification model which is capable of outperforming previous results reported in the state-of-the-art, showing that this approach is useful and improves upon previously manually-designed architectures.

AB  - Smart city (SC) technologies can provide appropriate services according to citizens&rsquo; demands. One of the key enablers in a SC is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which enables a massive number of devices to connect with each other. However, these devices usually come from different manufacturers with different product standards, which confront interactive control problems. Moreover, these devices will produce large amounts of data, and efficiently analyzing these data for intelligent services. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial intelligence-based semantic IoT (AI-SIoT) hybrid service architecture to integrate heterogeneous IoT devices to support intelligent services. In particular, the proposed architecture is empowered by semantic and AI technologies, which enable flexible connections among heterogeneous devices. The AI technology can support very implement efficient data analysis and make accurate decisions on service provisions in various kinds. Furthermore, we also present several practical use cases of the proposed AI-SIoT architecture and the opportunities and challenges to implement the proposed AI-SIoT for future SCs are also discussed.

AB  - In this paper, we report a study having as a main goal the obtaining of a method that can provide an accurate forecast of the residential electricity consumption, refining it up to the appliance level, using sensor recorded data, for residential smart homes complexes that use renewable energy sources as a part of their consumed electricity, overcoming the limitations of not having available historical meteorological data and the unwillingness of the contractor to acquire such data periodically in the future accurate short-term forecasts from a specialized institute due to the implied costs. In this purpose, we have developed a mixed artificial neural network (ANN) approach using both non-linear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) ANNs and function fitting neural networks (FITNETs). We have used a large dataset containing detailed electricity consumption data recorded by sensors, monitoring a series of individual appliances, while in the NARX case we have also used timestamps datasets as exogenous variables. After having developed and validated the forecasting method, we have compiled it in view of incorporating it into a cloud solution, being delivered to the contractor that can provide it as a service for a monthly fee to both the operators and residential consumers.

AB  - The rapid development of the smart grid has led to higher maintenance cost and greater scalability of transmission lines. An effective and secure monitoring system for power lines has become a bottleneck restricting the intellectualization of power grids. To address this problem, a novel method is proposed for the intelligent monitoring of power grids (Robot Delay-Tolerant Sensor Network, RDTSN) based on an inspection robot, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and Delay-Tolerant Sensor Network (DTSN) to achieve low-cost, energy-efficient, elastic and remote monitoring of power grids. With RDTSN, a smart grid can detect the fault of transmission lines and evaluate the operational state of power grids. To build an effective monitoring system for a smart grid, this research focuses on designing a methodology that achieves efficient and secure delivery of the data inspected on transmission lines. Multiple RDTSN scenarios are performed, in which different routing algorithms are explored to determine the optimal parameters, with a balance in network performance and financial cost. Furthermore, a data delivery strategy is introduced to ensure communication security.

AB  - In the last few years, a large number of smart meters have been deployed in buildings to continuously monitor fine-grained energy consumption. Meteorological data deeply impact energy consumption, and an in-depth analysis of collected and correlated data can uncover interesting and actionable insights to improve the overall energy balance of our communities and to enhance people&rsquo;s awareness of energy wasting. To effectively extract meaningful and interpretable insights from large collections of energy measurements and multi-dimensional meteorological data, innovative data science methodologies should be devised. Research frontiers are addressing self-learning approaches, which allow non-experts to exploit machine learning techniques more easily, and algorithmic transparency of models, hence providing actionable, explicit, declarative knowledge representation. This paper presents METeorological Data Analysis for Thermal Energy CHaracterization (METATECH), a data mining engine based on both exploratory and unsupervised data analytics algorithms, devised to build transparent models correlating weather conditions and energy consumption in buildings. METATECH exploits a joint approach coupling cluster analysis and generalized association rules to allow a deeper yet human-readable understanding of how meteorological data impact heating consumption. First, a partitional clustering algorithm is applied to weather conditions. Then, resulting clusters are characterized by means of generalized association rules, which provide a self-learning explainable model of the most interesting correlations between energy consumption and weather conditions at different granularity levels. The experimental evaluation performed on real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in automatically extracting interesting knowledge from data, and provide it transparently to domain experts.

AB  - The increase of consumer income has resulted in the rapid development of the retail industry in China, which provides high market potential for retail companies worldwide. However, site selection for retail shops has been a confusing business issue in practical business decisions. In this study, a two-step hybrid model in site selection for small retail shops was proposed. The two steps were spatial accessibility evaluation and market potential estimation. The spatial accessibility of target regions was evaluated based on the improved gravity model to determine regions that lack retail shops. Then, a PCA (principal component analysis)&ndash;BP (backpropagation network) model was established to estimate the market potential in the target regions. The two-step model could determine sites with the most market potential and low competition. We conducted the experiment in Guiyang, China and considered 18 socioeconomic factors to make the site selection convincing. Through the experiment, 42 locations were determined with high business value; the locations were recommended to the new retail shops. The accuracy of the PCA&ndash;BP model was then proven satisfactory by comparing it with other regression methods. The proposed model could guide retail chains in enhancing business location planning and formulating regional development policies.

AB  - This paper serves as a survey and empirical evaluation of the state-of-the-art in activity recognition methods using accelerometers. The paper is particularly focused on long-term activity recognition in real-world settings. In these environments, data collection is not a trivial matter; thus, there are performance trade-offs between prediction accuracy, which is not the sole system objective, and keeping the maintenance overhead at minimum levels. We examine research that has focused on the selection of activities, the features that are extracted from the accelerometer data, the segmentation of the time-series data, the locations of accelerometers, the selection and configuration trade-offs, the test/retest reliability, and the generalisation performance. Furthermore, we study these questions from an experimental platform and show, somewhat surprisingly, that many disparate experimental configurations yield comparable predictive performance on testing data. Our understanding of these results is that the experimental setup directly and indirectly defines a pathway for context to be delivered to the classifier, and that, in some settings, certain configurations are more optimal than alternatives. We conclude by identifying how the main results of this work can be used in practice, specifically in experimental configurations in challenging experimental conditions.

AB  - Depressive disorders cover a set of disabling problems, often chronic or recurrent. They are characterized by a high level of psychiatric and somatic comorbidities and represent an important public health problem. To date, therapeutic solutions remain unsatisfactory. For some researchers, this is a sign of decisive paradigmatic failure due to the way in which disorders are conceptualized. They hypothesize that the symptoms of a categorical disorder, or of different comorbid disorders, can be interwoven in chains of interdependencies on different elements, of which it would be possible to act independently and synergistically to influence the functioning of the symptom system, rather than limiting oneself to targeting a hypothetical single underlying cause. New connected technologies make it possible to invent new observation and intervention tools allowing better phenotypic characterization of disorders and their evolution, that fit particularly well into this new &ldquo;symptoms network&rdquo; paradigm. Synergies are possible and desirable between these technological and epistemological innovations and can possibly help to solve some of the difficult problems people with mental disorders face in their everyday life, as we will show through a fictional case study exploring the possibilities of connected technologies in mental disorders in the near future.

AB  - The traditional classification methods for limb motion recognition based on sEMG have been deeply researched and shown promising results. However, information loss during feature extraction reduces the recognition accuracy. To obtain higher accuracy, the deep learning method was introduced. In this paper, we propose a parallel multiple-scale convolution architecture. Compared with the state-of-art methods, the proposed architecture fully considers the characteristics of the sEMG signal. Larger sizes of kernel filter than commonly used in other CNN-based hand recognition methods are adopted. Meanwhile, the characteristics of the sEMG signal, that is, muscle independence, is considered when designing the architecture. All the classification methods were evaluated on the NinaPro database. The results show that the proposed architecture has the highest recognition accuracy. Furthermore, the results indicate that parallel multiple-scale convolution architecture with larger size of kernel filter and considering muscle independence can significantly increase the classification accuracy.

VL  - 18

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) utilizes algorithms to facilitate intelligent applications across cities in the form of smart-urban projects. As the majority of devices in IoT are battery operated, their applications should be facilitated with a low-power communication setup. Such facility is possible through the Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN), but at a constrained bit rate. For long-range communication over LPWAN, several approaches and protocols are adopted. One such protocol is the Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), which is a media access layer protocol for long-range communication between the devices and the application servers via LPWAN gateways. However, LoRaWAN comes with fewer security features as a much-secured protocol consumes more battery because of the exorbitant computational overheads. The standard protocol fails to support end-to-end security and perfect forward secrecy while being vulnerable to the replay attack that makes LoRaWAN limited in supporting applications where security (especially end-to-end security) is important. Motivated by this, an enhanced LoRaWAN security protocol is proposed, which not only provides the basic functions of connectivity between the application server and the end device, but additionally averts these listed security issues. The proposed protocol is developed with two options, the Default Option (DO) and the Security-Enhanced Option (SEO). The protocol is validated through Burrows&ndash;Abadi&ndash;Needham (BAN) logic and the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. The proposed protocol is also analyzed for overheads through system-based and low-power device-based evaluations. Further, a case study on a smart factory-enabled parking system is considered for its practical application. The results, in terms of network latency with reliability fitting and signaling overheads, show paramount improvements and better performance for the proposed protocol compared with the two handshake options, Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) is essential for understanding people&rsquo;s habits and behaviors, providing an important data source for precise marketing and research in psychology and sociology. Different approaches have been proposed and applied to HAR. Data segmentation using a sliding window is a basic step during the HAR procedure, wherein the window length directly affects recognition performance. However, the window length is generally randomly selected without systematic study. In this study, we examined the impact of window length on smartphone sensor-based human motion and pose pattern recognition. With data collected from smartphone sensors, we tested a range of window lengths on five popular machine-learning methods: decision tree, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, Gaussian na&iuml;ve Bayesian, and adaptive boosting. From the results, we provide recommendations for choosing the appropriate window length. Results corroborate that the influence of window length on the recognition of motion modes is significant but largely limited to pose pattern recognition. For motion mode recognition, a window length between 2.5&ndash;3.5 s can provide an optimal tradeoff between recognition performance and speed. Adaptive boosting outperformed the other methods. For pose pattern recognition, 0.5 s was enough to obtain a satisfactory result. In addition, all of the tested methods performed well.

AB  - Automatic data annotation eliminates most of the challenges we faced due to the manual methods of annotating sensor data. It significantly improves users&rsquo; experience during sensing activities since their active involvement in the labeling process is reduced. An unsupervised learning technique such as clustering can be used to automatically annotate sensor data. However, the lingering issue with clustering is the validation of generated clusters. In this paper, we adopted the k-means clustering algorithm for annotating unlabeled sensor data for the purpose of detecting sensitive location information of mobile crowd sensing users. Furthermore, we proposed a cluster validation index for the k-means algorithm, which is based on Multiple Pair-Frequency. Thereafter, we trained three classifiers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Na&iuml;ve Bayes) using cluster labels generated from the k-means clustering algorithm. The accuracy, precision, and recall of these classifiers were evaluated during the classification of &ldquo;non-sensitive&rdquo; and &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; data from motion and location sensors. Very high accuracy scores were recorded from Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers while a fairly high accuracy score was recorded from the Na&iuml;ve Bayes classifier. With the hybridized machine learning (unsupervised and supervised) technique presented in this paper, unlabeled sensor data was automatically annotated and then classified.

These challenges include reverse power flow, voltage fluctuations, power quality issues, dynamic stability, big data challenges and others. This paper investigates the existing challenges with the current level of PV penetration and looks into the challenges with high PV penetration in future scenarios such as smart cities, transactive energy, proliferation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), possible eclipse events, big data issues and environmental impacts. Within the context of these future scenarios, this paper reviewed the existing solutions and provides insights to new and future solutions that could be explored to ultimately address these issues and improve the smart grid&rsquo;s security, reliability and resiliency.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 18
IS  - 7
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The high rate of vehicle-crash victims has a fatal economic and social impact in today&rsquo;s societies. In particular, road crashes where heavy vehicles are involved cause more severe damage because they are prone to rollover. For this reason, many researches are focused on developing RSC Roll Stability Control (RSC) systems. Concerning the design of RSC systems with an adequate performance, it is mandatory to know the dynamics of the vehicle. The main problem arises from the lack of ability to directly capture several required dynamic vehicle variables, such as roll angle, from low-cost sensors. Previous studies demonstrate that low-cost sensors can provide data in real-time with the required precision and reliability. Even more, other research works indicate that neural networks are efficient mechanisms to estimate roll angle. Nevertheless, it is necessary to assess that the fusion of data coming from low-cost devices and estimations provided by neural networks can fulfill hard real-time processing constraints, achieving high level of accuracy during circulation of a vehicle in real situations. In order to address this issue, this study has two main goals: (1) Design and develop an IoT based architecture, integrating ANN in low cost kits with different hardware architectures in order to estimate under real-time constraints the vehicle roll angle. This architecture is able to work under high dynamic conditions, by following specific best practices and considerations during its design; (2) assess that the IoT architecture deployed in low-cost experimental kits achieve the hard real-time performance constraints estimating the roll angle with the required calculation accuracy. To fulfil these objectives, an experimental environment was set up, composed of a van with two set of low-cost kits, one including a Raspberry Pi 3 Model Band the other having an Intel Edison System on Chip linked to a SparkFun 9 Degrees of Freedom module. This experimental environment be tested in different maneuvers for comparison purposes. Neural networks embedded in low-cost sensor kits provide roll angle estimations highly approximated to real values. Even more, Intel Edison and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B have enough computing capabilities to successfully run roll angle estimation based on neural networks to determine rollover risk situations, fulfilling real-time operation restrictions stated for this problem.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In modern society, air pollution is an important topic as this pollution exerts a critically bad influence on human health and the environment. Among air pollutants, Particulate Matter (PM2.5) consists of suspended particles with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 &mu;m. Sources of PM2.5 can be coal-fired power generation, smoke, or dusts. These suspended particles in the air can damage the respiratory and cardiovascular systems of the human body, which may further lead to other diseases such as asthma, lung cancer, or cardiovascular diseases. To monitor and estimate the PM2.5 concentration, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are combined and applied to the PM2.5 forecasting system. To compare the overall performance of each algorithm, four measurement indexes, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) Pearson correlation coefficient and Index of Agreement (IA) are applied to the experiments in this paper. Compared with other machine learning methods, the experimental results showed that the forecasting accuracy of the proposed CNN-LSTM model (APNet) is verified to be the highest in this paper. For the CNN-LSTM model, its feasibility and practicability to forecast the PM2.5 concentration are also verified in this paper. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a deep neural network model that integrates the CNN and LSTM architectures, and through historical data such as cumulated hours of rain, cumulated wind speed and PM2.5 concentration. In the future, this study can also be applied to the prevention and control of PM2.5.

AB  - Railway industry plays a critical role in transportation and transit systems attributed to the ever-growing demand for catering to both freight and passengers. However, owing to many challenges faced by railway stations such as harsh environments, traffic flow, safety and security risks, new and adaptive systems employing new technology are recommended. In this review, several wireless sensor networks (WSNs) applications are proposed for use in railway station systems, including advanced WSNs, which will enhance security, safety, and decision-making processes to achieve more cost-effective management in railway stations, as well as the development of integrated systems. The size, efficiency, and cost of WSNs are influential factors that attract the railway industry to adopt these devices. This paper presents a review of WSNs that have been designed for uses in monitoring and securing railway stations. This article will first briefly focus on the presence of different WSN applications in diverse applications. In addition, it is important to note that exploitation of the state-of-the-art tools and techniques such as WSNs to gain an enormous amount of data from a railway station is a new and novel concept requiring the development of artificial intelligence methods, such machine learning, which will be vital for the future of the railway industry.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, cloud computing and fog computing have appeared one after the other, as promising technologies for augmenting the computing capability of devices locally. By offloading computational tasks to fog servers or cloud servers, the time for task processing decreases greatly. Thus, to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) of smart manufacturing systems, fog servers are deployed at network edge to provide fog computing services. In this paper, we study the following problems in a mixed computing system: (1) which computing mode should be chosen for a task in local computing, fog computing or cloud computing? (2) In the fog computing mode, what is the execution sequence for the tasks cached in a task queue? Thus, to solve the problems above, we design a Software-Defined Network (SDN) framework in a smart factory based on an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) system. A method based on Computing Mode Selection (CMS) and execution sequences based on the task priority (ASTP) is proposed in this paper. First, a CMS module is designed in the SDN controller and then, after operating the CMS algorithm, each task obtains an optimal computing mode. Second, the task priorities can be calculated according to their real-time performance and calculated amount. According to the task priority, the SDN controller sends a flow table to the SDN switch to complete the task transmission. In other words, the higher the task priority is, the earlier the fog computing service is obtained. Finally, a series of experiments and simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our method can achieve real-time performance and high reliability in IIoT.

AB  - While applications of big data have been extensively studied, discussion is mostly made from the perspectives of computer science, Internet services, and informatics. Alternatively, this article takes the big data approach as an institutional innovation and uses the problem of illegal subdivided units (ISUs) in Hong Kong as a case study. High transaction costs incurred in identification of suspected ISUs and associated enforcement actions lead to a proliferation of ISUs in the city. We posit that the deployment of big data analytics can lower these transaction costs, enabling the government to tackle the problem of illegal accommodations. We propose a framework for big data collection, analysis, and feedback. As the findings of a structured questionnaire survey reveal, building professionals believed that the proposed framework could reduce transaction costs of ISU identification. Yet, concerns associated with the big data approach like privacy and predictive policing were also raised by the professionals.

AB  - In the era of Big Data and IoT, successful systems have to be designed to discover, store, process, learn, analyse, and predict from a massive amount of data&mdash;in short, they have to behave intelligently. Despite the success of non-symbolic techniques such as deep learning, symbolic approaches to machine intelligence still have a role to play in order to achieve key properties such as observability, explainability, and accountability. In this paper we focus on logic programming (LP), and advocate its role as a provider of symbolic reasoning capabilities in IoT scenarios, suitably complementing non-symbolic ones. In particular, we show how its re-interpretation in terms of LPaaS (Logic Programming as a Service) can work as an enabling technology for distributed situated intelligence. A possible example of hybrid reasoning&mdash;where symbolic and non-symbolic techniques fruitfully combine to produce intelligent behaviour&mdash;is presented, demonstrating how LPaaS could work in a smart energy grid scenario.

AB  - With the expansion of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) in smart cities, the shared bicycle has developed quickly as a new green public transportation mode, and is changing the travel habits of citizens heavily across the world, especially in China. The purpose of the current paper is to provide an inclusive review and survey on shared bicycle besides its benefits, history, brands and comparisons. In addition, it proposes the concept of the Internet of Shared Bicycle (IoSB) for the first time, as far as we know, to find a feasible solution for those technical problems of the shared bicycle. The possible architecture of IoSB in our opinion is presented, as well as most of key IoT technologies, and their capabilities to merge into and apply to the different parts of IoSB are introduced. Meanwhile, some challenges and barriers to IoSB&rsquo;s implementation are expressed thoroughly too. As far as the advice for overcoming those barriers be concerned, the IoSB&rsquo;s potential aspects and applications in smart city with respect to technology development in the future provide another valuable further discussion in this paper.

TI  - Economically Incentivising Smart Urban Regeneration. Case Study of Port Louis, Mauritius
T2  - Smart Cities

VL  - 1
IS  - 1
SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Port Louis, the capital city of Mauritius, has been the preferred city for hosting the judicial, political and business activities of the country for the past two centuries. However, new policies have created nine new smart cities in greenfield locations within 10 km from Port Louis, so the capital city is facing economic decline as it is losing businesses, as well as administrative functions. This loss equates to an erosion in municipal revenue along with a reduced interest in contributing to the development of the city; all of which takes a toll on its urban economic landscape, as well as on the broader Mauritian economy. This paper builds from the findings of a focus group study to propose a smart urban regeneration model for the City of Port Louis, which could enable the old city to be restored and regenerated rather than redeveloped in modernist architecture, as has happened in the new smart cities model. A smart urban regeneration model is proposed backed by the pillars of smart infrastructure, culture, metabolism and governance. The proposed model is applied to the context of Port Louis to generate an urban regeneration scheme. The potential benefits in terms of financial outcomes, investment attraction and job creation are explored through a combined application of econometric forecasting models. The results support positive figures of both investment and job creation, and the findings of this study aim at informing and providing the governing bodies of Port Louis with a tangible solution for revamping the centuries-old capital city, as well as demonstrating to the world that smart cities can mean sensitive urban regeneration.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - At present, due to their geographical distribution, environmental conditions and traditional monitoring technologies, the manual inspection of brine pumps in Qinghai Saline Lake can not be effectively carried out in real time, so the pumps have a high failure rate. This has seriously affected the chemical production of this saline lake. The paper designed a remote real-time monitoring terminal and a decision support system based on LoRa technology, GPRS (General Packet Radio Services) remote communication technology and remote-control technology. The system integrated the liquid-level sensing model and the decision support model for brine pump management. The system monitored and analyzed the voltage, current, and liquid-level parameters in real time to determine the operating status or failure of the brine pump. The ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) method was used to establish the correlation models between the dynamic monitoring information and the brine pump failure, which is the core of the decision support model. The remote controller was implemented to display and control the running status of the brine pumps when the maintenance personnel received the warning information. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) language and a MySQL database were implemented to realize the data display, management and decision support system.

More and more sensors and communication technologies (e.g., cloud computing) are being integrated into cars, which opens up a new design space for vehicular-based applications. In this paper, we present the Spatial Optimized Dynamic Path Planning algorithm. Our contributions are, firstly, to enhance the effective of loading mechanism for road maps by dividing the connected sub-net, and building a spatial index; and secondly, to enhance the effect of the dynamic path planning by optimizing the search direction. We use the real road network and real-time traffic flow data of Karamay city to simulate the effect of our algorithm. Experiments show that our Spatial Optimized Dynamic Path Planning algorithm can significantly reduce the time complexity, and is better suited for use as a real-time navigation system. The algorithm can achieve superior real-time performance and obtain the optimal solution in dynamic path planning.

VL  - 7

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - We introduce a device for the automatic detecting and reporting of crawling insects in urban environments. It is a monitoring device for urban pests that complies with the context of smart homes and smart cities, and is compatible with the emerging discipline of the Internet of Things (IoT). We believe it can find its place in every room of a hotel, hospital, military camp, and residence. This box-shaped device attracts targeted insect pests, senses the entering insect, and takes automatically a picture of the internal space of the box. The e-trap includes strong attractants (pheromone and/or food) to increase capture efficiency and traps the insect on its sticky floor. The device carries the necessary optoelectronic sensors to monitor all entrances of the trap. As the insect enters it interrupts the infrared light source. This triggers a detection event; a picture is taken, and a time-stamp is set before delivering the picture through the Wi-Fi to an authorized person/stakeholder. The device can be integrated seamlessly in urban environments and operates unobtrusively to human activities. We report results on various insect pests and depending on the insect species, can reach a detection accuracy ranging from 96 to 99%.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The emerging fog computing technology is characterized by an ultralow latency response, which benefits a massive number of time-sensitive services and applications in the Internet of things (IoT) era. To this end, the fog computing infrastructure must minimize latencies for both service delivery and execution phases. While the transmission latency significantly depends on external factors (e.g., channel bandwidth, communication resources, and interferences), the computation latency can be considered as an internal issue that the fog computing infrastructure could actively self-handle. From this view point, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that utilizes the evolution strategies for real-time task assignment among fog servers to minimize the total computation latency during a long-term period. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the latency by approximately 16.1% compared to the existing methods. Additionally, the proposed learning algorithm has low computational complexity and an effectively parallel operation; therefore, it is especially appropriate to be implemented in modern heterogeneous computing platforms.

AB  - This study investigates how the development of artificial intelligence (AI) is perceived by the students enrolled in technical and humanistic specializations at two universities in Timisoara. It has an emphasis on identifying their attitudes towards the phenomenon, on the connotations associated with it, and on the possible impact of artificial intelligence on certain areas of the social life. Moreover, the present study reveals the students&rsquo; perceptions on the sustainability of these changes and developments, and therefore aims to reduce the possible negative impact on consumers, and at anticipate the changes that AI will produce in the future. In order to collect the data, the authors have used a quantitative research method. A questionnaire-based sociological survey was completed by 928 students, with a representation error of only &plusmn;3%. The analysis has shown that a great number of respondents have a positive attitude towards the emergence of AI, who believe it will influence society for the better. The results have also underscored underlying differences based on the respondents&rsquo; type of specialization (humanistic or technical), and their gender.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet-of-things facilitates the development of many groundbreaking applications. A large number of these applications involve mobile end nodes and a sparsely deployed network of base stations that operate as gateways to the Internet. Most of the mobile nodes, at least within city areas, are connected through low power wide area networking technologies (LPWAN) using public frequencies. Mobility and sparse network coverage result in long delays and intermittent connectivity for the end nodes. Disruption Tolerant Networks and utilization of heterogeneous wireless interfaces have emerged as key technologies to tackle the problem at hand. The first technology renders communication resilient to intermittent connectivity by storing and carrying data while the later increases the communication opportunities of the end nodes and at the same time reduces energy consumption whenever short-range communication is possible. However, one has to consider that end nodes are typically both memory and energy constrained devices which makes finding an energy efficient data transmission policy for heterogeneous disruption tolerant networks imperative. In this work we utilize information related to the spatial availability of network resources and localization information to formulate the problem at hand as a dynamic programming problem. Next, we utilize the framework of Markov Decision Processes to derive approximately optimal and suboptimal data transmission policies. We also prove that we can achieve improved packet transmission policies and reduce energy consumption, extending battery lifetime. This is achieved by knowing the spatial availability of heterogeneous network resources combined with the mobile node&rsquo;s location information. Numerical resultsshow significant gains achieved by utilizing the derived approximately optimal and suboptimal policies.

AB  - Energy markets are based on energy transactions with a central control entity, where the players are companies. In this research work, we propose an IoT (Internet of Things) system for the accounting of energy flows, as well as a blockchain approach to overcome the need for a central control entity. This allows for the creation of local energy markets to handle distributed energy transactions without needing central control. In parallel, the system aggregates users into communities with target goals and creates new markets for players. These two approaches (blockchain and IoT) are brought together using a gamification approach, allowing for the creation and maintenance of a community for electricity market participation based on pre-defined goals. This community approach increases the number of market players and creates the possibility of traditional end users earning money through small coordinated efforts. We apply this approach to the aggregation of batteries from electrical vehicles so that they become a player in the spinning reserve market. It is also possible to apply this approach to local demand flexibility, associated with the demand response (DR) concept. DR is aggregated to allow greater flexibility in the regulation market based on an OpenADR approach that allows the turning on and off of predefined equipment to handle local microgeneration.

AB  - Traffic prediction is a critical task for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Prediction at intersections is challenging as it involves various participants, such as vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the accurate intersection traffic prediction by introducing extra data sources other than road traffic volume data into the prediction model. In particular, we take advantage of the data collected from the reports of road accidents and roadworks happening near the intersections. In addition, we investigate two types of learning schemes, namely batch learning and online learning. Three popular ensemble decision tree models are used in the batch learning scheme, including Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting Trees (XGBoost), while the Fast Incremental Model Trees with Drift Detection (FIMT-DD) model is adopted for the online learning scheme. The proposed approach is evaluated using public data sets released by the Victorian Government of Australia. The results indicate that the accuracy of intersection traffic prediction can be improved by incorporating nearby accidents and roadworks information.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT), inspired by the tremendous growth of connected heterogeneous devices, has pioneered the notion of smart city. Various components, i.e., smart transportation, smart community, smart healthcare, smart grid, etc. which are integrated within smart city architecture aims to enrich the quality of life (QoL) of urban citizens. However, real-time processing requirements and exponential data growth withhold smart city realization. Therefore, herein we propose a Big Data analytics (BDA)-embedded experimental architecture for smart cities. Two major aspects are served by the BDA-embedded smart city. Firstly, it facilitates exploitation of urban Big Data (UBD) in planning, designing, and maintaining smart cities. Secondly, it occupies BDA to manage and process voluminous UBD to enhance the quality of urban services. Three tiers of the proposed architecture are liable for data aggregation, real-time data management, and service provisioning. Moreover, offline and online data processing tasks are further expedited by integrating data normalizing and data filtering techniques to the proposed work. By analyzing authenticated datasets, we obtained the threshold values required for urban planning and city operation management. Performance metrics in terms of online and offline data processing for the proposed dual-node Hadoop cluster is obtained using aforementioned authentic datasets. Throughput and processing time analysis performed with regard to existing works guarantee the performance superiority of the proposed work. Hence, we can claim the applicability and reliability of implementing proposed BDA-embedded smart city architecture in the real world.

AB  - Governments these days are demanding better Smart City technologies in order to connect with citizens and understand their demands. For such governments, much needed information exists on social media where members belonging to diverse groups share different interests, post statuses, review and comment on various topics. Aspect extraction from this data can provide a thorough understanding of citizens&rsquo; behaviors and choices. Also, categorization of these aspects can better summarize societal concerns regarding political, economic, religious and social issues. Aspect category detection (ACD) from people reviews is one of the major tasks of aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). The success of ABSA is mainly defined by the inexpensive and accurate machine-processable representation of the raw input sentences. Previous approaches rely on cumbersome feature extraction procedures from sentences, which adds its own complexity and inaccuracy in performing ACD tasks. In this paper, we propose an inexpensive and simple method to obtain the most suitable representation of a sentence-vector through different algebraic combinations of a sentence&rsquo;s word vectors, which will act as an input to any machine learning classifier. We have tested our technique on the restaurant review data provided in SemEval-2015 and SemEval-2016. SemEval is a series of global challenges to evaluate the effectiveness of disambiguation of word sense. Our results showed the highest F1-scores of 76.40% in SemEval-2016 Task 5, and 94.99% in SemEval-2015 Task 12.

AB  - Urban environments are regions in which spectral variability and spatial variability are extremely high, with a huge range of shapes and sizes, and they also demand high resolution images for applications involving their study. Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the fa&ccedil;ade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based fa&ccedil;ade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the fa&ccedil;ade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The fa&ccedil;ade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - Network traffic classification aims to identify categories of traffic or applications of network packets or flows. It is an area that continues to gain attention by researchers due to the necessity of understanding the composition of network traffics, which changes over time, to ensure the network Quality of Service (QoS). Among the different methods of network traffic classification, the payload-based one (DPI) is the most accurate, but presents some drawbacks, such as the inability of classifying encrypted data, the concerns regarding the users&rsquo; privacy, the high computational costs, and ambiguity when multiple signatures might match. For that reason, machine learning methods have been proposed to overcome these issues. This work proposes a Multi-Objective Divide and Conquer (MODC) model for network traffic classification, by combining, into a hybrid model, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, based on the divide and conquer strategy. Additionally, it is a flexible model since it allows network administrators to choose between a set of parameters (pareto-optimal solutions), led by a multi-objective optimization process, by prioritizing flow or byte accuracies. Our method achieved 94.14% of average flow accuracy for the analyzed dataset, outperforming the six DPI-based tools investigated, including two commercial ones, and other machine learning-based methods.

AB  - With the coming of intelligent vehicles and vehicular communication, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) of connected vehicles are emerging and now evolving to Cooperative-ITS (C-ITS), as service platforms for smart cities. Considering new service properties, the autonomous cooperation of such vehicles has exhibited novel QoS features that imply new requirements: guaranteeing the traffic efficiency of any emergent vehicle while trying to promote the throughput at an intersection. So, after analyzing the classic reservation-based cooperation mechanisms, new QoS-oriented cooperation methods and policies are studied in this work. Concretely, several models of related traffic objects we have proposed are firstly introduced briefly. Then, the scheduling policies of vehicles approaching an intersection have been presented, including three existing policies (FAFP-SV, FAFP-SQ, and HQEP-SV) and five new polices (FAFP-SQ-SV, FAFP-MQ, HWFP-SQ, HWFP-SQ-SV, HWFP-MQ). These policies combine two major factors: vehicular priority for scheduling and concurrency in traffics. The first one includes the vehicular arrival-time, priority mapped to QoS, and the weight of reserved vehicles on a lane etc. In addition, the second refers to schedule a platoon rather than single vehicle each time, or platoons on different lanes instead of one platoon on only one lane. All these policies have been implemented, and further, verified within the parameter-configurable traffic simulator QoS-CITS (v2.1) we designed and developed with C#. Abundant experiments have been conducted with configured typical traffic scenes, and experimental results show that HWFP-SQ-SV and HWFP-MQ can guarantee both the QoS of emergent vehicles and traffic throughput better than other six policies.

AB  - Considering the radio-based indoor positioning system pertaining to signal degradation due to the environmental factors, and rising popularity of IP (Internet Protocol) cameras in cities, a novel fusion of inertial measurement units (IMUs) with external IP cameras to determine the positions of moving users in indoor environments is presented. This approach uses a fine-tuned Faster R-CNN (Region Convolutional Neural Network) to detect users in images captured by cameras, and acquires visual measurements including ranges and angles of users with respect to the cameras based on the proposed monocular vision relatively measuring (MVRM) method. The results are determined by integrating the positions predicted by each user&rsquo;s inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual measurements using an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter). The results experimentally show that the ranging accuracy is affected by both the detected bounding box&rsquo;s by Faster R-CNN height errors and diverse measuring distances, however, the heading accuracy is solely interfered with bounding box&rsquo;s horizontal biases. The indoor obstacles including stationary obstacles and a pedestrian in our tests more significantly decrease the accuracy of ranging than that of heading, and the effect of a pedestrian on the heading errors is greater than stationary obstacles on that. We implemented a positioning test for a single user and an external camera in five indoor scenarios to evaluate the performance. The robust fused IMU/MVRM solution significantly decreases the positioning errors and shows better performance in dense multipath scenarios compared with the pure MVRM solution and ultra-wideband (UWB) solution.

AB  - Smart cities work with large volumes of data from sensor networks and other sources. To prevent data from being compromised by attacks or errors, smart city IT administrators need to apply attack detection techniques to evaluate possible incidents as quickly as possible. Machine learning has proven to be effective in many fields and, in the context of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), it has proven adequate to detect attacks. However, a smart city poses a much more complex scenario than a WSN, and it has to be evaluated whether these techniques are equally valid and effective. In this work, we evaluate two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines (SVM) and isolation forests) to detect anomalies in a laboratory that reproduces a real smart city use case with heterogeneous devices, algorithms, protocols, and network configurations. The experience has allowed us to show that, although these techniques are of great value for smart cities, additional considerations must be taken into account to effectively detect attacks. Thus, through this empiric analysis, we point out broader challenges and difficulties of using machine learning in this context, both for the technical complexity of the systems, and for the technical difficulty of configuring and implementing them in such environments.

AB  - Electric power systems are experiencing relevant changes involving the growing penetration of distributed generation and energy storage systems, the introduction of electric vehicles, the management of responsive loads, the proposals for new energy markets and so on. Such an evolution is pushing a paradigm shift that is one of the most important challenges in power network design: the management must move from traditional planning and manual intervention to full &ldquo;smartization&rdquo; of medium and low voltage networks. Peculiarities and criticalities of future power distribution networks originate from the complexity of the system which includes both the physical aspects of electric networks and the cyber aspects, like data elaboration, feature extraction, communication, supervision and control; only fully integrated advanced monitoring systems can foster this transition towards network automation. The design and development of such future networks require distinct kinds of expertise in the industrial and information engineering fields. In this context, this paper provides a comprehensive review of current challenges and multidisciplinary interactions in the development of smart distribution networks. The aim of this paper is to discuss, in an integrated and organized manner, the state of the art while focusing on the need for interaction between different disciplines and highlighting how innovative and future-proof outcomes of both research and practice can only emerge from a coordinated design of all the layers in the smart distribution network architecture.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The new standard oneM2M (one machine-to-machine) aims to standardize the architecture and protocols of Internet of Things (IoT) middleware for better interoperability. Although the standard seems promising, it lacks several features for efficiently searching and retrieving IoT data which satisfy users&rsquo; intentions. In this paper, we design and develop a oneM2M-based query engine, called OMQ, that provides a real-time processing over IoT data streams. For this purpose, we define a query language which enables users to retrieve IoT data from data sources using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). We also propose efficient query processing algorithms which utilizes the oneM2M architecture consisting of two nodes: (1) the IoT node and (2) the infrastructure node. IoT nodes of OMQ are mainly sensor devices execute user queries the aggregate, transform and filter operators, whereas the infrastructure node handles the join operator of user queries. Since the query processing algorithms are implemented as the hybrid infrastructure-edge processing, user queries can be executed efficiently in each IoT node rather than only in the infrastructure node. Thus, our OMQ system reduces the query processing time and the network bandwidth. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of OMQ using a real and a synthetic data set. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of OMQ system for executing queries and transferring data from each IoT node.

VL  - 11

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Accurate forecasting of the produced and consumed electricity from wind farms is an essential aspect for wind power plant operators. In this context, our research addresses small-scale wind farms situated on hilly terrain, with the main purpose of overcoming the low accuracy limitations arising from the wind deflection, caused by the quite complex hilly terrain. A specific aspect of our devised forecasting method consists of incorporating advantages of recurrent long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, benefiting from their long-term dependencies, learning capabilities, and the advantages of feed-forward function fitting neural networks (FITNETs) that have the ability to map between a dataset of numeric inputs and a set of numeric targets. Another specific element of our approach consists of improving forecasting accuracy by means of refining the accuracy of the weather data input parameters within the same weather forecast resolution area. The developed method has power plant operators as main beneficiaries, but it can also be successfully applied in order to assess the energy potential of hilly areas with deflected wind, being useful for potential investors who want to build this type of wind farms. The method can be compiled and incorporated in the development of a wide range of customized applications targeting electricity forecasting for small wind farms situated on hilly terrain with deflected wind. The experimental results, the implementation of the developed method in a real production environment, its validation, and the comparison between our proposed method and other ones from the literature, confirm that the developed forecasting method represents an accurate, useful, and viable tool that addresses a gap in the current state of knowledge regarding the necessity for an accurate forecasting method that is able to predict with a high degree of accuracy both the produced and consumed electricity for small wind power plants situated on quite complex hilly terrain with deflected wind.

IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Tracking multiple pedestrians across multi-camera scenarios is an important part of intelligent video surveillance and has great potential application for public security, which has been an attractive topic in the literature in recent years. In most previous methods, artificial features such as color histograms, HOG descriptors and Haar-like feature were adopted to associate objects among different cameras. But there are still many challenges caused by low resolution, variation of illumination, complex background and posture change. In this paper, a feature extraction network named NCA-Net is designed to improve the performance of multiple objects tracking across multiple cameras by avoiding the problem of insufficient robustness caused by hand-crafted features. The network combines features learning and metric learning via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and the loss function similar to neighborhood components analysis (NCA). The loss function is adapted from the probability loss of NCA aiming at object tracking. The experiments conducted on the NLPR_MCT dataset show that we obtain satisfactory results even with a simple matching operation. In addition, we embed the proposed NCA-Net with two existing tracking systems. The experimental results on the corresponding datasets demonstrate that the extracted features using NCA-net can effectively make improvement on the tracking performance.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Every day we experience unprecedented data growth from numerous sources, which contribute to big data in terms of volume, velocity, and variability. These datasets again impose great challenges to analytics framework and computational resources, making the overall analysis difficult for extracting meaningful information in a timely manner. Thus, to harness these kinds of challenges, developing an efficient big data analytics framework is an important research topic. Consequently, to address these challenges by exploiting non-linear relationships from very large and high-dimensional datasets, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms are being used in analytics frameworks. Apache Spark has been in use as the fastest big data processing arsenal, which helps to solve iterative ML tasks, using distributed ML library called Spark MLlib. Considering real-world research problems, DL architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an effective approach to overcoming practical issues such as reduced accuracy, long-term sequence dependency, and vanishing and exploding gradient in conventional deep architectures. In this paper, we propose an efficient analytics framework, which is technically a progressive machine learning technique merged with Spark-based linear models, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and LSTM, using a two-stage cascade structure in order to enhance the predictive accuracy. Our proposed architecture enables us to organize big data analytics in a scalable and efficient way. To show the effectiveness of our framework, we applied the cascading structure to two different real-life datasets to solve a multiclass and a binary classification problem, respectively. Experimental results show that our analytical framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a high-level of classification accuracy.

AB  - In this paper, we study the influence of multipath magnitude, bandwidth, and communication link number on the performance of the existing time-reversal (TR) based fingerprinting localization approach and find that the localization accuracy deteriorates with a limited bandwidth. To improve the localization performance, by exploiting two unique location-specified signatures extracted from Channel State Information (CSI), we propose a high accuracy TR fingerprint localization approach, HATRFLA. Furthermore, we employ a density-based spatial clustering algorithm to minimize the storage space of the fingerprint database by adaptively selecting the optimal number of fingerprints for each location. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can efficiently mitigate accuracy deterioration caused by a limited bandwidth and consequently, achieve higher accuracy compared with the existing TR localization approach.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 10
IS  - 10
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to provide a theoretically and empirically grounded discussion on big data and to propose a conceptual framework for big data based on a temporal dimension. This study adopts two research methods. The first research method is a critical assessment of the literature that aims to identify the concept of big data in organizations. This method is composed of a search for source materials, the selection of the source materials, and their analysis and synthesis. It has been used to develop a conceptual framework for assessing an organization&rsquo;s readiness to adopt big data. The purpose of the second research method is to provide an initial verification of the developed framework. This verification consisted of conducting qualitative research with the use of an in-depth interview in 15 selected organizations. The main contribution of this study is the Temporal Big Data Maturity Model (TBDMM) framework, which can help to measure the current state of an organization&rsquo;s big data assets, and to plan their future development with respect to sustainability issues. The proposed framework has been built over a time dimension as a fundamental internal structure with the goal of providing a complete means for assessing an organization&rsquo;s readiness to process the temporal data and knowledge that can be found in modern information sources. The proposed framework distinguishes five maturity levels: atemporal, pre-temporal, partly temporal, predominantly temporal, and temporal, which are used to evaluate data/knowledge, information technology (IT) solutions, functionalities offered by IT solutions, and the sustainable development context.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) holds great promises to provide an edge cutting technology that enables numerous innovative services related to healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities and various human daily activities. In a typical IoT scenario, a large number of self-powered smart devices collect real-world data and communicate with each other and with the cloud through a wireless link in order to exchange information and to provide specific services. However, the high energy consumption associated with the wireless transmission limits the performance of these IoT self-powered devices in terms of computation abilities and battery lifetime. Thus, to optimize data transmission, different approaches have to be explored such as cooperative transmission, multi-hop network architectures and sophisticated compression techniques. For the latter, compressive sensing (CS) is a very attractive paradigm to be incorporated in the design of IoT platforms. CS is a novel signal acquisition and compression theory that exploits the sparsity behavior of most natural signals and IoT architectures to achieve power-efficient, real-time platforms that can grant efficient IoT applications. This paper assesses the extant literature that has aimed to incorporate CS in IoT applications. Moreover, the paper highlights emerging trends and identifies several avenues for future CS-based IoT research.

AB  - People counting in surveillance cameras is a key technology for understanding the flow population and generating heat maps. In recent years, people detection performance has been greatly improved with the development of object detection algorithms using deep learning. However, in places where people are crowded, the detection rate is low as people are often occluded by other people. We proposed a people-counting method using a stereo camera to resolve the non-detection problem due to the occlusion. We applied stereo matching to extract the depth image and convert the camera view to top view using depth information. People were detected using a height map and an occupancy map, and people were tracked and counted using a Kalman filter-based tracker. We operated the proposed method on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 to check the real-time operation possibility on the embedded board. Experimental results showed that the proposed method had higher accuracy than the existing methods and that real-time processing is possible.

AB  - Hyperspectral image classification is a hot issue in the field of remote sensing. It is possible to achieve high accuracy and strong generalization through a good classification method that is used to process image data. In this paper, an efficient hyperspectral image classification method based on improved Rotation Forest (ROF) is proposed. It is named ROF-KELM. Firstly, Non-negative matrix factorization( NMF) is used to do feature segmentation in order to get more effective data. Secondly, kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) is chosen as base classifier to improve the classification efficiency. The proposed method inherits the advantages of KELM and has an analytic solution to directly implement the multiclass classification. Then, Q-statistic is used to select base classifiers. Finally, the results are obtained by using the voting method. Three simulation examples, classification of AVIRIS image, ROSIS image and the UCI public data sets respectively, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Due to the rapid installation of a massive number of fixed and mobile sensors, monitoring machines are intentionally or unintentionally involved in the production of a large amount of geospatial data. Environmental sensors and related software applications are rapidly altering human lifestyles and even impacting ecological and human health. However, there are rarely specific geospatial sensor web (GSW) applications for certain ecological public health questions. In this paper, we propose an ontology-driven approach for integrating intelligence to manage human and ecological health risks in the GSW. We design a Human and Ecological health Risks Ontology (HERO) based on a semantic sensor network ontology template. We also illustrate a web-based prototype, the Human and Ecological Health Risk Management System (HaEHMS), which helps health experts and decision makers to estimate human and ecological health risks. We demonstrate this intelligent system through a case study of automatic prediction of air quality and related health risk.

AB  - The continuous increase in deprived living conditions in many cities of the Global South contradicts efforts to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable places. Using examples of Asian, African, and Latin American cities, this study shows the scope and limits of earth observation (EO)-based mapping of deprived living conditions in support of providing consistent global information for the SDG indicator 11.1.1 “proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing”. At the technical level, we compare several EO-based methods and imagery for mapping deprived living conditions, discussing their ability to map such areas including differences in terms of accuracy and performance at the city scale. At the operational level, we compare available municipal maps showing identified deprived areas with the spatial extent of morphological mapped areas of deprived living conditions (using EO) at the city scale, discussing the reasons for inconsistencies between municipal and EO-based maps. We provide an outlook on how EO-based mapping of deprived living conditions could contribute to a global spatial information base to support targeting of deprived living conditions in support of the SDG Goal 11.1.1 indicator, when uncertainties and ethical considerations on data provision are well addressed.

AB  - Drones have recently become extremely popular, especially in military and civilian applications. Examples of drone utilization include reconnaissance, surveillance, and packet delivery. As time has passed, drones’ tasks have become larger and more complex. As a result, swarms or clusters of drones are preferred, because they offer more coverage, flexibility, and reliability. However, drone systems have limited computing power and energy resources, which means that sometimes it is difficult for drones to finish their tasks on schedule. A solution to this is required so that drone clusters can complete their work faster. One possible solution is an offloading scheme between drone clusters. In this study, we propose an opportunistic computational offloading system, which allows for a drone cluster with a high intensity task to borrow computing resources opportunistically from other nearby drone clusters. We design an artificial neural network-based response time prediction module for deciding whether it is faster to finish tasks by offloading them to other drone clusters. The offloading scheme is conducted only if the predicted offloading response time is smaller than the local computing time. Through simulation results, we show that our proposed scheme can decrease the response time of drone clusters through an opportunistic offloading process.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 7
IS  - 11
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Oblique photogrammetric point clouds are currently one of the major data sources for the three-dimensional level-of-detail reconstruction of buildings. However, they are severely noise-laden and pose serious problems for the effective and automatic surface extraction of buildings. In addition, conventional methods generally use normal vectors estimated in a local neighborhood, which are liable to be affected by noise, leading to inferior results in successive building reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an intact planar abstraction method for buildings, which explicitly handles noise by integrating information in a larger context through global optimization. The information propagates hierarchically from a local to global scale through the following steps: first, based on voxel cloud connectivity segmentation, single points are clustered into supervoxels that are enforced to not cross the surface boundary; second, each supervoxel is expanded to nearby supervoxels through the maximal support region, which strictly enforces planarity; third, the relationships established by the maximal support regions are injected into a global optimization, which reorients the local normal vectors to be more consistent in a larger context; finally, the intact planar surfaces are obtained by region growing using robust normal and point connectivity in the established spatial relations. Experiments on the photogrammetric point clouds obtained from oblique images showed that the proposed method is effective in reducing the influence of noise and retrieving almost all of the major planar structures of the examined buildings.

AB  - Digitalization has enabled infrastructure and cities to be “smarter”; the use of physical space and energy, the transmission of information, the management of users, assets and processes, the operation of businesses and companies have been progressively digitalized. The main challenges of a Smart City is its definition, scope and interconnections; there are different approaches to Smart City implementations that vary from collaborative multidisciplinary environments, the addition of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) within its physical fabric to the use of Big Data for higher abstraction decisions. This paper presents the concept of Digital as a Service (DaaS), where any complete digitalization can be implemented independently of its associated physical infrastructure in a Cloud environment; DasS would enable an interoperable Virtual Digital Infrastructure (VDI). In addition, this paper reviews the current Digital Systems, Transmission Networks, Servers and Management Systems. The next Industrial Revolution will be founded on Artificial Intelligence that will entirely replace humans by taking production and management decisions based on the Internet of Things (IoT), the Cloud, BlockChain, Big Data, Virtual Reality and the combination of digital and real infrastructure or city. Digital as a Service would be its enabler by providing the entire interconnection, integration and virtualization of its Space, Services and Structure (3S).

However, cloud services are still far from IoT devices. Notably, the transmission of IoT data experiences network issues, such as high latency. In this case, the cloud platforms cannot satisfy the IoT applications that require real-time response. Yet, the location of cloud services is one of the challenges encountered in the evolution of the IoT paradigm. Recently, edge cloud computing has been proposed to bring cloud services closer to the IoT end-users, becoming a promising paradigm whose pitfalls and challenges are not yet well understood. This paper aims at presenting the leading-edge computing concerning the movement of services from centralized cloud platforms to decentralized platforms, and examines the issues and challenges introduced by these highly distributed environments, to support engineers and researchers who might benefit from this transition.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have enormous potential in enabling new applications in various areas, ranging from military, security, medicine, and surveillance to traffic-monitoring applications. Lately, there has been heavy investment in the development of UAVs and multi-UAVs systems that can collaborate and complete missions more efficiently and economically. Emerging technologies such as 4G/5G networks have significant potential on UAVs equipped with cameras, sensors, and GPS receivers in delivering Internet of Things (IoT) services from great heights, creating an airborne domain of the IoT. However, there are many issues to be resolved before the effective use of UAVs can be made, including security, privacy, and management. As such, in this paper we review new UAV application areas enabled by the IoT and 5G technologies, analyze the sensor requirements, and overview solutions for fleet management over aerial-networking, privacy, and security challenges. Finally, we propose a framework that supports and enables these technologies on UAVs. The introduced framework provisions a holistic IoT architecture that enables the protection of UAVs as “flying” things in a collaborative networked environment.

The goal is to consolidate all of the existing results on the subject, present them in a unified way, and provide additional important analysis of theoretical and practical issues that one can encounter when designing and applying the methodology. We first present the basic algorithm which estimates local calibration parameters by enforcing asymptotic consensus, in the mean-square sense and with probability one (w.p.1), on calibrated sensor gains and calibrated sensor offsets. For the more realistic case in which additive measurement noise, communication dropouts and additive communication noise are present, two algorithm modifications are discussed: one that uses a simple compensation term, and a more robust one based on an instrumental variable. The modified algorithms also achieve asymptotic agreement for calibrated sensor gains and offsets, in the mean-square sense and w.p.1. The convergence rate can be determined in terms of an upper bound on the mean-square error. The case when the communications between nodes is completely asynchronous, which is of substantial importance for real-world applications, is also presented. Suggestions for design of a priori adjustable weights are given. We also present the results for the case in which the underlying sensor network has a subset of (precalibrated) reference sensors with fixed calibration parameters. Wide applicability and efficacy of these algorithms are illustrated on several simulation examples. Finally, important open questions and future research directions are discussed.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Cultural landscapes are regarded to be complex socioecological systems that originated as a result of the interaction between humanity and nature across time. Cultural landscapes present complex-system properties, including nonlinear dynamics among their components. There is a close relationship between socioeconomy and landscape in cultural landscapes, so that changes in the socioeconomic dynamic have an effect on the structure and functionality of the landscape. Several numerical analyses have been carried out to study this relationship, with linear regression models being widely used. However, cultural landscapes comprise a considerable amount of elements and processes, whose interactions might not be properly captured by a linear model. In recent years, machine-learning techniques have increasingly been applied to the field of ecology to solve regression tasks. These techniques provide sound methods and algorithms for dealing with complex systems under uncertainty. The term &lsquo;machine learning&rsquo; includes a wide variety of methods to learn models from data. In this paper, we study the relationship between socioeconomy and cultural landscape (in Andalusia, Spain) at two different spatial scales aiming at comparing different regression models from a predictive-accuracy point of view, including model trees and neural or Bayesian networks.

AB  - Nowadays, it is more and more important to deal with the potential security issues of internet-of-things (IoT). Indeed, using the physical layer features of IoT wireless signals to achieve individual identity authentication is an effective way to enhance the security of IoT. However, traditional classifiers need to know all the categories in advance to get the recognition models. Realistically, it is difficult to collect all types of samples, which will result in some mistakes that the unknown target class may be decided as a known one. Consequently, this paper constructs an improving open-categorical classification model based on the generative adversarial networks (OCC-GAN) to solve the above problems. Here, we have modified the loss function of the generative model G and the discriminative model D. Compared to the traditional GAN model which can generate the fake sample overlapping with the real samples, our proposed G model generates the fake samples as negative samples which are evenly surrounding with the real samples, while the D model learns to distinguish between real samples and fake samples. Besides, we add auxiliary training not only to gain a better recognition result but also to improve the efficiency of the model. Furthermore, Our proposed model is verified through experimental study. Compared to other common methods, such as one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) and one-versus-rest support vector machine (OvR-SVM), the OCC-GAN model has a better performance. The recognition rate of the OCC-GAN model can reach more than 90% with a recall rate of 97% by the data of the IoT module.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Social sensors perceive the real world through social media and online web services, which have the advantages of low cost and large coverage over traditional physical sensors. In intelligent transportation researches, sensing and analyzing such social signals provide a new path to monitor, control and optimize transportation systems. However, current research is largely focused on using single channel online social signals to extract and sense traffic information. Clearly, sensing and exploiting multi-channel social signals could effectively provide deeper understanding of traffic incidents. In this paper, we utilize cross-platform online data, i.e., Sina Weibo and News, as multi-channel social signals, then we propose a word2vec-based event fusion (WBEF) model   for sensing, detecting, representing, linking and fusing urban traffic incidents. Thus, each traffic incident can be comprehensively described from multiple aspects, and finally the whole picture of unban traffic events can be obtained and visualized. The proposed WBEF architecture was trained by about 1.15 million multi-channel online data from Qingdao (a coastal city in China), and the experiments show our method surpasses the baseline model, achieving an 88.1% F1 score in urban traffic incident detection. The model also demonstrates its effectiveness in the open scenario test.

We focus on a smart-campus initiative in the University of Malaga as the scenario for building this cyber&ndash;physical system at a low cost, and then present the details of a new proposed evolutionary algorithm used for better training machine-learning techniques: BiPred. We model and solve the task of reducing the size of the dataset used for learning about campus mobility. Our conclusions show an important reduction of the required data to learn mobility patterns by more than 90%, while improving (at the same time) the precision of the predictions of theapplied machine-learning method (up to 15%). All this was done along with the construction of a real system in a city, which hopefully resulted in a very comprehensive work in smart cities using sensors.

AB  - Undoubtedly, the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has impacted on our every-day life, surrounding us with smart objects. Thus, the potentialities of this new market attracted the industry, so that many enterprises developed their own IoT platforms aiming at helping IoT services&rsquo; developers. In the multitude of possible platforms, selecting the most suitable to implement a specific service is not straightforward, especially from a security perspective. This paper analyzes some of the most prominent proposals in the IoT platforms market-place, performing an in-depth security comparison using five common criteria. These criteria are detailed in sub-criteria, so that they can be used as a baseline for the development of a secure IoT service. Leveraging the knowledge gathered from our in-depth study, both researchers and developers may select the IoT platform which best fits their needs. Additionally, an IoT service for monitoring commercial flights is implemented in two previously analyzed IoT platforms, giving an adequate detail level to represent a solid guideline for future IoT developers.

AB  - The use of wearable and Internet-of-Things (IoT) for smart and affordable healthcare is trending. In traditional setups, the cloud backend receives the healthcare data and performs monitoring and prediction for diseases, diagnosis, and wellness prediction. Fog computing (FC) is a distributed computing paradigm that leverages low-power embedded processors in an intermediary node between the client layer and cloud layer. The diagnosis for wellness and fitness monitoring could be transferred to the fog layer from the cloud layer. Such a paradigm leads to a reduction in latency at an increased throughput. This paper processes a fog-based deep learning model, DeepFog that collects the data from individuals and predicts the wellness stats using a deep neural network model that can handle heterogeneous and multidimensional data. The three important abnormalities in wellness namely, (i) diabetes; (ii) hypertension attacks and (iii) stress type classification were chosen for experimental studies. We performed a detailed analysis of proposed models&rsquo; accuracy on standard datasets. The results validated the efficacy of the proposed system and architecture for accurate monitoring of these critical wellness and fitness criteria. We used standard datasets and open source software tools for our experiments.

AB  - Current studies show that traditional deterministic models tend to struggle to capture the non-linear relationship between the concentration of air pollutants and their sources of emission and dispersion. To tackle such a limitation, the most promising approach is to use statistical models based on machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, it is puzzling why a certain algorithm is chosen over another for a given task. This systematic review intends to clarify this question by providing the reader with a comprehensive description of the principles underlying these algorithms and how they are applied to enhance prediction accuracy. A rigorous search that conforms to the PRISMA guideline is performed and results in the selection of the 46 most relevant journal papers in the area. Through a factorial analysis method these studies are synthetized and linked to each other. The main findings of this literature review show that: (i) machine learning is mainly applied in Eurasian and North American continents and (ii) estimation problems tend to implement Ensemble Learning and Regressions, whereas forecasting make use of Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The next challenges of this approach are to improve the prediction of pollution peaks and contaminants recently put in the spotlights (e.g., nanoparticles).

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Renewable energy systems (RES) are reliable by nature; the sun and wind are theoretically endless resources. From the beginnings of the power systems, the concern was to know &ldquo;how much&rdquo; energy will be generated. Initially, there were voltmeters and power meters; nowadays, there are much more advanced solar controllers, with small displays and built-in modules that handle big data. Usually, large photovoltaic (PV)-battery systems have sophisticated energy management strategies in order to operate unattended. By adding the information collected by sensors managed with powerful technologies such as big data and analytics, the system is able to efficiently react to environmental factors and respond to consumers&rsquo; requirements in real time. According to the weather parameters, the output of PV could be symmetric, supplying an asymmetric electricity demand. Thus, a smart adaptive switching module that includes a forecasting component is proposed to improve the symmetry between the PV output and daily load curve. A scaling approach for smaller off-grid systems that provides an accurate forecast of the PV output based on data collected from sensors is developed. The proposed methodology is based on sensor implementation in RES operation and big data technologies are considered for data processing and analytics. In this respect, we analyze data captured from loggers and forecast the PV output with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and linear regression, finding that Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for prediction is considerably improved when using more parameters in the machine learning process.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging as a new communication paradigm and has attracted a significant amount of attention from both academic and engineering communities. In this paper, we consider an IoT market where three roles exist: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), two service providers (SPs) and end users. The WSNs are responsible for sensing and providing data to the two SPs. Based on the sensed data from WSNs, the two SPs compete to provide services to the end users. We model the relationship between the two SPs and end users as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the two SPs set the prices for their services firstly, and then the end users decide which SP to choose. Specifically, we consider two price-competition scenarios of the two SPs, which are engaged in two games, one is a noncooperative strategic game (NSG) where the two SPs set the prices for services simultaneously, the other is a Stackelberg game (SG) where SP1 who sets the price first is the leader and SP2 who sets the price after is the follower. Each user decides whether and which SP to purchase services from based on prices and service rates. An equilibrium is achieved in each of the two scenarios. Numerical results are conducted to verify our theoretical analysis.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Applying people detectors to unseen data is challenging since patterns distributions, such as viewpoints, motion, poses, backgrounds, occlusions and people sizes, may significantly differ from the ones of the training dataset. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework to adapt frame by frame people detectors during runtime classification, without requiring any additional manually labeled ground truth apart from the offline training of the detection model. Such adaptation make use of multiple detectors mutual information, i.e., similarities and dissimilarities of detectors estimated and agreed by pair-wise correlating their outputs. Globally, the proposed adaptation discriminates between relevant instants in a video sequence, i.e., identifies the representative frames for an adaptation of the system. Locally, the proposed adaptation identifies the best configuration (i.e., detection threshold) of each detector under analysis, maximizing the mutual information to obtain the detection threshold of each detector. The proposed coarse-to-fine approach does not require training the detectors for each new scenario and uses standard people detector outputs, i.e., bounding boxes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art detectors whose optimal threshold configurations are previously determined and fixed from offline training data.

SN  - 2411-9660

AB  - To be able to provide appropriate services in social and human application contexts, smart cyber-physical systems (S-CPSs) need ampliative reasoning and decision-making (ARDM) mechanisms. As one option, procedural abduction (PA) is suggested for self-managing S-CPSs. PA is a knowledge-based computation and learning mechanism. The objective of this article is to provide a comprehensive description of the computational framework proposed for PA. Towards this end, first the essence of smart cyber-physical systems is discussed. Then, the main recent research results related to computational abduction and ampliative reasoning are discussed. PA facilitates beliefs-driven contemplation of the momentary performance of S-CPSs, including a &lsquo;best option&rsquo;-based setting of the servicing objective and realization of any demanded adaptation. The computational framework of PA includes eight clusters of computational activities: (i) run-time extraction of signals and data by sensing, (ii) recognition of events, (iii) inferring about existing situations, (iv) building awareness of the state and circumstances of operation, (v) devising alternative performance enhancement strategies, (vi) deciding on the best system adaptation, (vii) devising and scheduling the implied interventions, and (viii) actuating effectors and controls. Several cognitive algorithms and computational actions are used to implement PA in a compositional manner. PA necessitates not only a synergic interoperation of the algorithms, but also an objective-dependent fusion of the pre-programmed and the run time acquired chunks of knowledge. A fully fledged implementation of PA is underway, which will make verification and validation possible in the context of various smart CPSs.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Predicting the exact urban places where crime is most likely to occur is one of the greatest interests for Police Departments. Therefore, the goal of the research presented in this paper is to identify specific urban areas where a crime could happen in Manhattan, NY for every hour of a day. The outputs from this research are the following: (i) predicted land uses that generates the top three most committed crimes in Manhattan, by using machine learning (random forest and logistic regression), (ii) identifying the exact hours when most of the assaults are committed, together with hot spots during these hours, by applying time series and hot spot analysis, (iii) built hourly prediction models for assaults based on the land use, by deploying logistic regression. Assault, as a physical attack on someone, according to criminal law, is identified as the third most committed crime in Manhattan. Land use (residential, commercial, recreational, mixed use etc.) is assigned to every area or lot in Manhattan, determining the actual use or activities within each particular lot. While plotting assaults on the map for every hour, this investigation has identified that the hot spots where assaults occur were ‘moving’ and not confined to specific lots within Manhattan. This raises a number of questions: Why are hot spots of assaults not static in an urban environment? What makes them ‘move’—is it a particular urban pattern? Is the ‘movement’ of hot spots related to human activities during the day and night? Answering these questions helps to build the initial frame for assault prediction within every hour of a day. Knowing a specific land use vulnerability to assault during each exact hour can assist the police departments to allocate forces during those hours in risky areas. For the analysis, the study is using two datasets: a crime dataset with geographical locations of crime, date and time, and a geographic dataset about land uses with land use codes for every lot, each obtained from open databases. The study joins two datasets based on the spatial location and classifies data into 24 classes, based on the time range when the assault occurred. Machine learning methods reveal the effect of land uses on larceny, harassment and assault, the three most committed crimes in Manhattan. Finally, logistic regression provides hourly prediction models and unveils the type of land use where assaults could occur during each hour for both day and night.

AB  - By nature, some jobs are always in closed environments and employees may stay for long periods. This is the case for many professional activities such as military watch tours of borders, civilian buildings and facilities that need efficient control processes. The role assigned to personnel in such environments is usually sensitive and of high importance, especially in terms of security and protection. With this in mind, we proposed in our research a novel approach using multi-sensor technology to monitor many safety and security parameters including the health status of indoor workers, such as those in watchtowers and at guard posts. In addition, the data gathered for those employees (heart rate, temperature, eye movement, human motion, etc.) combined with the room’s sensor data (temperature, oxygen ratio, toxic gases, air quality, etc.) were saved by appropriate cloud services, which ensured easy access to the data without ignoring the privacy protection aspect of such critical material. This information can be used later by specialists to monitor the evolution of the worker’s health status as well as its cost-effectiveness, which gives the possibility to improve productivity in the workplace and general employee health.

AB  - We describe the sentiment analysis experiments that were performed on the Lithuanian Internet comment dataset using traditional machine learning (Na&iuml;ve Bayes Multinomial&mdash;NBM and Support Vector Machine&mdash;SVM) and deep learning (Long Short-Term Memory&mdash;LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network&mdash;CNN) approaches. The traditional machine learning techniques were used with the features based on the lexical, morphological, and character information. The deep learning approaches were applied on the top of two types of word embeddings (Vord2Vec continuous bag-of-words with negative sampling and FastText). Both traditional and deep learning approaches had to solve the positive/negative/neutral sentiment classification task on the balanced and full dataset versions. The best deep learning results (reaching 0.706 of accuracy) were achieved on the full dataset with CNN applied on top of the FastText embeddings, replaced emoticons, and eliminated diacritics. The traditional machine learning approaches demonstrated the best performance (0.735 of accuracy) on the full dataset with the NBM method, replaced emoticons, restored diacritics, and lemma unigrams as features. Although traditional machine learning approaches were superior when compared to the deep learning methods; deep learning demonstrated good results when applied on the small datasets.

The recurrent neural networks with multiple consecutive timestamps can be applied to extract the features of time series data for the improvement of location estimation. In practical experimental environments, there are 4525 records, 59 different base stations, and 582 different Wi-Fi access points detected in Fuzhou University in China. The lower location errors can be obtained by the recurrent neural networks with multiple consecutive timestamps (e.g., two timestamps and three timestamps); from the experimental results, it can be observed that the average error of location estimation was 9.19 m by the proposed mobile positioning method with two timestamps.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - The resource limitation of multi-access edge computing (MEC) is one of the major issues in order to provide low-latency high-reliability computing services for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Moreover, with the steep rise of task requests from IoT devices, the requirement of computation tasks needs dynamic scalability while using the potential of offloading tasks to mobile volunteer nodes (MVNs). We, therefore, propose a scalable vehicle-assisted MEC (SVMEC) paradigm, which cannot only relieve the resource limitation of MEC but also enhance the scalability of computing services for IoT devices and reduce the cost of using computing resources. In the SVMEC paradigm, a MEC provider can execute its users&rsquo; tasks by choosing one of three ways: (i) Do itself on local MEC, (ii) offload to the remote cloud, and (iii) offload to the MVNs. We formulate the problem of joint node selection and resource allocation as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, whose major objective is to minimize the total computation overhead in terms of the weighted-sum of task completion time and monetary cost for using computing resources. In order to solve it, we adopt alternative optimization techniques by decomposing the original problem into two sub-problems: Resource allocation sub-problem and node selection sub-problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of the total computation overhead.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) utilize a sensor network-based system to gather and interpret traffic information. In addition, mobility users utilize mobile applications to collect transport information for safe traveling. However, these types of information are not sufficient to examine all aspects of the transportation networks. Therefore, both ITSs and mobility users need a smart approach and social media data, which can help ITSs examine transport services, support traffic and control management, and help mobility users travel safely. People utilize social networks to share their thoughts and opinions regarding transportation, which are useful for ITSs and travelers. However, user-generated text on social media is short in length, unstructured, and covers a broad range of dynamic topics. The application of recent Machine Learning (ML) approach is inefficient for extracting relevant features from unstructured data, detecting word polarity of features, and classifying the sentiment of features correctly. In addition, ML classifiers consistently miss the semantic feature of the word meaning. A novel fuzzy ontology-based semantic knowledge with Word2vec model is proposed to improve the task of transportation features extraction and text classification using the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) approach. The proposed fuzzy ontology describes semantic knowledge about entities and features and their relation in the transportation domain. Fuzzy ontology and smart methodology are developed in Web Ontology Language and Java, respectively. By utilizing word embedding with fuzzy ontology as a representation of text, Bi-LSTM shows satisfactory improvement in both the extraction of features and the classification of the unstructured text of social media.

TI  - An Improved Unauthorized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Detection Algorithm Using Radiofrequency-Based Statistical Fingerprint Analysis
T2  - Sensors

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now readily available worldwide and users can easily fly them remotely using smart controllers. This has created the problem of keeping unauthorized UAVs away from private or sensitive areas where they can be a personal or public threat. This paper proposes an improved radio frequency (RF)-based method to detect UAVs. The clutter (interference) is eliminated using a background filtering method. Then singular value decomposition (SVD) and average filtering are used to reduce the noise and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Spectrum accumulation (SA) and statistical fingerprint analysis (SFA) are employed to provide two frequency estimates. These estimates are used to determine if a UAV is present in the detection environment. The data size is reduced using a region of interest (ROI), and this improves the system efficiency and improves azimuth estimation accuracy. Detection results are obtained using real UAV RF signals obtained experimentally which show that the proposed method is more effective than other well-known detection algorithms. The recognition rate with this method is close to 100% within a distance of 2.4 km and greater than 90% within a distance of 3 km. Further, multiple UAVs can be detected accurately using the proposed method.

TI  - Generalized Parking Occupancy Analysis Based on Dilated Convolutional Neural Network

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The importance of vacant parking space detection systems is increasing dramatically as the avoidance of traffic congestion and the time-consuming process of searching an empty parking space is a crucial problem for drivers in urban centers. However, the existing parking space occupancy detection systems are either hardware expensive or not well-generalized for varying images captured from different camera views. As a solution, we take advantage of an affordable visual detection method that is made possible by the fact that camera monitoring is already available in the majority of parking areas. However, the current problem is a challenging vision task because of outdoor lighting variation, perspective distortion, occlusions, different camera viewpoints, and the changes due to the various seasons of the year. To overcome these obstacles, we propose an approach based on Dilated Convolutional Neural Network specifically designed for detecting parking space occupancy in a parking lot, given only an image of a single parking spot as input. To evaluate our method and allow its comparison with previous strategies, we trained and tested it on well-known publicly available datasets, PKLot and CNRPark + EXT. In these datasets, the parking lot images are already labeled, and therefore, we did not need to label them manually. The proposed method shows more reliability than prior works especially when we test it on a completely different subset of images. Considering that in previous studies the performance of the methods was compared with well-known architecture&mdash;AlexNet, which shows a highly promising achievement, we also assessed our model in comparison with AlexNet. Our investigations showed that, in comparison with previous approaches, for the task of classifying given parking spaces as vacant or occupied, the proposed approach is more robust, stable, and well-generalized for unseen images captured from completely different camera viewpoints, which has strong indications that it would generalize effectively to other parking lots.

SN  - 2218-6581

AB  - Numerous autonomous robots are used not only for factory automation as labor saving devices, but also for interaction and communication with humans in our daily life. Although superior compatibility for semantic recognition of generic objects provides wide applications in a practical use, it is still a challenging task to create an extraction method that includes robustness and stability against environmental changes. This paper proposes a novel method of scene and position recognition based on visual landmarks (VLs) used for an autonomous mobile robot in an environment living with humans. The proposed method provides a mask image of human regions using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG). The VL features are described with accelerated KAZE (AKAZE) after extracting conspicuous regions obtained using saliency maps (SMs). The experimentally obtained results using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) revealed that recognition accuracy of high-saliency feature points was higher than that of low-saliency feature points. We created our original benchmark datasets using a mobile robot. The recognition accuracy evaluated using LOOCV reveals 49.9% for our method, which is 3.2 percentage points higher than the accuracy of the comparison method without HOG detectors. The analysis of false recognition using a confusion matrix examines false recognition occurring in neighboring zones. This trend is reduced according to zone separations.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Small-to-medium scale smart buildings are an important part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the major enabler for smart control in such environments. Reliability is among the key performance requirements for many loss-sensitive IoT and WSN applications, while Energy Consumption (EC) remains a primary concern in WSN design. Error-prone links, traffic intense applications, and limited physical resources make it challenging to meet these service goals&mdash;not only that these performance metrics often conflict with one another, but also require solving optimization problems, which are intrinsically NP-hard. Correctly forecasting Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and EC can play a significant role in different loss-sensitive application environments. With the ever-increasing availability of performance data, data-driven techniques are becoming popular in such settings. It is observed that a number of communication parameters like transmission power, packet size, etc., influence metrics like PDR and EC in diverse ways. In this work, different regression models including linear, gradient boosting, random forest, and deep learning are used for the purpose of predicting both PDR and EC based on such communication parameters. To evaluate the performance, a public dataset of the IEEE 802.15.4 network, containing measurements against more than 48,000 combinations of parameter configurations, is used. Results are evaluated using root mean square error and it turns out that deep learning achieves up to 98% accuracy for both PDR and EC predictions. These prediction results can help configure communication parameters taking into account the performance goals.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Monitoring traffic states from the road is arousing increasing concern from traffic management authorities. To complete the picture of real-time traffic states, novel data sources have been introduced and studied in the transportation community for decades. This paper explores a supplementary and novel data source, Wi-Fi signal data, to extract traffic information through a well-designed system. An IoT (Internet of Things)-based Wi-Fi signal detector consisting of a solar power module, high capacity module, and IoT functioning module was constructed to collect Wi-Fi signal data. On this basis, a filtration and mining algorithm was developed to extract traffic state information (i.e., travel time, traffic volume, and speed). In addition, to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, a practical field test was conducted through the use of the system to monitor traffic states of a major corridor in China. The comparison results with loop data indicated that traffic speed obtained from the system was consistent with that collected from loop detectors. The mean absolute percentage error reached 3.55% in the best case. Furthermore, the preliminary analysis proved the existence of the highly correlated relationship between volumes obtained from the system and from loop detectors. The evaluation confirmed the feasibility of applying Wi-Fi signal data to acquisition of traffic information, indicating that Wi-Fi signal data could be used as a supplementary data source for monitoring real-time traffic states.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Virtualization technologies are key enablers of softwarized 5G networks, and their usage in the vehicular domain can provide flexibility and reliability in real deployments, where mobility and processing needs may be an issue. Next-generation vehicular services, such as the ones in the area of urban mobility and, in general, those interconnecting on-board sensors, require continuous data gathering and processing, but current architectures are stratified in two-tier solutions in which data is collected by on-board units (OBU) and sent to cloud servers. In this line, intermediate cache and processing layers are needed in order to cover quasi-ubiquitous data-gathering needs of vehicles in scenarios of smart cities/roads considering vehicles as moving sensors. The SURROGATES solution presented in this paper proposes to virtualize vehicle OBUs and create a novel Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) layer with the aim of offloading processing from the vehicle and serving data-access requests. This deals with potential disconnection periods of vehicles, saves radio resources when accessing the physical OBU and improves data processing performance. A proof of concept has been implemented using OpenStack and Open Source MANO to virtualize resources and gather data from in-vehicle sensors, and a final traffic monitoring service has been implemented to validate the proposal. Performance results reveal a speedup of more than 50% in the data request resolution, with consequently great savings of network resources in the wireless segment. Thus, this work opens a novel path regarding the virtualization of end-devices in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) ecosystem.

TI  - Cloud-Fog Architecture Based Energy Management and Decision-Making for Next-Generation Distribution Network with Prosumers and Internet of Things Devices
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - With the increasing penetration of Internet of Things devices and distributed energy resources in the next-generation distribution network, the efficient energy management for system operation are facing new challenges. One reason is that the large-scale resources cannot be all connected to the supervisory control and data acquisition system, which have limited storage and computation capabilities. In order to adapt to the new energy management requirements of next-generation distribution networks, a state-of-the-art energy management method called cloud-fog hierarchical architecture is proposed in this work. Based on this architecture, we established a utility and revenue model for various stakeholders, including normal customers, prosumers, and distribution system operators. Furthermore, by embedding an artificial intelligence module in the proposed architecture, energy management could be implemented automatically. In this work, neural network are used at fog computing layers to achieve regression prediction of energy usage behavior and power source output. Moreover, based on the maximizing utility objective function, the amount of energy consumption of customers and prosumers in the distribution network was optimized with a genetic algorithm at cloud layer. The proposed methods were tested with a set of normal customers and prosumers in a general distribution network, and the results, including the captured usage patterns of the customers and revenues of various stakeholders, verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. This work provides an effective reference for the development of real-time energy management systems for the next-generation distribution network.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting (STELF) through Data Analytics (DA) is an emerging and active research area. Forecasting about electricity load and price provides future trends and patterns of consumption. There is a loss in generation and use of electricity. So, multiple strategies are used to solve the aforementioned problems. Day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting are beneficial for both suppliers and consumers. In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) and data mining techniques are used for electricity load and price forecasting. XG-Boost (XGB), Decision Tree (DT), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest (RF) are used for feature selection and feature extraction. Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) and Enhanced Support Vector Regression (ESVR) are used as classifiers. Grid Search (GS) is used for tuning of the parameters of classifiers to increase their performance. The risk of over-fitting is mitigated by adding multiple layers in ECNN. Finally, the proposed models are compared with different benchmark schemes for stability analysis. The performance metrics MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperformed other benchmark schemes. ECNN performed well with threshold 0.08 for load forecasting. While ESVR performed better with threshold value 0.15 for price forecasting. ECNN achieved almost 2% better accuracy than CNN. Furthermore, ESVR achieved almost 1% better accuracy than the existing scheme (SVR).

TI  - Fast and Automatic Reconstruction of Semantically Rich 3D Indoor Maps from Low-quality RGB-D Sequences
T2  - Sensors

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Semantically rich indoor models are increasingly used throughout a facility&rsquo;s life cycle for different applications. With the decreasing price of 3D sensors, it is convenient to acquire point cloud data from consumer-level scanners. However, most existing methods in 3D indoor reconstruction from point clouds involve a tedious manual or interactive process due to line-of-sight occlusions and complex space structures. Using the multiple types of data obtained by RGB-D devices, this paper proposes a fast and automatic method for reconstructing semantically rich indoor 3D building models from low-quality RGB-D sequences. Our method is capable of identifying and modelling the main structural components of indoor environments such as space, wall, floor, ceilings, windows, and doors from the RGB-D datasets. The method includes space division and extraction, opening extraction, and global optimization. For space division and extraction, rather than distinguishing room spaces based on the detected wall planes, we interactively define the start-stop position for each functional space (e.g., room, corridor, kitchen) during scanning. Then, an interior elements filtering algorithm is proposed for wall component extraction and a boundary generation algorithm is used for space layout determination. For opening extraction, we propose a new noise robustness method based on the properties of convex hull, octrees structure, Euclidean clusters and the camera trajectory for opening generation, which is inapplicable to the data collected in the indoor environments due to inevitable occlusion. A global optimization approach for planes is designed to eliminate the inconsistency of planes sharing the same global plane, and maintain plausible connectivity between the walls and the relationships between the walls and openings. The final model is stored according to the CityGML3.0 standard. Our approach allows for the robust generation of semantically rich 3D indoor models and has strong applicability and reconstruction power for complex real-world datasets.

AB  - The Mamdani fuzzy inference method is one of the most important fuzzy logic control (FLC) techniques and has several applications in different fields. Despite its applications, the Mamdani fuzzy inference method has some core issues which still require solutions. The most critical issue is the selection of accurate shape and boundaries of membership functions (MFs) in the universe of discourse. In this work, we introduced a methodology called learning to control (LtC) to resolve the problem. The proposed methodology consisted of two main modules, namely, a control algorithm (CA) module and a learning algorithm (LA) module. In the CA module, the Mamdani FLC method has been used, whereas, in the LA module, we have used the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. Inputs into the ANN were the error difference between environmental temperature and the required temperature. The output of the ANN was the MF set to the FLC. Inputs into the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) were the error difference between environmental temperature and required temperature (D), and the output was the required power for the fan actuator. The purpose of the ANN was to tune the MFs of the FLC to improve its efficiency. The proposed learning-to-control method along with the conventional fuzzy logic controller method was applied to the data to evaluate the model&rsquo;s performance. The results indicate that the proposed model&rsquo;s performance is far better than that of conventional fuzzy logic techniques.

AB  - Dramatic changes in the way we collect and process data has facilitated the emergence of a new era by providing customised services and products precisely based on the needs of clients according to processed big data. It is estimated that the number of connected devices to the internet will pass 35 billion by 2020. Further, there has also been a massive escalation in the amount of data collection tools as Internet of Things devices generate data which has big data characteristics known as five V (volume, velocity, variety, variability and value). This article reviews challenges, opportunities and research trends to address the issues related to the data era in three industries including smart cities, healthcare and transportation. All three of these industries could greatly benefit from machine learning and deep learning techniques on big data collected by the Internet of Things, which is named as the internet of everything to emphasise the role of connected devices for data collection. In the smart grid portion of this paper, the recently developed deep reinforcement learning techniques and their applications in Smart Cities are also presented and reviewed.

TI  - Time-Aware Monitoring of Overhead Transmission Line Sag and Temperature with LoRa Communication
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The techniques of Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) for Overhead Transmission Line (OTL)&rsquo;s are currently dynamically developed. DLR systems typically rely on weather, temperature, inclination, and current measurements to calculate tension and sag, where sensors need to be installed directly on wires. Such systems are very reliable and ensure high accuracy in determining maximum allowable current. However, their installation may require switching off the transmission line from the operation. In order to receive precise values regarding the actual operating conditions of the whole transmission line, DLR sensors measuring wire temperature or tension should be installed at many points of OTL. The minimum number of installation points should cover at least each tension section and critical spans, thereby increasing installation costs. The alternative method that allows for the monitoring of OTL is the use of the vision system based on cameras. Installed on the OTLs&rsquo; poles, cameras can take photos which, appropriately processed, can provide data about the sag and temperature of wires, without the necessity of switching OTL from the operation for installation or further maintenance. Such a vision system facilitates also data transmission, because it does not require measurement data to be transmitted from the sensor station installed on the wire to the base station located on the pole (for instance, via radio). This article aims to present the concept of a vision system that monitors sag and temperature of Overhead Transmission Lines (OTLs)&rsquo; using Long Range (LoRa) wireless communication and data transmission. The developed system consists of a camera and a microcomputer equipped with LoRa communication module. The whole system monitors OTLs&rsquo; spans by taking photos, processing images for wire sag-temperature estimation, and sending results to the operator&rsquo;s Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). The system communication architecture is also proposed and investigated for data transmission time when monitoring the whole OTL.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 3
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are becoming a common tool for aerial sensing applications. Nevertheless, sensed data need further processing before becoming useful information. This processing requires large computing power and time before delivery. In this paper, we present a parallel architecture that includes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a small embedded computer on board, a communication link to the Internet, and a cloud service with the aim to provide useful real-time information directly to the end-users. The potential of parallelism as a solution in remote sensing has not been addressed for a distributed architecture that includes the UAV processors. The architecture is demonstrated for a specific problem: the counting of olive trees in a crop field where the trees are regularly spaced from each other. During the flight, the embedded computer is able to process individual images on board the UAV and provide the total count. The tree counting algorithm obtains an     F 1     score of     99.09 %     for a sequence of ten images with 332 olive trees. The detected trees are geolocated and can be visualized on the Internet seconds after the take-off of the flight, with no further processing required. This is a use case to demonstrate near real-time results obtained from UAS usage. Other more complex UAS applications, such as tree inventories, search and rescue, fire detection, or stock breeding, can potentially benefit from this architecture and obtain faster outcomes, accessible while the UAV is still on flight.

TI  - Evaluation of Classical Operators and Fuzzy Logic Algorithms for Edge Detection of Panels at Exterior Cladding of Buildings
T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 2
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - The automated process of construction defect detection using non-contact methods provides vital information for quality control and updating building information modelling. The external cladding in modular construction should be regularly controlled in terms of the quality of panels and proper installation because its appearance is very important for clients. However, there are limited computational methods for examining the installation issues of external cladding remotely in an automated manner. These issues could be the incorrect sitting of a panel, unequal joints in an elevation, scratches or cracks on the face of a panel or dimensions of different elements of external cladding. This paper aims to present seven algorithms to detect panel edges and statistically compare their performance through application on two scenarios of buildings in construction sites. Two different scenarios are selected, where the building fa&ccedil;ades are available to the public, and a sample of 100 images is taken using a state-of-the-art 3D camera for edge detection analysis. The experimentation results are validated by using a series of computational error and accuracy analyses and statistical methods including Mean Square Error, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio and Structural Similarity Index. The performance of an image processing algorithm depends on the quality of images and the algorithm utilised. The results show better performance of the fuzzy logic algorithm because it detects clear edges for installed panels. The applications of classical operators including Sobel, Canny, LoG, Prewitt and Roberts algorithms give similar results and show similarities in terms of the average of errors and accuracy. In addition, the results show that the minor difference of the average of the error and accuracy indices for Sobel, Canny, LoG, Prewitt and Roberts methods between both scenarios are not statistically significant, while the difference in the average of the error and accuracy indices for RGB-Sobel and Fuzzy methods between both scenarios are statistically significant. The accuracy of the algorithms can be improved by removing unwanted items such as vegetation and clouds in the sky. The evaluated algorithms assist practitioners to analyse their images collected day to day from construction sites, and to update building information modelling and the project digital drawings. Future work may need to focus on the combination of the evaluated algorithms using new data sets including colour edge detection for automatic defect identification using RGB and 360-degree images.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - This paper presents a QoS-aware, content-aware and device-aware nonintrusive medical QoE (m-QoE) prediction model over small cell networks. The proposed prediction model utilises a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to predict m-QoE. It also acts as a platform to maintain and optimise the acceptable diagnostic quality through a device-aware adaptive video streaming mechanism. The proposed model is trained for an unseen dataset of input variables such as QoS, content features and display device characteristics, to produce an output value in the form of m-QoE (i.e. MOS). The efficiency of the proposed model is validated through subjective tests carried by medical experts. The prediction accuracy obtained via the correlation coefficient and Root Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) indicates that the proposed model succeeds in measuring m-QoE closer to the visual perception of the medical experts. Furthermore, we have addressed two main research questions: (1) How significant is ultrasound video content type in determining m-QoE? (2) How much of a role does the screen size and device resolution play in medical experts&rsquo; diagnostic experience? The former is answered through the content classification of ultrasound video sequences based on their spatiotemporal features, by including these features in the proposed prediction model, and validating their significance through medical experts&rsquo; subjective ratings. The latter is answered by conducting a novel subjective experiment of the ultrasound video sequences across multiple devices.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - To accommodate the rapidly increasing demand for connected infrastructure, automation for industrial sites and building smart cities, the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-based solutions is considered one of the major trends in modern day industrial revolution. In particular, providing high precision indoor positioning services for such applications is a key challenge. Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning systems have been adapted as promising candidates for such applications. The performance of such indoor positioning systems degrade drastically due to several impairments like noisy datasets, high variation in Wi-Fi signals over time, fading of Wi-Fi signals due to multipath propagation caused by hurdles, people walking in the area under consideration and the addition/removal of Wi-Fi access points (APs). In this paper, we propose data pre- and post-processing algorithms with deep learning classifiers for Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning, in order to provide immunity against limitations in the database and the indoor environment. In addition, we investigate the performance of the proposed system through simulation as well as extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that the pre-processing algorithm can efficiently fill in the missing Wi-Fi received signal strength fingerprints in the database, resulting in a success rate of 88.96% in simulation and 86.61% in a real-time experiment. The post-processing algorithm can improve the results from 9.05&ndash;10.94% for the conducted experiments, providing the highest success rate of 95.94% with a precision of 4 m for Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - This paper focuses on analytics of an extremely large dataset of smart grid electricity price and load, which is difficult to process with conventional computational models. These data are known as energy big data. The analysis of big data divulges the deeper insights that help experts in the improvement of smart grid&rsquo;s (SG) operations. Processing and extracting of meaningful information from data is a challenging task. Electricity load and price are the most influential factors in the electricity market. For improving reliability, control and management of electricity market operations, an exact estimate of the day ahead load is a substantial requirement. Energy market trade is based on price. Accurate price forecast enables energy market participants to make effective and most profitable bidding strategies. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model for the forecast of price and demand for big data using Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM). Due to the adaptive and automatic feature learning mechanism of Deep Neural Network (DNN), the processing of big data is easier with LSTM as compared to the purely data-driven methods. The proposed model was evaluated using well-known real electricity markets&rsquo; data. In this study, day and week ahead forecasting experiments were conducted for all months. Forecast performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). The proposed Deep LSTM (DLSTM) method was compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) time series forecasting methods, i.e., Nonlinear Autoregressive network with Exogenous variables (NARX) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). DLSTM outperformed the compared forecasting methods in terms of accuracy. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method for electricity price and load forecasting.

AB  - Technology enhanced learning is a wide area that covers all uses of digital technology to support learning and teaching activities. The computer-based concept mapping has shown potential in enhancing meaningful learning in education. Concept mapping is an important tool that is used in the field of education to help students in understanding the basic concepts and the relationships between them. This research proposes a computer-based concept mapping (CBCM) environment combined with Google classroom to help students reduce their misconceptions and to improve their problem solving skills. Furthermore, it examines the effect of CBCM on the sustainability of concept learning according to student views. The participants were first-year engineering students. The study was conducted in a physics class, and a true-experimental design was used. The experimental group students learned with the Google classroom combined with computer-based concept mapping (CBCM), while the concept group students learned with Google classroom and the traditional method. Data were collected from a physics concept test, problem solving inventory, and semi-structured interviews. The research results indicated that teaching in the CBCM environment combined with Google Classroom provides meaningful learning by correcting the misconceptions of the students. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the problem solving skills of the experimental group as compared to the control group. According to the students&rsquo; views, it was determined that CBCM enhances the sustainability of concept learning. The results of this study can help educators and researchers to integrate computer-based concept mapping (CBCM) techniques into Google Classroom.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has evolved towards intelligent IoT applications which exploit knowledge produced by IoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques. Knowledge sharing between IoT devices is a challenging issue in this trend. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge of Things (KoT) framework which enables sharing self-taught knowledge between IoT devices which require similar or identical knowledge without help from the cloud. The proposed KoT framework allows an IoT device to effectively produce, cumulate, and share its self-taught knowledge with other devices at the edge in the vicinity. This framework can alleviate behavioral repetition in users and computational redundancy in systems in intelligent IoT applications. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we examine a smart home case study and build a prototype of the KoT framework-based smart home system. Experimental results show that the proposed KoT framework reduces the response time to use intelligent IoT devices from a user&rsquo;s perspective and the power consumption for compuation from a system&rsquo;s perspective.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This work proposes a persuasion model based on argumentation theory and users&rsquo; characteristics for improving the use of resources in bike sharing systems, fostering the use of the bicycles and thus contributing to greater energy sustainability by reducing the use of carbon-based fuels. More specifically, it aims to achieve a balanced network of pick-up and drop-off stations in urban areas with the help of the users, thus reducing the dedicated management trucks that redistribute bikes among stations. The proposal aims to persuade users to choose different routes from the shortest route between a start and an end location. This persuasion is carried out when it is not possible to park the bike in the desired station due to the lack of parking slots, or when the user is highly influenceable. Differently to other works, instead of employing a single criteria to recommend alternative stations, the proposed system can incorporate a variety of criteria. This result is achieved by providing a defeasible logic-based persuasion engine that is capable of aggregating the results from multiple recommendation rules. The proposed framework is showcased with an example scenario of a bike sharing system.

AB  - Smart cities (SC) promote economic development, improve the welfare of their citizens, and help in the ability of people to use technologies to build sustainable services. However, computational methods are necessary to assist in the process of creating smart cities because they are fundamental to the decision-making process, assist in policy making, and offer improved services to citizens. As such, the aim of this research is to present a systematic review regarding data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) approaches adopted in the promotion of smart cities. The Methodi Ordinatio was used to find relevant articles and the VOSviewer software was performed for a network analysis. Thirty-nine significant articles were identified for analysis from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, in which we analyzed the DM and ML techniques used, as well as the areas that are most engaged in promoting smart cities. Predictive analytics was the most common technique and the studies focused primarily on the areas of smart mobility and smart environment. This study seeks to encourage approaches that can be used by governmental agencies and companies to develop smart cities, being essential to assist in the Sustainable Development Goals.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - On-demand shared mobility is increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to address urban transport challenges in large and fast-growing cities. The appeal of this form of transport is largely attributed to its convenience, ease of use, and affordability made possible through digital platforms and innovations. The convergence of the shared economy with a number of established and emerging technologies—such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud and Fog computing—is helping to expedite their deployment as a new form of public transport. Recently, this has manifested itself in the form of Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMoD) solutions, aimed at meeting personal travel demands through flexible routing and scheduling. Increasingly, these shared mobility solutions are blurring the boundaries with existing forms of public transport, particularly bus operations. This paper presents an environmental scan and analysis of the technological, social, and economic impacts surrounding disruptive technology-driven shared mobility trends. Specifically, the paper includes an examination of current and anticipated external factors that are of direct relevance to collaborative and low carbon mobility. The paper also outlines how these trends are likely to influence the mobility industries now and into the future. The paper collates information from a wide body of literature and reports on findings from actual ‘use cases’ that exist today which have used these disruptive mobility solutions to deliver substantial benefits to travellers around the world. Finally, the paper provides stakeholders with insight into identifying and responding to the likely needs and impacts of FMoD and informs their policy and strategy positions on the implementation of smart mobility systems in their cities and jurisdictions.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) has been a popular research area in the last decade. The dependability of CPS is still a critical issue, and few surveys have been published in this domain. CPS is a dynamic complex system, which involves various multidisciplinary technologies. To avoid human errors and to simplify management, self-management CPS (SCPS) is a wise choice. To achieve dependable self-management, systematic solutions are necessary to verify the design and to guarantee the safety of self-adaptation decisions, as well as to maintain the health of SCPS. This survey first recalls the concepts of dependability, and proposes a generic environment-in-loop processing flow of self-management CPS, and then analyzes the error sources and challenges of self-management through the formal feedback flow. Focusing on reducing the complexity, we first survey the self-adaptive architecture approaches and applied dependability means, then we introduce a hybrid multi-role self-adaptive architecture, and discuss the supporting technologies for dependable self-management at the architecture level. Focus on dependable environment-centered adaptation, we investigate the verification and validation (V&amp;V) methods for making safe self-adaptation decision and the solutions for processing decision dependably. For system-centered adaptation, the comprehensive self-healing methods are summarized. Finally, we analyze the missing pieces of the technology puzzle and the future directions. In this survey, the technical trends for dependable CPS design and maintenance are discussed, an all-in-one solution is proposed to integrate these technologies and build a dependable organic SCPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on dependable SCPS building and evaluation.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - As an emerging and promising computing paradigm in the Internet of things (IoT), edge computing can significantly reduce energy consumption and enhance computation capability for resource-constrained IoT devices. Computation offloading has recently received considerable attention in edge computing. Many existing studies have investigated the computation offloading problem with independent computing tasks. However, due to the inter-task dependency in various devices that commonly happens in IoT systems, achieving energy-efficient computation offloading decisions remains a challengeable problem. In this paper, a cloud-assisted edge computing framework with a three-tier network in an IoT environment is introduced. In this framework, we first formulated an energy consumption minimization problem as a mixed integer programming problem considering two constraints, the task-dependency requirement and the completion time deadline of the IoT service. To address this problem, we then proposed an Energy-efficient Collaborative Task Computation Offloading (ECTCO) algorithm based on a semidefinite relaxation and stochastic mapping approach to obtain strategies of tasks computation offloading for IoT sensors. Simulation results demonstrated that the cloud-assisted edge computing framework was feasible and the proposed ECTCO algorithm could effectively reduce the energy cost of IoT sensors.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recently, vehicular networks have emerged to facilitate intelligent transportation systems (ITS). They enable vehicles to communicate with each other in order to provide various services such as traffic safety, autonomous driving, and entertainments. The vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication channel is doubly selective, where the channel changes within the transmission bandwidth and the frame duration. This necessitates robust algorithms to provide reliable V2V communications. In this paper, we propose a scheme that provides joint adaptive modulation, coding and payload length selection (AMCPLS) for V2V communications. Our AMCPLS scheme selects both the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and the payload length of transmission frames for V2V communication links, according to the V2V channel condition. Our aim is to achieve both reliability and spectrum efficiency. Our proposed AMCPLS scheme improves the V2V effective throughput performance while satisfying a predefined frame error rate (FER). Furthermore, we present a deep learning approach that exploits deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for implementing the proposed AMCPLS. Simulation results reveal that the proposed DCNN-based AMCPLS approach outperforms other competing machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and support vector machines (SVM) in terms of FER, effective throughput, and prediction time.

TI  - Measurement Noise Recommendation for Efficient Kalman Filtering over a Large Amount of Sensor Data

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - To effectively maintain and analyze a large amount of real-time sensor data, one often uses a filtering technique that reflects characteristics of original data well. This paper proposes a novel method for recommending the measurement noise for Kalman filtering, which is one of the most representative filtering techniques. Kalman filtering corrects inaccurate values of input sensor data, and its filtering performance varies depending on the input noise parameters. In particular, if the noise parameters determined based on the user&rsquo;s experience are incorrect, the accuracy of Kalman filtering may be reduced significantly. Based on this observation, this paper addresses how to determine the measurement noise variance, a major input parameter of Kalman filtering, by analyzing past sensor data and how to use the estimated noise to improve the filtering accuracy. More specifically, to estimate the measurement noise variance, two analytical methods are proposed: one a transform-based method using a wavelet transform and the other a learning-based method using a denoising autoencoder. Experimental results show that the proposed methods estimated the measurement noise variance accurately and were superior to the experience-based method in the filtering accuracy.

AB  - In recent years, due to the unnecessary wastage of electrical energy in residential buildings, the requirement of energy optimization and user comfort has gained vital importance. In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique is to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements, such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gaps in the literature are due to advancements in technology, the drawbacks of optimization algorithms, and the introduction of new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. Detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In order to optimize intelligent applications driven by various sensors, it is vital to properly interpret and reuse sensor data from different domains. The construction of semantic maps which illustrate the relationship between heterogeneous domain ontologies plays an important role in knowledge reuse. However, most mapping methods in the literature use the literal meaning of each concept and instance in the ontology to obtain semantic similarity. This is especially the case for domain ontologies which are built for applications with sensor data. At the instance level, there is seldom work to utilize data of the sensor instances when constructing the ontologies&rsquo; mapping relationship. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to achieve the association between sensor data and domain ontology. In our approach, we first classify the sensor data by making them as SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontology instances, and map the corresponding instances to the concepts in the domain ontology. Secondly, a multi-strategy similarity calculation method is used to evaluate the similarity of the concept pairs between the domain ontologies at multiple levels. Finally, the set of concept pairs with a high similarity is selected by the analytic hierarchy process to construct the mapping relationship between the domain ontologies, and then the correlation between sensor data and domain ontologies are constructed. Using the method presented in this paper, we perform sensor data correlation experiments with a simulator for a real world scenario. By comparison to other methods, the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Recent expansion of intelligent gadgets, such as smartphones and smart watches, familiarizes humans with sensing their activities. We have been developing a road accessibility evaluation system inspired by human sensing technologies. This paper introduces our methodology to estimate road accessibility from the three-axis acceleration data obtained by a smart phone attached on a wheelchair seat, such as environmental factors, e.g., curbs and gaps, which directly influence wheelchair bodies, and human factors, e.g., wheelchair users&rsquo; feelings of tiredness and strain. Our goal is to realize a system that provides the road accessibility visualization services to users by online/offline pattern matching using impersonal models, while gradually learning to improve service accuracy using new data provided by users. As the first step, this paper evaluates features acquired by the DCNN (deep convolutional neural network), which learns the state of the road surface from the data in supervised machine learning techniques. The evaluated results show that the features can capture the difference of the road surface condition in more detail than the label attached by us and are effective as the means for quantitatively expressing the road surface condition. This paper developed and evaluated a prototype system that estimated types of ground surfaces focusing on knowledge extraction and visualization.

Compared to the current method of identification, this approach is more agile and does not require as many resources. Two approaches are employed, one using feature detectors/descriptors and other using convolutional neural networks. The former used a vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD); however, it failed to accomplish what was desired. The latter used you only look once (YOLO), a convolutional neural network, and reached an accuracy in the range of 90%, meaning that it correctly identified and classified 90% of the pictures used on the test set.

AB  - In view of intensified disasters and fatalities caused by natural phenomena and geographical expansion, there is a pressing need for a more effective environment logging for a better management and urban planning. This paper proposes a novel utility computing model (UCM) for structural health monitoring (SHM) that would enable dynamic planning of monitoring systems in an efficient and cost-effective manner in form of a SHM geo-informatics system. The proposed UCM consists of networked SHM systems that send geometrical SHM variables to SHM-UCM gateways. Every gateway is routing the data to SHM-UCM servers running a geo-spatial patch health assessment and prediction algorithm. The inputs of the prediction algorithm are geometrical variables, environmental variables, and payloads. The proposed SHM-UCM is unique in terms of its capability to manage heterogeneous SHM resources. This has been tested in a case study on Qatar University (QU) in Doha Qatar, where it looked at where SHM nodes are distributed along with occupancy density in each building. This information was taken from QU routers and zone calculation models and were then compared to ideal SHM system data. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in logging and dynamically planning SHM.

AB  - This paper studies mobile edge computing (MEC) networks where multiple wireless devices (WDs) offload their computation tasks to multiple edge servers and one cloud server. Considering different real-time computation tasks at different WDs, every task is decided to be processed locally at its WD or to be offloaded to and processed at one of the edge servers or the cloud server. In this paper, we investigate low-complexity computation offloading policies to guarantee quality of service of the MEC network and to minimize WDs&rsquo; energy consumption. Specifically, both a linear programing relaxation-based (LR-based) algorithm and a distributed deep learning-based offloading (DDLO) algorithm are independently studied for MEC networks. We further propose a heterogeneous DDLO to achieve better convergence performance than DDLO. Extensive numerical results show that the DDLO algorithms guarantee better performance than the LR-based algorithm. Furthermore, the DDLO algorithm generates an offloading decision in less than 1 millisecond, which is several orders faster than the LR-based algorithm.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - Presently, we are observing an explosion of data that need to be stored and processed over the Internet, and characterized by large volume, velocity and variety. For this reason, software developers have begun to look at NoSQL solutions for data storage. However, operations that are trivial in traditional Relational DataBase Management Systems (DBMSs) can become very complex in NoSQL DBMSs. This is the case of the join operation to establish a connection between two or more DB structures, whose construct is not explicitly available in many NoSQL databases. As a consequence, the data model has to be changed or a set of operations have to be performed to address particular queries on data. Thus, open questions are: how do NoSQL solutions work when they have to perform join operations on data that are not natively supported? What is the quality of NoSQL solutions in such cases? In this paper, we deal with such issues specifically considering one of the major NoSQL document oriented DB available on the market: MongoDB. In particular, we discuss an approach to perform join operations at application layer in MongoDB that allows us to preserve data models. We analyse performance of the proposes approach discussing the introduced overhead in comparison with SQL-like DBs.

AB  - There is an increasing demand for acquiring details of food nutrients especially among those who are sensitive to food intakes and weight changes. To meet this need, we propose a new approach based on deep learning that precisely estimates the composition of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats from hyperspectral signals of foods obtained by using low-cost spectrometers. Specifically, we develop a system consisting of multiple deep neural networks for estimating food nutrients followed by detecting and discarding estimation anomalies. Our comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system can maximize estimation accuracy by automatically identifying wrong estimations. As such, if consolidated with the capability of reinforcement learning, it will likely be positioned as a promising means for personalized healthcare in terms of food safety.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In human-centered intelligent building, real-time measurements of human thermal comfort play critical roles and supply feedback control signals for building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Due to the challenges of intra- and inter-individual differences and skin subtleness variations, there has not been any satisfactory solution for thermal comfort measurements until now. In this paper, a contactless measuring method based on a skin sensitivity index and deep learning (NISDL) was proposed to measure real-time skin temperature. A new evaluating index, named the skin sensitivity index (SSI), was defined to overcome individual differences and skin subtleness variations. To illustrate the effectiveness of SSI proposed, a two multi-layers deep learning framework (NISDL method I and II) was designed and the DenseNet201 was used for extracting features from skin images. The partly personal saturation temperature (NIPST) algorithm was use for algorithm comparisons. Another deep learning algorithm without SSI (DL) was also generated for algorithm comparisons. Finally, a total of 1.44 million image data was used for algorithm validation. The results show that 55.62% and 52.25% error values (NISDL method I, II) are scattered at (0 &deg;C, 0.25 &deg;C), and the same error intervals distribution of NIPST is 35.39%.

AB  - This research paper focuses on a water quality prediction model which requires high-quality data. In the process of construction and operation of smart water quality monitoring systems based on Internet of Things (IoT), more and more big data are produced at a high speed, which has made water quality data complicated. Taking advantage of the good performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) deep neural networks in time-series prediction, a drinking-water quality model was designed and established to predict water quality big data with the help of the advanced deep learning (DL) theory in this paper. The drinking-water quality data measured by the automatic water quality monitoring station of Guazhou Water Source of the Yangtze River in Yangzhou were utilized to analyze the water quality parameters in detail, and the prediction model was trained and tested with monitoring data from January 2016 to June 2018. The results of the study indicate that the predicted values of the model and the actual values were in good agreement and accurately revealed the future developing trend of water quality, showing the feasibility and effectiveness of using LSTM deep neural networks to predict the quality of drinking water.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Through the Internet of things (IoT), as promoted by smart cities, there is an emergence of big data accentuating the use of artificial intelligence through various components of urban planning, management, and design. One such system is that of artificial neural networks (ANNs), a component of machine learning that boasts similitude with brain neurological networks and its functioning. However, the development of ANN was done in singular fashion, whereby processes are rendered in sequence in a unidimensional perspective, contrasting with the functions of the brain to which ANN boasts similitude, and in particular to the concept of neuroplasticity which encourages unique complex interactions in self-learning fashion, thereby encouraging more inclusive urban processes and render urban coherence. This paper takes inspiration from Christopher Alexander&rsquo;s Nature of Order and dwells in the concept of complexity theory; it also proposes a theoretical model of how ANN can be rendered with the same plastic properties as brain neurological networks with multidimensional interactivity in the context of smart cities through the use of big data and its emerging complex networks. By doing so, this model caters to the creation of stronger, richer, and more complex patterns that support Alexander&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; through the connection of overlapping networks. This paper is aimed toward engineers with interdisciplinary interest looking at creating more complex and intricate ANN models, and toward urban planners and urban theorists working on the emerging contemporary concept of smart cities.

AB  - The demand for mobile data communication has been increasing owing to the diversification of its purposes and the increase in the number of mobile devices accessing mobile networks. Users are experiencing a degradation in communication quality due to mobile network congestion. Therefore, improving the bandwidth utilization efficiency of cellular infrastructure is crucial. We previously proposed a mobile data offloading protocol (MDOP) for improving the bandwidth utilization efficiency. Although this method balances a load of evolved node B by taking into consideration the content delay tolerance, accurately balancing the load is challenging. In this paper, we apply deep reinforcement learning to MDOP to solve the temporal locality of a traffic. Moreover, we examine and evaluate the concrete processing while considering a delay tolerance. A comparison of the proposed method and bandwidth utilization efficiency of MDOP showed that the proposed method reduced the network traffic in excess of the control target value by 35% as compared with the MDOP. Furthermore, the proposed method improved the data transmission ratio by the delay tolerance range. Consequently, the proposed method improved the bandwidth utilization efficiency by learning how to provide the bandwidth to the user equipment when MDOP cannot be used to appropriately balance a load.

AB  - Citizen safety in modern urban environments is an important aspect of life quality. Implementation of a smart city approach to video surveillance depends heavily on the capability of gathering and processing huge amounts of live urban data. Analyzing data from high bandwidth surveillance video streams provided by large size distributed sensor networks is particularly challenging. We propose here an efficient method for automatic violent behavior detection designed for video sensor networks. Known solutions to real-time violence detection are not suitable for implementation in a resource-constrained environment due to the high processing power requirements. Our algorithm achieves real-time processing on a Raspberry PI-embedded architecture. To ensure separation of temporal and spatial information processing we employ a computationally effective cascaded approach. It consists of a deep neural network followed by a time domain classifier. In contrast with current approaches, the deep neural network input is fed exclusively with motion vector features extracted directly from the MPEG encoded video stream. As proven by results, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, while running on a low computational resources embedded architecture.

However, not all applications have the luxury of using depth sensors or multiple cameras to obtain depth information. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the per-pixel depths from a single image. Inspired by the recent works on generative neural network models, we formulate the task of depth estimation as a generative task where we synthesize an image of the depth map from a single Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) input image. We propose a novel generative adversarial network that has an encoder-decoder type generator with residual transposed convolution blocks trained with an adversarial loss. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several depth estimation works.

AB  - With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), applications have become smarter and connected devices give rise to their exploitation in all aspects of a modern city. As the volume of the collected data increases, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. The field of smart transportation has attracted many researchers and it has been approached with both ML and IoT techniques. In this review, smart transportation is considered to be an umbrella term that covers route optimization, parking, street lights, accident prevention/detection, road anomalies, and infrastructure applications. The purpose of this paper is to make a self-contained review of ML techniques and IoT applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and obtain a clear view of the trends in the aforementioned fields and spot possible coverage needs. From the reviewed articles it becomes profound that there is a possible lack of ML coverage for the Smart Lighting Systems and Smart Parking applications. Additionally, route optimization, parking, and accident/detection tend to be the most popular ITS applications among researchers.

Several approaches inside this domain make use of knowledge bases or knowledge graphs, both previously existing and ad hoc. This form of representation allows heterogeneous data gathered from diverse sources to be contextualized and combined to create relevant information for intelligent systems, usually following higher level constraints defined by an ontology. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the existing usages of knowledge bases in intelligent environments, as well as an in-depth study of the predictive and decision-making models employed. Finally, we present a use case for smart homes and illustrate the use and advantages of Knowledge Graph Embeddings in this context.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based algorithm is subject to the way the feature data is extracted. This is a common issue when applying the ANN to indoor fingerprinting-based localization where the signal is unstable. To date, there is not adequate feature extraction method that can significantly mitigate the influence of the receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI) variation that degrades the performance of the ANN-based indoor fingerprinting algorithm. In this work, a wavelet scattering transform is used to extract reliable features that are stable to small deformation and rotation invariant. The extracted features are used by a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the location. The zeroth and the first layer of decomposition coefficients were used as features data by concatenating different scattering path coefficients. The proposed algorithm has been validated on real measurements and has achieved good performance. The experimentation results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction method is stable to the RSSI variation.

The sparse Bayesian ELM and weighted ELM have been embedded into the proposed bundle learning machine. The case study includes real field signals obtained from the Turkish electricity transmission system. Most actual events like voltage sag, voltage swell, interruption, and harmonics have been detected using the proposed algorithm.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - For a city to be livable and walkable is the ultimate goal of future cities. However, conflicts among pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists at traffic intersections are becoming severe in high-density urban transportation areas, especially in China. Correspondingly, the transit time at intersections is becoming prolonged, and pedestrian safety is becoming endangered. Simulating pedestrian movements at complex traffic intersections is necessary to optimize the traffic organization. We propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based method for tracking and simulating pedestrian movements at intersections. Specifically, high-resolution videos acquired by a UAV are used to recognize and position moving targets, including pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles, using the convolutional neural network. An improved social force-based motion model is proposed, considering the conflicts among pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles. In addition, maximum likelihood estimation is performed to calibrate an improved social force model. UAV videos of intersections in Shenzhen are analyzed to demonstrate the performance of the presented approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed social force-based motion model can effectively simulate the movement of pedestrians and cyclists at road intersections. The presented approach provides an alternative method to track and simulate pedestrian movements, thus benefitting the organization of pedestrian flow and traffic signals controlling the intersections.

AB  - In the era of big data, smart cities have become a promising prospect for governments, citizens, and industrials. Many ideas and their derived systems for smart cities depend on big data for achieving a goal of data intelligence. However, there is an urgent transformation trend from data intelligence to service intelligence in the vision of smart cities due to the living requirements of citizens. People-centric service intelligence in smart cities has to support the realization of people&rsquo;s needs within urban and social domains. This paper introduces a concept of people-centric service intelligence, defines the level of it and its challenges in the aspect of infrastructure, human dynamics, human understanding and prediction, and the human&ndash;machine interface. Then, this paper proposes the theoretical framework and technical frameworks of people-centric service intelligence, and the service intelligence schemas for future construction of smart cities. It will be helpful for governments and industries to design people-centric service intelligence for improving the quality of life, the capabilities of good sustainability, and better development.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) provides a way to acquire detailed energy consumption and appliance operation status through a single sensor, which has been proven to save energy. Further, besides load disaggregation, advanced applications (e.g., demand response) need to recognize on/off events of appliances instantly. In order to shorten the time delay for users to acquire the event information, it is necessary to analyze extremely short period electrical signals. However, the features of those signals are easily submerged in complex background loads, especially in cross-user scenarios. Through experiments and observations, it can be found that the feature of background loads is almost stationary in a short time. On the basis of this result, this paper provides a novel model called the concatenate convolutional neural network to separate the feature of the target load from the load mixed with the background. For the cross-user test on the UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity dataset (UK-DALE), it turns out that the proposed model remarkably improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization of load recognition. In addition, it also provides significant improvements in energy disaggregation compared with the state-of-the-art.

AB  - As fifth-generation mobile communication systems give rise to new smart grid technologies, such as distributed energy resources, advanced communication systems, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics, the development of novel platforms and business models that ensure reliability and profitability of microgrid operations become increasingly important. In this study, we introduce an open micro energy grid platform to operate the widely distributed microgrids in Korea. Subsequently, we present commercial microgrid business models supported by the open micro energy grid platform equipped with an artificial intelligence engine and provide test results from testbeds connected to the platform. In contrast to the existing microgrid business models in the market, we propose a universal architecture and business model of the future microgrid, comprising (i) an energy robot-management operation business model, (ii) electric vehicle-based demand response, (iii) blockchain technology for energy trading, and (iv) a service-oriented business model. Finally, we propose a new business model for an intelligent virtual power plant (VPP) operator along with the architecture of the VPP and its proof of concept (PoC). We expect the proposed business model to provide energy solution providers with guidelines to develop various VPP services.

AB  - To achieve the full analytical potential of the streaming data from the internet of things, the interconnection of various data sources is needed. By definition, those sources are heterogeneous and their integration is not a trivial task. A common approach to exploit streaming sensor data potential is to use machine learning techniques for predictive analytics in a way that is agnostic to the domain knowledge. Such an approach can be easily integrated in various use cases. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data fusion of a set of heterogeneous data streams. The proposed framework enriches streaming sensor data with the contextual and historical information relevant for describing the underlying processes. The final result of the framework is a feature vector, ready to be used in a machine learning algorithm. The framework has been applied to a cloud and to an edge device. In the latter case, incremental learning capabilities have been demonstrated. The reported results illustrate a significant improvement of data-driven models, applied to sensor streams. Beside higher accuracy of the models the platform offers easy setup and thus fast prototyping capabilities in real-world applications.

SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - Different probabilities of events attract different attention in many scenarios such as anomaly detection and security systems. To characterize the events&rsquo; importance from a probabilistic perspective, the message importance measure (MIM) is proposed as a kind of semantics analysis tool. Similar to Shannon entropy, the MIM has its special function in information representation, in which the parameter of MIM plays a vital role. Actually, the parameter dominates the properties of MIM, based on which the MIM has three work regions where this measure can be used flexibly for different goals. When the parameter is positive but not large enough, the MIM not only provides a new viewpoint for information processing but also has some similarities with Shannon entropy in the information compression and transmission. In this regard, this paper first constructs a system model with message importance measure and proposes the message importance loss to enrich the information processing strategies. Moreover, the message importance loss capacity is proposed to measure the information importance harvest in a transmission. Furthermore, the message importance distortion function is discussed to give an upper bound of information compression based on the MIM. Additionally, the bitrate transmission constrained by the message importance loss is investigated to broaden the scope for Shannon information theory.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - Disaster events and their economic impacts are trending, and climate projection studies suggest that the risks of disaster will continue to increase in the near future. Despite the broad and increasing social effects of these events, the empirical basis of disaster research is often weak, partially due to the natural paucity of observed data. At the same time, some of the early research regarding social responses to disasters have become outdated as social, cultural, and political norms have changed. The digital revolution, the open data trend, and the advancements in data science provide new opportunities for social science disaster research. We introduce the term computational social science of disasters (CSSD), which can be formally defined as the systematic study of the social behavioral dynamics of disasters utilizing computational methods. In this paper, we discuss and showcase the opportunities and the challenges in this new approach to disaster research. Following a brief review of the fields that relate to CSSD, namely traditional social sciences of disasters, computational social science, and crisis informatics, we examine how advances in Internet technologies offer a new lens through which to study disasters. By identifying gaps in the literature, we show how this new field could address ways to advance our understanding of the social and behavioral aspects of disasters in a digitally connected world. In doing so, our goal is to bridge the gap between data science and the social sciences of disasters in rapidly changing environments.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is the global network of interrelated physical devices such as sensors, actuators, smart applications, objects, computing devices, mechanical machines, and people that are becoming an essential part of the internet. In an industrial environment, these devices are the source of data which provide abundant information in manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, the massive, heterogeneous, and time-sensitive nature of the data brings substantial challenges to the real-time collection, processing, and decision making. Therefore, this paper presents a framework of an IoT-based Industrial Data Management System (IDMS) which can manage the huge industrial data, support online monitoring, and control smart manufacturing. The framework contains five basic layers such as physical, network, middleware, database, and application layers to provide a service-oriented architecture for the end users. Experimental results from a smart factory case study demonstrate that the framework can manage the regular data and urgent events generated from various factory devices in the distributed industrial environment through state-of-the-art communication protocols. The collected data is converted into useful information which improves productivity and the prognosis of production lines.

TI  - Design and Analysis of a Lightweight Context Fusion CNN Scheme for Crowd Counting
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Crowd counting, which is widely used in disaster management, traffic monitoring, and other fields of urban security, is a challenging task that is attracting increasing interest from researchers. For better accuracy, most methods have attempted to handle the scale variation explicitly. which results in huge scale changes of the object size. However, earlier methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have focused primarily on improving accuracy while ignoring the complexity of the model. This paper proposes a novel method based on a lightweight CNN-based network for estimating crowd counting and generating density maps under resource constraints. The network is composed of three components: a basic feature extractor (BFE), a stacked &agrave; trous convolution module (SACM), and a context fusion module (CFM). The BFE encodes basic feature information with reduced spatial resolution for further refining. Various pieces of contextual information are generated through a short pipeline in SACM. To generate a context fusion density map, CFM distills feature maps from the above components. The whole network is trained in an end-to-end fashion and uses a compression factor to restrict its size. Experiments on three highly-challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method delivers attractive performance.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fire detection system requires accurate and fast mechanisms to make the right decision in a fire situation. Since most commercial fire detection systems use a simple sensor, their fire recognition accuracy is deficient because of the limitations of the detection capability of the sensor. Existing proposals, which use rule-based algorithms or image-based machine learning can hardly adapt to the changes in the environment because of their static features. Since the legacy fire detection systems and network services do not guarantee data transfer latency, the required need for promptness is unmet. In this paper, we propose a new fire detection system with a multifunctional artificial intelligence framework and a data transfer delay minimization mechanism for the safety of smart cities. The framework includes a set of multiple machine learning algorithms and an adaptive fuzzy algorithm. In addition, Direct-MQTT based on SDN is introduced to solve the traffic concentration problems of the traditional MQTT. We verify the performance of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and delay time and found a fire detection accuracy of over 95%. The end-to-end delay, which comprises the transfer and decision delays, is reduced by an average of 72%.

TI  - Forecasting Heating Consumption in Buildings: A Scalable Full-Stack Distributed Engine

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Predicting power demand of building heating systems is a challenging task due to the high variability of their energy profiles. Power demand is characterized by different heating cycles including sequences of various transient and steady-state phases. To effectively perform the predictive task by exploiting the huge amount of fine-grained energy-related data collected through Internet of Things (IoT) devices, innovative and scalable solutions should be devised. This paper presents PHi-CiB, a scalable full-stack distributed engine, addressing all tasks from energy-related data collection, to their integration, storage, analysis, and modeling. Heterogeneous data measurements (e.g., power consumption in buildings, meteorological conditions) are collected through multiple hardware (e.g., IoT devices) and software (e.g., web services) entities. Such data are integrated and analyzed to predict the average power demand of each building for different time horizons. First, the transient and steady-state phases characterizing the heating cycle of each building are automatically identified; then the power-level forecasting is performed for each phase. To this aim, PHi-CiB relies on a pipeline of three algorithms: the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, and the Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent. PHi-CiB&rsquo;s current implementation exploits Apache Spark and MongoDB and supports parallel and scalable processing and analytical tasks. Experimental results, performed on energy-related data collected in a real-world system show the effectiveness of PHi-CiB in predicting heating power consumption of buildings with a limited prediction error and an optimal horizontal scalability.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Air pollution has become a global environmental problem, because it has a great adverse impact on human health and the climate. One way to explore this problem is to monitor and predict air quality index in an economical way. Accurate monitoring and prediction of air quality index (AQI), e.g., PM2.5 concentration, is a challenging task. In order to accurately predict the PM2.5 time series, we propose a supplementary leaky integrator echo state network (SLI-ESN) in this paper. It adds the historical state term of the historical moment to the calculation of leaky integrator reservoir, which improves the influence of historical evolution state on the current state. Considering the redundancy and correlation between multivariable time series, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection method is introduced to reduce redundant and irrelevant information, and increase computation speed. A variety of evaluation indicators are used to assess the overall performance of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by the experiment of Beijing PM2.5 time series prediction. The comparison of learning time also shows the efficiency of the algorithm.

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the development of intelligent transportation system (ITS) and vehicle to X (V2X), the connected vehicle is capable of sensing a great deal of useful traffic information, such as queue length at intersections. Aiming to solve the problem of existing models&rsquo; complexity and information redundancy, this paper proposes a queue length sensing model based on V2X technology, which consists of two sub-models based on shockwave sensing and back propagation (BP) neural network sensing. First, the model obtains state information of the connected vehicles and analyzes the formation process of the queue, and then it calculates the velocity of the shockwave to predict the queue length of the subsequent unconnected vehicles. Then, the neural network is trained with historical connected vehicle data, and a sub-model based on the BP neural network is established to predict the real-time queue length. Finally, the final queue length at the intersection is determined by combining the sub-models by variable weight. Simulation results show that the sensing accuracy of the combined model is proportional to the penetration rate of connected vehicles, and sensing of queue length can be achieved even in low penetration rate environments. In mixed traffic environments of connected vehicles and unconnected vehicles, the queuing length sensing model proposed in this paper has higher performance than the probability distribution (PD) model when the penetration rate is low, and it has an almost equivalent performance with higher penetration rate while the penetration rate is not needed. The proposed sensing model is more applicable for mixed traffic scenarios with much looser conditions.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The Smart campus is a concept of an education institute using technologies, such as information systems, internet of things (IoT), and context-aware computing, to support learning, teaching, and administrative activities. Classrooms are important building blocks of a school campus. Therefore, a feasible architecture for building and running smart classrooms is essential for a smart campus. However, most studies related to the smart classroom are focused on studying or addressing particular technical or educational issues, such as networking, AI applications, lecture quality, and user responses to technology. In this study, an architecture for building and running context-aware smart classrooms is proposed. The proposed architecture consists of three parts including a prototype of a context-aware smart classroom, a model for technology integration, and supporting measures for the operation of smart classrooms in this architecture. The classroom prototype was designed based on our study results and a smart classroom project in Ming Chuan University (MCU). The integration model was a layered model uses Raspberry Pi in the bottom layer of the model to integrate underlying technologies and provide application interfaces to the higher layer applications for the ease of building context-aware smart classroom applications. As a result, application interfaces were implemented using Raspberry Pi based on the proposed technology integration model, and a context-aware energy-saving smart classroom application was implemented based on the proposed classroom prototype and the implemented web application interface. The result shows that, in terms of technology, the proposed architecture is feasible for building context-aware smart classrooms in smart campuses.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - When measurement rates grow, most Compressive Sensing (CS) methods suffer from an increase in overheads of transmission and storage of CS measurements, while reconstruction quality degrades appreciably when measurement rates reduce. To solve these problems in real scenarios such as large-scale distributed surveillance systems, we propose a low-cost image CS approach called MRCS for object detection. It predicts key objects using the proposed MYOLO3 detector, and then samples the regions of the key objects as well as other regions using multiple measurement rates to reduce the size of sampled CS measurements. It also stores and transmits half-precision CS measurements to further reduce the required transmission bandwidth and storage space. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MYOLO3 is a smaller and improved object detector for resource-limited hardware devices such as surveillance cameras and aerial drones. They also suggest that MRCS significantly reduces the required transmission bandwidth and storage space by declining the size of CS measurements, e.g., mean Compression Ratios (mCR) achieves 1.43&ndash;22.92 on the VOC-pbc dataset. Notably, MRCS further reduces the size of CS measurements by half-precision representations. Subsequently, the required transmission bandwidth and storage space are reduced by one half as compared to the counterparts represented with single-precision floats. Moreover, it also substantially enhances the usability of object detection on reconstructed images with half-precision CS measurements and multiple measurement rates as compared to its counterpart, using a single low measurement rate.

AB  - The Global Positioning System (GPS) has been widely applied in outdoor positioning, but it cannot meet the accuracy requirements of indoor positioning. Comprising an important part of the Internet of Things perception layer, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) plays an important role in indoor positioning. We propose a novel localization scheme aiming at the defects of existing RFID localization technology in localization accuracy and deployment cost, called ANTspin: Efficient Absolute Localization Method of RFID Tags via Spinning Antenna, which introduces a rotary table in the experiment. The reader antenna is fixed on the rotary table to continuously collect dynamic data. When compared with static acquisition, there is more information for localization. After that, the relative incident angle and distance between tags and the antenna can be analyzed for localization with characteristics of Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) data. We implement ANTspin using COTS RFID devices and the experimental results show that it achieves a mean accuracy of 9.34 cm in 2D and mean accuracy of 13.01 cm in three-dimensions (3D) with high efficiency and low deployment cost.

AB  - Road transportation is the backbone of modern economies, albeit it annually costs     1.25     million deaths and trillions of dollars to the global economy, and damages public health and the environment. Deep learning is among the leading-edge methods used for transportation-related predictions, however, the existing works are in their infancy, and fall short in multiple respects, including the use of datasets with limited sizes and scopes, and insufficient depth of the deep learning studies. This paper provides a novel and comprehensive approach toward large-scale, faster, and real-time traffic prediction by bringing four complementary cutting-edge technologies together: big data, deep learning, in-memory computing, and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We trained deep networks using over 11 years of data provided by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the largest dataset that has been used in deep learning studies. Several combinations of the input attributes of the data along with various network configurations of the deep learning models were investigated for training and prediction purposes. The use of the pre-trained model for real-time prediction was explored. The paper contributes novel deep learning models, algorithms, implementation, analytics methodology, and software tool for smart cities, big data, high performance computing, and their convergence.

AB  - Rapid transit systems or metros are a popular choice for high-capacity public transport in urban areas due to several advantages including safety, dependability, speed, cost, and lower risk of accidents. Existing studies on metros have not considered appropriate holistic urban transport models and integrated use of cutting-edge technologies. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach toward large-scale and faster prediction of metro system characteristics by employing the integration of four leading-edge technologies: big data, deep learning, in-memory computing, and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Using London Metro as a case study, and the Rolling Origin and Destination Survey (RODS) (real) dataset, we predict the number of passengers for six time intervals (a) using various access transport modes to reach the train stations (buses, walking, etc.); (b) using various egress modes to travel from the metro station to their next points of interest (PoIs); (c) traveling between different origin-destination (OD) pairs of stations; and (d) against the distance between the OD stations. The prediction allows better spatiotemporal planning of the whole urban transport system, including the metro subsystem, and its various access and egress modes. The paper contributes novel deep learning models, algorithms, implementation, analytics methodology, and software tool for analysis of metro systems.

AB  - The constantly increasing amount and availability of urban data derived from varying sources leads to an assortment of challenges that include, among others, the consolidation, visualization, and maximal exploitation prospects of the aforementioned data. A preeminent problem affecting urban planning is the appropriate choice of location to host a particular activity (either commercial or common welfare service) or the correct use of an existing building or empty space. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these challenges availed with machine learning techniques. The proposed system combines, fuses, and merges various types of data from different sources, encodes them using a novel semantic model that can capture and utilize both low-level geometric information and higher level semantic information and subsequently feeds them to the random forests classifier, as well as other supervised machine learning models for comparisons. Our experimental evaluation on multiple real-world data sets comparing the performance of several classifiers (including Feedforward Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Bag of Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Na&iuml;ve Bayes), indicated the superiority of Random Forests in terms of the examined performance metrics (Accuracy, Specificity, Precision, Recall, F-measure and G-mean).

AB  - This research aims to identify spatial and time patterns of theft in Manhattan, NY, to reveal urban factors that contribute to thefts from motor vehicles and to build a prediction model for thefts. Methods include time series and hot spot analysis, linear regression, elastic-net, Support vector machines SVM with radial and linear kernels, decision tree, bagged CART, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosting. Machine learning methods reveal that linear models perform better on our data (linear regression, elastic-net), specifying that a higher number of subway entrances, graffiti, and restaurants on streets contribute to higher theft rates from motor vehicles. Although the prediction model for thefts meets almost all assumptions (five of six), its accuracy is 77%, suggesting that there are other undiscovered factors making a contribution to the generation of thefts. As an output demonstrating final results, the application prototype for searching safer parking in Manhattan, NY based on the prediction model, has been developed.

AB  - An accurate forecast of the electricity consumption is particularly important to both consumers and system operators. The purpose of this study is to develop a forecasting method that provides such an accurate forecast of the month-ahead hourly electricity consumption in the case of medium industrial consumers, therefore assuring an intelligent energy management and an efficient economic scheduling of their resources, having the possibility to negotiate in advance appropriate billing tariffs relying on accurate hourly forecasts, in the same time facilitating an optimal energy management for the dispatch operator. The forecasting method consists of developing first non-linear autoregressive, with exogenous inputs (NARX) artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to forecast an initial daily electricity consumption, a forecast that is being further processed with custom developed long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with exogenous variables support in order to refine the daily forecast as to achieve an accurate hourly forecasted consumed electricity for the whole month-ahead. The obtained experimental results (highlighted also through a very good value of 0.0244 for the root mean square error performance metric, obtained when forecasting the month-ahead hourly electricity consumption and comparing it with the real consumption), the validation of the developed forecasting method, the comparison of the method with other forecasting approaches from the scientific literature substantiate the fact that the proposed approach manages to fill a gap in the current body of knowledge consisting of the need of a high-accuracy forecasting method for the month-ahead hourly electricity consumption in the case of medium industrial consumers.

AB  - Detection and isolation of burst locations in water distribution networks (WDN) are challenging problems in urban management because burst events cause considerable economic, social, and environmental losses. In the present study, a novel monitoring and sensor placement approach is proposed for rapid and robust burst detection. Accordingly, a hybrid principal component analysis (PCA) and standardized exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) system is proposed for WDN monitoring and management. In addition, the optimal sensor configuration is obtained using PCA, k-means clustering, and a sensitivity analysis considering the diurnal patterns and the noises of pressure and flowrate data in the WDN. The proposed system is applied to a branched WDN, and the results are compared to those obtained with conventional monitoring systems. The results show that the proposed system detected the burst occurrence regardless of noise size with a detection rate of 93%. Compared to conventional systems, the isolation ratio improved by 10%, indicating that the bursts were isolated more accurately. In addition, the corresponding sensor configuration was 40% less expensive than the conventional systems.

AB  - The Canary Islands are a well known tourist destination with generally stable and clement weather conditions. However, occasionally extreme weather conditions occur, which although very unusual, may cause severe damage to the local economy. The ViMetRi-MAC EU funded project has among its goals, managing climate-change-associated risks. The Spanish National Meteorology Agency (AEMET) has a network of weather stations across the eight Canary Islands. Using data from those stations, we propose a novel methodology for the prediction of maximum wind speed in order to trigger an early alert for extreme weather conditions. The methodology proposed has the added value of using an innovative kind of machine learning that is based on the data stream mining paradigm. This type of machine learning system relies on two important features: models are learned incrementally and adaptively. That means the learner tunes the models gradually and endlessly as new observations are received and also modifies it when there is concept drift (statistical instability), in the modeled phenomenon. The results presented seem to prove that this data stream mining approach is a good fit for this kind of problem, clearly improving the results obtained with the accumulative non-adaptive version of the methodology.

TI  - Predicting Station-Level Short-Term Passenger Flow in a Citywide Metro Network Using Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 6
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Predicting the passenger flow of metro networks is of great importance for traffic management and public safety. However, such predictions are very challenging, as passenger flow is affected by complex spatial dependencies (nearby and distant) and temporal dependencies (recent and periodic). In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning-based approach, named STGCNNmetro (spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural networks for metro), to collectively predict two types of passenger flow volumes&mdash;inflow and outflow&mdash;in each metro station of a city. Specifically, instead of representing metro stations by grids and employing conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, STGCNNmetro transforms the city metro network to a graph and makes predictions using graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). First, we apply stereogram graph convolution operations to seamlessly capture the irregular spatiotemporal dependencies along the metro network. Second, a deep structure composed of GCNNs is constructed to capture the distant spatiotemporal dependencies at the citywide level. Finally, we integrate three temporal patterns (recent, daily, and weekly) and fuse the spatiotemporal dependencies captured from these patterns to form the final prediction values. The STGCNNmetro model is an end-to-end framework which can accept raw passenger flow-volume data, automatically capture the effective features of the citywide metro network, and output predictions. We test this model by predicting the short-term passenger flow volume in the citywide metro network of Shanghai, China. Experiments show that the STGCNNmetro model outperforms seven well-known baseline models (LSVR, PCA-kNN, NMF-kNN, Bayesian, MLR, M-CNN, and LSTM). We additionally explore the sensitivity of the model to its parameters and discuss the distribution of prediction errors.

AB  - Taxi demand can be divided into pick-up demand and drop-off demand, which are firmly related to human&rsquo;s travel habits. Accurately predicting taxi demand is of great significance to passengers, drivers, ride-hailing platforms and urban managers. Most of the existing studies only forecast the taxi demand for pick-up and separate the interaction between spatial correlation and temporal correlation. In this paper, we first analyze the historical data and select three highly relevant parts for each time interval, namely closeness, period and trend. We then construct a multi-task learning component and extract the common spatiotemporal feature by treating the taxi pick-up prediction task and drop-off prediction task as two related tasks. With the aim of fusing spatiotemporal features of historical data, we conduct feature embedding by attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) and capture the correlation between taxi pick-up and drop-off with 3D ResNet. Finally, we combine external factors to simultaneously predict the taxi demand for pick-up and drop-off in the next time interval. Experiments conducted on real datasets in Chengdu present the effectiveness of the proposed method and show better performance in comparison with state-of-the-art models.

VL  - 8

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Delivering electronic health care (eHealth) services across multi-cloud providers to implement patient-centric care demands a trustworthy brokering architecture. Specifically, such an architecture should aggregate relevant medical information to allow informed decision-making. It should also ensure that this information is complete and authentic and that no one has tampered with it. Brokers deployed in eHealth services may fall short of meeting such criteria due to two key behaviors. The first involves violating international health-data protection laws by allowing user anonymity and limiting user access rights. Second, brokers claiming to provide trustworthy transactions between interested parties usually rely on user feedback, an approach vulnerable to manipulation by malicious users. This paper addresses these data security and trust challenges by proposing HealthyBroker, a novel, trust-building brokering architecture for multiple cloud environments. This architecture is designed specifically for patient-centric cloud eHealth services. It enables care-team members to complete eHealth transactions securely and access relevant patient data on a &ldquo;need-to-know&rdquo; basis in compliance with data-protection laws. HealthyBroker also protects against potential malicious behavior by assessing the trust relationship and tracking it using a neutral, tamper-proof, distributed blockchain ledger. Trust is assessed based on two strategies. First, all transactions and user feedback are tracked and audited in a distributed ledger for transparency. Second, only feedback coming from trustworthy parties is taken into consideration. HealthyBroker was tested in a simulated eHealth multi-cloud environment. The test produced better results than a benchmark algorithm in terms of data accuracy, service time, and the reliability of feedback received as measured by three malicious behavior models (na&iuml;ve, feedback isolated, and feedback collective). These results demonstrate that HealthyBroker can provide care teams with a trustworthy, transparent ecosystem that can facilitate information sharing and well-informed decisions for patient-centric care.

AB  - The worldwide utilization of surveillance cameras in smart cities has enabled researchers to analyze a gigantic volume of data to ensure automatic monitoring. An enhanced security system in smart cities, schools, hospitals, and other surveillance domains is mandatory for the detection of violent or abnormal activities to avoid any casualties which could cause social, economic, and ecological damages. Automatic detection of violence for quick actions is very significant and can efficiently assist the concerned departments. In this paper, we propose a triple-staged end-to-end deep learning violence detection framework. First, persons are detected in the surveillance video stream using a light-weight convolutional neural network (CNN) model to reduce and overcome the voluminous processing of useless frames. Second, a sequence of 16 frames with detected persons is passed to 3D CNN, where the spatiotemporal features of these sequences are extracted and fed to the Softmax classifier. Furthermore, we optimized the 3D CNN model using an open visual inference and neural networks optimization toolkit developed by Intel, which converts the trained model into intermediate representation and adjusts it for optimal execution at the end platform for the final prediction of violent activity. After detection of a violent activity, an alert is transmitted to the nearest police station or security department to take prompt preventive actions. We found that our proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for different benchmark datasets.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The 5G network is a next-generation wireless form of communication and the latest mobile technology. In practice, 5G utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) to work in high-traffic networks with multiple nodes/sensors in an attempt to transmit their packets to a destination simultaneously, which is a characteristic of IoT applications. Due to this, 5G offers vast bandwidth, low delay, and extremely high data transfer speed. Thus, 5G presents opportunities and motivations for utilizing next-generation protocols, especially the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP). However, the congestion control mechanisms of the conventional SCTP negatively influence overall performance. Moreover, existing mechanisms contribute to reduce 5G and IoT performance. Thus, a new machine learning model based on a decision tree (DT) algorithm is proposed in this study to predict optimal enhancement of congestion control in the wireless sensors of 5G IoT networks. The model was implemented on a training dataset to determine the optimal parametric setting in a 5G environment. The dataset was used to train the machine learning model and enable the prediction of optimal alternatives that can enhance the performance of the congestion control approach. The DT approach can be used for other functions, especially prediction and classification. DT algorithms provide graphs that can be used by any user to understand the prediction approach. The DT C4.5 provided promising results, with more than 92% precision and recall.

AB  - Buildings play a critical role in the stability and resilience of modern smart grids, leading to a refocusing of large-scale energy-management strategies from the supply side to the consumer side. When buildings integrate local renewable-energy generation in the form of renewable-energy resources, they become prosumers, and this adds more complexity to the operation of interconnected complex energy systems. A class of methods of modelling the energy-consumption patterns of the building have recently emerged as black-box input&ndash;output approaches with the ability to capture underlying consumption trends. These make use and require large quantities of quality data produced by nondeterministic processes underlying energy consumption. We present an application of a class of neural networks, namely, deep-learning techniques for time-series sequence modelling, with the goal of accurate and reliable building energy-load forecasting. Recurrent Neural Network implementation uses Long Short-Term Memory layers in increasing density of nodes to quantify prediction accuracy. The case study is illustrated on four university buildings from temperate climates over one year of operation using a reference benchmarking dataset that allows replicable results. The obtained results are discussed in terms of accuracy metrics and computational and network architecture aspects, and are considered suitable for further use in future in situ energy management at the building and neighborhood levels.

TI  - District Heating Load Prediction Algorithm Based on Feature Fusion LSTM Model

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The smart district heating system (SDHS) is an important element of the construction of smart cities in Northern China; it plays a significant role in meeting heating requirements and green energy saving in winter. Various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and wireless transmission technologies are applied to monitor data in real-time and to form a historical database. The accurate prediction of heating loads based on massive historical datasets is the necessary condition and key basis for formulating an optimal heating control strategy in the SDHS, which contributes to the reduction in the consumption of energy and the improvement in the energy dispatching efficiency and accuracy. In order to achieve the high prediction accuracy of SDHS and to improve the representation ability of multi-time-scale features, a novel short-term heating load prediction algorithm based on a feature fusion long short-term memory (LSTM) model (FFLSTM) is proposed. Three characteristics, namely proximity, periodicity, and trend, are found after analyzing the heating load data from the aspect of the hourly time dimension. In order to comprehensively utilize the data&rsquo;s intrinsic characteristics, three LSTM models are employed to make separate predictions, and, then, the prediction results based on internal features and other external features at the corresponding moments are imported into the high-level LSTM model for fusion processing, which brings a more accurate prediction result of the heating load. Detailed comparisons between the proposed FFLSTM algorithm and the-state-of-art algorithms are conducted in this paper. The experimental results show that the proposed FFLSTM algorithm outperforms others and can obtain a higher prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the impact of selecting different parameters of the FFLSTM model is also studied thoroughly.

VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Audio event detection (AED) is a task of recognizing the types of audio events in an audio stream and estimating their temporal positions. AED is typically based on fully supervised approaches, requiring strong labels including both the presence and temporal position of each audio event. However, fully supervised datasets are not easily available due to the heavy cost of human annotation. Recently, weakly supervised approaches for AED have been proposed, utilizing large scale datasets with weak labels including only the occurrence of events in recordings. In this work, we introduce a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model called DSNet based on densely connected convolution networks (DenseNets) and squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) for weakly supervised training of AED. DSNet alleviates the vanishing-gradient problem and strengthens feature propagation and models interdependencies between channels. We also propose a structured prediction method for weakly supervised AED. We apply a recurrent neural network (RNN) based framework and a prediction smoothness cost function to consider long-term contextual information with reduced error propagation. In post-processing, conditional random fields (CRFs) are applied to take into account the dependency between segments and delineate the borders of audio events precisely. We evaluated our proposed models on the DCASE 2017 task 4 dataset and obtained state-of-the-art results on both audio tagging and event detection tasks.

In order to understand the flow of research, we conducted a central analysis, which is widely used in quantitative research relating to social network analysis, and performed cluster analysis to identify relationships with related research. The results of the analysis are represented in the form of network maps, and the role of each keyword was clarified based on these network maps. In addition, the overall flow explained the change of flow through discarded and emerging keywords, and the relationships with related fields were explained through cluster analysis.

AB  - Recently, new mobile applications and services have appeared thanks to the rapid development of mobile devices and mobile network technology. Cloud computing has played an important role over the past decades, providing powerful computing capabilities and high-capacity storage space to efficiently deliver these mobile services to mobile users. Nevertheless, existing cloud computing delegates computing to a cloud server located at a relatively long distance, resulting in significant delays due to additional time to return processing results from a cloud server. These unnecessary delays are inconvenient for mobile users because they are not suitable for applications that require a real-time service environment. To cope with these problems, a new computing concept called Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged. Instead of sending all requests to the central cloud to handle mobile users&rsquo; requests, the MEC brings computing power and storage resources to the edge of the mobile network. It enables the mobile user device to run the real-time applications that are sensitive to latency to meet the strict requirements. However, there is a lack of research on the efficient utilization of computing resources and mobility support when mobile users move in the MEC environment. In this paper, we propose the MEC-based mobility management scheme that arranges MEC server (MECS) as the concept of Zone so that mobile users can continue to receive content and use server resources efficiently even when they move. The results show that the proposed scheme reduce the average service delay compared to the existing MEC scheme. In addition, the proposed scheme outperforms the existing MEC scheme because mobile users can continuously receive services, even when they move frequently.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) using deep neural networks has become a hot topic in human&ndash;computer interaction. Machines can effectively identify human naturalistic activities by learning from a large collection of sensor data. Activity recognition is not only an interesting research problem but also has many real-world practical applications. Based on the success of residual networks in achieving a high level of aesthetic representation of automatic learning, we propose a novel asymmetric residual network, named ARN. ARN is implemented using two identical path frameworks consisting of (1) a short time window, which is used to capture spatial features, and (2) a long time window, which is used to capture fine temporal features. The long time window path can be made very lightweight by reducing its channel capacity, while still being able to learn useful temporal representations for activity recognition. In this paper, we mainly focus on proposing a new model to improve the accuracy of HAR. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ARN model, we carried out extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., OPPORTUNITY, UniMiB-SHAR) and compared the results with some conventional and state-of-the-art learning-based methods. We discuss the influence of networks parameters on performance to provide insights about its optimization. Results from our experiments show that ARN is effective in recognizing human activities via wearable datasets.

AB  - Big data and business analytics are trends that are positively impacting the business world. Past researches show that data generated in the modern world is huge and growing exponentially. These include structured and unstructured data that flood organizations daily. Unstructured data constitute the majority of the world&rsquo;s digital data and these include text files, web, and social media posts, emails, images, audio, movies, etc. The unstructured data cannot be managed in the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS). Therefore, data proliferation requires a rethinking of techniques for capturing, storing, and processing the data. This is the role big data has come to play. This paper, therefore, is aimed at increasing the attention of organizations and researchers to various applications and benefits of big data technology. The paper reviews and discusses, the recent trends, opportunities and pitfalls of big data and how it has enabled organizations to create successful business strategies and remain competitive, based on available literature. Furthermore, the review presents the various applications of big data and business analytics, data sources generated in these applications and their key characteristics. Finally, the review not only outlines the challenges for successful implementation of big data projects but also highlights the current open research directions of big data analytics that require further consideration. The reviewed areas of big data suggest that good management and manipulation of the large data sets using the techniques and tools of big data can deliver actionable insights that create business values.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cooperative communication is an effective method of improving the transmission performance for vehicular ad hoc networks. However, the rapid movement of vehicles leads to frequent changes in network topology and reduces the probability of successful data transmission on the medium access control (MAC) layer. In this paper, we propose an Optimal Cooperative Ad hoc MAC protocol (OCA-MAC) based on time division multiple access (TDMA). OCA-MAC utilizes multiple cooperative nodes to forward data, so as to improve the probability of successful data transmission. It chooses cooperative nodes according to direct successful transmission probability, communication range between potential helper node and destination node, and available time slot. Meanwhile, in order to avoid excessive transmission redundancy caused by multiple cooperative forwarding, the optimal number of cooperative forwarding nodes is obtained through analysis of a probabilistic model. Simulation results show that OCA-MAC improves the successful data transmission rate and reduces the number of transmission times and transmission delay compared to the multichannel TDMA MAC protocol (VeMAC) and the cooperative ad hoc MAC protocol (CAH-MAC).

AB  - Predicting the diffusion rule of toxic gas plays a distinctly important role in emergency capability assessment and rescue work. Among diffusion prediction models, the traditional artificial neural network has exhibited excellent performance not only in prediction accuracy but also in calculation time. Nevertheless, with the continuous development of deep learning and data science, some new prediction models based on deep learning algorithms have been shown to be more advantageous because their structure can better discover internal laws and external connections between input data and output data. The long short-term memory (LSTM) network is a kind of deep learning neural network that has demonstrated outstanding achievements in many prediction fields. This paper applies the LSTM network directly to the prediction of toxic gas diffusion and uses the Project Prairie Grass dataset to conduct experiments. Compared with the Gaussian diffusion model, support vector machine (SVM) model, and back propagation (BP) network model, the LSTM model of deep learning has higher prediction accuracy (especially for the prediction at the point of high concentration values) while avoiding the occurrence of negative concentration values and overfitting problems found in traditional artificial neural network models.

AB  - This paper explores data caching as a key factor of edge computing. State-of-the-art research of data caching on edge nodes mainly considers reactive and proactive caching, and machine learning based caching, which could be a heavy task for edge nodes. However, edge nodes usually have relatively lower computing resources than cloud datacenters as those are geo-distributed from the administrator. Therefore, a caching algorithm should be lightweight for saving computing resources on edge nodes. In addition, the data caching should be agile because it has to support high-quality services on edge nodes. Accordingly, this paper proposes a lightweight, agile caching algorithm, EDCrammer (Efficient Data Crammer), which performs agile operations to control caching rate for streaming data by using the enhanced PID (Proportional-Integral-Differential) controller. Experimental results using this lightweight, agile caching algorithm show its significant value in each scenario. In four common scenarios, the desired cache utilization was reached in 1.1 s on average and then maintained within a 4&ndash;7% deviation. The cache hit ratio is about 96%, and the optimal cache capacity is around 1.5 MB. Thus, EDCrammer can help distribute the streaming data traffic to the edge nodes, mitigate the uplink load on the central cloud, and ultimately provide users with high-quality video services. We also hope that EDCrammer can improve overall service quality in 5G environment, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), Internet of Things (IoT), etc.

AB  - This study sought to propose a big data analysis and prediction model for transmission line tower outliers to assess when something is wrong with transmission line tower big data based on deep reinforcement learning. The model enables choosing automatic cluster K values based on non-labeled sensor big data. It also allows measuring the distance of action between data inside a cluster with the Q-value representing network output in the altered transmission line tower big data clustering algorithm containing transmission line tower outliers and old Deep Q Network. Specifically, this study performed principal component analysis to categorize transmission line tower data and proposed an automatic initial central point approach through standard normal distribution. It also proposed the A-Deep Q-Learning algorithm altered from the deep Q-Learning algorithm to explore policies based on the experiences of clustered data learning. It can be used to perform transmission line tower outlier data learning based on the distance of data within a cluster. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed model recorded an approximately 2.29%~4.19% higher prediction rate and around 0.8% ~ 4.3% higher accuracy rate compared to the old transmission line tower big data analysis model.
