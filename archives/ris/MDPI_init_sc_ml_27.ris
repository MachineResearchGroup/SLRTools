AB  - As citizens are increasingly concerned about the surrounding environment, it is important for modern cities to provide sufficient and accurate environmental information to the public for decision making in the era of smart cities. Due to the limited budget, we often need to optimize the sensor placement in order to maximize the overall information gain according to certain criteria. Existing work is primarily concerned with single-type sensor placement; however, the environment usually requires accurate measurements of multiple types of environmental characteristics. In this paper, we focus on the optimal multi-type sensor placement in Gaussian spatial field for environmental monitoring. We study two representative cases: the one-with-all case when each station is equipped with all types of sensors and the general case when each station is equipped with at least one type of sensor. We propose two greedy algorithms accordingly, each with a provable approximation guarantee. We evaluated the proposed approach via an application in air quality monitoring scenario in Hong Kong and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - Historically, cities follow reactive planning models where managers make decisions as problems occur. On the other hand, the exponential growth of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has allowed the connection of a diverse array of sensors, devices, systems, and objects. These objects can then generate data that can be transformed into information and used in a more efficient urban planning paradigm, one that allows decisions to be made before the occurrence of problems and emergencies. Therefore, this article aims to propose a platform capable of estimating the amount of carbon dioxide based on sensor readings in vehicles, indirectly contributing to a more proactive city planning based on the monitoring of vehicular pollution. Crowdsensing techniques and an On-Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) reader are used to extract data from vehicles in real time, which are then stored locally on the devices used to perform data collection. With the performed experiments, it was possible to extract information about the operation of the vehicles and their dynamics when moving in a city, providing valuable information that can support auxiliary tools for the management of urban centers.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) utilize a sensor network-based system to gather and interpret traffic information. In addition, mobility users utilize mobile applications to collect transport information for safe traveling. However, these types of information are not sufficient to examine all aspects of the transportation networks. Therefore, both ITSs and mobility users need a smart approach and social media data, which can help ITSs examine transport services, support traffic and control management, and help mobility users travel safely. People utilize social networks to share their thoughts and opinions regarding transportation, which are useful for ITSs and travelers. However, user-generated text on social media is short in length, unstructured, and covers a broad range of dynamic topics. The application of recent Machine Learning (ML) approach is inefficient for extracting relevant features from unstructured data, detecting word polarity of features, and classifying the sentiment of features correctly. In addition, ML classifiers consistently miss the semantic feature of the word meaning. A novel fuzzy ontology-based semantic knowledge with Word2vec model is proposed to improve the task of transportation features extraction and text classification using the Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) approach. The proposed fuzzy ontology describes semantic knowledge about entities and features and their relation in the transportation domain. Fuzzy ontology and smart methodology are developed in Web Ontology Language and Java, respectively. By utilizing word embedding with fuzzy ontology as a representation of text, Bi-LSTM shows satisfactory improvement in both the extraction of features and the classification of the unstructured text of social media.

TI  - An Improved Unauthorized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Detection Algorithm Using Radiofrequency-Based Statistical Fingerprint Analysis
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now readily available worldwide and users can easily fly them remotely using smart controllers. This has created the problem of keeping unauthorized UAVs away from private or sensitive areas where they can be a personal or public threat. This paper proposes an improved radio frequency (RF)-based method to detect UAVs. The clutter (interference) is eliminated using a background filtering method. Then singular value decomposition (SVD) and average filtering are used to reduce the noise and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Spectrum accumulation (SA) and statistical fingerprint analysis (SFA) are employed to provide two frequency estimates. These estimates are used to determine if a UAV is present in the detection environment. The data size is reduced using a region of interest (ROI), and this improves the system efficiency and improves azimuth estimation accuracy. Detection results are obtained using real UAV RF signals obtained experimentally which show that the proposed method is more effective than other well-known detection algorithms. The recognition rate with this method is close to 100% within a distance of 2.4 km and greater than 90% within a distance of 3 km. Further, multiple UAVs can be detected accurately using the proposed method.

AB  - The smart management of freshwater for precision irrigation in agriculture is essential for increasing crop yield and decreasing costs, while contributing to environmental sustainability. The intense use of technologies offers a means for providing the exact amount of water needed by plants. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the natural choice for smart water management applications, even though the integration of different technologies required for making it work seamlessly in practice is still not fully accomplished. The SWAMP project develops an IoT-based smart water management platform for precision irrigation in agriculture with a hands-on approach based on four pilots in Brazil and Europe. This paper presents the SWAMP architecture, platform, and system deployments that highlight the replicability of the platform, and, as scalability is a major concern for IoT applications, it includes a performance analysis of FIWARE components used in the Platform. Results show that it is able to provide adequate performance for the SWAMP pilots, but requires specially designed configurations and the re-engineering of some components to provide higher scalability using less computational resources.

TI  - Generalized Parking Occupancy Analysis Based on Dilated Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The importance of vacant parking space detection systems is increasing dramatically as the avoidance of traffic congestion and the time-consuming process of searching an empty parking space is a crucial problem for drivers in urban centers. However, the existing parking space occupancy detection systems are either hardware expensive or not well-generalized for varying images captured from different camera views. As a solution, we take advantage of an affordable visual detection method that is made possible by the fact that camera monitoring is already available in the majority of parking areas. However, the current problem is a challenging vision task because of outdoor lighting variation, perspective distortion, occlusions, different camera viewpoints, and the changes due to the various seasons of the year. To overcome these obstacles, we propose an approach based on Dilated Convolutional Neural Network specifically designed for detecting parking space occupancy in a parking lot, given only an image of a single parking spot as input. To evaluate our method and allow its comparison with previous strategies, we trained and tested it on well-known publicly available datasets, PKLot and CNRPark + EXT. In these datasets, the parking lot images are already labeled, and therefore, we did not need to label them manually. The proposed method shows more reliability than prior works especially when we test it on a completely different subset of images. Considering that in previous studies the performance of the methods was compared with well-known architecture&mdash;AlexNet, which shows a highly promising achievement, we also assessed our model in comparison with AlexNet. Our investigations showed that, in comparison with previous approaches, for the task of classifying given parking spaces as vacant or occupied, the proposed approach is more robust, stable, and well-generalized for unseen images captured from completely different camera viewpoints, which has strong indications that it would generalize effectively to other parking lots.

AB  - Numerous autonomous robots are used not only for factory automation as labor saving devices, but also for interaction and communication with humans in our daily life. Although superior compatibility for semantic recognition of generic objects provides wide applications in a practical use, it is still a challenging task to create an extraction method that includes robustness and stability against environmental changes. This paper proposes a novel method of scene and position recognition based on visual landmarks (VLs) used for an autonomous mobile robot in an environment living with humans. The proposed method provides a mask image of human regions using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG). The VL features are described with accelerated KAZE (AKAZE) after extracting conspicuous regions obtained using saliency maps (SMs). The experimentally obtained results using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) revealed that recognition accuracy of high-saliency feature points was higher than that of low-saliency feature points. We created our original benchmark datasets using a mobile robot. The recognition accuracy evaluated using LOOCV reveals 49.9% for our method, which is 3.2 percentage points higher than the accuracy of the comparison method without HOG detectors. The analysis of false recognition using a confusion matrix examines false recognition occurring in neighboring zones. This trend is reduced according to zone separations.

AB  - In this paper, a monitoring system of agricultural production is modeled as a Data Fusion System (data from local fairs and meteorological data). The proposal considers the particular information of sales in agricultural markets for knowledge extraction about the associations among them. This association knowledge is employed to improve predictions of sales using a spatial prediction technique, as shown with data collected from local markets of the Andean region of Ecuador. The commercial activity in these markets uses Alternative Marketing Circuits (CIALCO). This market platform establishes a direct relationship between producer and consumer prices and promotes direct commercial interaction among family groups. The problem is presented first as a general fusion problem with a network of spatially distributed heterogeneous data sources, and is then applied to the prediction of products sales based on association rules mined in available sales data. First, transactional data is used as the base to extract the best association rules between products sold in different local markets, knowledge that allows the system to gain a significant improvement in prediction accuracy in the spatial region considered.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) utilize Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) to collect, disseminate, and share data with the Traffic Management Center (TMC) and different actuators. Consequently, packet drop and delay in VANETs can significantly impact ITS performance. Feedback-based eco-routing (FB-ECO) is a promising ITS technology, which is expected to reduce vehicle fuel/energy consumption and pollutant emissions by routing drivers through the most environmentally friendly routes. To compute these routes, the FB-ECO utilizes VANET communication to update link costs in real-time, based on the experiences of other vehicles in the system. In this paper, we study the impact of vehicular communication on FB-ECO navigation performance in a large-scale real network with realistic calibrated traffic demand data. We conduct this study at different market penetration rates and different congestion levels. We start by conducting a sensitivity analysis of the market penetration rate on the FB-ECO system performance, and its network-wide impacts considering ideal communication. Subsequently, we study the impact of the communication network on system performance for different market penetration levels, considering the communication system. The results demonstrate that, for market penetration levels less than 30%, the eco-routing system performs adequately in both the ideal and realistic communication scenarios. It also shows that, for realistic communication, increasing the market penetration rate results in a network-wide degradation of the system performance.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Small-to-medium scale smart buildings are an important part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are the major enabler for smart control in such environments. Reliability is among the key performance requirements for many loss-sensitive IoT and WSN applications, while Energy Consumption (EC) remains a primary concern in WSN design. Error-prone links, traffic intense applications, and limited physical resources make it challenging to meet these service goals&mdash;not only that these performance metrics often conflict with one another, but also require solving optimization problems, which are intrinsically NP-hard. Correctly forecasting Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and EC can play a significant role in different loss-sensitive application environments. With the ever-increasing availability of performance data, data-driven techniques are becoming popular in such settings. It is observed that a number of communication parameters like transmission power, packet size, etc., influence metrics like PDR and EC in diverse ways. In this work, different regression models including linear, gradient boosting, random forest, and deep learning are used for the purpose of predicting both PDR and EC based on such communication parameters. To evaluate the performance, a public dataset of the IEEE 802.15.4 network, containing measurements against more than 48,000 combinations of parameter configurations, is used. Results are evaluated using root mean square error and it turns out that deep learning achieves up to 98% accuracy for both PDR and EC predictions. These prediction results can help configure communication parameters taking into account the performance goals.

TI  - Optimized Clustering Algorithms for Large Wireless Sensor Networks: A Review
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - During the past few years, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become widely used due to their large amount of applications. The use of WSNs is an imperative necessity for future revolutionary areas like ecological fields or smart cities in which more than hundreds or thousands of sensor nodes are deployed. In those large scale WSNs, hierarchical approaches improve the performance of the network and increase its lifetime. Hierarchy inside a WSN consists in cutting the whole network into sub-networks called clusters which are led by Cluster Heads. In spite of the advantages of the clustering on large WSNs, it remains a non-deterministic polynomial hard problem which is not solved efficiently by traditional clustering. The recent researches conducted on Machine Learning, Computational Intelligence, and WSNs bring out the optimized clustering algorithms for WSNs. These kinds of clustering are based on environmental behaviors and outperform the traditional clustering algorithms. However, due to the diversity of WSN applications, the choice of an appropriate paradigm for a clustering solution remains a problem. In this paper, we conduct a wide review of proposed optimized clustering solutions nowadays. In order to evaluate them, we consider 10 parameters. Based on these parameters, we propose a comparison of these optimized clustering approaches. From the analysis, we observe that centralized clustering solutions based on the Swarm Intelligence paradigm are more adapted for applications with low energy consumption, high data delivery rate, or high scalability than algorithms based on the other presented paradigms. Moreover, when an application does not need a large amount of nodes within a field, the Fuzzy Logic based solution are suitable.

AB  - Transferring data from a sensor or monitoring device in electronic health, vehicular informatics, or Internet of Things (IoT) networks has had the enduring challenge of improving data accuracy with relative efficiency. Previous works have proposed the use of an inference system at the sensor device to minimize the data transfer frequency as well as the size of data to save network usage and battery resources. This has been implemented using various algorithms in sampling and inference, with a tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. This paper proposes to enhance the accuracy without compromising efficiency by introducing new algorithms in sampling through a hybrid inference method. The experimental results show that accuracy can be significantly improved, whilst the efficiency is not diminished. These algorithms will contribute to saving operation and maintenance costs in data sampling, where resources of computational and battery are constrained and limited, such as in wireless personal area networks emerged with IoT networks.

On top of this, it is also necessary to ensure that users are engaged in the experimentation process, so as to guarantee that the resulting services actually fulfill their needs. In this work, we present the engagement monitoring framework that has been developed within the OrganiCity platform.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Virtualization technologies are key enablers of softwarized 5G networks, and their usage in the vehicular domain can provide flexibility and reliability in real deployments, where mobility and processing needs may be an issue. Next-generation vehicular services, such as the ones in the area of urban mobility and, in general, those interconnecting on-board sensors, require continuous data gathering and processing, but current architectures are stratified in two-tier solutions in which data is collected by on-board units (OBU) and sent to cloud servers. In this line, intermediate cache and processing layers are needed in order to cover quasi-ubiquitous data-gathering needs of vehicles in scenarios of smart cities/roads considering vehicles as moving sensors. The SURROGATES solution presented in this paper proposes to virtualize vehicle OBUs and create a novel Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) layer with the aim of offloading processing from the vehicle and serving data-access requests. This deals with potential disconnection periods of vehicles, saves radio resources when accessing the physical OBU and improves data processing performance. A proof of concept has been implemented using OpenStack and Open Source MANO to virtualize resources and gather data from in-vehicle sensors, and a final traffic monitoring service has been implemented to validate the proposal. Performance results reveal a speedup of more than 50% in the data request resolution, with consequently great savings of network resources in the wireless segment. Thus, this work opens a novel path regarding the virtualization of end-devices in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) ecosystem.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - With the increasing penetration of Internet of Things devices and distributed energy resources in the next-generation distribution network, the efficient energy management for system operation are facing new challenges. One reason is that the large-scale resources cannot be all connected to the supervisory control and data acquisition system, which have limited storage and computation capabilities. In order to adapt to the new energy management requirements of next-generation distribution networks, a state-of-the-art energy management method called cloud-fog hierarchical architecture is proposed in this work. Based on this architecture, we established a utility and revenue model for various stakeholders, including normal customers, prosumers, and distribution system operators. Furthermore, by embedding an artificial intelligence module in the proposed architecture, energy management could be implemented automatically. In this work, neural network are used at fog computing layers to achieve regression prediction of energy usage behavior and power source output. Moreover, based on the maximizing utility objective function, the amount of energy consumption of customers and prosumers in the distribution network was optimized with a genetic algorithm at cloud layer. The proposed methods were tested with a set of normal customers and prosumers in a general distribution network, and the results, including the captured usage patterns of the customers and revenues of various stakeholders, verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. This work provides an effective reference for the development of real-time energy management systems for the next-generation distribution network.

AB  - Indoor localization systems have already wide applications mainly for providing localized information and directions. The majority of them focus on commercial applications providing information such us advertisements, guidance and asset tracking. Medical oriented localization systems are uncommon. Given the fact that an individual&rsquo;s indoor movements can be indicative of his/her clinical status, in this paper we present a low-cost indoor localization system with room-level accuracy used to assess the frailty of older people. We focused on designing a system with easy installation and low cost to be used by non technical staff. The system was installed in older people houses in order to collect data about their indoor localization habits. The collected data were examined in combination with their frailty status, showing a correlation between them. The indoor localization system is based on the processing of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements by a tracking device, from Bluetooth Beacons, using a fingerprint-based procedure. The system has been tested in realistic settings achieving accuracy above 93% in room estimation. The proposed system was used in 271 houses collecting data for 1&ndash;7-day sessions. The evaluation of the collected data using ten-fold cross-validation showed an accuracy of 83% in the classification of a monitored person regarding his/her frailty status (Frail, Pre-frail, Non-frail).

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - An in-depth descriptive approach to the dynamics of the urban population is fundamental as a first step towards promoting effective planning and designing processes in cities. Understanding the behavioral aspects of human activities can contribute to their effective management and control. We present a framework, based on statistical methods, for studying the spatio-temporal distribution of geolocated tweets as a proxy for where and when people carry out their activities. We have evaluated our proposal by analyzing the distribution of collected geolocated tweets over a two-week period in the summer of 2017 in Lisbon, London, and Manhattan. Our proposal considers a negative binomial regression analysis for the time series of counts of tweets as a first step. We further estimate a functional principal component analysis of second-order summary statistics of the hourly spatial point patterns formed by the locations of the tweets. Finally, we find groups of hours with a similar spatial arrangement of places where humans develop their activities through hierarchical clustering over the principal scores. Social media events are found to show strong temporal trends such as seasonal variation due to the hour of the day and the day of the week in addition to autoregressive schemas. We have also identified spatio-temporal patterns of clustering, i.e., groups of hours of the day that present a similar spatial distribution of human activities.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Short-Term Electricity Load Forecasting (STELF) through Data Analytics (DA) is an emerging and active research area. Forecasting about electricity load and price provides future trends and patterns of consumption. There is a loss in generation and use of electricity. So, multiple strategies are used to solve the aforementioned problems. Day-ahead electricity price and load forecasting are beneficial for both suppliers and consumers. In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) and data mining techniques are used for electricity load and price forecasting. XG-Boost (XGB), Decision Tree (DT), Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest (RF) are used for feature selection and feature extraction. Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (ECNN) and Enhanced Support Vector Regression (ESVR) are used as classifiers. Grid Search (GS) is used for tuning of the parameters of classifiers to increase their performance. The risk of over-fitting is mitigated by adding multiple layers in ECNN. Finally, the proposed models are compared with different benchmark schemes for stability analysis. The performance metrics MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The experimental results show that the proposed models outperformed other benchmark schemes. ECNN performed well with threshold 0.08 for load forecasting. While ESVR performed better with threshold value 0.15 for price forecasting. ECNN achieved almost 2% better accuracy than CNN. Furthermore, ESVR achieved almost 1% better accuracy than the existing scheme (SVR).

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In the Internet of Things (IoT)-supported energy data management infrastructure, objects from various energy generation and consumption terminals in buildings produce a tremendous amount of data. However, this data is not useful unless it is available on-time for services that discover meaningful information in order to provide intelligent decisions. The microservices-based data caching, data virtualization, data processing, data analysis, and data ingestion methods can be applied to enhance the data availability for energy efficiency management services provision across buildings. To foster building energy efficiency management services (BEEMS), Web of Objects (WoO) provides data abstraction, aggregation, and ingestion mechanism with virtual objects (VOs) and composite virtual objects (CVOs) by using ontologies and availability and scalability of services with microservices. This article proposes the use of data processing microservices modeling to enhance data availability and expose services capabilities with microservices for BEEMS. We present a semantic web agent based on an ontology for linking, enhancement, reusability, and availability of data-objects, services, and microservices. For the evaluation, we present a use case, which includes heterogeneous data collection and processing and provision of various BEEMS. A prototype for the use case scenario has been built and the results have been evaluated in the laboratory to mimic the enhanced data availability for BEEMS.

SN  - 2227-9709

AB  - Mobile sensors have already proven to be helpful in different aspects of people&rsquo;s everyday lives such as fitness, gaming, navigation, etc. However, illegitimate access to these sensors results in a malicious program running with an exploit path. While the users are benefiting from richer and more personalized apps, the growing number of sensors introduces new security and privacy risks to end users and makes the task of sensor management more complex. In this paper, first, we discuss the issues around the security and privacy of mobile sensors. We investigate the available sensors on mainstream mobile devices and study the permission policies that Android, iOS and mobile web browsers offer for them. Second, we reflect the results of two workshops that we organized on mobile sensor security. In these workshops, the participants were introduced to mobile sensors by working with sensor-enabled apps. We evaluated the risk levels perceived by the participants for these sensors after they understood the functionalities of these sensors. The results showed that knowing sensors by working with sensor-enabled apps would not immediately improve the users&rsquo; security inference of the actual risks of these sensors. However, other factors such as the prior general knowledge about these sensors and their risks had a strong impact on the users&rsquo; perception. We also taught the participants about the ways that they could audit their apps and their permissions. Our findings showed that when mobile users were provided with reasonable choices and intuitive teaching, they could easily self-direct themselves to improve their security and privacy. Finally, we provide recommendations for educators, app developers, and mobile users to contribute toward awareness and education on this topic.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 3
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This contribution proposes an implementation for next generation smart homes, where heterogeneous data, coming from multiple sensors (medical, wellbeing, energy, contextual, etc.) and house equipment (smart fridge, smart TV, etc.), need to be managed, secured and visualized. As a first step, it focuses only on energy and health data. However, it aims to lay the foundations to manage any type of information towards the development of smart interactions with the house, which might include artificial intelligence and machine learning. These data are securely collected using a central Web of Things gateway, located inside the smart home. For the e-health part, a set of possible use-cases is provided, along with the current progress of the implantation. In this regard, the main idea is to link the next generation smart homes with external medical entities in order to provide, first, quick intervention in the event of an abnormality being detected, and to be able to provide basic medical services such as remote consultations with a doctor for a particular health issue. This vision can be very promising, particularly in rural areas, where access to medical services is difficult. As for the energy part, the aim is to collect users&rsquo; energy consumption inside the smart home, which can be supplied from different sources (heat, water, gas, or electricity), and to enable the use of advanced algorithms to predict and manage local energy consumption and production (if any). This approach combines data collected from smart meters, operational information of the smart energy devices (the status of smart plugs), user&rsquo;s requests and external network signals such as energy prices. By using a home energy management system that accepts such input parameters, the operation of in-home devices and appliances can be optimally controlled according to different objectives (e.g., minimizing energy costs and maximizing user&rsquo;s comfort level).

AB  - This paper considers a case where an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is used to monitor an area of interest. The UAV is assisted by a Sensor Network (SN), which is deployed in the area such as a smart city or smart village. The area being monitored has a reasonable size and hence may contain many sensors for efficient and accurate data collection. In this case, it would be expensive for one UAV to visit all the sensors; hence the need to partition the ground network into an optimum number of clusters with the objective of having the UAV visit only cluster heads (fewer sensors). In such a setting, the sensor readings (sensor data) would be sent to cluster heads where they are collected by the UAV upon its arrival. This paper proposes a clustering scheme that optimizes not only the sensor network energy usage, but also the energy used by the UAV to cover the area of interest. The computation of the number of optimal clusters in a dense and uniformly-distributed sensor network is proposed to complement the k-means clustering algorithm when used as a network engineering technique in hybrid UAV/terrestrial networks. Furthermore, for general networks, an efficient clustering model that caters for both orphan nodes and multi-layer optimization is proposed and analyzed through simulations using the city of Cape Town in South Africa as a smart city hybrid network engineering use-case.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - One of the main obstacles towards the promotion of IoT adoption and innovation is data interoperability. Facilitating cross-domain interoperability is expected to be the core element for the realisation of the next generation of the IoT computing paradigm that is already taking shape under the name of Internet of Everything (IoE). In this article, an analysis of the current status on IoT semantic interoperability is presented that leads to the identification of a set of generic requirements that act as fundamental design principles for the specification of interoperability enabling solutions. In addition, an extension of NGSIv2 data model and API (de-facto) standards is proposed aiming to bridge the gap among IoT and social media and hence to integrate user communities with cyber-physical systems. These specifications have been utilised for the implementation of the IoT2Edge interoperability enabling mechanism which is evaluated within the context of a catastrophic wildfire incident that took place in Greece on July 2018. Weather data, social media activity, video recordings from the fire, sensor measurements and satellite data, linked to the location and the time of this fire incident have been collected, modeled in a uniform manner and fed to an early fire detection decision support system. The findings of the experiment certify that achieving minimum data interoperability with light-weight, plug-n-play mechanisms can be realised with significant benefits for our society.

VL  - 8

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - The Mamdani fuzzy inference method is one of the most important fuzzy logic control (FLC) techniques and has several applications in different fields. Despite its applications, the Mamdani fuzzy inference method has some core issues which still require solutions. The most critical issue is the selection of accurate shape and boundaries of membership functions (MFs) in the universe of discourse. In this work, we introduced a methodology called learning to control (LtC) to resolve the problem. The proposed methodology consisted of two main modules, namely, a control algorithm (CA) module and a learning algorithm (LA) module. In the CA module, the Mamdani FLC method has been used, whereas, in the LA module, we have used the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. Inputs into the ANN were the error difference between environmental temperature and the required temperature. The output of the ANN was the MF set to the FLC. Inputs into the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) were the error difference between environmental temperature and required temperature (D), and the output was the required power for the fan actuator. The purpose of the ANN was to tune the MFs of the FLC to improve its efficiency. The proposed learning-to-control method along with the conventional fuzzy logic controller method was applied to the data to evaluate the model&rsquo;s performance. The results indicate that the proposed model&rsquo;s performance is far better than that of conventional fuzzy logic techniques.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - One of the fundamental tasks of electric distribution utilities is guaranteeing a continuous supply of electricity to their customers. The primary distribution network is a critical part of these facilities because a fault in it could affect thousands of customers. However, the complexity of this network has been increased with the irruption of distributed generation, typical in a Smart Grid and which has significantly complicated some of the analyses, making it impossible to apply traditional techniques. This problem is intensified in underground lines where access is limited. As a possible solution, this paper proposes to make a deployment of a distributed sensor network along the power lines. This network proposes taking advantage of its distributed character to support new approaches of these analyses. In this sense, this paper describes the aquiculture of the proposed network (adapted to the power grid) based on nodes that use power line communication and energy harvesting techniques. In this sense, it also describes the implementation of a real prototype that has been used in some experiments to validate this technological adaptation. Additionally, beyond a simple use for monitoring, this paper also proposes the use of this approach to solve two typical distribution system operator problems, such as: fault location and failure forecasting in power cables.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Intelligent farming is one of the vast range of applications covered by the Internet of Things concept. Notwithstanding, such applications present specific requirements and constraints that are dependent on their purpose. A practical case on which that is particularly relevant is the SheepIT project, where an automated IoT-based system controls grazing sheep within vineyards, guaranteeing that they do not threaten cultures. Due to its rigid requirements, particularly regarding the deployment of the Wireless Sensor Network, Machine-2-Machine communications and necessary interactions with a computational platform available through the Internet, Internet Protocol-based solutions are not suitable. Consequently, a customized communication stack has been developed, that intends to meet the project requirements, from the physical to the Application Layers. Although it has been developed considering the SheepIT requirements, its use may be extended to more generic intelligent farming applications, since most of the requirements are directly related with the farming environment. This paper reviews the proposed stack and details the recent developments. Particularly, we focused on Internet of Things/Machine-2-Machine interaction, describing the design and deployment of a gateway that addresses the SheepIT service requirements. Additionally, and complementary to previously published results, we evaluate the gateway performance and show its feasibility and scalability in a real scenario.

AB  - The development of crowdsensing-based technologies has allowed for the use of smartphones in large-scale data collection for different scopes of applications, mostly in a transparent and ubiquitous way. When concerning urban areas and smart city initiatives, the collection and further analysis of information about the highest number of vehicles is of paramount importance, potentially supporting more efficient mobility planning and management actions in modern cities. In this context, this article proposes a public general-purpose platform for acquisition and visualization of vehicular speeds, which can then be exploited by any additional application. For that, a crowdsensing-based mobile software application was developed to collect instantaneous speeds provided by smartphone GPS, formatting and distributing this information to a database system. Such historical data can then be exported or visualized through a web-based comprehensive interface, which provides valuable data when planning traffic mobility in cities; for example, indicating areas with heavier traffic over a certain time period. Therefore, allowing the use of many different search filters and supporting data delivery in the JSON format, the CitySpeed platform can provide services not supported by popular applications, such as Waze and Google Maps, and potentially assist smart city initiatives in this area.

AB  - Dramatic changes in the way we collect and process data has facilitated the emergence of a new era by providing customised services and products precisely based on the needs of clients according to processed big data. It is estimated that the number of connected devices to the internet will pass 35 billion by 2020. Further, there has also been a massive escalation in the amount of data collection tools as Internet of Things devices generate data which has big data characteristics known as five V (volume, velocity, variety, variability and value). This article reviews challenges, opportunities and research trends to address the issues related to the data era in three industries including smart cities, healthcare and transportation. All three of these industries could greatly benefit from machine learning and deep learning techniques on big data collected by the Internet of Things, which is named as the internet of everything to emphasise the role of connected devices for data collection. In the smart grid portion of this paper, the recently developed deep reinforcement learning techniques and their applications in Smart Cities are also presented and reviewed.

TI  - Time-Aware Monitoring of Overhead Transmission Line Sag and Temperature with LoRa Communication
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The techniques of Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) for Overhead Transmission Line (OTL)&rsquo;s are currently dynamically developed. DLR systems typically rely on weather, temperature, inclination, and current measurements to calculate tension and sag, where sensors need to be installed directly on wires. Such systems are very reliable and ensure high accuracy in determining maximum allowable current. However, their installation may require switching off the transmission line from the operation. In order to receive precise values regarding the actual operating conditions of the whole transmission line, DLR sensors measuring wire temperature or tension should be installed at many points of OTL. The minimum number of installation points should cover at least each tension section and critical spans, thereby increasing installation costs. The alternative method that allows for the monitoring of OTL is the use of the vision system based on cameras. Installed on the OTLs&rsquo; poles, cameras can take photos which, appropriately processed, can provide data about the sag and temperature of wires, without the necessity of switching OTL from the operation for installation or further maintenance. Such a vision system facilitates also data transmission, because it does not require measurement data to be transmitted from the sensor station installed on the wire to the base station located on the pole (for instance, via radio). This article aims to present the concept of a vision system that monitors sag and temperature of Overhead Transmission Lines (OTLs)&rsquo; using Long Range (LoRa) wireless communication and data transmission. The developed system consists of a camera and a microcomputer equipped with LoRa communication module. The whole system monitors OTLs&rsquo; spans by taking photos, processing images for wire sag-temperature estimation, and sending results to the operator&rsquo;s Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA). The system communication architecture is also proposed and investigated for data transmission time when monitoring the whole OTL.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 3
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are becoming a common tool for aerial sensing applications. Nevertheless, sensed data need further processing before becoming useful information. This processing requires large computing power and time before delivery. In this paper, we present a parallel architecture that includes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a small embedded computer on board, a communication link to the Internet, and a cloud service with the aim to provide useful real-time information directly to the end-users. The potential of parallelism as a solution in remote sensing has not been addressed for a distributed architecture that includes the UAV processors. The architecture is demonstrated for a specific problem: the counting of olive trees in a crop field where the trees are regularly spaced from each other. During the flight, the embedded computer is able to process individual images on board the UAV and provide the total count. The tree counting algorithm obtains an     F 1     score of     99.09 %     for a sequence of ten images with 332 olive trees. The detected trees are geolocated and can be visualized on the Internet seconds after the take-off of the flight, with no further processing required. This is a use case to demonstrate near real-time results obtained from UAS usage. Other more complex UAS applications, such as tree inventories, search and rescue, fire detection, or stock breeding, can potentially benefit from this architecture and obtain faster outcomes, accessible while the UAV is still on flight.

AB  - The automation of the Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) task aims for high levels of understanding of various scenery. In addition, working in unfriendly and complex environments may cause a time delay in the operation and consequently put human lives at stake. In order to address this problem, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which provide potential support to the conventional methods, are used. These vehicles are provided with reliable human detection and tracking algorithms; in order to be able to find and track the bodies of the victims in complex environments, and a robust control system to maintain safe distances from the detected bodies. In this paper, a human detection based on the color and depth data captured from onboard sensors is proposed. Moreover, the proposal of computing data association from the skeleton pose and a visual appearance measurement allows the tracking of multiple people with invariance to the scale, translation and rotation of the point of view with respect to the target objects. The system has been validated with real and simulation experiments, and the obtained results show the ability to track multiple individuals even after long-term disappearances. Furthermore, the simulations present the robustness of the implemented reactive control system as a promising tool for assisting the pilot to perform approaching maneuvers in a safe and smooth manner.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SN  - 2504-2289

AB  - In this study, we attempt to assess the value of the term Big Data when used by researchers in their publications. For this purpose, we systematically collected a corpus of biomedical publications that use and do not use the term Big Data. These documents were used as input to a machine learning classifier to determine how well they can be separated into two groups and to determine the most distinguishing classification features. We generated 100 classifiers that could correctly distinguish between Big Data and non-Big Data documents with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.96. The differences between the two groups were characterized by terms specific to Big Data themes&mdash;such as &lsquo;computational&rsquo;, &lsquo;mining&rsquo;, and &lsquo;challenges&rsquo;&mdash;and also by terms that indicate the research field, such as &lsquo;genomics&rsquo;. The ROC curves when plotted for various time intervals showed no difference over time. We conclude that there is a detectable and stable difference between publications that use the term Big Data and those that do not. Furthermore, the use of the term Big Data within a publication seems to indicate a distinct type of research in the biomedical field. Therefore, we conclude that value can be attributed to the term Big Data when used in a publication and this value has not changed over time.

AB  - This paper explores the emerging and evolving landscape for metrics in smart cities in relation to big data challenges. Based on a review of the research literature, the problem of &ldquo;synthetic quantitative indicators&rdquo; along with concerns for &ldquo;measuring urban realities&rdquo; and &ldquo;making metrics meaningful&rdquo; are identified. In response, the purpose of this paper is to advance the need for innovating metrics for smarter, more interactive and responsive cities in addressing and mitigating algorithmic-related challenges on the one hand, and concerns associated with involving people more meaningfully on the other hand. As such, the constructs of awareness, learning, openness, and engagement are employed in this study. Using an exploratory case study approach, the research design for this work includes the use of multiple methods of data collection including survey and interviews. Employing a combination of content analysis for qualitative data and descriptive statistics for quantitative data, the main findings of this work support the need for rethinking and innovating metrics. As such, the main conclusion of this paper highlights the potential for developing new pathways and spaces for involving people more directly, knowingly, and meaningfully in addressing big and small data challenges for the innovating of urban metrics.

It also acts as a platform to maintain and optimise the acceptable diagnostic quality through a device-aware adaptive video streaming mechanism. The proposed model is trained for an unseen dataset of input variables such as QoS, content features and display device characteristics, to produce an output value in the form of m-QoE (i.e. MOS). The efficiency of the proposed model is validated through subjective tests carried by medical experts. The prediction accuracy obtained via the correlation coefficient and Root Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) indicates that the proposed model succeeds in measuring m-QoE closer to the visual perception of the medical experts. Furthermore, we have addressed two main research questions: (1) How significant is ultrasound video content type in determining m-QoE? (2) How much of a role does the screen size and device resolution play in medical experts&rsquo; diagnostic experience? The former is answered through the content classification of ultrasound video sequences based on their spatiotemporal features, by including these features in the proposed prediction model, and validating their significance through medical experts&rsquo; subjective ratings. The latter is answered by conducting a novel subjective experiment of the ultrasound video sequences across multiple devices.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Low-cost air pollution wireless sensors are emerging in densely distributed networks that provide more spatial resolution than typical traditional systems for monitoring ambient air quality. This paper presents an air quality measurement system that is composed of a distributed sensor network connected to a cloud system forming a wireless sensor network (WSN). Sensor nodes are based on low-power ZigBee motes, and transmit field measurement data to the cloud through a gateway. An optimized cloud computing system has been implemented to store, monitor, process, and visualize the data received from the sensor network. Data processing and analysis is performed in the cloud by applying artificial intelligence techniques to optimize the detection of compounds and contaminants. This proposed system is a low-cost, low-size, and low-power consumption method that can greatly enhance the efficiency of air quality measurements, since a great number of nodes could be deployed and provide relevant information for air quality distribution in different areas. Finally, a laboratory case study demonstrates the applicability of the proposed system for the detection of some common volatile organic compounds, including: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. Principal component analysis, a multilayer perceptron with backpropagation learning algorithm, and support vector machine have been applied for data processing. The results obtained suggest good performance in discriminating and quantifying the concentration of the volatile organic compounds.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - To accommodate the rapidly increasing demand for connected infrastructure, automation for industrial sites and building smart cities, the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-based solutions is considered one of the major trends in modern day industrial revolution. In particular, providing high precision indoor positioning services for such applications is a key challenge. Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning systems have been adapted as promising candidates for such applications. The performance of such indoor positioning systems degrade drastically due to several impairments like noisy datasets, high variation in Wi-Fi signals over time, fading of Wi-Fi signals due to multipath propagation caused by hurdles, people walking in the area under consideration and the addition/removal of Wi-Fi access points (APs). In this paper, we propose data pre- and post-processing algorithms with deep learning classifiers for Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning, in order to provide immunity against limitations in the database and the indoor environment. In addition, we investigate the performance of the proposed system through simulation as well as extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that the pre-processing algorithm can efficiently fill in the missing Wi-Fi received signal strength fingerprints in the database, resulting in a success rate of 88.96% in simulation and 86.61% in a real-time experiment. The post-processing algorithm can improve the results from 9.05&ndash;10.94% for the conducted experiments, providing the highest success rate of 95.94% with a precision of 4 m for Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor positioning.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are responsible for the automation of different processes and the overall control of systems that include highly sensitive potential targets such as nuclear facilities, energy-distribution, water-supply, and mass-transit systems. Given the increased complexity and rapid evolvement of their threat landscape, and the fact that these systems form part of the Critical National infrastructure (CNI), makes them an emerging domain of conflict, terrorist attacks, and a playground for cyberexploitation. Existing layered-defence approaches are increasingly criticised for their inability to adequately protect against resourceful and persistent adversaries. It is therefore essential that emerging techniques, such as orthogonality, be combined with existing security strategies to leverage defence advantages against adaptive and often asymmetrical attack vectors. The concept of orthogonality is relatively new and unexplored in an ICS environment and consists of having assurance control as well as functional control at each layer. Our work seeks to partially articulate a framework where multiple functional and assurance controls are introduced at each layer of ICS architectural design to further enhance security while maintaining critical real-time transfer of command and control traffic.

T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11
IS  - 4
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - This paper focuses on analytics of an extremely large dataset of smart grid electricity price and load, which is difficult to process with conventional computational models. These data are known as energy big data. The analysis of big data divulges the deeper insights that help experts in the improvement of smart grid&rsquo;s (SG) operations. Processing and extracting of meaningful information from data is a challenging task. Electricity load and price are the most influential factors in the electricity market. For improving reliability, control and management of electricity market operations, an exact estimate of the day ahead load is a substantial requirement. Energy market trade is based on price. Accurate price forecast enables energy market participants to make effective and most profitable bidding strategies. This paper proposes a deep learning-based model for the forecast of price and demand for big data using Deep Long Short-Term Memory (DLSTM). Due to the adaptive and automatic feature learning mechanism of Deep Neural Network (DNN), the processing of big data is easier with LSTM as compared to the purely data-driven methods. The proposed model was evaluated using well-known real electricity markets&rsquo; data. In this study, day and week ahead forecasting experiments were conducted for all months. Forecast performance was assessed using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). The proposed Deep LSTM (DLSTM) method was compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) time series forecasting methods, i.e., Nonlinear Autoregressive network with Exogenous variables (NARX) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). DLSTM outperformed the compared forecasting methods in terms of accuracy. Experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method for electricity price and load forecasting.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 4
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In this work, we investigate the capacity allocation problem in the energy harvesting wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with interference channels. For the fixed topologies of data and energy, we formulate the optimization problem when the data flow remains constant on all data links and each sensor node harvests energy only once in a time slot. We focus on the optimal data rates, power allocations and energy transfers between sensor nodes in a time slot. Our goal is to minimize the total delay in the network under two scenarios, i.e., no energy transfer and energy transfer. Furthermore, since the optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve directly, by considering the network with the relatively high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), the non-convex optimization problem can be transformed into a convex optimization problem by convex approximation. We attain the properties of the optimal solution by Lagrange duality and solve the convex optimization problem by the CVX solver. The experimental results demonstrate that the total delay of the energy harvesting WSNs with interference channels is more than that in the orthogonal channel; the total network delay increases with the increasing data flow for the fixed energy arrival rate; and the energy transfer can help to decrease the total delay.

AB  - Lampposts, traffic lights, traffic signs, utility poles and so forth are important road furniture in urban areas. The fast and accurate localization and extraction of this type of furniture is urgent for the construction and updating of infrastructure databases in cities. This paper proposes a pipeline for mobile laser scanning data processing to locate and extract road poles. The proposed method is based on the vertical continuity with isolation feature of the pole part and the overall roughness feature of the attachment part of road poles. The isolation feature of the pole part is analysed by constructing two concentric cylinders from bottom to top and there should be no or a limited number of, points between these two cylinders. After splitting up the pole part and the attachment part of a road pole, the roughness of the candidate attachment points is computed and the attachment is obtained by performing region growing method based on roughness values. By applying the proposed pipeline to different situations in two datasets, the proposed method proves to be efficient not only in simple scenes but also in cluttered scenes.

AB  - Designing Internet of Things (IoT) applications faces many challenges including security, massive traffic, high availability, high reliability and energy constraints. Recent distributed computing paradigms, such as Fog and multi-access edge computing (MEC), software-defined networking (SDN), network virtualization and blockchain can be exploited in IoT networks, either combined or individually, to overcome the aforementioned challenges while maintaining system performance. In this paper, we present a framework for IoT that employs an edge computing layer of Fog nodes controlled and managed by an SDN network to achieve high reliability and availability for latency-sensitive IoT applications. The SDN network is equipped with distributed controllers and distributed resource constrained OpenFlow switches. Blockchain is used to ensure decentralization in a trustful manner. Additionally, a data offloading algorithm is developed to allocate various processing and computing tasks to the OpenFlow switches based on their current workload. Moreover, a traffic model is proposed to model and analyze the traffic indifferent parts of the network. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in simulation and in a testbed. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves higher efficiency in terms of latency and resource utilization.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The traditional Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has evolved towards intelligent IoT applications which exploit knowledge produced by IoT devices using artificial intelligence techniques. Knowledge sharing between IoT devices is a challenging issue in this trend. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge of Things (KoT) framework which enables sharing self-taught knowledge between IoT devices which require similar or identical knowledge without help from the cloud. The proposed KoT framework allows an IoT device to effectively produce, cumulate, and share its self-taught knowledge with other devices at the edge in the vicinity. This framework can alleviate behavioral repetition in users and computational redundancy in systems in intelligent IoT applications. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we examine a smart home case study and build a prototype of the KoT framework-based smart home system. Experimental results show that the proposed KoT framework reduces the response time to use intelligent IoT devices from a user&rsquo;s perspective and the power consumption for compuation from a system&rsquo;s perspective.

T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This work proposes a persuasion model based on argumentation theory and users&rsquo; characteristics for improving the use of resources in bike sharing systems, fostering the use of the bicycles and thus contributing to greater energy sustainability by reducing the use of carbon-based fuels. More specifically, it aims to achieve a balanced network of pick-up and drop-off stations in urban areas with the help of the users, thus reducing the dedicated management trucks that redistribute bikes among stations. The proposal aims to persuade users to choose different routes from the shortest route between a start and an end location. This persuasion is carried out when it is not possible to park the bike in the desired station due to the lack of parking slots, or when the user is highly influenceable. Differently to other works, instead of employing a single criteria to recommend alternative stations, the proposed system can incorporate a variety of criteria. This result is achieved by providing a defeasible logic-based persuasion engine that is capable of aggregating the results from multiple recommendation rules. The proposed framework is showcased with an example scenario of a bike sharing system.

However, computational methods are necessary to assist in the process of creating smart cities because they are fundamental to the decision-making process, assist in policy making, and offer improved services to citizens. As such, the aim of this research is to present a systematic review regarding data mining (DM) and machine learning (ML) approaches adopted in the promotion of smart cities. The Methodi Ordinatio was used to find relevant articles and the VOSviewer software was performed for a network analysis. Thirty-nine significant articles were identified for analysis from the Web of Science and Scopus databases, in which we analyzed the DM and ML techniques used, as well as the areas that are most engaged in promoting smart cities. Predictive analytics was the most common technique and the studies focused primarily on the areas of smart mobility and smart environment. This study seeks to encourage approaches that can be used by governmental agencies and companies to develop smart cities, being essential to assist in the Sustainable Development Goals.

The collected data are prone to be inaccurate and faulty due to internal or external influences, such as, environmental interference or sensor aging. Intelligent failure detection is necessary for the effective functioning of the sensor network. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning method that is named artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHN), to predict temperature in a remote location and detect failures in sensors. It allows predicting the temperature and detecting failure in sensor node of remote locations using information from a web service comparing it with field temperature sensors. For experimentation, we implemented a small WSN to test our sensor in order to measure failure detection, identification and accommodation proposal. In our experiments, 94.18% of the testing data were recovered and accommodated allowing of validation our proposed approach that is based on AHN, which detects, identify and accommodate sensor failures accurately.

AB  - Many researchers and product developers are striving toward achieving ICT-enabled independence of older adults by setting up Enhanced Living Environments (ELEs). Technological solutions, which are often based on the Internet of Things (IoT), show great potential in providing support for Active Aging. To enhance the quality of life for older adults and overcome challenges in enabling individuals to achieve their full potential in terms of physical, social, and mental well-being, numerous proof-of-concept systems have been built. These systems, often labeled as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), vary greatly in targeting different user needs. This paper presents our contribution using SmartHabits, which is an intelligent privacy-aware home care assistance system. The novel system comprising smart home-based and cloud-based parts uses machine-learning technology to provide peace of mind to informal caregivers caring for persons living alone. It does so by learning the user&rsquo;s typical daily activity patterns and automatically issuing warnings if an unusual situation is detected. The system was designed and implemented from scratch, building upon existing practices from IoT reference architecture and microservices. The system was deployed in several homes of real users for six months, and we will be sharing our findings in this paper.

Conventional computing infrastructures are struggling to satisfy dramatic growth in demand from a deluge of connected heterogeneous end points located at the edge of networks while, at the same time, meeting quality of service levels. The complexity of computing at the edge makes it increasingly difficult for infrastructure providers to plan for and provision resources to meet this demand. While simulation frameworks are used extensively in the modelling of cloud computing environments in order to test and validate technical solutions, they are at a nascent stage of development and adoption for fog and edge computing.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - On-demand shared mobility is increasingly being promoted as an influential strategy to address urban transport challenges in large and fast-growing cities. The appeal of this form of transport is largely attributed to its convenience, ease of use, and affordability made possible through digital platforms and innovations. The convergence of the shared economy with a number of established and emerging technologies‚Äîsuch as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and Cloud and Fog computing‚Äîis helping to expedite their deployment as a new form of public transport. Recently, this has manifested itself in the form of Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMoD) solutions, aimed at meeting personal travel demands through flexible routing and scheduling. Increasingly, these shared mobility solutions are blurring the boundaries with existing forms of public transport, particularly bus operations. This paper presents an environmental scan and analysis of the technological, social, and economic impacts surrounding disruptive technology-driven shared mobility trends. Specifically, the paper includes an examination of current and anticipated external factors that are of direct relevance to collaborative and low carbon mobility. The paper also outlines how these trends are likely to influence the mobility industries now and into the future. The paper collates information from a wide body of literature and reports on findings from actual ‚Äòuse cases‚Äô that exist today which have used these disruptive mobility solutions to deliver substantial benefits to travellers around the world. Finally, the paper provides stakeholders with insight into identifying and responding to the likely needs and impacts of FMoD and informs their policy and strategy positions on the implementation of smart mobility systems in their cities and jurisdictions.

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Human injuries and casualties at entertaining, religious, or political crowd events often occur due to the lack of proper crowd safety management. For instance, for a large scale moving crowd, a minor accident can create a panic for the people to start stampede. Although many smart video surveillance tools, inspired by the recent advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology and machine learning (ML) algorithms, enable object detection and identification, it is still challenging to predict the crowd mobility in real-time for preventing potential disasters. In this paper, we propose an intelligent crowd engineering platform using mobility characterization and analytics named ICE-MoCha. ICE-MoCha is to assist safety management for mobile crowd events by predicting and thus helping to prevent potential disasters through real-time radio frequency (RF) data characterization and analysis. The existing video surveillance based approaches lack scalability thus have limitations in its capability for wide open areas of crowd events. Via effectively integrating RF signal analysis, our approach can enhance safety management for mobile crowd. We particularly tackle the problems of identification, speed, and direction detection for the mobile group, among various crowd mobility characteristics. We then apply those group semantics to track the crowd status and predict any potential accidents and disasters. Taking the advantages of power-efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and ubiquitous availability, we specifically use and analyze a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) signal. We have conducted experiments of ICE-MoCha in a real crowd event as well as controlled indoor and outdoor lab environments. The results show the feasibility of ICE-MoCha detecting the mobile crowd characteristics in real-time, indicating it can effectively help the crowd management tasks to avoid potential crowd movement related incidents.

VL  - 12

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In view of the existing verification methods of electric meters, there are problems such as high maintenance cost, poor accuracy, and difficulty in full coverage, etc. Starting from the perspective of analyzing the large-scale measured data collected by user-side electric meters, an online estimation method for the operating error of electric meters was proposed, which uses the recursive least squares (RLS) and introduces a double-parameter method with dynamic forgetting factors &lambda;a and &lambda;b to track the meter parameters changes in real time. Firstly, the obtained measured data are preprocessed, and the abnormal data such as null data and light load data are eliminated by an appropriate clustering method, so as to screen out the measured data of the similar operational states of each user. Then equations relating the head electric meter in the substation and each users&rsquo; electric meter and line loss based on the law of conservation of electric energy are established. Afterwards, the recursive least squares algorithm with double-parameter is used to estimate the parameters of line loss and the electric meter error. Finally, the effects of double dynamic forgetting factors, double constant forgetting factors and single forgetting factor on the accuracy of estimated error of electric meter are discussed. Through the program-controlled load simulation system, the proposed method is verified with higher accuracy and practicality.

AB  - Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) has been a popular research area in the last decade. The dependability of CPS is still a critical issue, and few surveys have been published in this domain. CPS is a dynamic complex system, which involves various multidisciplinary technologies. To avoid human errors and to simplify management, self-management CPS (SCPS) is a wise choice. To achieve dependable self-management, systematic solutions are necessary to verify the design and to guarantee the safety of self-adaptation decisions, as well as to maintain the health of SCPS. This survey first recalls the concepts of dependability, and proposes a generic environment-in-loop processing flow of self-management CPS, and then analyzes the error sources and challenges of self-management through the formal feedback flow. Focusing on reducing the complexity, we first survey the self-adaptive architecture approaches and applied dependability means, then we introduce a hybrid multi-role self-adaptive architecture, and discuss the supporting technologies for dependable self-management at the architecture level. Focus on dependable environment-centered adaptation, we investigate the verification and validation (V&amp;V) methods for making safe self-adaptation decision and the solutions for processing decision dependably. For system-centered adaptation, the comprehensive self-healing methods are summarized. Finally, we analyze the missing pieces of the technology puzzle and the future directions. In this survey, the technical trends for dependable CPS design and maintenance are discussed, an all-in-one solution is proposed to integrate these technologies and build a dependable organic SCPS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on dependable SCPS building and evaluation.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - With the rapid development of sharing bicycles, unreasonable dispatching methods are likely to cause a series of issues, such as resource waste and traffic congestion in the city. In this paper, a new dynamic scheduling method is proposed, named Tri-G, so as to solve the above problems. First of all, the whole visualization information of bike stations was built based on a Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG), then Gaussian Mixture Mode (GMM) was used to group individual stations into clusters according to their geographical locations and transition patterns, and the Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) algorithm was adopted to predict the number of bikes inflow/outflow at each station in real time. This paper used New York&rsquo;s bicycle commute data to build global STG visualization information to evaluate Tri-G. Finally, it is concluded that Tri-G is superior to the methods in control groups, which can be applied to various geographical scenarios. In addition, this paper also discovered some human mobility patterns as well as some rules, which are helpful for governments to improve urban planning.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - As the global environment is getting more competitive, sustainability is increasingly becoming an important assessment tool. An exponential distribution stochastic model is developed for the purpose of assessing and measuring the sustainability of healthcare system. The aim of this study is to provide a sustainability measuring model that is driven by the actual distribution status of the sustainability indicators. In this paper, the notions of the &ldquo;Triple Bottom Line&rdquo; (TBL) are followed in deriving the sustainability challenge and capacity indicators for the environmental, social, and economic indicators. Since basic challenges and capacities depend on the modes of the organization, the study proposes an exponentially distributed stochastic model for measuring sustainability. A numerical illustration of Iranian healthcare is presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model. In the results obtained, sustainability index for environmental, economic, and social are 54.40%, 48.80%, and 66.80% respectively. It indicates the healthcare achieved some sustainability through the social aspect; therefore, improving the environmental and economic aspect of the TBL is necessary. The proposed model can be used as a panoramic tool for effective measurement of the sustainability level of any healthcare system.

TI  - Thinger.io: An Open Source Platform for Deploying Data Fusion Applications in IoT Environments
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In the last two decades, data and information fusion has experienced significant development due mainly to advances in sensor technology. The sensors provide a continuous flow of data about the environment in which they are deployed, which is received and processed to build a dynamic estimation of the situation. With current technology, it is relatively simple to deploy a set of sensors in a specific geographic area, in order to have highly sensorized spaces. However, to be able to fusion and process the information coming from the data sources of a highly sensorized space, it is necessary to solve certain problems inherent to this type of technology. The challenge is analogous to what we can find in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT technology is characterized by providing the infrastructure capacity to capture, store, and process a huge amount of heterogeneous sensor data (in most cases, from different manufacturers), in the same way that it occurs in data fusion applications. This work is not simple, mainly due to the fact that there is no standardization of the technologies involved (especially within the communication protocols used by the connectable sensors). The solutions that we can find today are proprietary solutions that imply an important dependence and a high cost. The aim of this paper is to present a new open source platform with capabilities for the collection, management and analysis of a huge amount of heterogeneous sensor data. In addition, this platform allows the use of hardware-agnostic in a highly scalable and cost-effective manner. This platform is called Thinger.io. One of the main characteristics of Thinger.io is the ability to model sensorized environments through a high level language that allows a simple and easy implementation of data fusion applications, as we will show in this paper.

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Deriving 3D urban development patterns is necessary for urban planners to control the future directions of 3D urban growth considering the availability of infrastructure or being prepared for fundamental infrastructure. Urban metrics have been used so far for quantification of landscape and land-use change. However, these studies focus on the horizontal development of urban form. Therefore, questions remain about 3D growth patterns. Both 3D data and appropriate 3D metrics are fundamentally required for vertical development pattern extraction. Airborne light detection and ranging (Lidar) as an advanced remote-sensing technology provides 3D data required for such studies. Processing of airborne lidar to extract buildings&rsquo; heights above a footprint is a major task and current automatic algorithms fail to extract such information on vast urban areas especially in hilly sites. This research focuses on proposing new methods of extraction of ground points in hilly urban areas using autocorrelation-based algorithms. The ground points then would be used for digital elevation model generation and elimination of ground elevation from classified buildings points elevation. Technical novelties in our experimentation lie in choosing a different window direction and also contour lines for the slant area, and applying moving windows and iterating non-ground extraction. The results are validated through calculation of skewness and kurtosis values. The results show that changing the shape of windows and their direction to be narrow long squares parallel to the ground contour lines, respectively, improves the results of classification in slant areas. Four parameters, namely window size, window shape, window direction and cell size are empirically chosen in order to improve initial digital elevation model (DEM) creation, enhancement of the initial DEM, classification of non-ground points and final creation of a normalised digital surface model (NDSM). The results of these enhanced algorithms are robust for generating reliable DEMs and separation of ground and non-ground points in slant urban scenes as evidenced by the results of skewness and kurtosis. Offering the possibility of monitoring urban growth over time with higher accuracy and more reliable information, this work could contribute in drawing the future directions of 3D urban growth for a smarter urban growth in the Smart Cities paradigm.

AB  - This paper presents IoH (Intelligence of Home), a platform developed to test some basic intelligent behaviors in Home context. Internet of Things, ambient intelligence and context awareness approaches motivated the development of IoH. The platform involves six layers, responsible by connectivity, persistency, unification, Internet of Things integration, subsystems integration and user interface.

Different intelligent methods and technologies are used, form the use of a diversity of sensors, actuators, and controllers and processing units to a set of artificial intelligence approaches varying from machine learning and optimization algorithms to the use of sensor fusion and computer vision. The use of IoH day-by-day demonstrated an intelligent performance for the real building occupants.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - As an emerging and promising computing paradigm in the Internet of things (IoT), edge computing can significantly reduce energy consumption and enhance computation capability for resource-constrained IoT devices. Computation offloading has recently received considerable attention in edge computing. Many existing studies have investigated the computation offloading problem with independent computing tasks. However, due to the inter-task dependency in various devices that commonly happens in IoT systems, achieving energy-efficient computation offloading decisions remains a challengeable problem. In this paper, a cloud-assisted edge computing framework with a three-tier network in an IoT environment is introduced. In this framework, we first formulated an energy consumption minimization problem as a mixed integer programming problem considering two constraints, the task-dependency requirement and the completion time deadline of the IoT service. To address this problem, we then proposed an Energy-efficient Collaborative Task Computation Offloading (ECTCO) algorithm based on a semidefinite relaxation and stochastic mapping approach to obtain strategies of tasks computation offloading for IoT sensors. Simulation results demonstrated that the cloud-assisted edge computing framework was feasible and the proposed ECTCO algorithm could effectively reduce the energy cost of IoT sensors.

AB  - The complex nature of cyber-physical energy systems (CPES) makes systematic testing of new technologies for these setups challenging. Co-simulation has been identified as an efficient and flexible test approach that allows consideration of interdisciplinary dynamic interactions. However, basic coupling of simulation models alone fails to account for many of the challenges of simulation-based multi-domain testing such as expert collaboration in test planning. This paper illustrates an extended CPES test environment based on the co-simulation framework mosaik. The environment contains capabilities for simulation planning, uncertainty quantification and the development of multi-agent systems. An application case involving virtual power plant control is used to demonstrate the platform&rsquo;s features. Future extensibility of the highly modular test environment is outlined.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recently, vehicular networks have emerged to facilitate intelligent transportation systems (ITS). They enable vehicles to communicate with each other in order to provide various services such as traffic safety, autonomous driving, and entertainments. The vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication channel is doubly selective, where the channel changes within the transmission bandwidth and the frame duration. This necessitates robust algorithms to provide reliable V2V communications. In this paper, we propose a scheme that provides joint adaptive modulation, coding and payload length selection (AMCPLS) for V2V communications. Our AMCPLS scheme selects both the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and the payload length of transmission frames for V2V communication links, according to the V2V channel condition. Our aim is to achieve both reliability and spectrum efficiency. Our proposed AMCPLS scheme improves the V2V effective throughput performance while satisfying a predefined frame error rate (FER). Furthermore, we present a deep learning approach that exploits deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for implementing the proposed AMCPLS. Simulation results reveal that the proposed DCNN-based AMCPLS approach outperforms other competing machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and support vector machines (SVM) in terms of FER, effective throughput, and prediction time.

TI  - SURAA: A Novel Method and Tool for Loadbalanced and Coalesced SpMV Computations on GPUs
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 5
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Sparse matrix-vector (SpMV) multiplication is a vital building block for numerous scientific and engineering applications. This paper proposes SURAA (translates to speed in arabic), a novel method for SpMV computations on graphics processing units (GPUs). The novelty lies in the way we group matrix rows into different segments, and adaptively schedule various segments to different types of kernels. The sparse matrix data structure is created by sorting the rows of the matrix on the basis of the nonzero elements per row (   n p r) and forming segments of equal size (containing approximately an equal number of nonzero elements per row) using the Freedman&ndash;Diaconis rule. The segments are assembled into three groups based on the mean     n p r     of the segments. For each group, we use multiple kernels to execute the group segments on different streams. Hence, the number of threads to execute each segment is adaptively chosen. Dynamic Parallelism available in Nvidia GPUs is utilized to execute the group containing segments with the largest mean     n p r, providing improved load balancing and coalesced memory access, and hence more efficient SpMV computations on GPUs. Therefore, SURAA minimizes the adverse effects of the     n p r     variance by uniformly distributing the load using equal sized segments. We implement the SURAA method as a tool and compare its performance with the de facto best commercial (cuSPARSE) and open source (CUSP, MAGMA) tools using widely used benchmarks comprising 26 high     n p r  v a r i a n c e     matrices from 13 diverse domains. SURAA outperforms the other tools by delivering 13.99x speedup on average. We believe that our approach provides a fundamental shift in addressing SpMV related challenges on GPUs including coalesced memory access, thread divergence, and load balancing, and is set to open new avenues for further improving SpMV performance in the future.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is the ability to provide everyday devices with a way of identification and another way for communication with each other. The spectrum of IoT application domains is very large including smart homes, smart cities, wearables, e-health, etc. Consequently, tens and even hundreds of billions of devices will be connected. Such devices will have smart capabilities to collect, analyze and even make decisions without any human interaction. Security is a supreme requirement in such circumstances, and in particular authentication is of high interest given the damage that could happen from a malicious unauthenticated device in an IoT system. This paper gives a near complete and up-to-date view of the IoT authentication field. It provides a summary of a large range of authentication protocols proposed in the literature. Using a multi-criteria classification previously introduced in our work, it compares and evaluates the proposed authentication protocols, showing their strengths and weaknesses, which constitutes a fundamental first step for researchers and developers addressing this domain.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - To effectively maintain and analyze a large amount of real-time sensor data, one often uses a filtering technique that reflects characteristics of original data well. This paper proposes a novel method for recommending the measurement noise for Kalman filtering, which is one of the most representative filtering techniques. Kalman filtering corrects inaccurate values of input sensor data, and its filtering performance varies depending on the input noise parameters. In particular, if the noise parameters determined based on the user&rsquo;s experience are incorrect, the accuracy of Kalman filtering may be reduced significantly. Based on this observation, this paper addresses how to determine the measurement noise variance, a major input parameter of Kalman filtering, by analyzing past sensor data and how to use the estimated noise to improve the filtering accuracy. More specifically, to estimate the measurement noise variance, two analytical methods are proposed: one a transform-based method using a wavelet transform and the other a learning-based method using a denoising autoencoder. Experimental results show that the proposed methods estimated the measurement noise variance accurately and were superior to the experience-based method in the filtering accuracy.

AB  - In recent years, due to the unnecessary wastage of electrical energy in residential buildings, the requirement of energy optimization and user comfort has gained vital importance. In the literature, various techniques have been proposed addressing the energy optimization problem. The goal of each technique is to maintain a balance between user comfort and energy requirements, such that the user can achieve the desired comfort level with the minimum amount of energy consumption. Researchers have addressed the issue with the help of different optimization algorithms and variations in the parameters to reduce energy consumption. To the best of our knowledge, this problem is not solved yet due to its challenging nature. The gaps in the literature are due to advancements in technology, the drawbacks of optimization algorithms, and the introduction of new optimization algorithms. Further, many newly proposed optimization algorithms have produced better accuracy on the benchmark instances but have not been applied yet for the optimization of energy consumption in smart homes. In this paper, we have carried out a detailed literature review of the techniques used for the optimization of energy consumption and scheduling in smart homes. Detailed discussion has been carried out on different factors contributing towards thermal comfort, visual comfort, and air quality comfort. We have also reviewed the fog and edge computing techniques used in smart homes.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In order to optimize intelligent applications driven by various sensors, it is vital to properly interpret and reuse sensor data from different domains. The construction of semantic maps which illustrate the relationship between heterogeneous domain ontologies plays an important role in knowledge reuse. However, most mapping methods in the literature use the literal meaning of each concept and instance in the ontology to obtain semantic similarity. This is especially the case for domain ontologies which are built for applications with sensor data. At the instance level, there is seldom work to utilize data of the sensor instances when constructing the ontologies&rsquo; mapping relationship. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to achieve the association between sensor data and domain ontology. In our approach, we first classify the sensor data by making them as SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontology instances, and map the corresponding instances to the concepts in the domain ontology. Secondly, a multi-strategy similarity calculation method is used to evaluate the similarity of the concept pairs between the domain ontologies at multiple levels. Finally, the set of concept pairs with a high similarity is selected by the analytic hierarchy process to construct the mapping relationship between the domain ontologies, and then the correlation between sensor data and domain ontologies are constructed. Using the method presented in this paper, we perform sensor data correlation experiments with a simulator for a real world scenario. By comparison to other methods, the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Insights from Self-Organizing Maps for Predicting Accessibility Demand for Healthcare Infrastructure
T2  - Urban Science

PY  - 2019
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SN  - 2413-8851

AB  - As urban populations grow worldwide, it becomes increasingly important to critically analyse accessibility&mdash;the ease with which residents can reach key places or opportunities. The combination of &lsquo;big data&rsquo; and advances in computational techniques such as machine learning (ML) could be a boon for urban accessibility studies, yet their application in this field remains limited. In this study, we provided detailed predictions of healthcare accessibility across a rapidly growing city and related them to socio-economic factors using a combination of classical and modern data analysis methods. Using the City of Surrey (Canada) as a case study, we clustered high-resolution income data for 2016 and 2022 using principal component analysis (PCA) and a powerful ML clustering tool, the self-organising map (SOM). We then combined this with door-to-door travel times to hospitals and clinics, calculated using a simple open-source tool. Focusing our analysis on senior populations (65+ years), we found that higher income clusters are projected to become more prevalent across Surrey over our study period. Low income clusters have on average better accessibility to healthcare facilities than high income clusters in both 2016 and 2022. Population growth will be the biggest accessibility challenge in neighbourhoods with good existing access to healthcare, whereas income change (both positive and negative) will be most challenging in poorly connected neighbourhoods. A dual accessibility problem may arise in Surrey: first, large senior populations will reside in areas with access to numerous and close-by, clinics, putting pressure on existing facilities for specialised services. Second, lower-income seniors will increasingly reside in areas poorly connected to healthcare services, which may impact accessibility equity. We demonstrate that combining PCA and SOM clustering techniques results in novel insights for predicting accessibility at the neighbourhood level. This allows for robust planning policy recommendations to be drawn from large multivariate datasets.

IS  - 3
SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - In this study, an analysis of brain, cardiovascular and respiratory dynamics was conducted combining information-theoretic measures with the Network Physiology paradigm during different levels of mental stress. Starting from low invasive recordings of electroencephalographic, electrocardiographic, respiratory, and blood volume pulse signals, the dynamical activity of seven physiological systems was probed with one-second time resolution measuring the time series of the    &delta;   ,    &theta;   ,    &alpha;    and    &beta;    brain wave amplitudes, the cardiac period (RR interval), the respiratory amplitude, and the duration of blood pressure wave propagation (pulse arrival time, PAT). Synchronous 5-min windows of these time series, obtained from 18 subjects during resting wakefulness (REST), mental stress induced by mental arithmetic (MA) and sustained attention induced by serious game (SG), were taken to describe the dynamics of the nodes composing the observed physiological network. Network activity and connectivity were then assessed in the framework of information dynamics computing the new information generated by each node, the information dynamically stored in it, and the information transferred to it from the other network nodes. Moreover, the network topology was investigated using directed measures of conditional information transfer and assessing their statistical significance. We found that all network nodes dynamically produce and store significant amounts of information, with the new information being prevalent in the brain systems and the information storage being prevalent in the peripheral systems. The transition from REST to MA was associated with an increase of the new information produced by the respiratory signal time series (RESP), and that from MA to SG with a decrease of the new information produced by PAT. Each network node received a significant amount of information from the other nodes, with the highest amount transferred to RR and the lowest transferred to    &delta;   ,    &theta;   ,    &alpha;    and    &beta;   . The topology of the physiological network underlying such information transfer was node- and state-dependent, with the peripheral subnetwork showing interactions from RR to PAT and between RESP and RR, PAT consistently across states, the brain subnetwork resulting more connected during MA, and the subnetwork of brain&ndash;peripheral interactions involving different brain rhythms in the three states and resulting primarily activated during MA. These results have both physiological relevance as regards the interpretation of central and autonomic effects on cardiovascular and respiratory variability, and practical relevance as regards the identification of features useful for the automatic distinction of different mental states.

AB  - The paper describes the methodology used for developing an electric load microforecasting module to be integrated in the Energy Management System (EMS) architecture designed and tested within the &ldquo;Energy Router&rdquo; (ER) project. This Italian R&amp;D project is aimed at providing non-industrial active customers and prosumers with a monitoring and control device that would enable demand response through optimization of their own distributed energy resources (DERs). The optimal control of resources is organized with a hierarchical control structure and performed in two stages. A cloud-based computation platform provides global control functions based on model predictive control whereas a closed-loop local device manages actual monitoring and control of field components. In this architecture, load forecasts on a small scale (a single residential or tertiary building) are needed as inputs of the predictive control problem. The microforecasting module aimed at providing such inputs was designed to be flexible, adaptive, and able to treat data with low time resolution. The module includes alternative forecasting techniques, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), neural networks, and exponential smoothing, allowing the application of the right forecasting strategy each time. The presented test results are based on a dataset acquired during a monitoring campaign in two pilot systems, installed during the ER Project in public buildings.

AB  - Recent expansion of intelligent gadgets, such as smartphones and smart watches, familiarizes humans with sensing their activities. We have been developing a road accessibility evaluation system inspired by human sensing technologies. This paper introduces our methodology to estimate road accessibility from the three-axis acceleration data obtained by a smart phone attached on a wheelchair seat, such as environmental factors, e.g., curbs and gaps, which directly influence wheelchair bodies, and human factors, e.g., wheelchair users&rsquo; feelings of tiredness and strain. Our goal is to realize a system that provides the road accessibility visualization services to users by online/offline pattern matching using impersonal models, while gradually learning to improve service accuracy using new data provided by users. As the first step, this paper evaluates features acquired by the DCNN (deep convolutional neural network), which learns the state of the road surface from the data in supervised machine learning techniques. The evaluated results show that the features can capture the difference of the road surface condition in more detail than the label attached by us and are effective as the means for quantitatively expressing the road surface condition. This paper developed and evaluated a prototype system that estimated types of ground surfaces focusing on knowledge extraction and visualization.

AB  - In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers. At the same time, advances in technologies enable the generation or collection of large amounts of valuable data (e.g., sensor data) from various sources in different applications, such as those for the Internet of Things (IoT), which in turn aims towards the development of smart cities. With the availability of sensor data from various sources, sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article, we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors, including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system (GIS), accelerometers, as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS). The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens, which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and practicality of our AI-based sensor information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of big transportation data.

AB  - For the past few years, the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has been a recurrent view of the technological environment where nearly every object is expected to be connected to the network. This infrastructure will progressively allow one to monitor and efficiently manage the environment. Until recent years, the IoT applications have been constrained by the limited computational capacity and especially by efficient communications, but the emergence of new communication technologies allows us to overcome most of these issues. This situation paves the way for the fulfillment of the Smart-City concept, where the cities become a fully efficient, monitored, and managed environment able to sustain the increasing needs of its citizens and achieve environmental goals and challenges. However, many Smart-City approaches still require testing and study for their full development and adoption. To facilitate this, the university of M&aacute;laga made the commitment to investigate and innovate the concept of Smart-Campus. The goal is to transform university campuses into &ldquo;small&rdquo; smart cities able to support efficient management of their area as well as innovative educational and research activities, which would be key factors to the proper development of the smart-cities of the future. This paper presents the University of M&aacute;laga long-term commitment to the development of its Smart-Campus in the fields of its infrastructure, management, research support, and learning activities. In this way, the adopted IoT and telecommunication architecture is presented, detailing the schemes and initiatives defined for its use in learning activities. This approach is then assessed, establishing the principles for its general application.

AB  - Smart cities are urban environments where Internet of Things (IoT) devices provide a continuous source of data about urban phenomena such as traffic and air pollution. The exploitation of the spatial properties of data enables situation and context awareness. However, the integration and analysis of data from IoT sensing devices remain a crucial challenge for the development of IoT applications in smart cities. Existing approaches provide no or limited ability to perform spatial data analysis, even when spatial information plays a significant role in decision making across many disciplines. This work proposes a generic approach to enabling spatiotemporal capabilities in information services for smart cities. We adopted a multidisciplinary approach to achieving data integration and real-time processing, and developed a reference architecture for the development of event-driven applications. This type of applications seamlessly integrates IoT sensing devices, complex event processing, and spatiotemporal analytics through a processing workflow for the detection of geographic events. Through the implementation and testing of a system prototype, built upon an existing sensor network, we demonstrated the feasibility, performance, and scalability of event-driven applications to achieve real-time processing capabilities and detect geographic events.

AB  - Smart cities research evolved into one of the most vibrant fields of research and policy-making with sustainability and well-being becoming the bons mots of the debate. The business sector, i.e., the developers and the vendors, form an equally important group of stakeholders in this context. The question is to what extent that debate yields the kind of output that the end-users would expect and would consider useful and usable. A plethora of smart city services exists. Literature suggests that a myriad of new ICT-enhanced tools could find application in urban space. Methodologically speaking, the question is how to link these two meaningfully. The objective of this paper is to address this issue. To this end, smart city services are mapped and clusters of services are identified; end users‚Äô perceptions and expectations are identified and observations are drawn. The value added of this paper is threefold: (i) at the conceptual level, it adds new insights in the ‚Äònormative bias of smart cities research‚Äô thesis, (ii) at the empirical level, it typifies smart city services and clusters them, and (iii) it introduces a practical toolkit that policymakers, regulators, and the business sector might employ to query end-users‚Äô perceptions and expectations to effectively respond to citizens‚Äô needs.

AB  - Recently, data mining analysis techniques have been developed, as large spatial datasets have accumulated in various fields. Such a data-driven analysis is necessary in areas of high uncertainty and complexity, such as estimating groundwater potential. Therefore, in this study, data mining of various spatial datasets, including those based on remote sensing data, was applied to estimate groundwater potential. For the sustainable development of groundwater resources, a plan for the systematic management of groundwater resources should be established based on a quantitative understanding of the development potential. The purpose of this study was to map and analyze the groundwater potential of Goyang-si in Gyeonggi-do province, South Korea and to evaluate the sensitivity of each factor by applying data mining models for big data analysis. A total of 876 surveyed groundwater pumping capacity data were used, 50% of which were randomly classified into training and test datasets to analyze groundwater potential. A total of 13 factors extracted from satellite-based topographical, land cover, soil, forest, geological, hydrogeological, and survey-based precipitation data were used. The frequency ratio (FR) and boosted classification tree (BCT) models were used to analyze the relationships between the groundwater pumping capacity and related factors. Groundwater potential maps were constructed and validated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, with accuracy rates of 68.31% and 69.39% for the FR and BCT models, respectively. A sensitivity analysis for both models was performed to assess the influence of each factor. The results of this study are expected to be useful for establishing an effective groundwater management plan in the future.

AB  - In view of intensified disasters and fatalities caused by natural phenomena and geographical expansion, there is a pressing need for a more effective environment logging for a better management and urban planning. This paper proposes a novel utility computing model (UCM) for structural health monitoring (SHM) that would enable dynamic planning of monitoring systems in an efficient and cost-effective manner in form of a SHM geo-informatics system. The proposed UCM consists of networked SHM systems that send geometrical SHM variables to SHM-UCM gateways. Every gateway is routing the data to SHM-UCM servers running a geo-spatial patch health assessment and prediction algorithm. The inputs of the prediction algorithm are geometrical variables, environmental variables, and payloads. The proposed SHM-UCM is unique in terms of its capability to manage heterogeneous SHM resources. This has been tested in a case study on Qatar University (QU) in Doha Qatar, where it looked at where SHM nodes are distributed along with occupancy density in each building. This information was taken from QU routers and zone calculation models and were then compared to ideal SHM system data. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in logging and dynamically planning SHM.

AB  - Future-generation radio access networks (RAN) are projected to fulfill the diverse requirements of user equipment (UE) by adopting a heterogeneous network (HetNet) environment. Necessary integration of different radio access technologies (RAT), such as 2G, 3G, 4G, wireless local area network (WLAN), and visible light communication (VLC) is inevitable. Moreover, UEs equipped with diverse requirements will be capable of accessing some or all the RATs. The complex HetNet environment with diverse requirements of UEs will present many challenges. The HetNet is likely to suffer severely from load imbalance among the base stations (BSs) from inheriting the traditional user association scheme such as max-SINR (signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio)/max-RSSI (received signal strength indicator), unless some sophisticated schemes are invented. In this paper, a novel scheme is devised for a joint-user association for load balancing, where BSs are densely deployed and UEs typically have a certain degree of mobility. Unlike most of the present works, a dynamic network is considered where the position and channel condition of the UEs are not fixed. We develop two complex and distributed association schemes based on probability and d-choices, while carefully considering both loads of the BSs and SINR experienced by the UEs. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed schemes by showing a received data-rate fairness among UEs and an improvement in the UE&rsquo;s minimum received data rate.

AB  - Noise pollution is one of the topmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the United States. Continued exposure to high levels of noise has proven effects on health, including acute effects such as sleep disruption, and long-term effects such as hypertension, heart disease, and hearing loss. To investigate and ultimately aid in the mitigation of urban noise, a network of 55 sensor nodes has been deployed across New York City for over two years, collecting sound pressure level (SPL) and audio data. This network has cumulatively amassed over 75 years of calibrated, high-resolution SPL measurements and 35 years of audio data. In addition, high frequency telemetry data have been collected that provides an indication of a sensors&rsquo; health. These telemetry data were analyzed over an 18-month period across 31 of the sensors. It has been used to develop a prototype model for pre-failure detection which has the ability to identify sensors in a prefail state 69.1% of the time. The entire network infrastructure is outlined, including the operation of the sensors, followed by an analysis of its data yield and the development of the fault detection approach and the future system integration plans for this.

AB  - In this paper, cluster analysis and the XGBoost method are used to analyze the related symptoms of various types of young hypertensive patients, and finally guide patients to target treatment. Hypertension is a chronic disease that is common worldwide. The incidence of it is increasing, and the age level of patients is decreasing year by year. Effective treatment of youth hypertension has become a problem in the world. In this paper, young hypertension patients are classified into two groups by cluster analysis; the proportion of different hypertension related symptoms in each group of patients is then counted; and after verifying the prediction accuracy of the XGBoost model with 10-fold cross-validation, the accuracy of clustering is calculated by the XGBoost method. The final result shows that there are significant differences in symptomatic entropy between patients with type II hypertension and those with type I hypertension. Patients with type II hypertension are more likely to have symptoms of ventricular hypertrophy and microalbuminuria. Through this analysis, patients can have preventive treatment according to their own situation, and this can reduce the burden of medical expenses and prevent major diseases. Applying the data analysis into the medical field has great practical significance.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Feature extraction in cloud shadows is a difficult problem in the field of optical remote sensing. The key to solving this problem is to improve the accuracy of classification algorithms by fusing multi-source remotely sensed data. Hyperspectral data have rich spectral information but highly suffer from cloud shadows, whereas light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data can be acquired from beneath clouds to provide accurate height information. In this study, fused airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data were used to extract urban objects in cloud shadows using the following steps: (1) a series of LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics were extracted and selected; (2) cloud shadows were extracted; (3) the new proposed approach was used by combining a pixel-based support vector machine (SVM) and object-based classifiers to extract urban objects in cloud shadows; (4) a pixel-based SVM classifier was used for the classification of the whole study area with the selected metrics; (5) a decision-fusion strategy was employed to get the final results for the whole study area; (6) accuracy assessment was conducted. Compared with the SVM classification results, the decision-fusion results of the combined SVM and object-based classifiers show that the overall classification accuracy is improved by 5.00% (from 87.30% to 92.30%). The experimental results confirm that the proposed method is very effective for urban object extraction in cloud shadows and thus improve urban applications such as urban green land management, land use analysis, and impervious surface assessment.

AB  - As an emerging class of spatial trajectory data, mobile user trajectory data can be used to analyze individual or group behavioral characteristics, hobbies and interests. Besides, the information extracted from original trajectory data is widely used in smart cities, transportation planning, and anti-terrorism maintenance. In order to identify the important locations of the target user from his trajectory data, a novel division method for preprocessing trajectory data is proposed, the feature points of original trajectory are extracted according to the change of trajectory structural, and then important locations are extracted by clustering the feature points, using an improved density peak clustering algorithm. Finally, in order to predict next location of mobile users, a multi-order fusion Markov model based on the Adaboost algorithm is proposed, the model order k is adaptively determined, and the weight coefficients of the 1~k-order models are given by the Adaboost algorithm according to the importance of various order models, a multi-order fusion Markov model is generated to predict next important location of the user. The experimental results on the real user trajectory dataset Geo-life show that the prediction performance of Adaboost-Markov model is better than the multi-order fusion Markov model with equal coefficient, and the universality and prediction performance of Adaboost-Markov model is better than the first to third order Markov models.

The software architecture is an evolving concept in smart grid systems, in which system architecture development is a challenging process. The architecture has to realize the complex legacy power grid systems and cope with current Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The distributed generation in a smart grid environment expects the software architecture to be distributed and to enable local control. Smart grid architecture should also be modular, flexible, and adaptable to technology upgrades. In this paper, the authors have made a comprehensive review of architectures for smart grids.

AB  - In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), there are many challenges for outlier detection, such as fault detection, fraud detection, intrusion detection, and so on. In this paper, the participation degree of instances in the hierarchical clustering process infers the relationship between instances. However, most of the existing algorithms ignore such information. Thus, we propose a novel fault detection technique based on the participation degree, called fault detection based on participation degree (FDP). Our algorithm has the following advantages. First, it does not need data training in labeled datasets; in fact, it uses the participation degree to measure the differences between fault points and normal points without setting distance or density parameters. Second, FDP can detect global outliers without local cluster influence. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our approach by applying it to synthetic and real-world datasets and contrasting it with four well-known techniques: isolation forest (IF), local outlier factor (LOF), one-class support vector machine (OCS), and robust covariance (RC).

Power consumption in the residential sector is affected by the behavior of home residents through using their home appliances. Respecting such behavior and preferences is essential for developing demand response programs. The main contribution of this paper is to discover the association between appliances&rsquo; usage through mining temporal association rules in addition to applying the temporal clustering technique for grouping appliances with similar usage at a particular time. The proposed method is applied on a time-series dataset, which is the United Kingdom Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity (UK-DALE), and the results that are achieved discovered appliance&ndash;appliance associations that have similar usage patterns with respect to the 24 h of the day.

AB  - This paper studies denial-of-services (DoS) attacks against industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) for which we built a proper ICPS model and attack model. According to the impact of different attack rates on systems, instead of directly studying the time delay caused by the attacks some security zones are identified, which display how a DoS attack destroys the stable status of the ICPS. Research on security zone division is consistent with the fact that ICPSs&rsquo; communication devices actually have some capacity for large network traffic. The research on DoS attacks&rsquo; impacts on ICPSs by studying their operation conditions in different security zones is simplified further. Then, a detection method and a mimicry security switch strategy are proposed to defend against malicious DoS attacks and bring the ICPS under attack back to normal. Lastly, practical implementation experiments have been carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the method we propose.

AB  - There is an increasing demand for acquiring details of food nutrients especially among those who are sensitive to food intakes and weight changes. To meet this need, we propose a new approach based on deep learning that precisely estimates the composition of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats from hyperspectral signals of foods obtained by using low-cost spectrometers. Specifically, we develop a system consisting of multiple deep neural networks for estimating food nutrients followed by detecting and discarding estimation anomalies. Our comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system can maximize estimation accuracy by automatically identifying wrong estimations. As such, if consolidated with the capability of reinforcement learning, it will likely be positioned as a promising means for personalized healthcare in terms of food safety.

A distributed ledger (blockchain) technology, embedded with privacy and security by architecture, provides a transparent application developing platform. Privacy, security, and lack of confidence among stakeholders are the main downsides of extensive medical collaboration. This study, therefore, utilizes the transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology to establish a collaborative medical decision-making scheme. This study considers the experience, skill, and collaborative success rate of four key stakeholders (patient, cured patient, doctor, and insurance company) in the healthcare domain to propose a local reference-based consortium blockchain scheme, and an associated consensus gathering algorithm, proof-of-familiarity (PoF). Stakeholders create a transparent and tenable medical decision to increase the interoperability among collaborators through PoF. A prototype of PoF is tested with multichain 2.0, a blockchain implementing framework. Moreover, the privacy of identities, EMRs, and decisions are preserved by two-layer storage, encryption, and a timestamp storing mechanism. Finally, superiority over existing schemes is identified to improve personal data (PII) privacy and patient-centric outcomes research (PCOR).

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In human-centered intelligent building, real-time measurements of human thermal comfort play critical roles and supply feedback control signals for building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Due to the challenges of intra- and inter-individual differences and skin subtleness variations, there has not been any satisfactory solution for thermal comfort measurements until now. In this paper, a contactless measuring method based on a skin sensitivity index and deep learning (NISDL) was proposed to measure real-time skin temperature. A new evaluating index, named the skin sensitivity index (SSI), was defined to overcome individual differences and skin subtleness variations. To illustrate the effectiveness of SSI proposed, a two multi-layers deep learning framework (NISDL method I and II) was designed and the DenseNet201 was used for extracting features from skin images. The partly personal saturation temperature (NIPST) algorithm was use for algorithm comparisons. Another deep learning algorithm without SSI (DL) was also generated for algorithm comparisons. Finally, a total of 1.44 million image data was used for algorithm validation. The results show that 55.62% and 52.25% error values (NISDL method I, II) are scattered at (0 &deg;C, 0.25 &deg;C), and the same error intervals distribution of NIPST is 35.39%.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Predicted price-to-book value ratios (P/BV) are widely used for the valuation of listed common stocks. However, with the application of automated trading system (ATS), the existing indicators that are applied in the method are losing their effectiveness in the Chinese market. Combining qualitative research with the text mining method, this study explores and validates those ignored factors to improve the accuracy of the stock valuation. On the basis of the principal of the existing valuation method, we clarify the scope of the factors that affects the P/BV ratio prediction. Through semi-structured interviews that are designed with six first-level factors which are taken from the literature, we then excavate some second-level factors. After that, with three corpuses including samples form Sina.com.cn, Xueqiu.com, and CSDN.net, four first-level factors and thirteen second-level factors have been verified step by step through the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. In the process, two other new factors and three sub-factors are also found. Furthermore, based on the factor correlation that was found in a data analysis, a factor relationship model was built. The results can be used in a stock valuation in future work as the basis of the indicator system for the prediction of P/BV ratio.

AB  - The advancements in digital communication technology have made communication between humans more accessible and instant. However, personal and sensitive information may be available online through social networks and online services that lack the security measures to protect this information. Communication systems are vulnerable and can easily be penetrated by malicious users through social engineering attacks. These attacks aim at tricking individuals or enterprises into accomplishing actions that benefit attackers or providing them with sensitive data such as social security number, health records, and passwords. Social engineering is one of the biggest challenges facing network security because it exploits the natural human tendency to trust. This paper provides an in-depth survey about the social engineering attacks, their classifications, detection strategies, and prevention procedures.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper describes our virtual fence system for goats. The present invention is a method of controlling goats without visible physical fences and monitoring their condition. Control occurs through affecting goats, using one or more sound signals and electric shocks when they attempt to enter a restricted zone. One of the best Machine Learning (ML) classifications named Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to observe the condition. A virtual fence boundary can be of any geometrical shape. A smart collar on goats‚Äô necks can be detected by using a virtual fence application. Each smart collar consists of a global positioning system (GPS), an XBee communication module, an mp3 player, and an electrical shocker. Stimuli and classification results are presented from on-farm experiments with a goat equipped with smart collar. Using the proposed stimuli methods, we showed that the probability of a goat receiving an electrical stimulus following an audio cue (dog and emergency sounds) was low (20%) and declined over the testing period. Besides, the RBF kernel-based SVM classification model classified lying behavior with an extremely high classification accuracy (F-score of 1), whilst grazing, running, walking, and standing behaviors were also classified with a high accuracy (F-score of 0.95, 0.97, 0.81, and 0.8, respectively).

AB  - Sustainable development is critical to ensure the future of humanity. Therefore, the assessment and governance of sustainability becomes a central challenge our society is facing. This paper provides a novel ICT framework for addressing sustainable development goals. It is characterized by both local and global considerations, in the context of economic, ecological, and social aspects of sustainable development. The framework consists of three modules: data module, sustainability module, and governance module. Data module integrates data from several sources, processes data, infers knowledge, and transforms data into understandable information and knowledge. The second module implements SDGs at the level of municipality/city, ensures ranking of locally transformed SDGs to arrange them in line with the values and needs of the local communities, and proposes an integrated approach in modeling the social-ecological systems. By implementing governance theories, the governance module permits an effective citizen engagement in governance of SDGs. The ICT framework addresses short-term and long-term SDGs and allows for the vertical and horizontal linkages among diverse stakeholders, as well as for their contributions to the nested rule structures employed at operational, collective, and constitutional levels. Thus, the framework we provide here ensures a paradigm shift in approaching SDGs for the advancement of our society.

AB  - Many cities around the world are facing immense pressure due to the expediting growth rates in urban population levels. The notion of &lsquo;smart cities&rsquo; has been proposed as a solution to enhance the sustainability of cities through effective urban management of governance, energy and transportation. The research presented herein examines the applicability of a mathematical framework to enhance the sustainability of decisions involved in zoning, land-use allocation and facility location within smart cities. In particular, a mathematical optimisation framework is proposed, which links through with other platforms in city settings, for optimising the zoning, land-use allocation, location of new buildings and the investment decisions made regarding infrastructure works in smart cities. Multiple objective functions are formulated to optimise social, economic and environmental considerations in the urban space. The impact on underlying traffic of location choices made for the newly introduced buildings is accounted for through optimised assignment of traffic to the underlying network. A case example on urban planning and infrastructure development within a smart city is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Through the Internet of things (IoT), as promoted by smart cities, there is an emergence of big data accentuating the use of artificial intelligence through various components of urban planning, management, and design. One such system is that of artificial neural networks (ANNs), a component of machine learning that boasts similitude with brain neurological networks and its functioning. However, the development of ANN was done in singular fashion, whereby processes are rendered in sequence in a unidimensional perspective, contrasting with the functions of the brain to which ANN boasts similitude, and in particular to the concept of neuroplasticity which encourages unique complex interactions in self-learning fashion, thereby encouraging more inclusive urban processes and render urban coherence. This paper takes inspiration from Christopher Alexander&rsquo;s Nature of Order and dwells in the concept of complexity theory; it also proposes a theoretical model of how ANN can be rendered with the same plastic properties as brain neurological networks with multidimensional interactivity in the context of smart cities through the use of big data and its emerging complex networks. By doing so, this model caters to the creation of stronger, richer, and more complex patterns that support Alexander&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; through the connection of overlapping networks. This paper is aimed toward engineers with interdisciplinary interest looking at creating more complex and intricate ANN models, and toward urban planners and urban theorists working on the emerging contemporary concept of smart cities.

TI  - Evaluation Method for the Hourly Average CO2eq. Intensity of the Electricity Mix and Its Application to the Demand Response of Residential Heating
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2019
VL  - 12
IS  - 7
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This work introduces a generic methodology to determine the hourly average CO2eq. intensity of the electricity mix of a bidding zone. The proposed method is based on the logic of input&ndash;output models and avails the balance between electricity generation and demand. The methodology also takes into account electricity trading between bidding zones and time-varying CO2eq. intensities of the electricity traded. The paper shows that it is essential to take into account electricity imports and their varying CO2eq. intensities for the evaluation of the CO2eq. intensity in Scandinavian bidding zones. Generally, the average CO2eq. intensity of the Norwegian electricity mix increases during times of electricity imports since the average CO2eq. intensity is normally low because electricity is mainly generated from hydropower. Among other applications, the CO2eq. intensity can be used as a penalty signal in predictive controls of building energy systems since ENTSO-E provides 72 h forecasts of electricity generation. Therefore, as a second contribution, the demand response potential for heating a single-family residential building based on the hourly average CO2eq. intensity of six Scandinavian bidding zones is investigated. Predictive rule-based controls are implemented into a building performance simulation tool (here IDA ICE) to study the influence that the daily fluctuations of the CO2eq. intensity signal have on the potential overall emission savings. The results show that control strategies based on the CO2eq. intensity can achieve emission reductions, if daily fluctuations of the CO2eq. intensity are large enough to compensate for the increased electricity use due to load shifting. Furthermore, the results reveal that price-based control strategies usually lead to increased overall emissions for the Scandinavian bidding zones as the operation is shifted to nighttime, when cheap carbon-intensive electricity is imported from the continental European power grid.

AB  - The city of Bandung, Indonesia contains thematic parks which use certain themes to highlight the features of the park. They are also used as a branding strategy for the city as a whole. As social networking has become a type of media used by most global populations to share experiences and stories and to influence perceptions, and because online reviews are one way to get potential positive information about the success of a business or service, we analyzed online reviews from the Bandung thematic parks. We identified that thematic parks have an influence on the branding of the city of Bandung. Data collection involved data extraction from Google Maps user reviews. Text mining was used to collect the information attributes needed to determine the public perceptions of thematic parks. Data analysis was used to determine the extent to which a park can be a benchmark for place branding in Bandung. This research found that the influence of the thematic park concept is a good strategy for the city of Bandung. Online reviews show that thematic parks in Bandung are better known than non-thematic parks, and that thematic parks get very good ratings and good opinions from online reviewers. This information is expected to be a reference for developing the concept of thematic parks, especially in the city of Bandung, and it can be used by the government, architects, and urban designers to get a better understanding of the users&rsquo; perceptions and as a benchmark for similar projects.

AB  - Depth has been a valuable piece of information for perception tasks such as robot grasping, obstacle avoidance, and navigation, which are essential tasks for developing smart homes and smart cities. However, not all applications have the luxury of using depth sensors or multiple cameras to obtain depth information. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating the per-pixel depths from a single image. Inspired by the recent works on generative neural network models, we formulate the task of depth estimation as a generative task where we synthesize an image of the depth map from a single Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) input image. We propose a novel generative adversarial network that has an encoder-decoder type generator with residual transposed convolution blocks trained with an adversarial loss. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over several depth estimation works.

AB  - With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), applications have become smarter and connected devices give rise to their exploitation in all aspects of a modern city. As the volume of the collected data increases, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are applied to further enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application. The field of smart transportation has attracted many researchers and it has been approached with both ML and IoT techniques. In this review, smart transportation is considered to be an umbrella term that covers route optimization, parking, street lights, accident prevention/detection, road anomalies, and infrastructure applications. The purpose of this paper is to make a self-contained review of ML techniques and IoT applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and obtain a clear view of the trends in the aforementioned fields and spot possible coverage needs. From the reviewed articles it becomes profound that there is a possible lack of ML coverage for the Smart Lighting Systems and Smart Parking applications. Additionally, route optimization, parking, and accident/detection tend to be the most popular ITS applications among researchers.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Industrial revolution is advancing, and the augmented role of autonomous technology and embedded Internet of Things (IoT) systems is at its vanguard. In autonomous technology, real-time systems and real-time computing are of core importance. It is crucial for embedded IoT devices to respond in real-time; along with fulfilling all the constraints. Many combinations for existing approaches have been proposed with different trade-offs between the resources constraints and tasks dropping rate. Hence, it highlights the significance of a task scheduler which not only takes care of complex nature task input; but also maximizes the CPU throughput. A complex nature task input is when combinations of hard real-time tasks and soft real-time tasks, with different priorities and urgency measures, arrive at the scheduler. In this work, we propose a custom tailored adaptive and intelligent scheduling algorithm for the efficient execution and management of hard and soft real time tasks in embedded IoT systems. The proposed scheduling algorithm aims to distribute the CPU resources fairly to the possibly starving, in overloaded cases, soft real-time tasks while focusing on the execution of high priority hard real-time tasks as its primary objective. The proposal is achieved with the help of two intelligent measures; Urgency Measure (UM) and Failure Measure (FM). The proposed mechanism reduces the rate of tasks missed and the rate of tasks starved, by utilizing the free CPU units for maximum CPU utilization and quick response times. We have performed comparisons of our proposed scheme based on performance metrics as percentage of task instances missed, number of tasks with missed instances, and tasks starvation rate to evaluate the CPU utilization. We first compare our proposed approach with multiple traditional and combined scheduling approaches, and then we evaluate the effect of intelligent modules by comparing the intelligent FEF with non-intelligent FEF. We also evaluate the proposed algorithm in contrast to the most commonly-used hybrid scheduling scheme in embedded systems. The results show that the proposed algorithm out performs the other algorithms, by significantly reducing the task starvation rate and increasing the CPU utilization.

AB  - The proliferation of inter-connected devices in critical industries, such as healthcare and power grid, is changing the perception of what constitutes critical infrastructure. The rising interconnectedness of new critical industries is driven by the growing demand for seamless access to information as the world becomes more mobile and connected and as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows. Critical industries are essential to the foundation of today&rsquo;s society, and interruption of service in any of these sectors can reverberate through other sectors and even around the globe. In today&rsquo;s hyper-connected world, the critical infrastructure is more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats, whether state sponsored, criminal groups or individuals. As the number of interconnected devices increases, the number of potential access points for hackers to disrupt critical infrastructure grows. This new attack surface emerges from fundamental changes in the critical infrastructure of organizations technology systems. This paper aims to improve understanding the challenges to secure future digital infrastructure while it is still evolving. After introducing the infrastructure generating big data, the functionality-based fog architecture is defined. In addition, a comprehensive review of security requirements in fog-enabled IoT systems is presented. Then, an in-depth analysis of the fog computing security challenges and big data privacy and trust concerns in relation to fog-enabled IoT are given. We also discuss blockchain as a key enabler to address many security related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and fog computing. In this context, this work formalizes the task of securing big data and its scope, provides a taxonomy to categories threats to fog-based IoT systems, presents a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art contributions in the field according to their security service and recommends promising research directions for future investigations.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The performance of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based algorithm is subject to the way the feature data is extracted. This is a common issue when applying the ANN to indoor fingerprinting-based localization where the signal is unstable. To date, there is not adequate feature extraction method that can significantly mitigate the influence of the receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI) variation that degrades the performance of the ANN-based indoor fingerprinting algorithm. In this work, a wavelet scattering transform is used to extract reliable features that are stable to small deformation and rotation invariant. The extracted features are used by a deep neural network (DNN) model to predict the location. The zeroth and the first layer of decomposition coefficients were used as features data by concatenating different scattering path coefficients. The proposed algorithm has been validated on real measurements and has achieved good performance. The experimentation results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction method is stable to the RSSI variation.

AB  - In digital and green city initiatives, smart mobility is a key aspect of developing smart cities and it is important for built-up areas worldwide. Double-parking and busy roadside activities such as frequent loading and unloading of trucks, have a negative impact on traffic situations, especially in cities with high transportation density. Hence, a real-time internet of things (IoT)-based system for surveillance of roadside loading and unloading bays is needed. In this paper, a fully integrated solution is developed by equipping high-definition smart cameras with wireless communication for traffic surveillance. Henceforth, this system is referred to as a computer vision-based roadside occupation surveillance system (CVROSS). Through a vision-based network, real-time roadside traffic images, such as images of loading or unloading activities, are captured automatically. By making use of the collected data, decision support on roadside occupancy and vacancy can be evaluated by means of fuzzy logic and visualized for users, thus enhancing the transparency of roadside activities. The CVROSS was designed and tested in Hong Kong to validate the accuracy of parking-gap estimation and system performance, aiming at facilitating traffic and fleet management for smart mobility.

AB  - Innovative Internet of Things (IoT) applications with strict performance and energy consumption requirements and where the agile collection of data is paramount are arising. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) represent a promising solution as they can be easily deployed to sense, process, and forward data. The large number of Sensor Nodes (SNs) composing a WSN are expected to be autonomous, with a node&rsquo;s lifetime dictated by the battery&rsquo;s size. As the form factor of the SN is critical in various use cases, minimizing energy consumption while ensuring availability becomes a priority. Moreover, energy harvesting techniques are increasingly considered as a viable solution for building an entirely green SN and prolonging its lifetime. In the process of building a SN and in the absence of a clear and well-rounded methodology, the designer can easily make unfounded and suboptimal decisions about the right hardware components, their configuration, and reliable data communication techniques, such as automatic repeat request (ARQ) and forward error correction (FEC). In this paper, a methodology to design, configure, and deploy a reliable ultra-low power WSNs is proposed. A comprehensive energy model and a realistic path-loss (PL) model of the sensor node are also established. Through estimations and field measurements it is proven that, following the proposed methodology, the designer can thoroughly explore the design space and the make most favorable decisions when choosing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, configuring the node, and deploying a reliable and energy-efficient WSN.

AB  - This paper presents a novel method for online power quality data analysis in transmission networks using a machine learning-based classifier. The proposed classifier has a bundle structure based on the enhanced version of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Due to its fast response and easy-to-build architecture, the ELM is an appropriate machine learning model for power quality analysis. The sparse Bayesian ELM and weighted ELM have been embedded into the proposed bundle learning machine. The case study includes real field signals obtained from the Turkish electricity transmission system. Most actual events like voltage sag, voltage swell, interruption, and harmonics have been detected using the proposed algorithm. For validation purposes, the ELM algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art methods such as artificial neural network and least squares support vector machine.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - For a city to be livable and walkable is the ultimate goal of future cities. However, conflicts among pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists at traffic intersections are becoming severe in high-density urban transportation areas, especially in China. Correspondingly, the transit time at intersections is becoming prolonged, and pedestrian safety is becoming endangered. Simulating pedestrian movements at complex traffic intersections is necessary to optimize the traffic organization. We propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based method for tracking and simulating pedestrian movements at intersections. Specifically, high-resolution videos acquired by a UAV are used to recognize and position moving targets, including pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles, using the convolutional neural network. An improved social force-based motion model is proposed, considering the conflicts among pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles. In addition, maximum likelihood estimation is performed to calibrate an improved social force model. UAV videos of intersections in Shenzhen are analyzed to demonstrate the performance of the presented approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed social force-based motion model can effectively simulate the movement of pedestrians and cyclists at road intersections. The presented approach provides an alternative method to track and simulate pedestrian movements, thus benefitting the organization of pedestrian flow and traffic signals controlling the intersections.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Digital water meters can take Australian water utilities into the world of internet of things (IoT) and big data analytics. The potential is there for them to build more efficient processes, to enable new products and services to be offered, to defer expensive capital works, and for water conservation to be achieved. However, utilities are not mounting business cases with sufficient benefits to cover the project and operational costs. This study undertakes a literature review and interviews of industry experts in the search for unreported benefits that might be considered for inclusion in business cases. It identifies seventy-five possible benefits of which fifty-seven are classified as benefiting the water utility and forty are classified as benefiting customers (twenty-two benefit both). Many benefits may be difficult to monetize. Benefits to customers may have a small monetary benefit to the water utility but provide a significant benefit to customer satisfaction scores. However, for utilities to achieve these potential benefits, eight change enablers were identified as being required in their systems, processes, and resources. Of the seventy-five benefits, approximately half might be considered previously unreported. Finally, a taxonomy is presented into which the benefits are classified, and the enabling business changes for them to be realized are identified. Water utilities might consider the taxonomy, the benefits, and the changes required to enable the benefits when developing their business cases.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - As Internet of Things (IoT) involvement increases in our daily lives, several security and privacy concerns like linkability, unauthorized conversations, and side-channel attacks are raised. If they are left untouched, such issues may threaten the existence of IoT. They derive from two main reasons. One is that IoT objects are equipped with limited capabilities in terms of computation power, memory, and bandwidth which hamper the direct implementation of traditional Internet security techniques. The other reason is the absence of widely-accepted IoT security and privacy guidelines and their appropriate implementation techniques. Such guidelines and techniques would greatly assist IoT stakeholders like developers and manufacturers, paving the road for building secure IoT systems from the start and, thus, reinforcing IoT security and privacy by design. In order to contribute to such objective, we first briefly discuss the primary IoT security goals and recognize IoT stakeholders. Second, we propose a comprehensive list of IoT security and privacy guidelines for the edge nodes and communication levels of IoT reference architecture. Furthermore, we point out the IoT stakeholders such as customers and manufacturers who will benefit most from these guidelines. Moreover, we identify a set of implementation techniques by which such guidelines can be accomplished, and possible attacks against previously-mentioned levels can be alleviated. Third, we discuss the challenges of IoT security and privacy guidelines, and we briefly discuss digital rights management in IoT. Finally, through this survey, we suggest several open issues that require further investigation in the future. To the best of the authors&rsquo; knowledge, this work is the first survey that covers the above-mentioned objectives.

AB  - In the era of big data, smart cities have become a promising prospect for governments, citizens, and industrials. Many ideas and their derived systems for smart cities depend on big data for achieving a goal of data intelligence. However, there is an urgent transformation trend from data intelligence to service intelligence in the vision of smart cities due to the living requirements of citizens. People-centric service intelligence in smart cities has to support the realization of people&rsquo;s needs within urban and social domains. This paper introduces a concept of people-centric service intelligence, defines the level of it and its challenges in the aspect of infrastructure, human dynamics, human understanding and prediction, and the human&ndash;machine interface. Then, this paper proposes the theoretical framework and technical frameworks of people-centric service intelligence, and the service intelligence schemas for future construction of smart cities. It will be helpful for governments and industries to design people-centric service intelligence for improving the quality of life, the capabilities of good sustainability, and better development.

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - In today&rsquo;s world, ruled by a great amount of data and mobile devices, cloud-based systems are spreading all over. Such phenomenon increases the number of connected devices, broadcast bandwidth, and information exchange. These fine-grained interconnected systems, which enable the Internet connectivity for an extremely large number of facilities (far beyond the current number of devices) go by the name of Internet of Things (IoT). In this scenario, mobile devices have an operating time which is proportional to the battery capacity, the number of operations performed per cycle and the amount of exchanged data. Since the transmission of data to a central cloud represents a very energy-hungry operation, new computational paradigms have been implemented. The computation is not completely performed in the cloud, distributing the power load among the nodes of the system, and data are compressed to reduce the transmitted power requirements. In the edge-computing paradigm, part of the computational power is moved toward data collection sources, and, only after a first elaboration, collected data are sent to the central cloud server. Indeed, the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; term refers to the extremities of systems represented by IoT devices. This survey paper presents the hardware architectures of typical IoT devices and sums up many of the low power techniques which make them appealing for a large scale of applications. An overview of the newest research topics is discussed, besides a final example of a complete functioning system, embedding all the introduced features.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - VANET (vehicular ad hoc network) has a main objective to improve driver safety and traffic efficiency. The intermittent exchange of real-time safety message delivery in VANET has become an urgent concern due to DoS (denial of service) and smart and normal intrusions (SNI) attacks. The intermittent communication of VANET generates huge amount of data which requires typical storage and intelligence infrastructure. Fog computing (FC) plays an important role in storage, computation, and communication needs. In this research, fog computing (FC) integrates with hybrid optimization algorithms (OAs) including the Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), firefly algorithm (FA), firefly neural network, and the key distribution establishment (KDE) for authenticating both the network level and the node level against all attacks for trustworthiness in VANET. The proposed scheme is termed &ldquo;Secure Intelligent Vehicular Network using fog computing&rdquo; (SIVNFC). A feedforward back propagation neural network (FFBP-NN), also termed the firefly neural, is used as a classifier to distinguish between the attacking vehicles and genuine vehicles. The SIVNFC scheme is compared with the Cuckoo, the FA, and the firefly neural network to evaluate the quality of services (QoS) parameters such as jitter and throughput.

AB  - With the advancement of new technologies, the number of connected devices, the amount of data generated, and the need to build an intelligently connected network of things to improve and enrich the human ecosystem open new doors to modifications and adaptations of current cellular network infrastructures. While more focus is given to low power wide area (LPWA) applications and devices, a significant challenge is the definition of Internet of Things (IoT) use cases and the value generation of applications on already existing IoT devices. Smartphones and related devices are currently manufactured with a wide range of smart sensors such as accelerometers, video sensors, compasses, gyros, proximity sensors, fingerprint sensors, temperature sensors, and biometric sensors used for various purposes. Many of these sensors can be automatically expanded to monitor a user&rsquo;s daily activities (e.g., fitness workouts), locations, movements, and real-time body temperatures. Mobile network operators (MNOs) play a substantial role in providing IoT communications platforms, as they manage traffic flow in the network. In this paper, we discuss the global concept of IoT and machine-type communication (MTC), and we conduct device performance analytics based on data traffic collected from a cellular network. The experiment equips service providers with a model and framework to monitor device performance in a network.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) provides a way to acquire detailed energy consumption and appliance operation status through a single sensor, which has been proven to save energy. Further, besides load disaggregation, advanced applications (e.g., demand response) need to recognize on/off events of appliances instantly. In order to shorten the time delay for users to acquire the event information, it is necessary to analyze extremely short period electrical signals. However, the features of those signals are easily submerged in complex background loads, especially in cross-user scenarios. Through experiments and observations, it can be found that the feature of background loads is almost stationary in a short time. On the basis of this result, this paper provides a novel model called the concatenate convolutional neural network to separate the feature of the target load from the load mixed with the background. For the cross-user test on the UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity dataset (UK-DALE), it turns out that the proposed model remarkably improves accuracy, robustness, and generalization of load recognition. In addition, it also provides significant improvements in energy disaggregation compared with the state-of-the-art.

AB  - As fifth-generation mobile communication systems give rise to new smart grid technologies, such as distributed energy resources, advanced communication systems, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics, the development of novel platforms and business models that ensure reliability and profitability of microgrid operations become increasingly important. In this study, we introduce an open micro energy grid platform to operate the widely distributed microgrids in Korea. Subsequently, we present commercial microgrid business models supported by the open micro energy grid platform equipped with an artificial intelligence engine and provide test results from testbeds connected to the platform. In contrast to the existing microgrid business models in the market, we propose a universal architecture and business model of the future microgrid, comprising (i) an energy robot-management operation business model, (ii) electric vehicle-based demand response, (iii) blockchain technology for energy trading, and (iv) a service-oriented business model. Finally, we propose a new business model for an intelligent virtual power plant (VPP) operator along with the architecture of the VPP and its proof of concept (PoC). We expect the proposed business model to provide energy solution providers with guidelines to develop various VPP services.

AB  - To achieve the full analytical potential of the streaming data from the internet of things, the interconnection of various data sources is needed. By definition, those sources are heterogeneous and their integration is not a trivial task. A common approach to exploit streaming sensor data potential is to use machine learning techniques for predictive analytics in a way that is agnostic to the domain knowledge. Such an approach can be easily integrated in various use cases. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data fusion of a set of heterogeneous data streams. The proposed framework enriches streaming sensor data with the contextual and historical information relevant for describing the underlying processes. The final result of the framework is a feature vector, ready to be used in a machine learning algorithm. The framework has been applied to a cloud and to an edge device. In the latter case, incremental learning capabilities have been demonstrated. The reported results illustrate a significant improvement of data-driven models, applied to sensor streams. Beside higher accuracy of the models the platform offers easy setup and thus fast prototyping capabilities in real-world applications.

AB  - Disaster events and their economic impacts are trending, and climate projection studies suggest that the risks of disaster will continue to increase in the near future. Despite the broad and increasing social effects of these events, the empirical basis of disaster research is often weak, partially due to the natural paucity of observed data. At the same time, some of the early research regarding social responses to disasters have become outdated as social, cultural, and political norms have changed. The digital revolution, the open data trend, and the advancements in data science provide new opportunities for social science disaster research. We introduce the term computational social science of disasters (CSSD), which can be formally defined as the systematic study of the social behavioral dynamics of disasters utilizing computational methods. In this paper, we discuss and showcase the opportunities and the challenges in this new approach to disaster research. Following a brief review of the fields that relate to CSSD, namely traditional social sciences of disasters, computational social science, and crisis informatics, we examine how advances in Internet technologies offer a new lens through which to study disasters. By identifying gaps in the literature, we show how this new field could address ways to advance our understanding of the social and behavioral aspects of disasters in a digitally connected world. In doing so, our goal is to bridge the gap between data science and the social sciences of disasters in rapidly changing environments.

AB  - New technologies have the potential to transform agriculture and to reduce environmental impact through a green revolution. Internet of Things (IoT)-based application development platforms have the potential to run farm management tools capable of monitoring real-time events when integrated into interactive innovation models for fertirrigation. Their capabilities must extend to flexible reconfiguration of programmed actions. IoT platforms require complex smart decision-making systems based on data-analysis and data mining of big data sets. In this paper, the advantages are demonstrated of a powerful tool that applies real-time decisions from data such as variable rate irrigation, and selected parameters from field and weather conditions. The field parameters, the index vegetation (estimated using aerial images), and the irrigation events, such as flow level, pressure level, and wind speed, are periodically sampled. Data is processed in a decision-making system based on learning prediction rules in conjunction with the Drools rule engine. The multimedia platform can be remotely controlled, and offers a smart farming open data network with shared restriction levels for information exchange oriented to farmers, the fertilizer provider, and agricultural technicians that should provide the farmer with added value in the form of better decision making or more efficient exploitation operations and management.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is the global network of interrelated physical devices such as sensors, actuators, smart applications, objects, computing devices, mechanical machines, and people that are becoming an essential part of the internet. In an industrial environment, these devices are the source of data which provide abundant information in manufacturing processes. Nevertheless, the massive, heterogeneous, and time-sensitive nature of the data brings substantial challenges to the real-time collection, processing, and decision making. Therefore, this paper presents a framework of an IoT-based Industrial Data Management System (IDMS) which can manage the huge industrial data, support online monitoring, and control smart manufacturing. The framework contains five basic layers such as physical, network, middleware, database, and application layers to provide a service-oriented architecture for the end users. Experimental results from a smart factory case study demonstrate that the framework can manage the regular data and urgent events generated from various factory devices in the distributed industrial environment through state-of-the-art communication protocols. The collected data is converted into useful information which improves productivity and the prognosis of production lines.

TI  - Design and Analysis of a Lightweight Context Fusion CNN Scheme for Crowd Counting

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Crowd counting, which is widely used in disaster management, traffic monitoring, and other fields of urban security, is a challenging task that is attracting increasing interest from researchers. For better accuracy, most methods have attempted to handle the scale variation explicitly. which results in huge scale changes of the object size. However, earlier methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have focused primarily on improving accuracy while ignoring the complexity of the model. This paper proposes a novel method based on a lightweight CNN-based network for estimating crowd counting and generating density maps under resource constraints. The network is composed of three components: a basic feature extractor (BFE), a stacked &agrave; trous convolution module (SACM), and a context fusion module (CFM). The BFE encodes basic feature information with reduced spatial resolution for further refining. Various pieces of contextual information are generated through a short pipeline in SACM. To generate a context fusion density map, CFM distills feature maps from the above components. The whole network is trained in an end-to-end fashion and uses a compression factor to restrict its size. Experiments on three highly-challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed method delivers attractive performance.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fire detection system requires accurate and fast mechanisms to make the right decision in a fire situation. Since most commercial fire detection systems use a simple sensor, their fire recognition accuracy is deficient because of the limitations of the detection capability of the sensor. Existing proposals, which use rule-based algorithms or image-based machine learning can hardly adapt to the changes in the environment because of their static features. Since the legacy fire detection systems and network services do not guarantee data transfer latency, the required need for promptness is unmet. In this paper, we propose a new fire detection system with a multifunctional artificial intelligence framework and a data transfer delay minimization mechanism for the safety of smart cities. The framework includes a set of multiple machine learning algorithms and an adaptive fuzzy algorithm. In addition, Direct-MQTT based on SDN is introduced to solve the traffic concentration problems of the traditional MQTT. We verify the performance of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and delay time and found a fire detection accuracy of over 95%. The end-to-end delay, which comprises the transfer and decision delays, is reduced by an average of 72%.

TI  - Forecasting Heating Consumption in Buildings: A Scalable Full-Stack Distributed Engine

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Predicting power demand of building heating systems is a challenging task due to the high variability of their energy profiles. Power demand is characterized by different heating cycles including sequences of various transient and steady-state phases. To effectively perform the predictive task by exploiting the huge amount of fine-grained energy-related data collected through Internet of Things (IoT) devices, innovative and scalable solutions should be devised. This paper presents PHi-CiB, a scalable full-stack distributed engine, addressing all tasks from energy-related data collection, to their integration, storage, analysis, and modeling. Heterogeneous data measurements (e.g., power consumption in buildings, meteorological conditions) are collected through multiple hardware (e.g., IoT devices) and software (e.g., web services) entities. Such data are integrated and analyzed to predict the average power demand of each building for different time horizons. First, the transient and steady-state phases characterizing the heating cycle of each building are automatically identified; then the power-level forecasting is performed for each phase. To this aim, PHi-CiB relies on a pipeline of three algorithms: the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average, the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, and the Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent. PHi-CiB&rsquo;s current implementation exploits Apache Spark and MongoDB and supports parallel and scalable processing and analytical tasks. Experimental results, performed on energy-related data collected in a real-world system show the effectiveness of PHi-CiB in predicting heating power consumption of buildings with a limited prediction error and an optimal horizontal scalability.

AB  - Air pollution has become a global environmental problem, because it has a great adverse impact on human health and the climate. One way to explore this problem is to monitor and predict air quality index in an economical way. Accurate monitoring and prediction of air quality index (AQI), e.g., PM2.5 concentration, is a challenging task. In order to accurately predict the PM2.5 time series, we propose a supplementary leaky integrator echo state network (SLI-ESN) in this paper. It adds the historical state term of the historical moment to the calculation of leaky integrator reservoir, which improves the influence of historical evolution state on the current state. Considering the redundancy and correlation between multivariable time series, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection method is introduced to reduce redundant and irrelevant information, and increase computation speed. A variety of evaluation indicators are used to assess the overall performance of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by the experiment of Beijing PM2.5 time series prediction. The comparison of learning time also shows the efficiency of the algorithm.

AB  - In a smart home linked to a smart grid (SG), demand-side management (DSM) has the potential to reduce electricity costs and carbon/chlorofluorocarbon emissions, which are associated with electricity used in today&rsquo;s modern society. To meet continuously increasing electrical energy demands requested from downstream sectors in an SG, energy management systems (EMS), developed with paradigms of artificial intelligence (AI) across Internet of things (IoT) and conducted in fields of interest, monitor, manage, and analyze industrial, commercial, and residential electrical appliances efficiently in response to demand response (DR) signals as DSM. Usually, a DSM service provided by utilities for consumers in an SG is based on cloud-centered data science analytics. However, such cloud-centered data science analytics service involved for DSM is mostly far away from on-site IoT end devices, such as DR switches/power meters/smart meters, which is usually unacceptable for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications in DSM. This implies that, for instance, IoT end devices deployed on-site for latency-sensitive user-centric IoT applications in DSM should be aware of immediately analytical, interpretable, and real-time actionable data insights processed on and identified by IoT end devices at IoT sources. Therefore, this work designs and implements a smart edge analytics-empowered power meter prototype considering advanced AI in DSM for smart homes. The prototype in this work works in a cloud analytics-assisted electrical EMS architecture, which is designed and implemented as edge analytics in the architecture described and developed toward a next-generation smart sensing infrastructure for smart homes. Two different types of AI deployed on-site on the prototype are conducted for DSM and compared in this work. The experimentation reported in this work shows the architecture described with the prototype in this work is feasible and workable.

AB  - The increasing development of urban centers brings serious challenges for traffic management. In this paper, we introduce a smart visual sensor, developed for a pilot project taking place in the Australian city of Liverpool (NSW). The project&rsquo;s aim was to design and evaluate an edge-computing device using computer vision and deep neural networks to track in real-time multi-modal transportation while ensuring citizens&rsquo; privacy. The performance of the sensor was evaluated on a town center dataset.

AB  - In order to obtain high-accuracy measurements, traditional air quality monitoring and prediction systems adopt high-accuracy sensors. However, high-accuracy sensors are accompanied with high cost, which cannot be widely promoted in Internet of Things (IoT) with many sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a low-cost air quality monitoring and real-time prediction system based on IoT and edge computing, which reduces IoT applications dependence on cloud computing. Raspberry Pi with computing power, as an edge device, runs the Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm, which improves the accuracy of low-cost sensors by 27% on the edge side. Based on the KF algorithm, our proposed system achieves the immediate prediction of the concentration of six air pollutants such as SO2, NO2 and PM2.5 by combining the observations with errors. In the comparison experiments with three common predicted algorithms including Simple Moving Average, Exponentially Weighted Moving Average and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, the KF algorithm can obtain the optimal prediction results, and root-mean-square error decreases by 68.3% on average. Taken together, the results of the study indicate that our proposed system, combining edge computing and IoT, can be promoted in smart agriculture.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the development of intelligent transportation system (ITS) and vehicle to X (V2X), the connected vehicle is capable of sensing a great deal of useful traffic information, such as queue length at intersections. Aiming to solve the problem of existing models&rsquo; complexity and information redundancy, this paper proposes a queue length sensing model based on V2X technology, which consists of two sub-models based on shockwave sensing and back propagation (BP) neural network sensing. First, the model obtains state information of the connected vehicles and analyzes the formation process of the queue, and then it calculates the velocity of the shockwave to predict the queue length of the subsequent unconnected vehicles. Then, the neural network is trained with historical connected vehicle data, and a sub-model based on the BP neural network is established to predict the real-time queue length. Finally, the final queue length at the intersection is determined by combining the sub-models by variable weight. Simulation results show that the sensing accuracy of the combined model is proportional to the penetration rate of connected vehicles, and sensing of queue length can be achieved even in low penetration rate environments. In mixed traffic environments of connected vehicles and unconnected vehicles, the queuing length sensing model proposed in this paper has higher performance than the probability distribution (PD) model when the penetration rate is low, and it has an almost equivalent performance with higher penetration rate while the penetration rate is not needed. The proposed sensing model is more applicable for mixed traffic scenarios with much looser conditions.

AB  - The Smart campus is a concept of an education institute using technologies, such as information systems, internet of things (IoT), and context-aware computing, to support learning, teaching, and administrative activities. Classrooms are important building blocks of a school campus. Therefore, a feasible architecture for building and running smart classrooms is essential for a smart campus. However, most studies related to the smart classroom are focused on studying or addressing particular technical or educational issues, such as networking, AI applications, lecture quality, and user responses to technology. In this study, an architecture for building and running context-aware smart classrooms is proposed. The proposed architecture consists of three parts including a prototype of a context-aware smart classroom, a model for technology integration, and supporting measures for the operation of smart classrooms in this architecture. The classroom prototype was designed based on our study results and a smart classroom project in Ming Chuan University (MCU). The integration model was a layered model uses Raspberry Pi in the bottom layer of the model to integrate underlying technologies and provide application interfaces to the higher layer applications for the ease of building context-aware smart classroom applications. As a result, application interfaces were implemented using Raspberry Pi based on the proposed technology integration model, and a context-aware energy-saving smart classroom application was implemented based on the proposed classroom prototype and the implemented web application interface. The result shows that, in terms of technology, the proposed architecture is feasible for building context-aware smart classrooms in smart campuses.

VL  - 19
IS  - 9
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Internet of Things-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are gaining significant attention in academic literature and industry, and are seen as a solution to enhancing road safety in smart cities. Due to the ever increasing number of vehicles, a significant rise in the number of road accidents has been observed. Vehicles embedded with a plethora of sensors enable us to not only monitor the current situation of the vehicle and its surroundings but also facilitates the detection of incidents. Significant research, for example, has been conducted on accident rescue, particularly on the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for efficient and prompt rescue operations. The majority of such works provide sophisticated solutions that focus on reducing response times. However, such solutions can be expensive and are not available in all types of vehicles. Given this, we present a novel Internet of Things-based accident detection and reporting system for a smart city environment. The proposed approach aims to take advantage of advanced specifications of smartphones to design and develop a low-cost solution for enhanced transportation systems that is deployable in legacy vehicles. In this context, a customized Android application is developed to gather information regarding speed, gravitational force, pressure, sound, and location. The speed is a factor that is used to help improve the identification of accidents. It arises because of clear differences in environmental conditions (e.g., noise, deceleration rate) that arise in low speed collisions, versus higher speed collisions). The information acquired is further processed to detect road incidents. Furthermore, a navigation system is also developed to report the incident to the nearest hospital. The proposed approach is validated through simulations and comparison with a real data set of road accidents acquired from Road Safety Open Repository, and shows promising results in terms of accuracy.

AB  - The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has recently become an emerging promising field of research due to the increasing number of vehicles each day. IoV is vehicle communications, which is also a part of the Internet of Things (IoT). Continuous topological changes of vehicular communications are a significant issue in IoV that can affect the change in network scalability, and the shortest routing path. Therefore, organizing efficient and reliable intercommunication routes between vehicular nodes, based on conditions of traffic density is an increasingly challenging issue. For such issues, clustering is one of the solutions, among other routing protocols, such as geocast, topology, and position-based routing. This paper focuses mainly on the scalability and the stability of the topology of IoV. In this study, a novel intelligent system-based algorithm is proposed (CACOIOV), which stabilizes topology by using a metaheuristic clustering algorithm based on the enhancement of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in two distinct stages for packet route optimization. Another algorithm, called mobility Dynamic Aware Transmission Range on Local traffic Density (DA-TRLD), is employed together with CACOIOV for the adaptation of transmission range regarding of density in local traffic. The results presented through NS-2 simulations show that the new protocol is superior to both Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing and (ACO) protocols based on evaluating routing performance in terms of throughput, packet delivery, and drop ratio, cluster numbers, and average end-to-end delay.

AB  - Drivers&rsquo; behaviors and decision making on the road directly affect the safety of themselves, other drivers, and pedestrians. However, as distinct entities, people cannot predict the motions of surrounding vehicles and they have difficulty in performing safe reactionary driving maneuvers in a short time period. To overcome the limitations of making an immediate prediction, in this work, we propose a two-stage data-driven approach: classifying driving patterns of on-road surrounding vehicles using the Gaussian mixture models (GMM); and predicting vehicles&rsquo; short-term lateral motions (i.e., left/right turn and left/right lane change) based on real-world vehicle mobility data, provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation, with different ensemble decision trees. We considered several important kinetic features and higher order kinematic variables. The research results of our proposed approach demonstrate the effectiveness of pattern classification and on-road lateral motion prediction. This methodology framework has the potential to be incorporated into current data-driven collision warning systems, to enable more practical on-road preprocessing in intelligent vehicles, and to be applied in autopilot-driving scenarios.

AB  - The exact location of objects, such as infrastructure, is crucial to the systematic understanding of the built environment. The emergence and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) have attracted growing attention to the low-cost location scheme, which can respond to a dramatic increasing amount of public infrastructure in smart cities. Various Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)-based locating systems and noise mitigation methods have been developed. However, most of them are impractical for built environments in large areas due to their high cost, computational complexity, and low noise detection capability. In this paper, we proposed a novel noise mitigation solution integrating the low-cost localization scheme with one mobile RFID reader. We designed a filter algorithm to remove the influence of abnormal data. Inspired the sampling concept, a more carefully parameters calibration was carried out for noise data sampling to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. To achieve robust noise detection results, we employed the powerful noise detection capability of the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method for the localization and noise mitigation in a large area. The proposed scheme has potential applications for location-based services in smart cities.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications has taken the attention of several researchers. In an effort to provide interoperability and IPv6 support for the IoT devices, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed the 6LoWPAN stack. However, the particularities and hardware limitations of networks associated with IoT devices lead to several challenges, mainly for routing protocols. On its stack proposal, IETF standardizes the RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) as the routing protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). RPL is a tree-based proactive routing protocol that creates acyclic graphs among the nodes to allow data exchange. Although widely considered and used by current applications, different recent studies have shown its limitations and drawbacks. Among these, it is possible to highlight the weak support of mobility and P2P traffic, restrictions for multicast transmissions, and lousy adaption for dynamic throughput. Motivated by the presented issues, several new solutions have emerged during recent years. The approaches range from the consideration of different routing metrics to an entirely new solution inspired by other routing protocols. In this context, this work aims to present an extensive survey study about routing solutions for IoT/LLN, not limited to RPL enhancements. In the course of the paper, the routing requirements of LLNs, the initial protocols, and the most recent approaches are presented. The IoT routing enhancements are divided according to its main objectives and then studied individually to point out its most important strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, as the main contribution, this study presents a comprehensive discussion about the considered approaches, identifying the still remaining open issues and suggesting future directions to be recognized by new proposals.

AB  - Urban ecosystem services (UES) is an essential approach to the development of sustainable cities and must be incorporated into urban planning to be able to improve humans&rsquo; life quality. This paper aimed to identify remote sensing (RS) data/techniques used in the literature in five years (2013&ndash;2017) for UES investigation and to analyze the similarity between them. For this purpose, we used the Scopus database of scientific journals, and a set of appropriate filters were applied. A total of 44 studies were selected, being 93.18% of them located in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in Europe. The most common dataset used was the secondary data, followed by the Landsat family products. Land use and land cover (LULC) was the most common approach utilized, succeeded by radiometric indexes and band related. All four main classes (provision, regulation, supporting, and cultural) of ecosystem services (ES) were identified in the reviewed papers, wherein regulating services were the most popular modality mentioned. Seven different groups were established as having 100% of similarity between methods and ES results. Therefore, RS is identified in the literature as an important technique to reach this goal. However, we highlight the lack of studies in the southern hemisphere.

AB  - A variety of applications and forwarding protocols have been proposed for opportunistic networks (OppNets) in the literature. However, the methodology of evaluation, testing and comparing these forwarding protocols are not standardized yet, which leads to large levels of ambiguity in performance evaluation studies. Performance results depend largely on the evaluation environment, and on the used parameters and models. More comparability in evaluation scenarios and methodologies would largely improve also the availability of protocols and the repeatability of studies, and thus would accelerate the development of this research topic. In this survey paper, we focus our attention on how various OppNets data forwarding protocols are evaluated rather than what they actually achieve. We explore the models, parameters and the evaluation environments and make observations about their scalability, realism and comparability. Finally, we deduce some best practices on how to achieve the largest impact of future evaluation studies of OppNets data dissemination/forwarding protocols.

AB  - In a real interactive service system, a smart meter can only read the total amount of energy consumption rather than analyze the internal load components for users. Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM), as a vital part of smart power utilization techniques, can provide load disaggregation information, which can be further used for optimal energy use. In our paper, we introduce a new method called linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) for NILM and combine two promising features: current signals and real power measurements. The proposed method relaxes the independent assumption and avoids the label bias problem. Case studies on two open datasets showed that the proposed method can efficiently identify multistate appliances and detect appliances that are not easily identified by other models.

AB  - Road transportation is the backbone of modern economies, albeit it annually costs     1.25     million deaths and trillions of dollars to the global economy, and damages public health and the environment. Deep learning is among the leading-edge methods used for transportation-related predictions, however, the existing works are in their infancy, and fall short in multiple respects, including the use of datasets with limited sizes and scopes, and insufficient depth of the deep learning studies. This paper provides a novel and comprehensive approach toward large-scale, faster, and real-time traffic prediction by bringing four complementary cutting-edge technologies together: big data, deep learning, in-memory computing, and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We trained deep networks using over 11 years of data provided by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the largest dataset that has been used in deep learning studies. Several combinations of the input attributes of the data along with various network configurations of the deep learning models were investigated for training and prediction purposes. The use of the pre-trained model for real-time prediction was explored. The paper contributes novel deep learning models, algorithms, implementation, analytics methodology, and software tool for smart cities, big data, high performance computing, and their convergence.

AB  - Sensor technology provides the real-time monitoring of data in several scenarios that contribute to the improved security of life and property. Crowd condition monitoring is an area that has benefited from this. The basic context-aware framework (BCF) uses activity recognition based on emerging intelligent technology and is among the best that has been proposed for this purpose. However, accuracy is low, and the false negative rate (FNR) remains high. Thus, the need for an enhanced framework that offers reduced FNR and higher accuracy becomes necessary. This article reports our work on the development of an enhanced context-aware framework (EHCAF) using smartphone participatory sensing for crowd monitoring, dimensionality reduction of statistical-based time-frequency domain (SBTFD) features, and enhanced individual behavior estimation (IBEenhcaf). The experimental results achieved 99.1% accuracy and an FNR of 2.8%, showing a clear improvement over the 92.0% accuracy, and an FNR of 31.3% of the BCF.

AB  - Rapid transit systems or metros are a popular choice for high-capacity public transport in urban areas due to several advantages including safety, dependability, speed, cost, and lower risk of accidents. Existing studies on metros have not considered appropriate holistic urban transport models and integrated use of cutting-edge technologies. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach toward large-scale and faster prediction of metro system characteristics by employing the integration of four leading-edge technologies: big data, deep learning, in-memory computing, and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Using London Metro as a case study, and the Rolling Origin and Destination Survey (RODS) (real) dataset, we predict the number of passengers for six time intervals (a) using various access transport modes to reach the train stations (buses, walking, etc.); (b) using various egress modes to travel from the metro station to their next points of interest (PoIs); (c) traveling between different origin-destination (OD) pairs of stations; and (d) against the distance between the OD stations. The prediction allows better spatiotemporal planning of the whole urban transport system, including the metro subsystem, and its various access and egress modes. The paper contributes novel deep learning models, algorithms, implementation, analytics methodology, and software tool for analysis of metro systems.

AB  - The constantly increasing amount and availability of urban data derived from varying sources leads to an assortment of challenges that include, among others, the consolidation, visualization, and maximal exploitation prospects of the aforementioned data. A preeminent problem affecting urban planning is the appropriate choice of location to host a particular activity (either commercial or common welfare service) or the correct use of an existing building or empty space. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these challenges availed with machine learning techniques. The proposed system combines, fuses, and merges various types of data from different sources, encodes them using a novel semantic model that can capture and utilize both low-level geometric information and higher level semantic information and subsequently feeds them to the random forests classifier, as well as other supervised machine learning models for comparisons. Our experimental evaluation on multiple real-world data sets comparing the performance of several classifiers (including Feedforward Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Bag of Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Na&iuml;ve Bayes), indicated the superiority of Random Forests in terms of the examined performance metrics (Accuracy, Specificity, Precision, Recall, F-measure and G-mean).

AB  - This research aims to identify spatial and time patterns of theft in Manhattan, NY, to reveal urban factors that contribute to thefts from motor vehicles and to build a prediction model for thefts. Methods include time series and hot spot analysis, linear regression, elastic-net, Support vector machines SVM with radial and linear kernels, decision tree, bagged CART, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosting. Machine learning methods reveal that linear models perform better on our data (linear regression, elastic-net), specifying that a higher number of subway entrances, graffiti, and restaurants on streets contribute to higher theft rates from motor vehicles. Although the prediction model for thefts meets almost all assumptions (five of six), its accuracy is 77%, suggesting that there are other undiscovered factors making a contribution to the generation of thefts. As an output demonstrating final results, the application prototype for searching safer parking in Manhattan, NY based on the prediction model, has been developed.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 10
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The article proposes the concept of modeling that uses multi-agent systems of mutual interactions between city residents as well as interactions between residents and spatial objects. Adopting this perspective means treating residents, as well as buildings or other spatial objects, as distinct agents that exchange multifaceted packages of information in a dynamic and non-linear way. The exchanged information may be reinforced or diminished during the process, which may result in changing the social activity of the residents. Utilizing Latour&rsquo;s actor&ndash;network theory, the authors developed a model for studying the relationship between demographic and social factors, and the diversified spatial arrangement and the structure of a city. This concept was used to model the level of residents&rsquo; trust spatiotemporally and, indirectly, to study the level of social (geo)participation in a smart city. The devised system, whose test implementation as an agent-based system was done in the GAMA: agent-based, spatially explicit, modeling and simulation platform, was tested on both model and real data. The results obtained for the model city and the capital of Poland, Warsaw, indicate the significant and interdisciplinary analytical and scientific potential of the authorial methodology in the domain of geospatial science, geospatial data models with multi-agent systems, spatial planning, and applied social sciences.

AB  - In this paper, we present a WiFi-based intrusion detection system called Wi-Alarm. Motivated by our observations and analysis that raw channel state information (CSI) of WiFi is sensitive enough to monitor human motion, Wi-Alarm omits data preprocessing. The mean and variance of the amplitudes of raw CSI data are used for feature extraction. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is applied to determine detection results. We prototype Wi-Alarm on commercial WiFi devices and evaluate it in a typical indoor scenario. Results show that Wi-Alarm reduces much computational expense without losing accuracy and robustness. Moreover, different influence factors are also discussed in this paper.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is a remarkable data producer and these data may be used to prevent or detect security vulnerabilities and increase productivity by the adoption of statistical and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. However, these desirable benefits are gained if data from IoT networks are dependable&mdash;this is where blockchain comes into play. In fact, through blockchain, critical IoT data may be trusted, i.e., considered valid for any subsequent processing. A simple formal model named &ldquo;the Mirror Model&rdquo; is proposed to connect IoT data organized in traditional models to assets of trust in a blockchain. The Mirror Model sets some formal conditions to produce trusted data that remain trusted over time. A possible practical implementation of an application programming interface (API) is proposed, which keeps the data and the trust model in synch. Finally, it is noted that the Mirror Model enforces a top-down approach from reality to implementation instead of going the opposite way as it is now the practice when referring to blockchain and the IoT.

T2  - Processes

PY  - 2019
VL  - 7
IS  - 5
SN  - 2227-9717

AB  - An accurate forecast of the electricity consumption is particularly important to both consumers and system operators. The purpose of this study is to develop a forecasting method that provides such an accurate forecast of the month-ahead hourly electricity consumption in the case of medium industrial consumers, therefore assuring an intelligent energy management and an efficient economic scheduling of their resources, having the possibility to negotiate in advance appropriate billing tariffs relying on accurate hourly forecasts, in the same time facilitating an optimal energy management for the dispatch operator. The forecasting method consists of developing first non-linear autoregressive, with exogenous inputs (NARX) artificial neural networks (ANNs) in order to forecast an initial daily electricity consumption, a forecast that is being further processed with custom developed long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with exogenous variables support in order to refine the daily forecast as to achieve an accurate hourly forecasted consumed electricity for the whole month-ahead. The obtained experimental results (highlighted also through a very good value of 0.0244 for the root mean square error performance metric, obtained when forecasting the month-ahead hourly electricity consumption and comparing it with the real consumption), the validation of the developed forecasting method, the comparison of the method with other forecasting approaches from the scientific literature substantiate the fact that the proposed approach manages to fill a gap in the current body of knowledge consisting of the need of a high-accuracy forecasting method for the month-ahead hourly electricity consumption in the case of medium industrial consumers. The developed forecasting method targets medium industrial consumers, but, due to its accuracy, it can also be a useful tool for promoting innovative business models with regard to industrial consumers willing to produce a part of their own electricity using renewable energy resources, benefiting from reduced production costs and reliable electricity prices.

TI  - The Sciences Underlying Smart Sustainable Urbanism: Unprecedented Paradigmatic and Scholarly Shifts in Light of Big Data Science and Analytics

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - As a new area of science and technology (S&amp;T), big data science and analytics embodies an unprecedentedly transformative power‚Äîwhich is manifested not only in the form of revolutionizing science and transforming knowledge, but also in advancing social practices, catalyzing major shifts, and fostering societal transitions. Of particular relevance, it is instigating a massive change in the way both smart cities and sustainable cities are understood, studied, planned, operated, and managed to improve and maintain sustainability in the face of expanding urbanization. This relates to what has been dubbed data-driven smart sustainable urbanism, an emerging approach that is based on a computational understanding of city systems that reduces urban life to logical and algorithmic rules and procedures, as well as employs a new scientific method based on data-intensive science, while also harnessing urban big data to provide a more holistic and integrated view and synoptic intelligence of the city. This paper examines the unprecedented paradigmatic and scholarly shifts that the sciences underlying smart sustainable urbanism are undergoing in light of big data science and analytics and the underlying enabling technologies, as well as discusses how these shifts intertwine with and affect one another in the context of sustainability. I argue that data-intensive science, as a new epistemological shift, is fundamentally changing the scientific and practical foundations of urban sustainability. In specific terms, the new urban science‚Äîas underpinned by sustainability science and urban sustainability‚Äîis increasingly making cities more sustainable, resilient, efficient, and livable by rendering them more measurable, knowable, and tractable in terms of their operational functioning, management, planning, design, and development.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Canary Islands are a well known tourist destination with generally stable and clement weather conditions. However, occasionally extreme weather conditions occur, which although very unusual, may cause severe damage to the local economy. The ViMetRi-MAC EU funded project has among its goals, managing climate-change-associated risks. The Spanish National Meteorology Agency (AEMET) has a network of weather stations across the eight Canary Islands. Using data from those stations, we propose a novel methodology for the prediction of maximum wind speed in order to trigger an early alert for extreme weather conditions. The methodology proposed has the added value of using an innovative kind of machine learning that is based on the data stream mining paradigm. This type of machine learning system relies on two important features: models are learned incrementally and adaptively. That means the learner tunes the models gradually and endlessly as new observations are received and also modifies it when there is concept drift (statistical instability), in the modeled phenomenon. The results presented seem to prove that this data stream mining approach is a good fit for this kind of problem, clearly improving the results obtained with the accumulative non-adaptive version of the methodology.

TI  - SmartFire: Intelligent Platform for Monitoring Fire Extinguishers and Their Building Environment
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 10
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to fire protection regulations, a minimum number of fire extinguishers must be available depending on the surface area of each building, industrial establishment or workplace. There is also a set of rules that establish where the fire extinguisher should be placed: always close to the points that are most likely to be affected by a fire and where they are visible and accessible for use. Fire extinguishers are pressure devices, which means that they require maintenance operations that ensure they will function properly in the case of a fire. The purpose of manual and periodic fire extinguisher checks is to verify that their labeling, installation and condition comply with the standards. Security seals, inscriptions, hose and other seals are thoroughly checked. The state of charge (weight and pressure) of the extinguisher, the bottle of propellant gas (if available), and the state of all mechanical parts (nozzle, valves, hose, etc.) are also checked. To ensure greater safety and reduce the economic costs associated with maintaining fire extinguishers, it is necessary to develop a system that allows monitoring of their status. One of the advantages of monitoring fire extinguishers is that it will be possible to understand what external factors affect them (for example, temperature or humidity) and how they do so. For this reason, this article presents a system of soft agents that monitors the state of the extinguishers, collects a history of the state of the extinguisher and environmental factors and sends notifications if any parameter is not within the range of normal values.The results rendered by the SmartFire prototype indicate that its accuracy in calculating pressure changes is equivalent to that of a specific data acquisition system (DAS). The comparative study of the two curves (SmartFire and DAS) shows that the average error between the two curves is negligible: 8% in low pressure measurements (up to 3 bar) and 0.3% in high pressure (above 3 bar).

SN  - 1999-4907

AB  - In this paper, we provide an overview of positioning systems for moving resources in forest and fire management and review the related literature. Emphasis is placed on the accuracy and range of different localization and location-sharing methods, particularly in forested environments and in the absence of conventional cellular or internet connectivity. We then conduct a second review of literature and concepts related to several emerging, broad themes in data science, including the terms location-based services (LBS), geofences, wearable technology, activity recognition, mesh networking, the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data. Our objective in this second review is to inform how these broader concepts, with implications for networking and analytics, may help to advance natural resource management and science in the future. Based on methods, themes, and concepts that arose in our systematic reviews, we then augmented the paper with additional literature from wildlife and fisheries management, as well as concepts from video object detection, relative positioning, and inventory-tracking that are also used as forms of localization. Based on our reviews of positioning technologies and emerging data science themes, we present a hierarchical model for collecting and sharing data in forest and fire management, and more broadly in the field of natural resources. The model reflects tradeoffs in range and bandwidth when recording, processing, and communicating large quantities of data in time and space to support resource management, science, and public safety in remote areas. In the hierarchical approach, wearable devices and other sensors typically transmit data at short distances using Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), or ANT wireless, and smartphones and tablets serve as intermediate data collection and processing hubs for information that can be subsequently transmitted using radio networking systems or satellite communication. Data with greater spatial and temporal complexity is typically processed incrementally at lower tiers, then fused and summarized at higher levels of incident command or resource management. Lastly, we outline several priority areas for future research to advance big data analytics in natural resources.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2019

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Over the past few years, the importance of video surveillance in securing national critical infrastructure has significantly increased, with applications including the detection of failures and anomalies. Accompanied by the proliferation of video is the increasing number of attacks against surveillance systems. Among the attacks, False Frame Injection (FFI) attacks that replay video frames from a previous recording to mask the live feed has the highest impact. While many attempts have been made to detect FFI frames using features from the video feeds, video analysis is computationally too intensive to be deployed on-site for real-time false frame detection. In this paper, we investigated the feasibility of FFI attacks on compromised surveillance systems at the edge and propose an effective technique to detect the injected false video and audio frames by monitoring the surveillance feed using the embedded Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) signals. An ENF operates at a nominal frequency of 60 Hz/50 Hz based on its geographical location and maintains a stable value across the entire power grid interconnection with minor fluctuations. For surveillance system video/audio recordings connected to the power grid, the ENF signals are embedded. The time-varying nature of the ENF component was used as a forensic application for authenticating the surveillance feed. The paper highlights the ENF signal collection from a power grid creating a reference database and ENF extraction from the recordings using conventional short-time Fourier Transform and spectrum detection for robust ENF signal analysis in the presence of noise and interference caused in different harmonics. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of ENF signal detection and/or abnormalities for FFI attacks.

TI  - Predicting Station-Level Short-Term Passenger Flow in a Citywide Metro Network Using Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 6
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Predicting the passenger flow of metro networks is of great importance for traffic management and public safety. However, such predictions are very challenging, as passenger flow is affected by complex spatial dependencies (nearby and distant) and temporal dependencies (recent and periodic). In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning-based approach, named STGCNNmetro (spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural networks for metro), to collectively predict two types of passenger flow volumes&mdash;inflow and outflow&mdash;in each metro station of a city. Specifically, instead of representing metro stations by grids and employing conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, STGCNNmetro transforms the city metro network to a graph and makes predictions using graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). First, we apply stereogram graph convolution operations to seamlessly capture the irregular spatiotemporal dependencies along the metro network. Second, a deep structure composed of GCNNs is constructed to capture the distant spatiotemporal dependencies at the citywide level. Finally, we integrate three temporal patterns (recent, daily, and weekly) and fuse the spatiotemporal dependencies captured from these patterns to form the final prediction values. The STGCNNmetro model is an end-to-end framework which can accept raw passenger flow-volume data, automatically capture the effective features of the citywide metro network, and output predictions. We test this model by predicting the short-term passenger flow volume in the citywide metro network of Shanghai, China. Experiments show that the STGCNNmetro model outperforms seven well-known baseline models (LSVR, PCA-kNN, NMF-kNN, Bayesian, MLR, M-CNN, and LSTM). We additionally explore the sensitivity of the model to its parameters and discuss the distribution of prediction errors.

AB  - Smart city is an emerging initiative for integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in effective ways to support development of smart cities with enhanced quality of life for its citizens through safe and secure context-aware services. Major technical challenges to realize smart cities include resource use optimization, service delivery without interruption at all times in all aspects, minimization of costs, and reduction of resource consumption. To address these challenges, new techniques and technologies are required for modeling and processing the big data generated and used through the underlying Internet of Things (IoT). To this end, we propose a data-centric approach to IoT in conceptualizing the &ldquo;things&rdquo; from a service-oriented perspective and investigate efficient ways to identify, integrate, and manage big data. The data-centric approach is expected to better support efficient management of data with complexities inherent in IoT-generated big data. Furthermore, it supports efficient and scalable query processing and reasoning techniques required in development of smart city applications. This article redresses the literature and contributes to the foundations of smart cities applications.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Taxi demand can be divided into pick-up demand and drop-off demand, which are firmly related to human&rsquo;s travel habits. Accurately predicting taxi demand is of great significance to passengers, drivers, ride-hailing platforms and urban managers. Most of the existing studies only forecast the taxi demand for pick-up and separate the interaction between spatial correlation and temporal correlation. In this paper, we first analyze the historical data and select three highly relevant parts for each time interval, namely closeness, period and trend. We then construct a multi-task learning component and extract the common spatiotemporal feature by treating the taxi pick-up prediction task and drop-off prediction task as two related tasks. With the aim of fusing spatiotemporal features of historical data, we conduct feature embedding by attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) and capture the correlation between taxi pick-up and drop-off with 3D ResNet. Finally, we combine external factors to simultaneously predict the taxi demand for pick-up and drop-off in the next time interval. Experiments conducted on real datasets in Chengdu present the effectiveness of the proposed method and show better performance in comparison with state-of-the-art models.

VL  - 8
IS  - 6
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Delivering electronic health care (eHealth) services across multi-cloud providers to implement patient-centric care demands a trustworthy brokering architecture. Specifically, such an architecture should aggregate relevant medical information to allow informed decision-making. It should also ensure that this information is complete and authentic and that no one has tampered with it. Brokers deployed in eHealth services may fall short of meeting such criteria due to two key behaviors. The first involves violating international health-data protection laws by allowing user anonymity and limiting user access rights. Second, brokers claiming to provide trustworthy transactions between interested parties usually rely on user feedback, an approach vulnerable to manipulation by malicious users. This paper addresses these data security and trust challenges by proposing HealthyBroker, a novel, trust-building brokering architecture for multiple cloud environments. This architecture is designed specifically for patient-centric cloud eHealth services. It enables care-team members to complete eHealth transactions securely and access relevant patient data on a &ldquo;need-to-know&rdquo; basis in compliance with data-protection laws. HealthyBroker also protects against potential malicious behavior by assessing the trust relationship and tracking it using a neutral, tamper-proof, distributed blockchain ledger. Trust is assessed based on two strategies. First, all transactions and user feedback are tracked and audited in a distributed ledger for transparency. Second, only feedback coming from trustworthy parties is taken into consideration. HealthyBroker was tested in a simulated eHealth multi-cloud environment. The test produced better results than a benchmark algorithm in terms of data accuracy, service time, and the reliability of feedback received as measured by three malicious behavior models (na&iuml;ve, feedback isolated, and feedback collective). These results demonstrate that HealthyBroker can provide care teams with a trustworthy, transparent ecosystem that can facilitate information sharing and well-informed decisions for patient-centric care.

AB  - The Internet of Things is a rapidly growing paradigm for smart cities that provides a way of communication, identification, and sensing capabilities among physically distributed devices. With the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoTs), user dependence on smart systems and services, such as smart appliances, smartphone, security, and healthcare applications, has been increased. This demands secure authentication mechanisms to preserve the users&rsquo; privacy when interacting with smart devices. This paper proposes a heterogeneous framework &ldquo;ADLAuth&rdquo; for passive and implicit authentication of the user using either a smartphone&rsquo;s built-in sensor or wearable sensors by analyzing the physical activity patterns of the users. Multiclass machine learning algorithms are applied to users&rsquo; identity verification. Analyses are performed on three different datasets of heterogeneous sensors for a diverse number of activities. A series of experiments have been performed to test the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the better performance of the proposed scheme compared to existing work for user authentication.

AB  - To support the rapid growth of demand in passengers and freight, separating trucks and passenger-cars is a potential solution to improve traffic efficiency and safety. The primary purpose of this paper is to comprehensively assess the multilane separate freeway at Huludao Toll Station in Liaoning Province, China. Based on the configuration and segmentation of the freeway near a toll station, a six-step guidance strategy is designed to adapt to the separate organization mode. Five conventional traffic scenarios are designed in the Vissim platform for comparative analysis between different guidance strategies. To investigate the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) environment, a microscopic testbed is established with cooperative car-following and lane-changing models using the MATLAB platform. The numerical simulation results show that the guidance strategy significantly improves efficiency and safety, and also reduces emissions and fuel consumption. Meanwhile, pre-guidance before toll channels outperforms the scenario only applied with guidance measures after toll plaza. Compared to conventional conditions, the assessment of pollutant emissions and fuel consumption also embodies the superiority of the other five scenarios, especially in the sections of toll plaza and channels with the lowest efficiency and safety level. Generally, all indexes indicate that the cooperative V2I technology is the best alternative for multilane separate freeways.

AB  - The 5G network is a next-generation wireless form of communication and the latest mobile technology. In practice, 5G utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) to work in high-traffic networks with multiple nodes/sensors in an attempt to transmit their packets to a destination simultaneously, which is a characteristic of IoT applications. Due to this, 5G offers vast bandwidth, low delay, and extremely high data transfer speed. Thus, 5G presents opportunities and motivations for utilizing next-generation protocols, especially the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP). However, the congestion control mechanisms of the conventional SCTP negatively influence overall performance. Moreover, existing mechanisms contribute to reduce 5G and IoT performance. Thus, a new machine learning model based on a decision tree (DT) algorithm is proposed in this study to predict optimal enhancement of congestion control in the wireless sensors of 5G IoT networks. The model was implemented on a training dataset to determine the optimal parametric setting in a 5G environment. The dataset was used to train the machine learning model and enable the prediction of optimal alternatives that can enhance the performance of the congestion control approach. The DT approach can be used for other functions, especially prediction and classification. DT algorithms provide graphs that can be used by any user to understand the prediction approach. The DT C4.5 provided promising results, with more than 92% precision and recall.

AB  - Buildings play a critical role in the stability and resilience of modern smart grids, leading to a refocusing of large-scale energy-management strategies from the supply side to the consumer side. When buildings integrate local renewable-energy generation in the form of renewable-energy resources, they become prosumers, and this adds more complexity to the operation of interconnected complex energy systems. A class of methods of modelling the energy-consumption patterns of the building have recently emerged as black-box input&ndash;output approaches with the ability to capture underlying consumption trends. These make use and require large quantities of quality data produced by nondeterministic processes underlying energy consumption. We present an application of a class of neural networks, namely, deep-learning techniques for time-series sequence modelling, with the goal of accurate and reliable building energy-load forecasting. Recurrent Neural Network implementation uses Long Short-Term Memory layers in increasing density of nodes to quantify prediction accuracy. The case study is illustrated on four university buildings from temperate climates over one year of operation using a reference benchmarking dataset that allows replicable results. The obtained results are discussed in terms of accuracy metrics and computational and network architecture aspects, and are considered suitable for further use in future in situ energy management at the building and neighborhood levels.

AB  - The information contained within Call Details records (CDRs) of mobile networks can be used to study the operational efficacy of cellular networks and behavioural pattern of mobile subscribers. In this study, we extract actionable insights from the CDR data and show that there exists a strong spatiotemporal predictability in real network traffic patterns. This knowledge can be leveraged by the mobile operators for effective network planning such as resource management and optimization. Motivated by this, we perform the spatiotemporal analysis of CDR data publicly available from Telecom Italia. Thus, on the basis of spatiotemporal insights, we propose a framework for mobile traffic classification. Experimental results show that the proposed model based on machine learning technique is able to accurately model and classify the network traffic patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of such insights for resource optimisation.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The smart district heating system (SDHS) is an important element of the construction of smart cities in Northern China; it plays a significant role in meeting heating requirements and green energy saving in winter. Various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and wireless transmission technologies are applied to monitor data in real-time and to form a historical database. The accurate prediction of heating loads based on massive historical datasets is the necessary condition and key basis for formulating an optimal heating control strategy in the SDHS, which contributes to the reduction in the consumption of energy and the improvement in the energy dispatching efficiency and accuracy. In order to achieve the high prediction accuracy of SDHS and to improve the representation ability of multi-time-scale features, a novel short-term heating load prediction algorithm based on a feature fusion long short-term memory (LSTM) model (FFLSTM) is proposed. Three characteristics, namely proximity, periodicity, and trend, are found after analyzing the heating load data from the aspect of the hourly time dimension. In order to comprehensively utilize the data&rsquo;s intrinsic characteristics, three LSTM models are employed to make separate predictions, and, then, the prediction results based on internal features and other external features at the corresponding moments are imported into the high-level LSTM model for fusion processing, which brings a more accurate prediction result of the heating load. Detailed comparisons between the proposed FFLSTM algorithm and the-state-of-art algorithms are conducted in this paper. The experimental results show that the proposed FFLSTM algorithm outperforms others and can obtain a higher prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the impact of selecting different parameters of the FFLSTM model is also studied thoroughly.

AB  - Vehicular networks play a key role in building intelligent transport systems for smart cities. For the purpose of achieving traffic efficiency, road safety, and traveler comfort, vehicles communicate and collaborate with each other as well as with the fixed infrastructure. In practice, not all vehicles are trustworthy. A faulty or malicious vehicle may forward or share inaccurate or bogus information, which may cause adverse things, such as, road accidents and traffic congestion. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate risk before a vehicle takes any decision. Various risk-based decision systems have already been proposed in the literature. The fuzzy risk-based decision model of vehicular networks is one of them. In this paper, we have proposed various extensions in the fuzzy risk-based decision model to achieve higher robustness, reliability, and completeness. We have presented the theoretical and simulation-based analysis and evaluation of the proposed scheme in a comprehensive manner. In addition, we have analytically cross verified the theoretical and simulation-based results. Qualitative comparison of the proposed scheme has also been presented in this work.

AB  - Wireless cellular networks are emerging to take a strong stand in attempts to achieve pervasive large scale obtainment, communication, and processing with the evolution of the fifth generation (5G) network. Both the present day cellular technologies and the evolving new age 5G are considered to be advantageous for the smart grid. The 5G networks exhibit relevant services for critical and timely applications for greater aspects in the smart grid. In the present day electricity markets, 5G provides new business models to the energy providers and improves the way the utility communicates with the grid systems. In this work, a complete analysis and a review of the 5G network and its vision regarding the smart grid is exhibited. The work discusses the present day wireless technologies, and the architectural changes for the past years are shown. Furthermore, to understand the user-based analyses in a smart grid, a detailed analysis of 5G architecture with the grid perspectives is exhibited. The current status of 5G networks in a smart grid with a different analysis for energy efficiency is vividly explained in this work. Furthermore, focus is emphasized on future reliable smart grid communication with future roadmaps and challenges to be faced.

VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Audio event detection (AED) is a task of recognizing the types of audio events in an audio stream and estimating their temporal positions. AED is typically based on fully supervised approaches, requiring strong labels including both the presence and temporal position of each audio event. However, fully supervised datasets are not easily available due to the heavy cost of human annotation. Recently, weakly supervised approaches for AED have been proposed, utilizing large scale datasets with weak labels including only the occurrence of events in recordings. In this work, we introduce a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model called DSNet based on densely connected convolution networks (DenseNets) and squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) for weakly supervised training of AED. DSNet alleviates the vanishing-gradient problem and strengthens feature propagation and models interdependencies between channels. We also propose a structured prediction method for weakly supervised AED. We apply a recurrent neural network (RNN) based framework and a prediction smoothness cost function to consider long-term contextual information with reduced error propagation. In post-processing, conditional random fields (CRFs) are applied to take into account the dependency between segments and delineate the borders of audio events precisely. We evaluated our proposed models on the DCASE 2017 task 4 dataset and obtained state-of-the-art results on both audio tagging and event detection tasks.

The data were collected from before and after 2016, and since the amount of data has been growing rapidly after global agreements such as the United Nations&rsquo; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, we attempted to focus on adjacent years of publication. In order to understand the flow of research, we conducted a central analysis, which is widely used in quantitative research relating to social network analysis, and performed cluster analysis to identify relationships with related research. The results of the analysis are represented in the form of network maps, and the role of each keyword was clarified based on these network maps. In addition, the overall flow explained the change of flow through discarded and emerging keywords, and the relationships with related fields were explained through cluster analysis. The findings could serve as a basis for policymakers, urban managers, and researchers seeking a comprehensive understanding of the smart city concept in urban planning areas.

AB  - Recently, new mobile applications and services have appeared thanks to the rapid development of mobile devices and mobile network technology. Cloud computing has played an important role over the past decades, providing powerful computing capabilities and high-capacity storage space to efficiently deliver these mobile services to mobile users. Nevertheless, existing cloud computing delegates computing to a cloud server located at a relatively long distance, resulting in significant delays due to additional time to return processing results from a cloud server. These unnecessary delays are inconvenient for mobile users because they are not suitable for applications that require a real-time service environment. To cope with these problems, a new computing concept called Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged. Instead of sending all requests to the central cloud to handle mobile users&rsquo; requests, the MEC brings computing power and storage resources to the edge of the mobile network. It enables the mobile user device to run the real-time applications that are sensitive to latency to meet the strict requirements. However, there is a lack of research on the efficient utilization of computing resources and mobility support when mobile users move in the MEC environment. In this paper, we propose the MEC-based mobility management scheme that arranges MEC server (MECS) as the concept of Zone so that mobile users can continue to receive content and use server resources efficiently even when they move. The results show that the proposed scheme reduce the average service delay compared to the existing MEC scheme. In addition, the proposed scheme outperforms the existing MEC scheme because mobile users can continuously receive services, even when they move frequently.

AB  - Technologies, such as smart sensors, actuators, and other kinds of devices, are often installed in our environments (e.g., our Homes) and available to integrate our daily lives. Despite their installation being motivated by the pursuit of automation and increased efficiency, making these environments usable, acceptable and enjoyable in a sustainable, energy efficient way is not only a matter of automation. Tackling these goals is a complex task demanding the combination of different perspectives including building and urban Architecture, Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to provide occupants with the means to shape these environments to their needs. Interaction is of paramount relevance in the creation of adequate relations of users with their environments, but it cannot be seen independently from the ubiquitous sensing and computing or the environment&rsquo;s architecture. In this regard, there are several challenges to HCI, particularly in how to integrate this multidisciplinary effort. Although there are several solutions to address some of these challenges, the complexity and dynamic nature of the smart environments and the diversity of technologies involved still present many challenges, particularly for its development. In general, the development is complex, and it is hard to create a dynamic environment providing versatile and adaptive forms of interaction. To participate in the multidisciplinary effort, the development of interaction must be supported by tools capable of facilitating co-design by multidisciplinary teams. In this article, we address the development of interaction for complex smart environments and propose the AM4I architecture and framework, a novel modular approach to design and develop adaptive multiplatform multilingual multi-device multimodal interactive systems. The potential of the framework is demonstrated by proof-of-concept applications in two different smart environment contexts, non-residential buildings and smart homes.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) using deep neural networks has become a hot topic in human&ndash;computer interaction. Machines can effectively identify human naturalistic activities by learning from a large collection of sensor data. Activity recognition is not only an interesting research problem but also has many real-world practical applications. Based on the success of residual networks in achieving a high level of aesthetic representation of automatic learning, we propose a novel asymmetric residual network, named ARN. ARN is implemented using two identical path frameworks consisting of (1) a short time window, which is used to capture spatial features, and (2) a long time window, which is used to capture fine temporal features. The long time window path can be made very lightweight by reducing its channel capacity, while still being able to learn useful temporal representations for activity recognition. In this paper, we mainly focus on proposing a new model to improve the accuracy of HAR. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ARN model, we carried out extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (i.e., OPPORTUNITY, UniMiB-SHAR) and compared the results with some conventional and state-of-the-art learning-based methods. We discuss the influence of networks parameters on performance to provide insights about its optimization. Results from our experiments show that ARN is effective in recognizing human activities via wearable datasets.

AB  - A new mobility ethos is needed for cities looking to overcome the problems that have been accumulated for decades by a transport paradigm that prioritises automobiles over people. Bike-sharing, a measure promoting voluntary travel behaviour change, could be part of a refined toolbox that will help in forging this new ethos. Despite a rapid emergence during the last handful of years, as evidenced by 1956 operational local schemes and approximately 15,254,400 self-service public use bicycles across the world, bike-sharing has been attracting negative attention lately. Tens of schemes have closed down, deemed as financial or operational failures, stigmatising bike-sharing‚Äôs brand and putting the future of the concept itself in jeopardy. However, discounting bike-sharing as flawed may not be fair or accurate. This paper identifies a formula of success for bike-sharing operations based on a state-of-the-art case study analysis, which is supported by primary data evidence from two survey-based studies in Sweden and Greece. This paper suggests that residents in cities hosting or looking to host bike-sharing schemes are usually very supportive of them but not always likely to use them. More importantly, this paper delivers some key policy and business lessons that form a survival guide for effectively introducing and running public bicycle schemes. These lessons include, among others, the need for: tailoring the system design and expansion strategy according to the host city needs, city-operator and commercial partner synergies, more bike-friendly infrastructure and legislation, pro-active cultural engagement, anti-abuse measures, enhanced fleet management and realistic profit expectations.

AB  - Big data and business analytics are trends that are positively impacting the business world. Past researches show that data generated in the modern world is huge and growing exponentially. These include structured and unstructured data that flood organizations daily. Unstructured data constitute the majority of the world&rsquo;s digital data and these include text files, web, and social media posts, emails, images, audio, movies, etc. The unstructured data cannot be managed in the traditional relational database management system (RDBMS). Therefore, data proliferation requires a rethinking of techniques for capturing, storing, and processing the data. This is the role big data has come to play. This paper, therefore, is aimed at increasing the attention of organizations and researchers to various applications and benefits of big data technology. The paper reviews and discusses, the recent trends, opportunities and pitfalls of big data and how it has enabled organizations to create successful business strategies and remain competitive, based on available literature. Furthermore, the review presents the various applications of big data and business analytics, data sources generated in these applications and their key characteristics. Finally, the review not only outlines the challenges for successful implementation of big data projects but also highlights the current open research directions of big data analytics that require further consideration. The reviewed areas of big data suggest that good management and manipulation of the large data sets using the techniques and tools of big data can deliver actionable insights that create business values.

AB  - Dense air quality monitoring network (AQMN) is one of main ways to surveil industrial air pollution. This paper is concerned with the design of a dense AQMN for H2S for a chemical industrial park in Shanghai, China. An indicator (Surveillance Efficiency, SE) for the long-term performance of AQMN was constructed by averaging pollution detection efficiency (rd) and source identification efficiency (rb). A ranking method was developed by combing Gaussian puff model and Source area analysis for improving calculation efficiency. Candidate combinations with highest score were given priority in the selection of next site. Two existing monitors were suggested to relocate to the west and southwest of this park. SE of optimized AQMN increased quickly with monitor number, and then the growth trend started to flatten when the number reached about 60. The highest SE occurred when the number reached 110. Optimal schemes of AQMNs were suggested which can achieve about 98% of the highest SE, while using only about 60 monitors. Finally, the reason why the highest SE is less than 1 and the variation characteristics of rd and rb were discussed. Overall, the proposed method is an effective tool for designing AQMN with optimal SE in industrial parks.

AB  - In areas such as health, environment, and energy consumption, there is a need to do better. A common goal in society is to get people to behave in ways that are sustainable for the environment or support a healthier lifestyle. Nudging is a term known from economics and political theory, for influencing decisions and behavior using suggestions, positive reinforcement, and other non-coercive means. With the extensive use of digital devices, nudging within a digital environment (known as digital nudging) has great potential. We introduce smart nudging, where the guidance of user behavior is presented through digital nudges tailored to be relevant to the current situation of each individual user. The ethics of smart nudging and the transparency of nudging is also discussed. We see a smart nudge as a recommendation to the user, followed by information that both motivates and helps the user choose the suggested behavior. This paper describes such nudgy recommendations, the design of a smart nudge, and an architecture for a smart nudging system. We compare smart nudging to traditional models for recommender systems, and we describe and discuss tools (or approaches) for nudge design. We discuss the challenges of designing personalized smart nudges that evolve and adapt according to the user&rsquo;s reactions to the previous nudging and possible behavioral change of the user.

AB  - Predicting the diffusion rule of toxic gas plays a distinctly important role in emergency capability assessment and rescue work. Among diffusion prediction models, the traditional artificial neural network has exhibited excellent performance not only in prediction accuracy but also in calculation time. Nevertheless, with the continuous development of deep learning and data science, some new prediction models based on deep learning algorithms have been shown to be more advantageous because their structure can better discover internal laws and external connections between input data and output data. The long short-term memory (LSTM) network is a kind of deep learning neural network that has demonstrated outstanding achievements in many prediction fields. This paper applies the LSTM network directly to the prediction of toxic gas diffusion and uses the Project Prairie Grass dataset to conduct experiments. Compared with the Gaussian diffusion model, support vector machine (SVM) model, and back propagation (BP) network model, the LSTM model of deep learning has higher prediction accuracy (especially for the prediction at the point of high concentration values) while avoiding the occurrence of negative concentration values and overfitting problems found in traditional artificial neural network models.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Underwater sensor networks have wide application prospects, but the large-scale sensing node deployment is severely hindered by problems like energy constraints, long delays, local disconnections, and heavy energy consumption. These problems can be solved effectively by optimizing sensing node deployment with a genetic algorithm. However, the genetic algorithm (GA) needs many iterations in solving the best location of underwater sensor deployment, which results in long running time delays and limited practical application when dealing with large-scale data. The classical parallel framework Hadoop can improve the GA running efficiency to some extent while the state-of-the-art parallel framework Spark can release much more parallel potential of GA by realizing parallel crossover, mutation, and other operations on each computing node. Giving full allowance for the working environment of the underwater sensor network and the characteristics of sensors, this paper proposes a Spark-based parallel GA to calculate the extremum of the Shubert multi-peak function, through which the optimal deployment of the underwater sensor network can be obtained. Experimental results show that while faced with a large-scale underwater sensor network, compared with single node and Hadoop framework, the Spark-based implementation not only significantly reduces the running time but also effectively avoids the problem of premature convergence because of its powerful randomness.

AB  - A wireless sensor network (WSN) has achieved significant importance in tracking different physical or environmental conditions using wireless sensor nodes. Such types of networks are used in various applications including smart cities, smart building, military target tracking and surveillance, natural disaster relief, and smart homes. However, the limited power capacity of sensor nodes is considered a major issue that hampers the performance of a WSN. A plethora of research has been conducted to reduce the energy consumption of sensor nodes in traditional WSN, however the limited functional capability of such networks is the main constraint in designing sophisticated and dynamic solutions. Given this, software defined networking (SDN) has revolutionized traditional networks by providing a programmable and flexible framework. Therefore, SDN concepts can be utilized in designing energy-efficient WSN solutions. In this paper, we exploit SDN capabilities to conserve energy consumption in a traditional WSN. To achieve this, an energy-aware multihop routing protocol (named EASDN) is proposed for software defined wireless sensor network (SDWSN). The proposed protocol is evaluated in a real environment. For this purpose, a test bed is developed using Raspberry Pi. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm exhibits promising results in terms of network lifetime, average energy consumption, the packet delivery ratio, and average delay in comparison to an existing energy efficient routing protocol for SDWSN and a traditional source routing algorithm.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) are envisaged to be the future transportation medium, and demonstrate energy efficiency levels much higher than conventional gasoline or diesel-based vehicles. However, the sustainability of EVs is only justified if the electricity used to charge these EVs is availed from a sustainable source of energy and not from any fossil fuel or carbon generating source. In this paper, the challenges of the EV charging stations are discussed while highlighting the growing use of distributed generators in the modern electrical grid system. The benefits of the adoption of photovoltaic (PV) sources along with battery storage devices are studied. A multiport converter is proposed for integrating the PV, charging docks, and energy storage device (ESD) with the grid system. In order to control the bidirectional flow between the generating sources and the loads, an intelligent energy management system is proposed by adapting particle swarm optimization for efficient switching between the sources. The proposed system is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink environment, and the results depicted fast switching between the sources and less switching time without obstructing the fast charging to the EVs.

AB  - Maintaining the high visual recognizability of traffic signs for traffic safety is a key matter for road network management. Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) systems provide efficient way of 3D measurement over large-scale traffic environment. This paper presents a quantitative visual recognizability evaluation method for traffic signs in large-scale traffic environment based on traffic recognition theory and MLS 3D point clouds. We first propose the Visibility Evaluation Model (VEM) to quantitatively describe the visibility of traffic sign from any given viewpoint, then we proposed the concept of visual recognizability field and Traffic Sign Visual Recognizability Evaluation Model (TSVREM) to measure the visual recognizability of a traffic sign. Finally, we present an automatic TSVREM calculation algorithm for MLS 3D point clouds. Experimental results on real MLS 3D point clouds show that the proposed method is feasible and efficient.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In recent years, 5G photonic technology has gradually gained increased attention from scholars. However, studies on 5G photonic technology have mostly focused on technological discussions or market development research, but have failed to identify the relevant key technologies from a comprehensive perspective. In particular, 5G photonic technology is an interdisciplinary technology that could create considerable potential business opportunities in the future, therefore, identifying related key technologies is crucial. Accordingly, the patents of 5G photonic technologies were used as the basis for analysis in this study, and a patent technology network for such technologies was constructed using network analysis. The results showed that the key technologies of 5G photonic technology are mainly related to optics, nanostructures, semiconductors, and material analysis, indicating an interdisciplinary feature instead of focusing only on one specific technological field. Additionally, the relevant technologies that have seen active development in recent years are mainly related to optical elements and semiconductor devices. Finally, a patentee analysis demonstrated that information technology companies were the key players in the development of 5G photonic technologies, and the semiconductor industry will have a crucial role in the development of such technologies. In this study, a patent technology network model was constructed to explore the development trend of 5G photonic technologies, thereby providing a reference for the government to promote these emerging technologies.

TI  - EDCrammer: An Efficient Caching Rate-Control Algorithm for Streaming Data on Resource-Limited Edge Nodes
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 12
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - This paper explores data caching as a key factor of edge computing. State-of-the-art research of data caching on edge nodes mainly considers reactive and proactive caching, and machine learning based caching, which could be a heavy task for edge nodes. However, edge nodes usually have relatively lower computing resources than cloud datacenters as those are geo-distributed from the administrator. Therefore, a caching algorithm should be lightweight for saving computing resources on edge nodes. In addition, the data caching should be agile because it has to support high-quality services on edge nodes. Accordingly, this paper proposes a lightweight, agile caching algorithm, EDCrammer (Efficient Data Crammer), which performs agile operations to control caching rate for streaming data by using the enhanced PID (Proportional-Integral-Differential) controller. Experimental results using this lightweight, agile caching algorithm show its significant value in each scenario. In four common scenarios, the desired cache utilization was reached in 1.1 s on average and then maintained within a 4&ndash;7% deviation. The cache hit ratio is about 96%, and the optimal cache capacity is around 1.5 MB. Thus, EDCrammer can help distribute the streaming data traffic to the edge nodes, mitigate the uplink load on the central cloud, and ultimately provide users with high-quality video services. We also hope that EDCrammer can improve overall service quality in 5G environment, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), Internet of Things (IoT), etc.

TI  - Knowledge and Technology Transfer Influencing the Process of Innovation in Green Supply Chain Management: A Multicriteria Model Based on the DEMATEL Method
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2019
VL  - 11

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - After performing a systematic review of the literature, it was noticeable that the discussion regarding Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) along with Knowledge and Technology Transfer (KTT) and Innovation is scarce. To address this issue, the objective of this paper is to analyze the relationship between GSCM, KTT, and Innovation. To achieve this purpose, we developed a conceptual framework based on the literature review, which raised some hypotheses. In order to verify the hypotheses and validate the framework, we designed a multicriteria model called the KTT-GSCM Multicriteria Model, composed of two stages. The first stage describes factors that are relevant to GSCM, KTT, and Innovation, ascertaining which ones have influence over the others and which ones are influenced by the others, through the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The second stage of the model analyzes the level of each perspective in each company and in the supply chain as a whole, thus verifying the hypotheses. This model was applied in 13 firms of a supply chain that has a rotomolding firm as a focal company. Through the development and application of the model, it was possible to verify the hypotheses raised and conclude that the perspectives of GSCM, KTT, and Innovation are, in fact, influenced by one another and that both Innovation and KTT promote greater development in GSCM.

AB  - Continuous authentication was introduced to propose novel mechanisms to validate users&rsquo; identity and address the problems and limitations exposed by traditional techniques. However, this methodology poses several challenges that remain unsolved. In this paper, we present a novel framework, PALOT, that leverages IoT to provide context-aware, continuous and non-intrusive authentication and authorization services. To this end, we propose a formal information system model based on ontologies, representing the main source of knowledge of our framework. Furthermore, to recognize users&rsquo; behavioral patterns within the IoT ecosystem, we introduced a new module called &ldquo;confidence manager&rdquo;. The module is then integrated into an extended version of our early framework architecture, IoTCAF, which is consequently adapted to include the above-mentioned component. Exhaustive experiments demonstrated the efficacy, feasibility and scalability of the proposed solution.

AB  - This study sought to propose a big data analysis and prediction model for transmission line tower outliers to assess when something is wrong with transmission line tower big data based on deep reinforcement learning. The model enables choosing automatic cluster K values based on non-labeled sensor big data. It also allows measuring the distance of action between data inside a cluster with the Q-value representing network output in the altered transmission line tower big data clustering algorithm containing transmission line tower outliers and old Deep Q Network. Specifically, this study performed principal component analysis to categorize transmission line tower data and proposed an automatic initial central point approach through standard normal distribution. It also proposed the A-Deep Q-Learning algorithm altered from the deep Q-Learning algorithm to explore policies based on the experiences of clustered data learning. It can be used to perform transmission line tower outlier data learning based on the distance of data within a cluster. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed model recorded an approximately 2.29%~4.19% higher prediction rate and around 0.8% ~ 4.3% higher accuracy rate compared to the old transmission line tower big data analysis model.

AB  - Celestial tourism, also known as astrotourism, astronomical tourism or, less frequently, star tourism, refers to people&rsquo;s interest in visiting places where celestial phenomena can be clearly observed. Stars, skygazing, meteor showers or comets, among other phenomena, arouse people&rsquo;s interest, however, good night sky conditions are required to observe such phenomena. From an environmental point of view, several organisations have surfaced in defence of the protection of dark night skies against light pollution, while from an economic point of view; the idea also opens new possibilities for development in associated areas. The quality of dark skies for celestial tourism can be measured by night sky brightness (NSB), which is used to quantify the visual perception of the sky, including several light sources at a specific point on earth. The aim of this research is to model the nocturnal sky brightness by training and testing a probabilistic model using real NSB data. ARIMA and artificial neural network models have been applied to open NSB data provided by the Globe at Night international programme, with the results of this first model approach being promising and opening up new possibilities for astrotourism. To the best of the authors&rsquo; knowledge, probabilistic models have not been applied to NSB forecasting.

TI  - Vehicle Counting in Video Sequences: An Incremental Subspace Learning Approach

PY  - 2019
VL  - 19
IS  - 13
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The counting of vehicles plays an important role in measuring the behavior patterns of traffic flow in cities, as streets and avenues can get crowded easily. To address this problem, some Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) have been implemented in order to count vehicles with already established video surveillance infrastructure. With this in mind, in this paper, we present an on-line learning methodology for counting vehicles in video sequences based on Incremental Principal Component Analysis (Incremental PCA). This incremental learning method allows us to identify the maximum variability (i.e., motion detection) between a previous block of frames and the actual one by using only the first projected eigenvector. Once the projected image is obtained, we apply dynamic thresholding to perform image binarization. Then, a series of post-processing steps are applied to enhance the binary image containing the objects in motion. Finally, we count the number of vehicles by implementing a virtual detection line in each of the road lanes. These lines determine the instants where the vehicles pass completely through them. Results show that our proposed methodology is able to count vehicles with 96.6% accuracy at 26 frames per second on average&mdash;dealing with both camera jitter and sudden illumination changes caused by the environment and the camera auto exposure.

AB  - Energy-efficiency is one of the critical issues in smart cities. It is an essential basis for optimizing smart cities planning. This study proposed four new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for forecasting the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency based on the potential of artificial neural network (ANN) and meta-heuristics algorithms, including artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization, particle swarm optimization (PSO), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), and genetic algorithm (GA). They were abbreviated as ABC-ANN, PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, and GA-ANN models; 837 buildings were considered and analyzed based on the influential parameters, such as glazing area distribution (GLAD), glazing area (GLA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), relative compactness (RC), for estimating heating load (HL). Three statistical criteria, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), coefficient determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE), were used to assess the potential of the aforementioned models. The results indicated that the GA-ANN model provided the highest performance in estimating the heating load of buildings&rsquo; energy efficiency, with an RMSE of 1.625, R2 of 0.980, and MAE of 0.798. The remaining models (i.e., PSO-ANN, ICA-ANN, ABC-ANN) yielded lower performance with RMSE of 1.932, 1.982, 1.878; R2 of 0.972, 0.970, 0.973; MAE of 1.027, 0.980, 0.957, respectively.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is considered one of the future disruptive technologies and has attracted lots of research attention in the recent past. IoT devices are tiny sensing or actuating devices attached to daily life objects, capable of sending sensing data and receiving commands. Cloud computing technology provides tremendous computing and storage capacity over the Internet to overcome limited resources of IoT devices. Many studies are conducted on IoT device virtualization in the cloud environment to facilitate remote access and control. In the future, IoT devices will be accessed through its corresponding virtual objects. Just like the network of physical devices, there needs to be a network of virtual objects in the cyber world. In this paper, we present a concept of building a dynamic virtual network in the cloud environment among connected IoT devices. The key idea is to provide a mechanism for building a virtual network among connected IoT devices from different domains through their corresponding virtual objects in the cloud environment. This will facilitate the sharing of resources and the rapid development of diverse applications on top of the virtualization layer by establishing a dynamic end-to-end connection between IoT devices. In this study, we present a detailed design of the proposed system for building a virtual IoT network. We have also implemented three application layers protocols in OMNET++ for simulation of a virtual objects network to conduct performance analysis of the proposed IoT network virtualization.

AB  - In Texas and elsewhere, the looming realities of rapid population growth and intensifying effects of climate change mean that the things we rely on to live&mdash;water, energy, dependable infrastructure, social cohesion, and an ecosystem to support them&mdash;are exposed to unprecedented risk. Limited resources will be in ever greater demand and the environmental stress from prolonged droughts, record-breaking heat waves, and destructive floods will increase. Existing long-term trends and behaviors will not be sustainable. That is our current trajectory, but we can still change course. Significant advances in information communication technologies and big data, combined with new frameworks for thinking about urban places as social&ndash;ecological&ndash;technical systems, and an increasing movement towards transdisciplinary scholarship and practice sets the foundation and framework for a metropolitan observatory. Yet, more is required than an infrastructure for data. Making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable will require that data become actionable knowledge that change policy and practice. Research and development of urban sustainability and resilience knowledge is burgeoning, yet the uptake to policy has been slow. An integrative and holistic approach is necessary to develop effective sustainability science that synthesizes different sources of knowledge, relevant disciplines, multi-sectoral alliances, and connections to policy-makers and the public. To address these challenges and opportunities, we developed a conceptual framework for a &ldquo;metropolitan observatory&rdquo; to generate standardized long-term, large-scale datasets about social, ecological, and technical dimensions of metropolitan systems. We apply this conceptual model in Texas, known as the Texas Metro Observatory, to advance strategic research and decision-making at the intersection of urbanization and climate change. The Texas Metro Observatory project is part of Planet Texas 2050, a University of Texas Austin grand challenge initiative.

VL  - 19

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a way to use social resources to solve high-precision environmental awareness problems in real time. Publishers hope to collect as much sensed data as possible at a relatively low cost, while users want to earn more revenue at a low cost. Low-quality data will reduce the efficiency of MCS and lead to a loss of revenue. However, existing work lacks research on the selection of user revenue under the premise of ensuring data quality. In this paper, we propose a Publisher-User Evolutionary Game Model (PUEGM) and a revenue selection method to solve the evolutionary stable equilibrium problem based on non-cooperative evolutionary game theory. Firstly, the choice of user revenue is modeled as a Publisher-User Evolutionary Game Model. Secondly, based on the error-elimination decision theory, we combine a data quality assessment algorithm in the PUEGM, which aims to remove low-quality data and improve the overall quality of user data. Finally, the optimal user revenue strategy under different conditions is obtained from the evolutionary stability strategy (ESS) solution and stability analysis. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed solutions, extensive experiments using some real data sets are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has high accuracy of data quality assessment and a reasonable selection of user revenue.

AB  - Air Conditioners (AC) impact in overall electricity consumption in buildings is very high. Therefore, controlling ACs power consumption is a significant factor for demand response. With the advancement in the area of demand side management techniques implementation and smart grid, precise AC load forecasting for electrical utilities and end-users is required. In this paper, big data analysis and its applications in power systems is introduced. After this, various load forecasting categories and various techniques applied for load forecasting in context of big data analysis in power systems have been explored. Then, Levenberg&ndash;Marquardt Algorithm (LMA)-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for residential AC short-term load forecasting is presented. This forecasting approach utilizes past hourly temperature observations and AC load as input variables for assessment. Different performance assessment indices have also been investigated. Error formulations have shown that LMA-based ANN presents better results in comparison to Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) and statistical regression approach. Furthermore, information of AC load is obtainable for different time horizons like weekly, hourly, and monthly bases due to better prediction accuracy of LMA-based ANN, which is helpful for efficient demand response (DR) implementation.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In this study, a novel technique to support smart city planning in estimating and controlling the heating load (HL) of buildings, was proposed, namely PSO-XGBoost. Accordingly, the extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBoost) was developed to estimate HL first; then, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was applied to optimize the performance of the XGBoost model. The classical XGBoost model, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Gaussian process (GP), and classification and regression trees (CART) models were also investigated and developed to predict the HL of building systems, and compared with the proposed PSO-XGBoost model; 837 investigations of buildings were considered and analyzed with many influential factors, such as glazing area distribution (GAD), glazing area (GA), orientation (O), overall height (OH), roof area (RA), wall area (WA), surface area (SA), and relative compactness (RC). Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), variance account for (VAF), mean absolute error (MAE), and determination coefficient (R2), were used as the statistical criteria for evaluating the performance of the above models. The color intensity, as well as the ranking method, were also used to compare and evaluate the models. The results showed that the proposed PSO-XGBoost model was the most robust technique for estimating the HL of building systems. The remaining models (i.e., XGBoost, SVM, RF, GP, and CART) yielded more mediocre performance through RMSE, MAE, R2, VAF, and MAPE metrics. Another finding of this study also indicated that OH, RA, WA, and SA were the most critical parameters for the accuracy of the proposed PSO-XGBoost model. They should be particularly interested in smart city planning as well as the optimization of smart cities.

AB  - In recent years, air pollution has become an important public health concern. The high concentration of fine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 ¬µm (PM2.5) is known to be associated with lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and metabolic disease. Predicting PM2.5 concentrations can help governments warn people at high risk, thus mitigating the complications. Although attempts have been made to predict PM2.5 concentrations, the factors influencing PM2.5 prediction have not been investigated. In this work, we study feature importance for PM2.5 prediction in Tehran‚Äôs urban area, implementing random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and deep learning machine learning (ML) approaches. We use 23 features, including satellite and meteorological data, ground-measured PM2.5, and geographical data, in the modeling. The best model performance obtained was R2 = 0.81 (R = 0.9), MAE = 9.93 ¬µg/m3, and RMSE = 13.58 ¬µg/m3 using the XGBoost approach, incorporating elimination of unimportant features. However, all three ML methods performed similarly and R2 varied from 0.63 to 0.67, when Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 3 km resolution was included, and 0.77 to 0.81, when AOD at 3 km resolution was excluded. Contrary to the PM2.5 lag data, satellite-derived AODs did not improve model performance.

AB  - Advances in embedded electronic systems, the development of new communication protocols, and the application of artificial intelligence paradigms have enabled the improvement of current automation systems of energy management. Embedded devices integrate different sensors with connectivity, computing resources, and reduced cost. Communication and cloud services increase their performance; however, there are limitations in the implementation of these technologies. If the cloud is used as the main source of services and resources, overload problems will occur. There are no models that facilitate the complete integration and interoperability in the facilities already created. This article proposes a model for the integration of smart energy management systems in new and already created facilities, using local embedded devices, Internet of Things communication protocols and services based on artificial intelligence paradigms. All services are distributed in the new smart grid network using edge and fog computing techniques. The model proposes an architecture both to be used as support for the development of smart services and for energy management control systems adapted to the installation: a group of buildings and/or houses that shares energy management and energy generation. Machine learning to predict consumption and energy generation, electric load classification, energy distribution control, and predictive maintenance are the main utilities integrated. As an experimental case, a facility that incorporates wind and solar generation is used for development and testing. Smart grid facilities, designed with artificial intelligence algorithms, implemented with Internet of Things protocols, and embedded control devices facilitate the development, cost reduction, and the integration of new services. In this work, a method to design, develop, and install smart services in self-consumption facilities is proposed. New smart services with reduced costs are installed and tested, confirming the advantages of the proposed model.

AB  - The ongoing digital transformation has the potential to revolutionize nearly all industrial manufacturing processes. However, its concrete requirements and implications are still not sufficiently investigated. In order to establish a common understanding, a multitude of initiatives have published guidelines, reference frameworks and specifications, all intending to promote their particular interpretation of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As a result of the inconsistent use of terminology, heterogeneous structures and proposed processes, an opaque landscape has been created. The consequence is that both new users and experienced experts can hardly manage to get an overview of the amount of information and publications, and make decisions on what is best to use and to adopt. This work contributes to the state of the art by providing a structured analysis of existing reference frameworks, their classifications and the concerns they target. We supply alignments of shared concepts, identify gaps and give a structured mapping of regarded concerns at each part of the respective reference architectures. Furthermore, the linking of relevant industry standards and technologies to the architectures allows a more effective search for specifications and guidelines and supports the direct technology adoption.

AB  - Building Energy and Comfort Management (BECM) systems have the potential to considerably reduce costs related to energy consumption and improve the efficiency of resource exploitation, by implementing strategies for resource management and control and policies for Demand-Side Management (DSM). One of the main requirements for such systems is to be able to adapt their management decisions to the users&rsquo; specific habits and preferences, even when they change over time. This feature is fundamental to prevent users&rsquo; disaffection and the gradual abandonment of the system. In this paper, a sensor-based system for analysis of user habits and early detection and prediction of user activities is presented. To improve the resulting accuracy, the system incorporates statistics related to other relevant external conditions that have been observed to be correlated (e.g., time of the day). Performance evaluation on a real use case proves that the proposed system enables early recognition of activities after only 10 sensor events with an accuracy of     81 %    . Furthermore, the correlation between activities can be used to predict the next activity with an accuracy of about     60 %    .

AB  - Recently, the development of smart home technologies has played a crucial role in enhancing several real-life smart applications. They help improve the quality of life through systems designed to enhance convenience, comfort, entertainment, health of the householders, and security. Note, however, that malware attacks on smart home devices are increasing in frequency and volume. As people seek to improve and optimize comfort in their home and minimize their daily home responsibilities at the same time, this makes them attractive targets for a malware attack. Thus, attacks on smart home-based devices have emerged. The goals of this paper are to analyze the different aspects of cyber-physical threats on the smart home from a security perspective, discuss the types of attacks including advanced cyber-attacks and cyber-physical system attacks, and evaluate the impact on a smart home system in daily life. We have come up with a taxonomy focusing on cyber threat attacks that can also have potential impact on a smart home system and identify some key issues about VPNFilter malware that constitutes large-scale Internet of Things (IoT)-based botnet malware infection. We also discuss the defense mechanism against this threat and mention the most infected routers. The specific objective of this paper is to provide efficient task management and knowledge related to VPNFilter malware attack.

AB  - Understanding human behavior can assist in the adoption of satisfactory health interventions and improved care. One of the main problems relies on the definition of human behaviors, as human activities depend on multiple variables and are of dynamic nature. Although smart homes have advanced in the latest years and contributed to unobtrusive human behavior tracking, artificial intelligence has not coped yet with the problem of variability and dynamism of these behaviors. Process mining is an emerging discipline capable of adapting to the nature of high-variate data and extract knowledge to define behavior patterns. In this study, we analyze data from 25 in-house residents acquired with indoor location sensors by means of process mining clustering techniques, which allows obtaining workflows of the human behavior inside the house. Data are clustered by adjusting two variables: the similarity index and the Euclidean distance between workflows. Thereafter, two main models are created: (1) a workflow view to analyze the characteristics of the discovered clusters and the information they reveal about human behavior and (2) a calendar view, in which common behaviors are rendered in the way of a calendar allowing to detect relevant patterns depending on the day of the week and the season of the year. Three representative patients who performed three different behaviors: stable, unstable, and complex behaviors according to the proposed approach are investigated. This approach provides human behavior details in the manner of a workflow model, discovering user paths, frequent transitions between rooms, and the time the user was in each room, in addition to showing the results into the calendar view increases readability and visual attraction of human behaviors, allowing to us detect patterns happening on special days.

AB  - A new generation of smart meters are called cognitive meters, which are essentially based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and load disaggregation methods for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). Thus, modern NILM may recognize appliances connected to the grid during certain periods, while providing much more information than the traditional monthly consumption. Therefore, this article presents a new load disaggregation methodology with microscopic characteristics collected from current and voltage waveforms. Initially, the novel NILM algorithm&mdash;called the Power Signature Blob (PSB)&mdash;makes use of a state machine to detect when the appliance has been turned on or off. Then, machine learning is used to identify the appliance, for which attributes are extracted from the Conservative Power Theory (CPT), a contemporary power theory that enables comprehensive load modeling. Finally, considering simulation and experimental results, this paper shows that the new method is able to achieve 95% accuracy considering the applied data set.
