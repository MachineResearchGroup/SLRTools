AB  - With the rapid growth and development of cities, Intelligent Traffic Management and Control (ITMC) is becoming a fundamental component to address the challenges of modern urban traffic management, where a wide range of daily problems need to be addressed in a prompt and expedited manner. Issues such as unpredictable traffic dynamics, resource constraints, and abnormal events pose difficulties to city managers. ITMC aims to increase the efficiency of traffic management by minimizing the odds of traffic problems, by providing real-time traffic state forecasts to better schedule the intersection signal controls. Reliable implementations of ITMC improve the safety of inhabitants and the quality of life, leading to economic growth. In recent years, researchers have proposed different solutions to address specific problems concerning traffic management, ranging from image-processing and deep-learning techniques to forecasting the traffic state and deriving policies to control intersection signals. This review article studies the primary public datasets helpful in developing models to address the identified problems, complemented with a deep analysis of the works related to traffic state forecast and intersection-signal-control models. Our analysis found that deep-learning-based approaches for short-term traffic state forecast and multi-intersection signal control showed reasonable results, but lacked robustness for unusual scenarios, particularly during oversaturated situations, which can be resolved by explicitly addressing these cases, potentially leading to significant improvements of the systems overall. However, there is arguably a long path until these models can be used safely and effectively in real-world scenarios.

AB  - There are big differences between the driving behaviors of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) and traditional human-driven vehicles (HVs). ICVs will be mixed with HVs on roads for a long time in the future. Different intelligent functions and different driving styles will affect the condition of traffic flow, thereby changing traffic efficiency and emissions. In this paper, we focus on China’s expressways and secondary motorways, and the impacts of the ‘single-lane automatic driving system’ (SLADS) on traffic delay, road capacity and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were studied under different ICV penetration rates. Driving styles were regarded as important factors for scenario analysis. We found that with higher volume input, SLADS has an optimizing effect on traffic efficiency and CO2 emissions generally, which will be more significant as the ICV penetration rate increases. Additionally, enhancing the aggressiveness of driving behavior appropriately is an effective way to amplify the benefits of SLADS.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), also known as Smart Transportation, is an infusion of information and communication technologies into transportation. ITS are a key component of smart cities, which have seen rapid global development in the last few decades. This has in turn translated to an increase in the deployment and adoption of ITS, particularly in countries in the Western world. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the developing countries of Africa and Asia, where dilapidated road infrastructure, poorly maintained public/mass transit vehicles and poverty are major concerns. However, the impact of Westernization and “imported technologies” cannot be overlooked; thus, despite the aforementioned challenges, ITS have found their way into African cities. In this paper, a systematic review was performed to determine the state of the art of ITS in Africa. The output of this systematic review was then fed into a hybrid multi-criteria model to analyse the research landscape, identify connections between published works and reveal research gaps and inequalities in African ITS. African peculiarities inhibiting the widespread implementation of ITS were then discussed, followed by the development of a conceptual architecture for an integrated ITS for African cities.

TI  - Dual Image-Based CNN Ensemble Model for Waste Classification in Reverse Vending Machine
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - A reverse vending machine motivates citizens to bring recyclable waste by rewarding them, which is a viable solution to increase the recycling rate. Reverse vending machines generally use near-infrared sensors, barcode sensors, or cameras to classify recycling resources. However, sensor-based reverse vending machines suffer from a high configuration cost and the limited scope of target objects, and conventional single image-based reverse vending machines usually make erroneous predictions about intentional fraud objects. This paper proposes a dual image-based convolutional neural network ensemble model to address these problems. For this purpose, we first created a prototype reverse vending machine and constructed an image dataset containing two cross-sections of objects, top and front view. Then, we chose convolutional neural network models widely used in image classification as the candidates for building an accurate and lightweight ensemble model. Considering the size and classification performance of candidates, we constructed the best-fit ensemble combination and evaluated its classification performance. The final ensemble model showed a classification accuracy higher than 95% for all target classes, including fraud objects. This result proves that our approach achieves better robustness against intentional fraud objects than single image-based models and thus can broaden the scope for target resources. The measurement results on lightweight embedded platforms also demonstrated that our model provides a short inference time that is enough to facilitate the real-time execution of reverse vending machines based on low-cost edge artificial intelligence devices.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The high level of energy consumption of buildings is significantly influencing occupant behavior changes towards improved energy efficiency. This paper introduces a systematic literature review with two objectives: to understand the more relevant factors affecting energy consumption of buildings and to find the best intelligent computing (IC) methods capable of classifying and predicting energy consumption of different types of buildings. Adopting the PRISMA method, the paper analyzed 822 manuscripts from 2013 to 2020 and focused on 106, based on title and abstract screening and on manuscripts with experiments. A text mining process and a bibliometric map tool (VOS viewer) were adopted to find the most used terms and their relationships, in the energy and IC domains. Our approach shows that the terms &ldquo;consumption,&rdquo; &ldquo;residential,&rdquo; and &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; are the more relevant terms in the energy domain, in terms of the ratio of important terms (TITs), whereas &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; is the more commonly used term in the IC domain. The paper also shows that there are strong relations between &ldquo;Residential Energy Consumption&rdquo; and &ldquo;Electricity Consumption,&rdquo; &ldquo;Heating&rdquo; and &ldquo;Climate. Finally, we checked and analyzed 41 manuscripts in detail, summarized their major contributions, and identified several research gaps that provide hints for further research.

T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Radon gas is a harmful pollutant with a well-documented adverse influence on public health. In poorly ventilated environments, that are often prone to significant radon levels, studies indicate a known relationship between human radon exposure and lung cancer. Recent technology advances, notably on the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, allow the integration of sensors, computing, and communication capabilities into low-cost and small-scale devices that can be used for implementing specific cyber-physical systems (CPS) for online and real-time radon management. These technologies are crucial for improving the overall building indoor air quality (IAQ), contributing toward the so-called cognitive buildings, where human-based control is tending to decline, and building management systems (BMS) are focused on balancing critical factors, such as energy efficiency, human radon exposure management, and user experience, to achieve a more transparent and harmonious integration between technology and the built environment. This work surveys recent IoT technologies for indoor radon exposure management (monitoring, assessment and mitigation), and discusses its main challenges and opportunities, by focusing on methods, techniques, and technologies to answer the following questions: (i) What technologies have been recently in use for radon exposure management; (ii) how they operate; (iii) what type of radon detection mechanisms do they use; and (iv) what type of system architectures, components, and communication technologies have been used to assist the referred technologies. This contribution is relevant to pave the way for designing more intelligent and sustainable systems that rely on IoT and Information and Communications Technology (ICT), to achieve an optimal balance between these two critical factors: human radon exposure management and building energy efficiency.

SN  - 2304-8158

AB  - Background: The increasing population of humans, changing food consumption behavior, as well as the recent developments in the awareness for food sustainability, lead to new challenges for the production of food. Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, including Machine Learning and data analytics, might help to account for these challenges. Scope and Approach: Several research perspectives, among them Precision Agriculture, Industrial IoT, Internet of Food, or Smart Health, already provide new opportunities through digitalization. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art of the mentioned concepts. An additional concept is Food Informatics, which so far is mostly recognized as a mainly data-driven approach to support the production of food. In this review paper, we propose and discuss a new perspective for the concept of Food Informatics as a supportive discipline that subsumes the incorporation of information technology, mainly IoT and AI, in order to support the variety of aspects tangent to the food production process and delineate it from other, existing research streams in the domain. Key Findings and Conclusions: Many different concepts related to the digitalization in food science overlap. Further, Food Informatics is vaguely defined. In this paper, we provide a clear definition of Food Informatics and delineate it from related concepts. We corroborate our new perspective on Food Informatics by presenting several case studies about how it can support the food production as well as the intermediate steps until its consumption, and further describe its integration with related concepts.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - As a result of environmental pollution and the ever-growing demand for energy, there has been a shift from conventional vehicles towards electric vehicles (EVs). Public acceptance of EVs and their large-scale deployment raises requires a fully operational charging infrastructure. Charging infrastructure planning is an intricate process involving various activities, such as charging station placement, charging demand prediction, and charging scheduling. This planning process involves interactions between power distribution and the road network. The advent of machine learning has made data-driven approaches a viable means for solving charging infrastructure planning problems. Consequently, researchers have started using machine learning techniques to solve the aforementioned problems associated with charging infrastructure planning. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review of the machine learning applications used to solve charging infrastructure planning problems. Furthermore, three case studies on charging station placement and charging demand prediction are presented. This paper is an extension of: Deb, S. (2021, June). Machine Learning for Solving Charging Infrastructure Planning: A Comprehensive Review. In the 2021 5th International Conference on Smart Grid and Smart Cities (ICSGSC) (pp. 16&ndash;22). IEEE.

AB  - Recent developments in cloud computing and the Internet of Things have enabled smart environments, in terms of both monitoring and actuation. Unfortunately, this often results in unsustainable cloud-based solutions, whereby, in the interest of simplicity, a wealth of raw (unprocessed) data are pushed from sensor nodes to the cloud. Herein, we advocate the use of machine learning at sensor nodes to perform essential data-cleaning operations, to avoid the transmission of corrupted (often unusable) data to the cloud. Starting from a public pollution dataset, we investigate how two machine learning techniques (kNN and missForest) may be embedded on Raspberry Pi to perform data imputation, without impacting the data collection process. Our experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of edge-learning methods for filling in missing data values in corrupted data series. We find that kNN and missForest correctly impute up to 40% of randomly distributed missing values, with a density distribution of values that is indistinguishable from the benchmark. We also show a trade-off analysis for the case of bursty missing values, with recoverable blocks of up to 100 samples. Computation times are shorter than sampling periods, allowing for data imputation at the edge in a timely manner.

AB  - This study examines the effects of quality of service, product awareness, and perceptions among customers of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) on customer loyalty through technology integration using customer satisfaction as a mediator. A well-structured, comprehensive questionnaire was developed and data were collected from 203 respondents who were customers of six IFIs in Pakistan and had at least 2 years of experience in dealing confiorm this is correct with these IFIs. A total of 171 accurate responses were received from the respondents. Ten hypotheses were developed and statistically verified using regression and correlation analytical techniques. The results reveal that the quality of customer services and awareness of IFIs had a direct and positive relationship with customer loyalty, which in turn was mediated by customer satisfaction. Perceptions about IFIs had a direct positive relation with customer satisfaction. However, the relation of perceptions and quality of service with customer loyalty and satisfaction in financial institutions through technology integration was found to be insignificant, even in the presence of customer satisfaction as a mediator.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has led to the growth and expansion of various new opportunities in the new Industrial Transformation. There have been notable challenges regarding the security of data and challenges related to privacy when collecting real-time and automatic data while observing applications in the industry. This paper proposes an Federated Transfer Learning for Authentication and Privacy Preservation Using Novel Supportive Twin Delayed DDPG (S-TD3) Algorithm for IIoT. In FT-Block (Federated transfer learning blockchain), several blockchains are applied to preserve privacy and security for all types of industrial applications. Additionally, by introducing the authentication mechanism based on transfer learning, blockchains can enhance the preservation and security standards for industrial applications. Specifically, Novel Supportive Twin Delayed DDPG trains the user model to authenticate specific regions. As it is considered one of the most open and scalable interacting platforms of information, it successfully helps in the positive transfer of different kinds of data between devices in more significant and local operations of the industry. It is mainly due to a single authentication factor, and the poor adaptation to regular increases in the number of users and different requirements that make the current authentication mechanism suffer a lot in IIoT. As a result, it has been very clearly observed that the given solutions are very useful.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In this article, a systematic literature review of 419 articles on energy demand modeling, published between 2015 and 2020, is presented. This provides researchers with an exhaustive overview of the examined literature and classification of techniques for energy demand modeling. Unlike in existing literature reviews, in this comprehensive study all of the following aspects of energy demand models are analyzed: techniques, prediction accuracy, inputs, energy carrier, sector, temporal horizon, and spatial granularity. Readers benefit from easy access to a broad literature base and find decision support when choosing suitable data-model combinations for their projects. Results have been compiled in comprehensive figures and tables, providing a structured summary of the literature, and containing direct references to the analyzed articles. Drawbacks of techniques are discussed as well as countermeasures. The results show that among the articles, machine learning (ML) techniques are used the most, are mainly applied to short-term electricity forecasting on a regional level and rely on historic load as their main data source. Engineering-based models are less dependent on historic load data and cover appliance consumption on long temporal horizons. Metaheuristic and uncertainty techniques are often used in hybrid models. Statistical techniques are frequently used for energy demand modeling as well and often serve as benchmarks for other techniques. Among the articles, the accuracy measured by mean average percentage error (MAPE) proved to be on similar levels for all techniques. This review eases the reader into the subject matter by presenting the emphases that have been made in the current literature, suggesting future research directions, and providing the basis for quantitative testing of hypotheses regarding applicability and dominance of specific methods for sub-categories of demand modeling.

AB  - The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was approved in 2015 by the United Nations. It is a call of action to protect our planet, end poverty and improve the lives and prospects of all. Sustainable development has been fundamental in the tourism and construction sectors in the past few decades. Nowadays, developing countries are leaders in green engineering procedures, and progressively, hotels are including sustainable standards in their designs, architecture and management. In places where tourism is the main contributor to the Gross Domestic Product, the incorporation of energy certifications is crucial. In this context, this article explores the positive implications of the application of the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) on hotels in relation to the achievement of SDGs. The study analyses the influence of BREEAM on hotel design using six case studies and examines the sustainable modifications incorporated. Qualitative data were obtained through in-depth interviews and by the analysis of the documentation provided. The results revealed that a BREEAM approach in the initial stage of a project will optimize the sustainability of the hotel and can help with the achievement of several of the SDGs.

AB  - The concept of Healthy Cities, introduced by the World Health Organization, demonstrates the value of health for the whole urban system. As one of the most important components of urban systems, transportation plays an important role in Healthy Cities. Many transportation evaluation systems focus on factors such as road networks, parking spaces, transportation speed, accessibility, convenience, and commuting time, while the vulnerability and resilience of urban transportation are rarely evaluated. This study presents the preliminary progress in the evaluation of traffic vulnerability and resilience during precipitation events in 39 Chinese cities. Traffic congestion index data, derived from the Baidu Map Smart Transportation Platform, and rainfall data, derived from NASA&rsquo;s global precipitation measurement, are utilized. Traffic vulnerability index, traffic resilience index, and the corresponding quantitative methods are proposed, and the analysis results are presented. This study is of value in improving the understanding of urban traffic vulnerability and resilience, and in enabling the quantitative evaluation of them in urban health assessment and the Healthy Cities program.

AB  - The article presents issues regarding the impact of operating conditions on the functional reliability of representative fire alarm systems (FASs) in selected critical infrastructure buildings (CIB). FAS should operate correctly under variable environmental conditions. FASs ensure the safety of people and CIB. Operational measurements for 10 representative systems were conducted in order to determine the impact of environmental conditions on FAS reliability. Selected operational indices were also determined. The next stage involved developing two models of representative FASs and the availability, pre-ageing time and operating process security indices. Determining operational indices is a rational selection of FAS technical and organizational solutions that enables the reliability level to be increased. Identifying the course of the FAS operating process security hazard changes in individual system lines, particularly at the initial operation stage, enables people that supervise the operation to affect operating parameters on an ongoing basis. The article is structured in the following order: issue analysis, FAS power supply in CIB, operational test results, selected FAS operating process models, determination of operational and security indices, and conclusions.

AB  - Nowadays, pavement management systems (PMS) are mainly based on monitoring processes that have been established for a long time, and strongly depend on acquired experience. However, with the emergence of smart technologies, such as internet of things and artificial intelligence, PMS could be improved by applying these new smart technologies to their decision support systems, not just by updating their data collection methodologies, but also their data analysis tools. The application of these smart technologies to the field of pavement monitoring and condition evaluation will undoubtedly contribute to more efficient, less costly, safer, and environmentally friendly methodologies. Thus, the main drive of the present work is to provide insight for the development of future decision support systems for smart pavement management by conducting a systematic literature review of the developed works that apply smart technologies to this field. The conclusions drawn from the analysis allowed for the identification of a series of future direction recommendations for researchers. In fact, future PMS should tend to be capable of collecting and analyzing data at different levels, both externally at the surface or inside the pavement, as well as to detect and predict all types of functional and structural flaws and defects.

AB  - Several cities have recently moved towards becoming smart cities for better services and quality of life for residents and visitors, with: optimized resource utilization; increased environmental protection; enhanced infrastructure operations and maintenance; and strong safety and security measures. Smart cities depend on deploying current and new technologies and different optimization methods to enhance services and performance in their different sectors. Some of the technologies assisting smart city applications are the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, and cloud computing. Integrating these three to serve one system (we will refer to it as integrated IoT-fog-cloud system (iIFC)) creates an advanced platform to develop and operate various types of smart city applications. This platform will allow applications to use the best features from the IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud services to deliver best capabilities and performance. Utilizing this powerful platform will provide many opportunities for enhancing and optimizing applications in energy, transportation, healthcare, and other areas. In this paper we survey various applications of iIFCs for smart cities. We identify different common issues associated with utilizing iIFCs for smart city applications. These issues arise due to the characteristics of iIFCs on the one side and the requirements of different smart city applications on the other. In addition, we outline the main requirements to effectively utilize iIFCs for smart city applications. These requirements are related to optimization, networking, and security.

AB  - The paper is positioned in the emerging debate on the technological change brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, often referred to as Industry 4.0. Our analysis is at the local, sub-national level. The aim is to explore what drivers and barriers local productive systems might face when seeking to embark on transitions that reconcile smart, equitable, and sustainable priorities, under enhanced models called Industry 4.0+. The novelty of the paper is to develop such models by designing a conceptual framework that juxtaposes the drivers and the barriers of sustainability transitions with local productive systems. This novel framework suggests possible pathways that local productive systems can initiate to achieve more equitable and green outcomes for their economy and society by directing the development of digital-related solutions.

AB  - This paper focuses on the consumer preferences for the so-called &ldquo;smart homes&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;smart houses&rdquo;) which represent a novel addition and a product of the on-going digitalization and the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). The major scientific contribution of our study is the empirical model build on the data from the online questionnaire conducted with randomly selected respondents (N = 523) from four European Union (EU) countries and Russia. Even though our results are subject to limitations (no Southern of Northern European countries are included in the scope of this research, which might have yielded different results due to the differences in wealth of citizens and climate in comparison to the Central and Eastern European countries or Germany), they demonstrate that the users included in our sample generally feel inclined to the smart homes technologies and perceive them as a plausible means for improving the safety and security of their lives. On the other hand, some respondents from our sample expressed their concerns over the cybersecurity and technology dependence issues associated with smart homes. It is also apparent that younger respondents (aged 16&ndash;35) featured in our research are more worried about their personal data being monitored and analyzed (with a pending threat of leakages). All these results are original and constitute an important scientific value-added to the field of research in smart home technologies and their acceptance by the general public. We demonstrate that the further enhancement of smart homes, and the increase of their popularity and affordability among the customers both in the Central and Eastern European countries and beyond, might depend on the development of the smart grids which these smart homes are an integral part of. The reliability of the smart systems constitutes the key element for achieving the satisfaction of the smart homes residents, and hence needs to be achieved and secured in an effective way. This would ensure the right mix and balance of energy security and efficiency for all customers involved in this process.

AB  - This paper investigates the opportunities offered by floating car data (FCD) to infer delivering activities. A discrete trip-chain order model (within the random utility theory) for light goods vehicles (laden weight less than 3.5 tons) is hence proposed, which characterizes delivery tours in terms of the number of stops/deliveries performed. Thus, the main goal of the study is to calibrate a discrete choice model to estimate the number of stops/deliveries per tour by using FCD, which can be incorporated in a planning procedure for obtaining a preliminary assessment of parking demand. The data used refer to light goods vehicles operating in the Veneto region. The database contains more than 8000 tours undertaken in 60 working days. Satisfactory results have been obtained in terms of tour estimation and model transferability.

AB  - The recent advance in information technology has created a new era named the Internet of Things (IoT). This new technology allows objects (things) to be connected to the Internet, such as smart TVs, printers, cameras, smartphones, smartwatches, etc. This trend provides new services and applications for many users and enhances their lifestyle. The rapid growth of the IoT makes the incorporation and connection of several devices a predominant procedure. Although there are many advantages of IoT devices, there are different challenges that come as network anomalies. In this research, the current studies in the use of deep learning (DL) in DDoS intrusion detection have been presented. This research aims to implement different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in WEKA tools to analyze the detection performance for DDoS attacks using the most recent CICDDoS2019 datasets. CICDDoS2019 was found to be the model with best results. This research has used six different types of ML algorithms which are K_Nearest_Neighbors (K-NN), super vector machine (SVM), na&iuml;ve bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR). The best accuracy result in the presented evaluation was achieved when utilizing the Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, 99% and 99%, respectively. However, the DT is better than RF because it has a shorter computation time, 4.53 s and 84.2 s, respectively. Finally, open issues for further research in future work are presented.

AB  - Cloud robotics and advanced communications can foster a step-change in cooperative robots and hybrid wireless sensor networks (H-WSN) for demanding environments (e.g., disaster response, mining, demolition, and nuclear sites) by enabling the timely sharing of data and computational resources between robot and human teams. However, the operational complexity of such multi-agent systems requires defining effective architectures, coping with implementation details, and testing in realistic deployments. This article proposes X-IoCA, an Internet of robotic things (IoRT) and communication architecture consisting of a hybrid and heterogeneous network of wireless transceivers (H2WTN), based on LoRa and BLE technologies, and a robot operating system (ROS) network. The IoRT is connected to a feedback information system (FIS) distributed among multi-access edge computing (MEC) centers. Furthermore, we present SAR-IoCA, an implementation of the architecture for search and rescue (SAR) integrated into a 5G network. The FIS for this application consists of an SAR-FIS (including a path planner for UGVs considering risks detected by a LoRa H-WSN) and an ROS-FIS (for real-time monitoring and processing of information published throughout the ROS network). Moreover, we discuss lessons learned from using SAR-IoCA in a realistic exercise where three UGVs, a UAV, and responders collaborated to rescue victims from a tunnel accessible through rough terrain.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper presents an internet of things (IoTs) enabled smart meter with energy-efficient simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) for the wireless powered smart grid communication network. The SWIPT technique with energy harvesting (EH) is an attractive solution for prolonging the battery life of ultra-low power devices. The motivation for energy efficiency (EE) maximization is to increase the efficient use of energy and improve the battery life of the IoT devices embedded in smart meter. In the system model, the smart meter is equipped with an IoT device, which implements the SWIPT technique in power splitting (PS) mode. This paper aims at the EE maximization and considers the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing distributed antenna system (OFDM-DAS) for the smart meters in the downlink with IoT enabled PS-SWIPT system. The EE maximization is a nonlinear and non-convex optimization problem. We propose an optimal power allocation algorithm for the non-convex EE maximization problem by the Lagrange method and proportional fairness to optimal power allocation among smart meters. The proposed algorithm shows a clear advantage, where total power consumption is considered in the EE maximization with energy constraints. Furthermore, EE vs. spectral efficiency (SE) tradeoff is investigated. The results of our algorithm reveal that EE improves with EH requirements.

TI  - Smart Homes as Enablers for Depression Pre-Diagnosis Using PHQ-9 on HMI through Fuzzy Logic Decision System

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Depression is a common mental illness characterized by sadness, lack of interest, or pleasure. According to the DSM-5, there are nine symptoms, from which an individual must present 4 or 5 in the last two weeks to fulfill the diagnosis criteria of depression. Nevertheless, the common methods that health care professionals use to assess and monitor depression symptoms are face-to-face questionnaires leading to time-consuming or expensive methods. On the other hand, smart homes can monitor householders&rsquo; health through smart devices such as smartphones, wearables, cameras, or voice assistants connected to the home. Although the depression disorders at smart homes are commonly oriented to the senior sector, depression affects all of us. Therefore, even though an expert needs to diagnose the depression disorder, questionnaires as the PHQ-9 help spot any depressive symptomatology as a pre-diagnosis. Thus, this paper proposes a three-step framework; the first step assesses the nine questions to the end-user through ALEXA or a gamified HMI. Then, a fuzzy logic decision system considers three actions based on the nine responses. Finally, the last step considers these three actions: continue monitoring through Alexa and the HMI, suggest specialist referral, and mandatory specialist referral.

AB  - Currently, a smart city is an emerging field in urban cities to improve the quality of life through information and communication technology (ICT). In general, the traditional solid waste management (SWM) approach taken by municipal authorities for waste collection in urban areas must be enhanced to achieve the green and smart city goals. This article is primarily focused on the progress of ICT technologies in solid waste management. With that aim, a thorough analysis is carried out in the article, and from the analysis, we have identified distinct ICT technologies that have been implemented in SWM. The function, application, and limitations of each technology are presented in the article. From the review, it is concluded that the implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in minimizing the negative impact of waste on the environment. It is also identified that selection of the appropriate wireless communication protocol is critical during the implementation of IoT-based system because the sensor node at the bins is battery-powered. In addition, it is analysed that blockchain technology plays an essential role in realizing the waste&ndash;money model, as this model includes transactions between users and recyclers. Finally, in this article, we propose that the waste-to-money model, local network and gateway architecture, vision node, and customized prototype improve solid waste management system in terms of communication, energy consumption, and real-time monitoring.

AB  - The detection of buildings in the city is essential in several geospatial domains and for decision-making regarding intelligence for city planning, tax collection, project management, revenue generation, and smart cities, among other areas. In the past, the classical approach used for building detection was by using the imagery and it entailed human&ndash;computer interaction, which was a daunting proposition. To tackle this task, a novel network based on an end-to-end deep learning framework is proposed to detect and classify buildings features. The proposed CNN has three parallel stream channels: the first is the high-resolution aerial imagery, while the second stream is the digital surface model (DSM). The third was fixed on extracting deep features using the fusion of channel one and channel two, respectively. Furthermore, the channel has eight group convolution blocks of 2D convolution with three max-pooling layers. The proposed model&rsquo;s efficiency and dependability were tested on three different categories of complex urban building structures in the study area. Then, morphological operations were applied to the extracted building footprints to increase the uniformity of the building boundaries and produce improved building perimeters. Thus, our approach bridges a significant gap in detecting building objects in diverse environments; the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of the proposed method are greater than 80% and 0.605, respectively. The findings support the proposed framework and methodologies&rsquo; efficacy and effectiveness at extracting buildings from complex environments.

AB  - Recently, technology utilizing ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors for robot localization in an indoor environment where the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) cannot be used has begun to be actively studied. UWB-based positioning has the advantage of being able to work even in an environment lacking feature points, which is a limitation of positioning using existing vision- or LiDAR-based sensing. However, UWB-based positioning requires the pre-installation of UWB anchors and the precise location of coordinates. In addition, when using a sensor that measures only the one-dimensional distance between the UWB anchor and the tag, there is a limitation whereby the position of the robot is solved but the orientation cannot be acquired. To overcome this, a framework based on an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter that tightly integrates an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor and a UWB sensor is proposed in this paper. However, UWB-based distance measurement introduces large errors in multipath environments with obstacles or walls between the anchor and the tag, which degrades positioning performance. Therefore, we propose a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) robust UWB ranging model to improve the pose estimation performance. Finally, the localization performance of the proposed framework is verified through experiments in real indoor environments.

AB  - The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as base station (BS) is gaining popularity. In this paper, we consider maximization of the overall data rate by intelligent deployment of UAV BS in the downlink of a cellular system. We investigate a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided approach to optimize the position of flying BSs mounted on board UAVs to support a macro BS (MBS). We propose an algorithm to avoid collision between multiple UAVs undergoing exploratory movements and to restrict UAV BSs movement within a predefined area. Q-learning technique is used to optimize UAV BS position, where the reward is equal to sum of user equipment (UE) data rates. We consider a framework where the UAV BSs carry out exploratory movements in the beginning and exploitary movements in later stages to maximize the overall data rate. Our results show that a cellular system with three UAV BSs and one MBS serving 72 UE reaches 69.2% of the best possible data rate, which is identified by brute force search. Finally, the RL algorithm is compared with a K-means algorithm to study the need of accurate UE locations. Our results show that the RL algorithm outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm when the measure of imperfection is higher. The proposed algorithm can be made use of by a practical MBS&ndash;UAV BSs&ndash;UEs system to provide protection to UAV BSs while maximizing data rate.

AB  - Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as an advancement over the traditional Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) towards achieving a more efficient intelligent transportation system that is capable of providing various intelligent services and supporting different applications for the drivers and passengers on roads. In order for the IoV and VANETs environments to be able to offer such beneficial road services, huge amounts of data are generated and exchanged among the different communicated entities in these vehicular networks wirelessly via open channels, which could attract the adversaries and threaten the network with several possible types of security attacks. In this survey, we target the authentication part of the security system while highlighting the efficiency of blockchains in the IoV and VANETs environments. First, a detailed background on IoV and blockchain is provided, followed by a wide range of security requirements, challenges, and possible attacks in vehicular networks. Then, a more focused review is provided on the recent blockchain-based authentication schemes in IoV and VANETs with a detailed comparative study in terms of techniques used, network models, evaluation tools, and attacks counteracted. Lastly, some future challenges for IoV security are discussed that are necessary to be addressed in the upcoming research.

AB  - The paper addresses the problem of insufficient knowledge on the impact of noise on the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model identification. The work offers a simulation-based solution to the analysis of the tolerance to noise of ARIMA models in electrical load forecasting. In the study, an idealized ARIMA model obtained from real load data of the Polish power system was disturbed by noise of different levels. The model was then re-identified, its parameters were estimated, and new forecasts were calculated. The experiment allowed us to evaluate the robustness of ARIMA models to noise in their ability to predict electrical load time series. It could be concluded that the reaction of the ARIMA model to random disturbances of the modeled time series was relatively weak. The limiting noise level at which the forecasting ability of the model collapsed was determined. The results highlight the key role of the data preprocessing stage in data mining and learning. They contribute to more accurate decision making in an uncertain environment, help to shape energy policy, and have implications for the sustainability and reliability of power systems.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Recently, remote sensing satellite image analysis has received significant attention from geo-information scientists. However, the current geo-information systems lack automatic detection of several building characteristics inside the high-resolution satellite images. The accurate extraction of buildings characteristics helps the decision-makers to optimize urban planning and achieve better decisions. Furthermore, Building orientation angle is a very critical parameter in the accuracy of automated building detection algorithms. However, the traditional computer vision techniques lack accuracy, scalability, and robustness for building orientation angle detection. This paper proposes two different approaches to deep building orientation angle estimation in the high-resolution satellite image. Firstly, we propose a transfer deep learning approach for our estimation task. Secondly, we propose a novel optimized DCRN network consisting of pre-processing, scaled gradient layer, deep convolutional units, dropout layers, and regression end layer. The early proposed gradient layer helps the DCRN network to extract more helpful information and increase its performance. We have collected a building benchmark dataset that consists of building images in Riyadh city. The images used in the experiments are 15,190 buildings images. In our experiments, we have compared our proposed approaches and the other approaches in the literature. The proposed system has achieved the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) value of 1.24, the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16, and the highest adjusted R-squared value of 0.99 using the RMS optimizer. The cost of processing time of our proposed DCRN architecture is 0.0113 &plusmn; 0.0141 s. Our proposed approach has proven its stability with the input building image contrast variation for all orientation angles. Our experimental results are promising, and it is suggested to be utilized in other building characteristics estimation tasks in high-resolution satellite images.

AB  - Typical applications of wireless sensor networks (WSN), such as in Industry 4.0 and smart cities, involves acquiring and processing large amounts of data in federated systems. Important challenges arise for machine learning algorithms in this scenario, such as reducing energy consumption and minimizing data exchange between devices in different zones. This paper introduces a novel method for accelerated training of parallel Support Vector Machines (pSVMs), based on ensembles, tailored to these kinds of problems. To achieve this, the training set is split into several Voronoi regions. These regions are small enough to permit faster parallel training of SVMs, reducing computational payload. Results from experiments comparing the proposed method with a single SVM and a standard ensemble of SVMs demonstrate that this approach can provide comparable performance while limiting the number of regions required to solve classification tasks. These advantages facilitate the development of energy-efficient policies in WSN.

AB  - Recently, more and more solutions have utilised artificial intelligence approaches in order to enhance or optimise processes to achieve greater sustainability. One of the most pressing issues is the emissions caused by cars; in this paper, the problem of optimising the route of delivery cars is tackled. In this paper, the applicability of the deep reinforcement learning algorithms with regards to the aforementioned problem is tested on a simulation game designed and implemented to pose various challenges such as constant change of delivery locations. The algorithms chosen for this task are Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) with and without Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). These novel and advanced reinforcement learning algorithms have yet not been utilised in similar scenarios. The differences in performance and learning process of those are visualised and discussed. It is demonstrated that both of those algorithms present a slow but steady learning curve, which is an expected effect of reinforcement learning algorithms, leading to a conclusion that the algorithms would discover an optimal policy with an adequately long learning process. Additionally, the benefits of the Proximal Policy Optimisation algorithm are proven by the enhanced learning curve with comparison to the Advantage Actor-Critic approach, as the learning process is characterised by faster growth with a significantly smaller variation. Finally, the applicability of such algorithms in the described scenarios is discussed, alongside the possible improvements and future work.

AB  - Today&rsquo;s cities face numerous challenges due to climate change and urbanization. The concept of a smart city aims to help cities to address these challenges by adapting modern information and communication technology. Smart mobility and transportation form one important aspect of smart cities. Inefficient mobility in cities can lead to problems such as traffic congestion, which results in frustration for residents and a decrease in the quality of life. Against the backdrop of global warming, cities also strive to reduce CO2 emissions, an attempt which requires sustainable and novel mobility concepts. Blockchain is a current technology, said to have huge potential, that is being investigated for application in many facets of smart cities. In the context of smart mobility, blockchain can be used for transactions relating to ridesharing and electric charging, handling of interactions of platoon members, or serving as a foundation for communication between vehicles. Although initial research about this topic exists, it is distributed among different use-cases and applications. This article conducts a systematic literature review to analyze blockchain&rsquo;s role in mobility and transportation in smart cities, and its potential to increase efficiency in these areas. With this review, we aim to consolidate and summarize the current knowledge about this topic. As a first result, we present the findings from our literature review, which can be divided into five categories of use-cases. We also present a platform for further research about this emerging topic by identifying promising future research avenues. For this purpose, we derive a future research agenda based on our findings.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has already gained the attention of the researchers involved in smart city (SC) initiatives, along with other advanced technologies such as IoT, big data, cloud computing, or analytics. In this context, researchers also realized that data can help in making the SC happen but also, the open data movement has encouraged more research works using machine learning. Based on this line of reasoning, the aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review to investigate open data-based machine learning applications in the six different areas of smart cities. The results of this research reveal that: (a) machine learning applications using open data came out in all the SC areas and specific ML techniques are discovered for each area, with deep learning and supervised learning being the first choices. (b) Open data platforms represent the most frequently used source of data. (c) The challenges associated with open data utilization vary from quality of data, to frequency of data collection, to consistency of data, and data format. Overall, the data synopsis as well as the in-depth analysis may be a valuable support and inspiration for the future smart city projects.

AB  - The role of energy is cardinal for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the enhancement and modernization of energy generation and management practices. The smart grid enables efficient communication between utilities and the end- users, and enhances the user experience by monitoring and controlling the energy transmission. The smart grid deals with an enormous amount of energy data, and the absence of proper techniques for data collection, processing, monitoring and decision-making ultimately makes the system ineffective. Big data analytics, in association with the smart grid, enable better grid visualization and contribute toward the attainment of sustainability. The current research work deals with the achievement of sustainability in the smart grid and efficient data management using big data analytics, that has social, economic, technical and political impacts. This study provides clear insights into energy data generated in the grid and the possibilities of energy theft affecting the sustainable future. The paper provides insights about the importance of big data analytics, with their effects on the smart grids&rsquo; performance towards the achievement of SDGs. The work highlights efficient real-time energy data management involving artificial intelligence and machine learning for a better future, to short out the effects of the conventional smart grid without big data analytics. Finally, the work discusses the challenges and future directions to improve smart grid technologies with big data analytics in action.

AB  - In the recent years, the health and wellness tourism industry has become one of the new emerging industries in Pakistan. In terms of the sharing economy, the driving mechanism of the health and wellness tourism industry has undergone significant changes. Based on a combination of theoretical and practical research, the paper explores the dynamic system and mechanism of innovation development of health and wellness in the tourism industry in Pakistan. Firstly, it theoretically constructs the driving factors in four aspects, which include market demand, industrial supply, infrastructure, and external environment. Secondly, taking Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province (KPK) as an example, it uses the entropy method and Grey relational analysis to test the driving factors system. The empirical results show that four aspects jointly influence the innovation of the health and wellness tourism industry in Pakistan. Finally, this study discusses several practical implications for the development of the health and wellness tourism industry of KPK for academics, policymakers, business owners, and scholars, with recommendations for future research.

AB  - Cities in the 21st century play a major role in the sustainability and climate impact reduction challenges set by the European agenda. As the population of cities grows and their environmental impact becomes more evident, the European strategy aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions&mdash;the main cause of climate change. Measures to reduce the impact of climate change include reducing energy consumption, improving mobility, harnessing resources and renewable energies, integrating nature-based solutions and efficiently managing infrastructure. The monitoring and control of all this activity is essential for its proper functioning. In this context, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a key role in the digitisation, monitoring, and managing of these different verticals. Urban data platforms support cities on extracting Key Performance Indicators (KPI) in their efforts to make better decisions. Cities must be transformed by applying efficient urban planning measures and taking into account not only technological aspects, but also by applying a holistic vision in building solutions where citizens are at the centre. In addition, standardisation of platforms where applications are integrated as one is necessary. This requires interoperability between different verticals. This article presents the information platform developed for the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain. The platform is based on the UNE 178104 standard to provide a holistic architecture that integrates information from the different urban planning measures implemented in the city. The platform was constructed in the context of the SmartEnCity project following the urban transformation strategy established by the city. The article presents the value-added solutions implemented in the platform. These solutions have been developed by applying co-creation techniques in which stakeholders have been involved throughout the process. The platform proposes a step forward towards standardization, harmonises the integration of data from multiple vertical, provides interoperability between services, and simplifies scalability and replicability due to its microservice architecture.

TI  - Future Shift for &lsquo;Big Things&rsquo;: From Starchitecture via Agritecture to Parkitecture

VL  - 7
IS  - 4
SN  - 2199-8531

AB  - This article analyses three recent shifts in what called the geography of &lsquo;Big Things&rsquo;, meaning the contemporary functions and adaptability of modern city centre architecture. We periodise the three styles conventionally into the fashionable &lsquo;Starchitecture&rsquo; of the 1990s, the repurposed &lsquo;Agritecture&rsquo; of the 2000s and the parodising &lsquo;Parkitecture&rsquo; of the 2010s. Starchitecture was the form of new architecture coinciding with the rise of neo-liberalism in its brief era of global urban competitiveness prevalent in the 1990s. After the Great Financial Crash of 2007&ndash;2008, the market for high-rise emblems of iconic, thrusting, skyscrapers and giant downtown and suburban shopping malls waned and online shopping and working from home destroyed the main rental values of the CBD. In some illustrious cases, &lsquo;Agritecture&rsquo; caused re-purposed office blocks and other CBD accompaniments to be re-purposed as settings for high-rise urban farming, especially aquaponics and hydroponic horticulture. Now, COVID-19 has further undermined traditional CBD property markets, causing some administrations to decide to bulldoze their &lsquo;deadmalls&rsquo; and replace them with urban prairie landscapes, inviting the designation &lsquo;Parkitecture&rsquo; for the bucolic results. This paper presents an account of these transitions with reference to questions raised by urban cultural scholars such as Jane M. Jacobs and Jean Gottmann to figure out answers in time and space to questions their work poses.

TI  - A Survey of Recent Indoor Localization Scenarios and Methodologies
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 23
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recently, various novel scenarios have been studied for indoor localization. The trilateration is known as a classic theoretical model of geometric-based indoor localization, with uniform RSSI data that can be transferred directly into distance ranges. Then, a trilateration solution can be algebraically acquired from theses ranges, in order to fix user&rsquo;s actual location. However, the collected RSSI or other measurement data should be further processed and classified to lower the localization error rate, instead of using the raw data influenced by multi-path effect, multiple nonlinear interference and noises. In this survey, a large number of existing techniques are presented for different indoor network structures and channel conditions, divided as LOS (light-of-sight) and NLOS (non light-of-sight). Besides, the input measurement data such as RSSI (received signal strength indication), TDOA (time difference of arrival), DOA (distance of arrival), and RTT (round trip time) are studied towards different application scenarios. The key localization techniques like RSSI-based fingerprinting technique are presented using supervised machine learning methods, namely SVM (support vector machine), KNN (K nearest neighbors) and NN (neural network) methods, especially in an offline training phase. Other unsupervised methods as isolation forest, k-means, and expectation maximization methods are utilized to further improve the localization accuracy in online testing phase. For Bayesian filtering methods, apart from the basic linear Kalman filter (LKF) methods, nonlinear stochastic filters such as extended KF, cubature KF, unscented KF and particle filters are introduced. These nonlinear methods are more suitable for dynamic localization models. In addition to the localization accuracy, the other important performance features and evaluation aspects are presented in our paper: scalability, stability, reliability, and the complexity of proposed algorithms is compared in this survey. Our paper provides a comprehensive perspective to compare the existing techniques and related practical localization models, with the aim of improving localization accuracy and reducing the complexity of the system.

The goal is to research what applications are being implemented in fog computing architectures and how the temporal requirements of these applications are being addressed. We also carried out a comprehensive analysis of the articles surveyed and separate them into categories, according to a pattern found in them. Our research is important for the area of real-time systems since the concept of systems that respond in real time has presented various understandings and concepts. This variability of concept has been due to the growing requirements for fast data communication and processing. Therefore, we present different concepts of real-time and near real-time systems found in the literature and currently accepted by the academic-scientific community. Finally, we conduct an analytical discussion of the characteristics and proposal of articles.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Electric vehicles must improve their electric drive system efficiency and effectively use their limited energy to become a viable means of transportation. As such, these technologies have undergone substantial improvements from their initial conception. More efficient powertrains, together with improved storage technologies, have enabled more extended autonomy. However, from an engineering perspective, these systems are still a key area of research and optimization. This work presents a powertrain optimization methodology, developing energy savings and improving the performance of the electric vehicle by focusing on the differential. The proposed methodology includes a study of the dynamics of the electric vehicle and the generation of a mathematical model that represents it. By simulating the vehicle and varying the final ratio of the differential, a significant optimization for energy savings is obtained by developing a standardized driving cycle. In this case, NEDC, WLTC-2, and WLTC-3 test cycles are used. The results show that a short ratio improves performance, even if this implies a larger torque from the prime mover. Depending on the operating cycle used, an energy-saving between 3% and 8% was registered. An extended energy autonomy and an increment in the life-cycle of the batteries are expected in real driving scenarios.

AB  - The main objective of the present research is to identify the advantages and benefits that the use and implementation of 5G technology has on the development and evolution of the Romanian business environment. The study is based on a theoretical documentation regarding existing information in the field and a descriptive analysis of the evolution of the technology in Romania and worldwide. The research method chosen is a survey based on an opinion poll (questionnaire) to find out the availability of economic entities regarding the implementation of 5G technologies, the foreseen expectations and those realized by the business environment regarding the effects of 5G technologies on the economic activities and the benefits that 5G networks offer them. The analysis of the results of the questionnaire, through the correlations and contingency tables determined, allowed the validation of the research hypotheses, and the results show availability and interest for the implementation of 5G technology (over 69% agree with the 5G implementation over a period of up to 5 years), conditioned by the costs, the high degree of cyber security, and the competitive advantages it can generate. Competition, low productivity, and even external pressures are the main decisive factors in the implementation of 5G. Thus, it can be considered useful to extend the research by identifying possible viable solutions or alternatives, customized for the implementation of 5G technologies for economic entities from different sectors, as well as the analysis of the implementation costs and the potential economic benefits.

We introduce a new IoT device for paper roll supply management in bathrooms and kitchens, both for homes and businesses, that is extremely cost effective and battery power-efficient. The device can be installed on practically any paper roll dispenser and makes use of existing Wi-Fi infrastructure. Despite Wi-Fi&rsquo;s reputation as &ldquo;unsupportive for power saving,&rdquo; we introduce and experimentally validate a methodology for using Wi-Fi networks with low power utilization, resulting in a system that provides very good management of paper supplies while only requiring battery charging once every 3&ndash;4 months. The new device has the potential to provide more households and businesses with real-time, data-driven automated supply chains.

AB  - Data marketplaces are expected to play a crucial role in tomorrow&rsquo;s data economy, but such marketplaces are seldom commercially viable. Currently, there is no clear understanding of the knowledge gaps in data marketplace research, especially not of neglected research topics that may advance such marketplaces toward commercialization. This study provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of data marketplace research. We employ a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach to examine 133 academic articles and structure our analysis using the Service-Technology-Organization-Finance (STOF) model. We find that the extant data marketplace literature is primarily dominated by technical research, such as discussions about computational pricing and architecture. To move past the first stage of the platform&rsquo;s lifecycle (i.e., platform design) to the second stage (i.e., platform adoption), we call for empirical research in non-technological areas, such as customer expected value and market segmentation.

T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Buildings&rsquo; heating and cooling systems account for an important part of total energy consumption. The EU&rsquo;s directives and engagements motivate building owners and relevant stakeholders in the energy and construction sectors towards net zero energy buildings by maximizing the use of renewable energy sources, ICT, and automation systems. However, the high costs of investment for the renovation of buildings, in situ use of renewable energy production, and installation of expensive ICT infrastructure and automation systems in small&ndash;medium range buildings are the main obstacles for the wide adoption of EU building directives in small- and medium-range buildings. On the other hand, the concept of sharing computational and data storage resources among various buildings can be an alternative approach to achieving smart buildings and smart cities where the main control power resides on a server. Unlike other studies that focus on the implementation of AI techniques in a building or separated buildings with local processing resources and data storage, in this work a corporate server was employed to control the heating systems in three building typologies and to examine the potential benefits of controlling existing buildings in a unified energy-savings platform. The key finding of this work is that the AI algorithms incorporated into the proposed system achieved significant energy savings in the order of 20&ndash;40% regardless of building typology, building functionality, and type of heating system, despite the COVID-19 measures for frequent ventilation of the buildings, even in cases with older-type heating systems.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - New approaches and techniques are required for environmental management in workplaces that emit pollutants. The best available techniques (BATs) that are suggested by the integrated environmental permit system (IEPS) play a pivotal role in providing state-of-the-art approaches and techniques to workplaces. For the workplaces that install facilities with the BATs, it is necessary to perform real-time monitoring to determine whether pollutant emission facilities and treatment facilities are operating normally and whether such facilities can maintain the optimal condition during the emission of pollutants. The environmental management measures used before the IEPS had limitations for workplaces that are subjected to integrated environmental management because they consider the entire workplace as a single pollution source by combining all media. In addition, only the emission concentrations and amounts of pollutants were monitored because only the points at which most pollutants are discharged, i.e., stacks for air pollutant emission facilities and final effluent outlets for water pollutant emission facilities, are monitored. These monitoring approaches in a variety of facilities involve considerable costs, and most of them (95% for stacks in workplaces under IEPS, Korea) cannot perform real-time observation even though some of them are capable of it (5% for stacks managed by Tele Monitoring System, TMS). In this study, the applicability of a wireless sensor monitoring network was examined as a new approach for environmental management in workplaces. Based on the sensor monitoring network, surrogate parameters that can indirectly monitor the critical operating factors of pollutant emission and prevention facilities were developed and then measured in real time to examine the status of these facilities. Surrogate parameters can be used instead of directly measuring pollutants as the former has high efficiency, such as cost reduction, and can provide reliable data on the emission characteristics of pollutants. The wireless network is based on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform under real-time conditions in the emission and production facilities in a workplace. This study suggested that a wireless network using the IoT platform improves the BAT assessment methodology to understand the efficiency of environmental pollution reduction and the economic contribution to the workplace.

TI  - A QoS-Aware Machine Learning-Based Framework for AMI Applications in Smart Grids

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 23
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT) enables a diverse set of applications such as distribution automation, smart cities, wireless sensor networks, and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). In smart grids (SGs), quality of service (QoS) and AMI traffic management need to be considered in the design of efficient AMI architectures. In this article, we propose a QoS-aware machine-learning-based framework for AMI applications in smart grids. Our proposed framework comprises a three-tier hierarchical architecture for AMI applications, a machine-learning-based hierarchical clustering approach, and a priority-based scheduling technique to ensure QoS in AMI applications in smart grids. We introduce a three-tier hierarchical architecture for AMI applications in smart grids to take advantage of IoT communication technologies and the cloud infrastructure. In this architecture, smart meters are deployed over a georeferenced area where the control center has remote access over the Internet to these network devices. More specifically, these devices can be digitally controlled and monitored using simple web interfaces such as REST APIs. We modify the existing K-means algorithm to construct a hierarchical clustering topology that employs Wi-SUN technology for bi-directional communication between smart meters and data concentrators. Further, we develop a queuing model in which different priorities are assigned to each item of the critical and normal AMI traffic based on its latency and packet size. The critical AMI traffic is scheduled first using priority-based scheduling while the normal traffic is scheduled with a first-in&ndash;first-out scheduling scheme to ensure the QoS requirements of both traffic classes in the smart grid network. The numerical results demonstrate that the target coverage and connectivity requirements of all smart meters are fulfilled with the least number of data concentrators in the design. Additionally, the numerical results show that the architectural cost is reduced, and the bottleneck problem of the data concentrator is eliminated. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated and validated on the CloudSim simulator. The simulation results of our proposed framework show efficient performance in terms of CPU utilization compared to a traditional framework that uses single-hop communication from smart meters to data concentrators with a first-in&ndash;first-out scheduling scheme.

AB  - Smart transportation a smart city application where traditional individual models are transforming to shared and distributed ownership. These models are used to serve commuters for inter- and intra-city travel. However, short-range urban transportation services within campuses, residential compounds, and public parks are not explored to their full capacity compared to the distributed vehicle model. This paper aims to explore and design an adequate framework for battery-operated shared mobility within a large community for short-range travel. This work identifies the characteristics of the shared mobility for battery-operated vehicles and accordingly proposes an adequate solution that deals with real-time data collection, tracking, and automated decisions. Furthermore, given the requirement for real-time decisions with low latency for critical requests, the paper deploys the proposed framework within the 3-tier computing model, namely edge, fog, and cloud tiers. The solution design considers the power consumption requirement at the edge by offloading the computational requests to the fog tier and utilizing the LoRaWAN communication technology. A prototype implementation is presented to validate the proposed framework for a university campus using e-bikes. The results show the scalability of the proposed design and the achievement of low latency for requests that require real-time decisions.

AB  - The demand for the digital monitoring of environmental ecosystems is high and growing rapidly as a means of protecting the public and managing the environment. However, before data, algorithms, and models can be mobilized at scale, there are considerable concerns associated with privacy and security that can negatively affect the adoption of technology within this domain. In this paper, we propose the advancement of electronic environmental monitoring through the capability provided by the blockchain. The blockchain&rsquo;s use of a distributed ledger as its underlying infrastructure is an attractive approach to counter these privacy and security issues, although its performance and ability to manage sensor data must be assessed. We focus on a new distributed ledger technology for the IoT, called IOTA, that is based on a directed acyclic graph. IOTA overcomes the current limitations of the blockchain and offers a data communication protocol called masked authenticated messaging for secure data sharing among Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We show how the application layer employing the data communication protocol, MAM, can support the secure transmission, storage, and retrieval of encrypted environmental sensor data by using an immutable distributed ledger such as that shown in IOTA. Finally, we evaluate, compare, and analyze the performance of the MAM protocol against a non-protocol approach.

AB  - Recent years have seen the rapid adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, where billions of physical devices are interconnected to provide data sensing, computing and actuating capabilities. IoT-based systems have been extensively deployed across various sectors, such as smart homes, smart cities, smart transport, smart logistics and so forth. Newer paradigms such as edge computing are developed to facilitate computation and data intelligence to be performed closer to IoT devices, hence reducing latency for time-sensitive tasks. However, IoT applications are increasingly being deployed in remote and difficult to reach areas for edge computing scenarios. These deployment locations make upgrading application and dealing with software failures difficult. IoT applications are also increasingly being deployed as containers which offer increased remote management ability but are more complex to configure. This paper proposes an approach for effectively managing, updating and re-configuring container-based IoT software as efficiently, scalably and reliably as possible with minimal downtime upon the detection of software failures. The approach is evaluated using docker container-based IoT application deployments in an edge computing scenario.

AB  - Due to the increasing use of private cars for urbanization and urban transport, the travel time of urban transportation is increasing. People spend a lot of time in the streets, and the queue length of waiting increases accordingly; this has direct effects on fuel consumption too. Traffic flow forecasts and traffic light schedules were studied separately in the urban traffic system. This paper presents a new stable TS (Takagi&ndash;Sugeno) fuzzy controller for urban traffic. The state-space dynamics are utilized to formulate both the vehicle&rsquo;s average waiting time at an isolated intersection and the length of queues. A fuzzy intelligent controller is designed for light control based upon the length of the queue, and eventually, the system&rsquo;s stability is proved using the Lyapunov theorem. Moreover, the input variables are the length of queue and number of input or output vehicles from each lane. The simulation results describe the appearance of the proposed controller. An illustrative example is also given to show the proposed method&rsquo;s effectiveness; the suggested method is more efficient than both the conventional fuzzy traffic controllers and the fixed time controller.

AB  - The recent development in the area of IoT technologies is likely to be implemented extensively in the next decade. There is a great increase in the crime rate, and the handling officers are responsible for dealing with a broad range of cyber and Internet issues during investigation. IoT technologies are helpful in the identification of suspects, and few technologies are available that use IoT and deep learning together for face sketch synthesis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other constructs of deep learning have become major tools in recent approaches. A new-found architecture of the neural network is anticipated in this work. It is called Spiral-Net, which is a modified version of U-Net fto perform face sketch synthesis (the phase is known as the compiler network C here). Spiral-Net performs in combination with a pre-trained Vgg-19 network called the feature extractor F. It first identifies the top n matches from viewed sketches to a given photo. F is again used to formulate a feature map based on the cosine distance of a candidate sketch formed by C from the top n matches. A customized CNN configuration (called the discriminator D) then computes loss functions based on differences between the candidate sketch and the feature. Values of these loss functions alternately update C and F. The ensemble of these nets is trained and tested on selected datasets, including CUFS, CUFSF, and a part of the IIT photo&ndash;sketch dataset. Results of this modified U-Net are acquired by the legacy NLDA (1998) scheme of face recognition and its newer version, OpenBR (2013), which demonstrate an improvement of 5% compared with the current state of the art in its relevant domain.

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Twenty-three rainfall events were monitored to determine the characteristics of the stormwater runoff entering a rain garden facility and evaluate its performance in terms of pollutant removal and volume reduction. Data gathered during the five-year monitoring period were utilized to develop a deep learning-based model that can predict the concentrations of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP). Findings revealed that the rain garden was capable of effectively reducing solids, organics, nutrients, and heavy metals from stormwater runoff during the five-year period when hydrologic and climate conditions have changed. Volume reduction was also high but can decrease over time due to the accumulation of solids in the facility which reduced the infiltration capacity and increased ponding and overflows especially during heavy rainfalls. A preliminary development of a water quality prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture was also developed to be able to potentially reduce the labor and costs associated with on-site monitoring in the future. The LSTM model predicted pollutant concentrations that are close to the actual values with a mean square error of 0.36 during calibration and a less than 10% difference from the measured values during validation. The study showed the potential of using deep learning architecture for the prediction of stormwater quality parameters entering rain gardens. While this study is still in the preliminary stage, it can potentially be improved for use in performance monitoring, decision-making regarding maintenance, and design of similar technologies in the future.

AB  - Urban Building Energy Modelling (UBEM) requires adequate geometrical information to represent buildings in a 3D digital form. However, open data models usually lack essential information, such as building geometries, due to a lower granularity in available data. For heating demand simulations, this scarcity impacts the energy predictions and, thereby, questioning existing simulation workflows. In this paper, the authors present an open-source CityGML LoD Transformation (CityLDT) tool for upscaling or downscaling geometries of 3D spatial CityGML building models. With the current support of LoD0&ndash;2, this paper presents the adapted methodology and developed algorithms for transformations. Using the presented tool, the authors transform open CityGML datasets and conduct heating demand simulations in Modelica to validate the geometric processing of transformed building models.

AB  - Since 2020, the world is still facing a global economic and health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One approach to fighting this global crisis is to track COVID-19 cases by wireless technologies, which requires receiving reliable, efficient, and accurate data. Consequently, this article proposes a model based on Lagrange optimization and a distributed deep learning model to assure that all required data for tracking any suspected COVID-19 patient is received efficiently and reliably. Finding the optimum location of the Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) reader relevant to the base station results in the reliable transmission of data. The proposed deep learning model, developed using the one-dimensional convolutional neural network and a fully connected network, resulted in lower mean absolute squared errors when compared to state-of-the-art regression benchmarks. The proposed model based on Lagrange optimization and deep learning algorithms is evaluated when changing different network parameters, such as requiring signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio, reader transmission power, and the required system quality-of-service. The analysis of the obtained results, which indicates the appropriate transmission distance between an RFID reader and a base station, shows the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed approach, which leads to an easy and efficient tracking system.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The role of a service that is dedicated to road weather analysis is to issue forecasts and warnings to users regarding roadway conditions, thereby making it possible to anticipate dangerous traffic conditions, especially during the winter period. It is important to define pavement conditions at all times. In this paper, a new data acquisition approach is proposed that is based upon the analysis and combination of two sensors in real time by nanocomputer. The first sensor is a camera that records images and videos of the road network. The second sensor is a microphone that records the tire&ndash;pavement interaction, to characterize each surface&rsquo;s condition. The two low-cost sensors were fed to different deep learning architectures that are specialized in surface state analysis; the results were combined using an evidential theory-based data fusion approach. This study is a proof of concept, to test an evidential approach for improving classification with deep learning, applied to only two sensors; however, one could very well add more sensors and make the nanocomputers communicate together, to analyze a larger urban environment.

AB  - Vehicle Re-identification (re-id) over surveillance camera network with non-overlapping field of view is an exciting and challenging task in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Due to its versatile applicability in metropolitan cities, it gained significant attention. Vehicle re-id matches targeted vehicle over non-overlapping views in multiple camera network. However, it becomes more difficult due to inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, viewpoint changes, and spatio-temporal uncertainty. In order to draw a detailed picture of vehicle re-id research, this paper gives a comprehensive description of the various vehicle re-id technologies, applicability, datasets, and a brief comparison of different methodologies. Our paper specifically focuses on vision-based vehicle re-id approaches, including vehicle appearance, license plate, and spatio-temporal characteristics. In addition, we explore the main challenges as well as a variety of applications in different domains. Lastly, a detailed comparison of current state-of-the-art methods performances over VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets is summarized with future directions. We aim to facilitate future research by reviewing the work being done on vehicle re-id till to date.

AB  - With the advancement of different technologies such as 5G networks and IoT the use of different cloud computing technologies became essential. Cloud computing allowed intensive data processing and warehousing solution. Two different new cloud technologies that inherit some of the traditional cloud computing paradigm are fog computing and edge computing that is aims to simplify some of the complexity of cloud computing and leverage the computing capabilities within the local network in order to preform computation tasks rather than carrying it to the cloud. This makes this technology fits with the properties of IoT systems. However, using such technology introduces several new security and privacy challenges that could be huge obstacle against implementing these technologies. In this paper, we survey some of the main security and privacy challenges that faces fog and edge computing illustrating how these security issues could affect the work and implementation of edge and fog computing. Moreover, we present several countermeasures to mitigate the effect of these security issues.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Modern cities require a tighter integration with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for bringing new services to the citizens. The Smart City is the revolutionary paradigm aiming at integrating the ICT with the citizen life; among several urban services, transports are one of the most important in modern cities, introducing several challenges to the Smart City paradigm. In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of new vehicular applications and services, Edge Computing (EC) is one of the most promising technologies when integrated into the Vehicular Networks (VNs). EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units&mdash;RSUs, 5G Base Stations&mdash;5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage. In the recent past, several new aerial platforms with integrated EC facilities have been deployed for achieving global connectivity. Such air-based EC platforms can complement the ground-based EC facilities for creating a futuristic VN able to deploy several new applications and services. The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services. By exploiting most modern technologies, with particular attention towards network softwarization, vehicular edge computing, and machine learning, we propose here three possible layered air-ground EC-enabled VN scenarios. For each of the discussed scenarios, a list of the possible challenges is considered, as well possible solutions allowing to overcome all or some of the considered challenges. A proper comparison is also done, through the use of tables, where all the proposed scenarios, and the proposed solutions, are discussed.

AB  - Through recent progress, the forms of modern supply chains have evolved into complex networks. The supply chain management systems face a variety of challenges. These include lack of visibility of the upstream party (Provider) to the downstream party (Client); lack of flexibility in the face of sudden variations in demand and control of operating costs; lack of reliance on safety stakeholders; ineffective management of supply chain risks. Blockchain (BC) is used in the supply chain to overcome the growing demands for items. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a profoundly encouraging innovation that can help companies observe, track, and monitor products, activities, and processes within their respective value chain networks. Research establishments and logical gatherings are ceaselessly attempting to answer IoT gadgets in supply chain management. This paper presents orderly writing on and reviewing of Blockchain-based IoT advances and their current usage. We discuss the smart devices used in this system and which device is the most appropriate in the supply chain. This paper also looks at future examination themes in blockchain-based IoT, referred to as the executive&rsquo;s framework production network. The essential deliberate writing audit has been consolidated by surveying research articles circulated in highly reputable publications between 2016 and 2021. Lastly, current issues and challenges are present to provide researchers with promising future directions in IoT supply chain management systems.

AB  - Statistical reports say that, from 2011 to 2021, more than 11,915 stray animals, such as cats, dogs, goats, cows, etc., and wild animals were wounded in road accidents. Most of the accidents occurred due to negligence and doziness of drivers. These issues can be handled brilliantly using stray and wild animals-vehicle interaction and the pedestrians&rsquo; awareness. This paper briefs a detailed forum on GPU-based embedded systems and ODT real-time applications. ML trains machines to recognize images more accurately than humans. This provides a unique and real-time solution using deep-learning real 3D motion-based YOLOv3 (DL-R-3D-YOLOv3) ODT of images on mobility. Besides, it discovers methods for multiple views of flexible objects using 3D reconstruction, especially for stray and wild animals. Computer vision-based IoT devices are also besieged by this DL-R-3D-YOLOv3 model. It seeks solutions by forecasting image filters to find object properties and semantics for object recognition methods leading to closed-loop ODT.

AB  - Maintaining a healthy cyber society is a great challenge due to the users&rsquo; freedom of expression and behavior. This can be solved by monitoring and analyzing the users&rsquo; behavior and taking proper actions. This research aims to present a platform that monitors the public content on Twitter by extracting tweet data. After maintaining the data, the users&rsquo; interactions are analyzed using graph analysis methods. Then, the users&rsquo; behavioral patterns are analyzed by applying metadata analysis, in which the timeline of each profile is obtained; also, the time-series behavioral features of users are investigated. Then, in the abnormal behavior detection and filtering component, the interesting profiles are selected for further examinations. Finally, in the contextual analysis component, the contents are analyzed using natural language processing techniques; a binary text classification model (SVM (Support Vector Machine) + TF-IDF (Term Frequency&mdash;Inverse Document Frequency) with 88.89% accuracy) is used to detect if a tweet is related to crime or not. Then, a sentiment analysis method is applied to the crime-related tweets to perform aspect-based sentiment analysis (DistilBERT + FFNN (Feed-Forward Neural Network) with 80% accuracy), because sharing positive opinions about a crime-related topic can threaten society. This platform aims to provide the end-user (the police) with suggestions to control hate speech or terrorist propaganda.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has seen a surge in mobile devices with the market and technical expansion. IoT networks provide end-to-end connectivity while keeping minimal latency. To reduce delays, efficient data delivery schemes are required for dispersed fog-IoT network orchestrations. We use a Spark-based big data processing scheme (BDPS) to accelerate the distributed database (RDD) delay efficient technique in the fogs for a decentralized heterogeneous network architecture to reinforce suitable data allocations via IoTs. We propose BDPS based on Spark-RDD in fog-IoT overlay architecture to address the performance issues across the network orchestration. We evaluate data processing delays from fog-IoT integrated parts using a depth-first-search-based shortest path node finding configuration, which outperforms the existing shortest path algorithms in terms of algorithmic (i.e., depth-first search) efficiency, including the Bellman&ndash;Ford (BF) algorithm, Floyd&ndash;Warshall (FW) algorithm, Dijkstra algorithm (DA), and Apache Hadoop (AH) algorithm. The BDPS exhibits low latency in packet deliveries as well as low network overhead uplink activity through a map-reduced resilient data distribution mechanism, better than in BF, DA, FW, and AH. The overall BDPS scheme supports efficient data delivery across the fog-IoT orchestration, outperforming faster node execution while proving effective results, compared to DA, BF, FW and AH, respectively.

SN  - 2306-5354

AB  - Stroke is the biggest cause of adult disability and the third biggest cause of death in the US. Stroke is a medical emergency, and the treatment given in the early hours is important in shaping the patient&rsquo;s long-term recovery and prognosis. Despite the fact that substantial attention has been dedicated to this complex and difficult issue in healthcare, novel strategies such as operation research-based approaches have hardly been used to deal with the difficult challenges associated with stroke. This study proposes a novel approach with data envelopment analysis (DEA) and multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) in hospitals that provide stroke care services to select the most efficient approach, which will be a new experiment in literature perception. DEA and MOLP are widely used for performance evaluation and efficiency measurement. Despite their similarities and common concepts, the two disciplines have evolved separately. The generalised DEA (GDEA) cannot incorporate the preferences of decision-makers (DMs) preferences and historical efficiency data. In contrast, MOLP can incorporate the DM&rsquo;s preferences into the decision-making process. We transform the GDEA model into MOLP through the max-ordering approach to (i) solve the problem interactively; (ii) use the step method (STEM) and consider DM&rsquo;s preferences; (iii) eliminate the need for predetermined preference information; and (iv) apply the most preferred solution (MPS) to identify the most efficient approach. A case study of hospitals that provide stroke care services is taken as an example to illustrate the potential application of the proposed approach method.

AB  - Buildings play a central role in energy transition, as they were responsible for 67.8% of the total consumption of electricity in France in 2017. Because of that, detecting anomalies (outliers) is crucial in order to identify both potential opportunities to reduce energy consumption and malfunctioning of the metering system. This work aims to compare the performance of several outlier detection methods, such as classical statistical methods (as boxplots) applied to the actual measurements and to the difference between the measurements and their predictions, in the task of detecting outliers in the power consumption data of a tertiary building located in France. The results show that the combination of a regression method, such as random forest, and the adjusted boxplot outlier detection method have promising potential in detecting this type of data quality problem in electricity consumption.

AB  - Smart cities support the enhancement of the quality of life of their residents, for which the use of a robust integrated platform of information and communication technology is required. However, not all cities have similar technology infrastructure and a similar understanding of the quality of life. Therefore, holistic planning, resource support, security, continuous updates, and dynamic operational enhancements should be considered while planning smart cities. However, a smart city could be vulnerable to security threats and a loss of personal or classified information due to the complexity of technology integration. Therefore, understanding and assessing different risks and embedding risk management mechanisms would be required to minimize vulnerability exposure in smart cities. This paper proposes a risk assessment method using the Dempster&ndash;Shafer theory for smart city planning. The Dempster&ndash;Shafer theory is used here to analyze the risks perceptions of experts. The principal component analysis method is used to analyze the data obtained from risk assessment. The application of this method is determined through a smart city test case in Qatar.

AB  - Blockchain technology is highly coupled with cryptocurrencies; however, it provides several other potential use cases, related to energy and sustainability, Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, smart mobility and more. Blockchain can offer security for Electric Vehicle (EV) transactions in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) concept, allowing electricity trading to be performed in a decentralized, transparent and secure way. Additionally, blockchain provides the necessary functionalities for IoV decentralized application development, such as data exchange, personal digital identity, sharing economy and optimized charging pattern. Moreover, blockchain technology has the potential to significantly increase energy efficiency, decrease management costs and guarantee the effective use of the energy recourses. Therefore, its application in the IoV concept provides secure, autonomous and automated energy trading between EVs. While several studies on blockchain technology in smart grids have been conducted, insufficient attention has been given to conducting a detailed review and state-of-the-art analysis of blockchain application in the IoV domain. To this end, this work provides a systematic literature review of blockchain-based applications in the IoV domain. The aim is to investigate the current challenges of IoV and to highlight how blockchain characteristics can contribute to this emerging paradigm. In addition, limitations and future research directions related to the integration of blockchain technology within the IoV are discussed. To this end, this study incorporates the theoretical foundations of several research articles published in scientific publications over the previous five years, as a method of simplifying our assessment and capturing the ever-expanding blockchain area. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of blockchain-enabled applications in the IoV domain, such as privacy and security, data protection and management, vehicle management, charging optimization and P2P energy trading, based on a structured, systematic review and content analysis of the discovered literature, and we identify key trends and emerging areas for research. The contribution of this article is two-fold: (a) we highlight the limitations presented in the relevant literature, particularly the barriers of blockchain technology and how they influence its integration into the IoV and (b) we present a number of research gaps and suggest future exploratory areas.

AB  - Owing to the hasty growth of communication technologies in the Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT), many researchers and industries focus on enhancing the existing technologies of UIoT systems for developing numerous applications such as oceanography, diver networks monitoring, deep-sea exploration and early warning systems. In a constrained UIoT environment, communication media such as acoustic, infrared (IR), visible light, radiofrequency (RF) and magnet induction (MI) are generally used to transmit information via digitally linked underwater devices. However, each medium has its technical limitations: for example, the acoustic medium has challenges such as narrow-channel bandwidth, low data rate, high cost, etc., and optical medium has challenges such as high absorption, scattering, long-distance data transmission, etc. Moreover, the malicious node can steal the underwater data by employing blackhole attacks, routing attacks, Sybil attacks, etc. Furthermore, due to heavyweight, the existing privacy and security mechanism of the terrestrial internet of things (IoT) cannot be applied directly to UIoT environment. Hence, this paper aims to provide a systematic review of recent trends, applications, communication technologies, challenges, security threats and privacy issues of UIoT system. Additionally, this paper highlights the methods of preventing the technical challenges and security attacks of the UIoT environment. Finally, this systematic review contributes much to the profit of researchers to analyze and improve the performance of services in UIoT applications.

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - The bulk of water pipes experience major degradation and deterioration problems. This research aims at estimating the condition of water pipes in Shattora and Shaker Al-Bahery&rsquo;s water distribution networks, in Egypt. The developed models involve training the Elman neural network (ENN) and feed-forward neural network (FFNN) coupled with particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithms (GA), the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), and the teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm. For the Shattora network, the inputs to these models are pipe characteristics such as length, wall thickness, diameter, material, lining and coating, surface type, traffic distribution, cathodic protection, flow velocity, and c-factor. For the Shaker Al-Bahery network, the data gathered include length, material, age, diameter, depth, and wall thickness. Three assessment criteria are used to evaluate the suggested machine learning models, namely index of agreement (IOA), correlation coefficient (R), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results reveal that coupling FFNN with the TLBO algorithm outperforms other prediction models. Therefore, the FFNN-TLBO model can be a valuable tool for simulating the water network pipe condition. This study could help the water municipality allocate the available budget effectively and plan the required maintenance and rehabilitation actions.

AB  - The increasing role of emerging technologies, such as big data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive technologies, cloud computing, and mobile technologies, is essential to the business process manager profession&rsquo;s sustainable development. Nevertheless, these technologies could involve new challenges in labor markets. The era of intelligent business process management (BPM) has begun, but how does it look in real labor markets? This paper examines the hypothesis that the transformation of the business process manager profession has been caused by certain determinants that involve the need for an improvement in BPM skills. The main contribution is a model of the dimensions of the impact of digital technologies on business process management supplemented with skills that influence the business process manager profession. The paper fills the gap in research on perspectives of the impact of digital technologies on business process management, considering both a literature analysis and labor market research. The purpose of the literature review was to identify the core dimensions that drive the use of emerging technologies in business process management. The labor market study was conducted in order to analyze the current demand for core skills of business process managers in the Polish labor market with a particular emphasis on the intelligent BPM concept. Additionally, to study the determinants that slow down the iBPM concept&rsquo;s development, the digital intensity level of the enterprises and public administration units in Poland was studied. Finally, a fuzzy cognitive map presenting the core determinants of the business process manager profession&rsquo;s transformation is described.

TI  - A Hybrid Lightweight System for Early Attack Detection in the IoMT Fog
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 24
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cyber-attack detection via on-gadget embedded models and cloud systems are widely used for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The former has a limited computation ability, whereas the latter has a long detection time. Fog-based attack detection is alternatively used to overcome these problems. However, the current fog-based systems cannot handle the ever-increasing IoMT&rsquo;s big data. Moreover, they are not lightweight and are designed for network attack detection only. In this work, a hybrid (for host and network) lightweight system is proposed for early attack detection in the IoMT fog. In an adaptive online setting, six different incremental classifiers were implemented, namely a novel Weighted Hoeffding Tree Ensemble (WHTE), Incremental K-Nearest Neighbors (IKNN), Incremental Na&iuml;ve Bayes (INB), Hoeffding Tree Majority Class (HTMC), Hoeffding Tree Na&iuml;ve Bayes (HTNB), and Hoeffding Tree Na&iuml;ve Bayes Adaptive (HTNBA). The system was benchmarked with seven heterogeneous sensors and a NetFlow data infected with nine types of recent attack. The results showed that the proposed system worked well on the lightweight fog devices with ~100% accuracy, a low detection time, and a low memory usage of less than 6 MiB. The single-criteria comparative analysis showed that the WHTE ensemble was more accurate and was less sensitive to the concept drift.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming integrated into a wide range of modern IoT applications. The growing number of networked IoT devices generates a large amount of data. However, processing and memorizing this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed critical challenges, especially when using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a way to bring cloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to address computation-intensive offloading and latency issues. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works related to UAV technology applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures. It details the utility of UAV-enabled MEC architecture regarding emerging IoT applications and the role of both deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in meeting various limitations related to latency, task offloading, energy demand, and security. Furthermore, throughout this article, the reader gains an insight into the future of UAV-enabled MEC, the advantages and the critical challenges to be tackled when using AI.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of a massive number of smart devices capable of data collection, storage, processing, and communication. The adoption of the IoT has brought about tremendous innovation opportunities in industries, homes, the environment, and businesses. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of the IoT have sparked concerns for wide adoption and applications. Unlike traditional information technology (I.T.) systems, the IoT environment is challenging to secure due to resource constraints, heterogeneity, and distributed nature of the smart devices. This makes it impossible to apply host-based prevention mechanisms such as anti-malware and anti-virus. These challenges and the nature of IoT applications call for a monitoring system such as anomaly detection both at device and network levels beyond the organisational boundary. This suggests an anomaly detection system is strongly positioned to secure IoT devices better than any other security mechanism. In this paper, we aim to provide an in-depth review of existing works in developing anomaly detection solutions using machine learning for protecting an IoT system. We also indicate that blockchain-based anomaly detection systems can collaboratively learn effective machine learning models to detect anomalies.

TI  - Developing a Scoring System to Evaluate the Level of Smartness in Commercial Buildings: A Case of Sri Lanka
T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Smart buildings (SBs) are developed in many different ways and are self-proclaimed smart. There are a great number of publications introducing smart systems using a wider range of tools and sensors. However, the level of smartness, functions of the smart system, and the usefulness of the system are not the same, which may give a wrong impression to clients or potential buyers of a building. Developing a scoring system that enables determining the overall smartness of a building is necessary. Despite the necessity, there is a dearth of studies in this area. Hence, the purpose of this study is to develop a scoring system to evaluate the level of smartness of Sri Lankan commercial buildings. Thus, initially, smart criteria were identified, defined, and categorized through a literature survey. Subsequently, 35 experts in the commercial building sector were interviewed. Finally, the relative importance of the smart criteria was derived through the AHP technique, and accordingly, a scoring system was developed. The study identified six main criteria to evaluate the smartness of buildings in the scoring system. The automation criterion with the highest relative weight was concluded to be the dominant criterion (45.59%) in the scoring system. Communication and data sharing were placed at second with a relative weight of 18.76% and indicates the importance given by the study findings in establishing the backbones of SBs. Occupants&rsquo; comfort, energy management, occupants&rsquo; health and safety, and sustainability criterion were ranked third, fourth, fifth, and sixth within the scoring system. This study is one of the first to investigate in detail the contribution of both soft and hard services of a facility in determining the overall smartness of a building. Property developers in the commercial building sector can benefit from this study by recognizing the necessary criteria to be embedded in their SB development projects in order to attract more tenants and customers.

TI  - A Multi-Provider End-to-End Dynamic Orchestration Architecture Approach for 5G and Future Communication Systems

VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Network segregation is the solution adopted in the IMT-2020 standardization of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), better known as 5G networks (Fifth Generation Mobile Networks), under development to meet the requirements of performance, reliability, energy, and economic efficiency required by applications in the various verticals of current and near-future economic activities. The philosophy adopted for the IMT-2020 standardization relies on the use of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and Software-Defined Radio (SDR), i.e., the softwarization of the network. Softwarization allows network segregation through its slicing, which is discussed herein this work. Network slicing is performed by a novel Orchestrator, as provided in IMT-2020, which maintains the end-to-end network slices independent of each other and performs horizontal handover when the possibility of a loss of Quality of Service (QoS) is predictively detected by monitoring quality parameters during operation. Therefore, the Orchestrator is dynamic, operates in uptime, and allows horizontal handover. Hence, it chooses the most appropriate telecommunication infrastructure provider and network operator to guarantee QoS and Quality of Experience (QoE) to end-users in each network segment. These features make this work modern and keep it aligned with the actions being carried out by ITU. Based on this objective, as the main result of this paper, we propose an effective architecture for implementing the Orchestrator, not only to contribute to the state of the art for 5G and beyond communication systems but also to generate economic, technological, and social impacts.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Malaysia has a high percentage of motorcycles. Due to lane-splitting, travel times of motorcycles are less than passenger cars at congestion. Because of this, collecting travel times using the media access control (MAC) address is not straightforward. Many outlier filtering algorithms for travel time datasets have not been evaluated for their capability to filter lane-splitting observations. This study aims to identify the best travel time filtering algorithms for the data containing lane-splitting observations and how to use the best algorithm. Two stages were adopted to achieve the objective of the study. The first stage validates the performance of the previous algorithms, and the second stage checks the sensitivity of the algorithm parameters for different days. The analysis uses the travel time data for three routes in Kuala Lumpur collected by Wi-Fi detectors in May 2018. The results show that the Jang algorithm has the best performance for two of the three routes, and the TransGuide algorithm is the best algorithm for one route. However, the parameters of Jang and TransGuide algorithms are sensitive for different days, and the parameters require daily calibration to obtain acceptable results. Using proper calibration of the algorithm parameters, the Jang and TransGuide algorithms produced the most accurate filtered travel time datasets compared to other algorithms

AB  - Companies are increasingly gathering and analyzing time-series data, driven by the rising number of IoT devices. Many works in literature describe analysis systems built using either data-driven or semantic (knowledge-driven) techniques. However, little to no works describe hybrid combinations of these two. Dyversify, a collaborative project between industry and academia, investigated how event and anomaly detection can be performed on time-series data in such a hybrid setting. We built a proof-of-concept analysis platform, using a microservice architecture to ensure scalability and fault-tolerance. The platform comprises time-series ingestion, long term storage, data semantification, event detection using data-driven and semantic techniques, dynamic visualization, and user feedback. In this work, we describe the system architecture of this hybrid analysis platform and give an overview of the different components and their interactions. As such, the main contribution of this work is an experience report with challenges faced and lessons learned.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The European Parliament has adopted Directive 2019/1161 on the promotion of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient road transport vehicles, which also defines the obligations and forms of support for the procurement of environmentally friendly vehicles in urban logistics. The increase in the number of shipments delivered within e-commerce, which is also the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, requires a transition to a sustainable logistics system. New research questions are being raised in the preparation of new projects for the introduction of small electric commercial vehicles in particular. One of the main research questions about deployment itself is whether light commercial electric vehicles are able to fully replace conventionally powered vehicles. What operating conditions are optimal for the operation of them? How does load weight affect the energy efficiency of operating a light commercial electric vehicle? The authors decided to carry out research into the impacts of weight and the nature of a driving cycle under laboratory conditions to eliminate all external factors that could distort individual measurements and their results. In order to simulate driving cycles, an urban driving cycle was designed on the basis of the course of speed, acceleration, deceleration and slope conditions of roads in the selected regional city of &#381;ilina (Slovakia). In the case of the operation of an electrically powered light commercial vehicle, the impact of load weight on the range of the vehicle is low, and is below the level of the theoretical maximum range of the vehicle in urban logistics applications. The operation of electrically powered vehicles in hilly terrains with relatively longer gradients and steeper slopes increases electricity consumption and, thereby, reduces their range.

AB  - Recently released research about deep learning applications related to perception for autonomous driving focuses heavily on the usage of LiDAR point cloud data as input for the neural networks, highlighting the importance of LiDAR technology in the field of Autonomous Driving (AD). In this sense, a great percentage of the vehicle platforms used to create the datasets released for the development of these neural networks, as well as some AD commercial solutions available on the market, heavily invest in an array of sensors, including a large number of sensors as well as several sensor modalities. However, these costs create a barrier to entry for low-cost solutions for the performance of critical perception tasks such as Object Detection and SLAM. This paper explores current vehicle platforms and proposes a low-cost, LiDAR-based test vehicle platform capable of running critical perception tasks (Object Detection and SLAM) in real time. Additionally, we propose the creation of a deep learning-based inference model for Object Detection deployed in a resource-constrained device, as well as a graph-based SLAM implementation, providing important considerations, explored while taking into account the real-time processing requirement and presenting relevant results demonstrating the usability of the developed work in the context of the proposed low-cost platform.

AB  - Advancement in network technology has vastly increased the usage of the Internet. Consequently, there has been a rise in traffic volume and data sharing. This has made securing a network from sophisticated intrusion attacks very important to preserve users&rsquo; information and privacy. Our research focuses on combating and detecting intrusion attacks and preserving the integrity of online systems. In our research we first create a benchmark model for detecting intrusions and then employ various combinations of feature selection techniques based upon ensemble machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of the intrusion detection system. The performance of our model was investigated using three evaluation metrics namely: elimination time, accuracy and F1-score. The results of the experiment indicated that the random forest feature selection technique had the minimum elimination time, whereas the support vector machine model had the best accuracy and F1-score. Therefore, conclusive evidence could be drawn that the combination of random forest and support vector machine is suitable for low latency and highly accurate intrusion detection systems.

AB  - Background: treating infectious diseases in elderly individuals is difficult; patient referral to emergency services often occurs, since the elderly tend to arrive at consultations with advanced, serious symptoms. Aim: it was hypothesized that anticipating an infectious disease diagnosis by a few days could significantly improve a patient&rsquo;s well-being and reduce the burden on emergency health system services. Methods: vital signs from residents were taken daily and transferred to a database in the cloud. Classifiers were used to recognize patterns in the spatial domain process of the collected data. Doctors reported their diagnoses when any disease presented. A flexible microservice architecture provided access and functionality to the system. Results: combining two different domains, health and technology, is not easy, but the results are encouraging. The classifiers reported good results; the system has been well accepted by medical personnel and is proving to be cost-effective and a good solution to service disadvantaged areas. In this context, this research found the importance of certain clinical variables in the identification of infectious diseases. Conclusions: this work explores how to apply mobile communications, cloud services, and machine learning technology, in order to provide efficient tools for medical staff in nursing homes. The scalable architecture can be extended to big data applications that may extract valuable knowledge patterns for medical research.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 24
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) support humans in performing an increasingly varied number of tasks. UAVs need to be remotely operated by a human pilot in many cases. Therefore, pilots require repetitive training to master the UAV movements. Nevertheless, training with an actual UAV involves high costs and risks. Fortunately, simulators are alternatives to face these difficulties. However, existing simulators lack realism, do not present flight information intuitively, and sometimes do not allow natural interaction with the human operator. This work addresses these issues through a framework for building realistic virtual simulators for the human operation of UAVs. First, the UAV is modeled in detail to perform a dynamic simulation in this framework. Then, the information of the above simulation is utilized to manipulate the elements in a virtual 3D operation environment developed in Unity 3D. Therefore, the interaction with the human operator is introduced with a proposed teleoperation algorithm and an input device. Finally, a meta-heuristic optimization procedure provides realism to the simulation. In this procedure, the flight information obtained from an actual UAV is used to optimize the parameters of the teleoperation algorithm.

T2  - Fractal and Fractional

PY  - 2021
VL  - 5

SN  - 2504-3110

AB  - The purpose of the current investigation is to find the numerical solutions of the novel fractional order pantograph singular system (FOPSS) using the applications of Meyer wavelets as a neural network. The FOPSS is presented using the standard form of the Lane&ndash;Emden equation and the detailed discussions of the singularity, shape factor terms along with the fractional order forms. The numerical discussions of the FOPSS are described based on the fractional Meyer wavelets (FMWs) as a neural network (NN) with the optimization procedures of global/local search procedures of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and interior-point algorithm (IPA), i.e., FMWs-NN-PSOIPA. The FMWs-NN strength is pragmatic and forms a merit function based on the differential system and the initial conditions of the FOPSS. The merit function is optimized, using the integrated capability of PSOIPA. The perfection, verification and substantiation of the FOPSS using the FMWs is pragmatic for three cases through relative investigations from the true results in terms of stability and convergence. Additionally, the statics&rsquo; descriptions further authorize the presentation of the FMWs-NN-PSOIPA in terms of reliability and accuracy.

TI  - Development of an IoT Architecture Based on a Deep Neural Network against Cyber Attacks for Automated Guided Vehicles
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 24
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper introduces an integrated IoT architecture to handle the problem of cyber attacks based on a developed deep neural network (DNN) with a rectified linear unit in order to provide reliable and secure online monitoring for automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The developed IoT architecture based on a DNN introduces a new approach for the online monitoring of AGVs against cyber attacks with a cheap and easy implementation instead of the traditional cyber attack detection schemes in the literature. The proposed DNN is trained based on experimental AGV data that represent the real state of the AGV and different types of cyber attacks including a random attack, ramp attack, pulse attack, and sinusoidal attack that is injected by the attacker into the internet network. The proposed DNN is compared with different deep learning and machine learning algorithms such as a one dimension convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a supported vector machine model (SVM), random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a decision tree for greater validation. Furthermore, the proposed IoT architecture based on a DNN can provide an effective detection for the AGV status with an excellent accuracy of 96.77% that is significantly greater than the accuracy based on the traditional schemes. The AGV status based on the proposed IoT architecture with a DNN is visualized by an advanced IoT platform named CONTACT Elements for IoT. Different test scenarios with a practical setup of an AGV with IoT are carried out to emphasize the performance of the suggested IoT architecture based on a DNN. The results approve the usefulness of the proposed IoT to provide effective cybersecurity for data visualization and tracking of the AGV status that enhances decision-making and improves industrial productivity.

TI  - Smart Manufacturing and Tactile Internet Based on 5G in Industry 4.0: Challenges, Applications and New Trends
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 24
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - For many applications deployed in manufacturing networks, communication latency has been a significant barrier. Despite the constant development of improved communication protocols and standards during Industry 4.0, the latency problem persists, lowering quality of services (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). Tactile internet (TI), with its high availability, security, and ultra-low latency, will add a new dimension to human-machine interaction (HMI) by enabling haptic and tactile sensations. The tactile internet (TI) is a cutting-edge technology that uses 5G and beyond (B5G) communications to enable real-time interaction of haptic data over the internet between tactile ends. This emerging TI technology is regarded as the next evolutionary step for the Internet of Things (IoT) and is expected to bring about massive changes towards Society 5.0 and to address complex issues in current society. To that end, the 5G mobile communication systems will support the TI at the wireless edge. As a result, TI can be used as a backbone for delay mitigation in conjunction with 5G networks, allowing for ultra-reliable low latency applications like Smart Manufacturing, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to present the current state of 5G and TI, as well as the challenges and future trends for 5G networks beyond 2021, as well as a conceptual framework for integrating 5G and TI into existing industrial case studies, with a focus on the design aspects and layers of TI, such as the master, network, and slave layers. Finally, the key publications focused on the key enabling technologies of TI are summarized and the beyond 5G era towards Society 5.0 based on cyber-physical systems is discussed.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - This study investigates the social representation of Blockchain from the perspective of professionals in Brazil, herein considered as a proxy for emerging markets, and then compares the results found with the existing academic literature on the concept of Blockchain. To do that, the social representation theory was applied, operationalized through the words evocation technique. Security, bitcoin and decentralization were the categories located in the central nucleus of the social representation of Blockchain, while innovation, data, network, cryptocurrency, and technology were the categories located in the peripheral system. Based on the results obtained, there was a perceived strong association of Blockchain with bitcoin, one of its applications, and a dissonance between the existing academic literature and the perception of Brazilian professionals about the concept of Blockchain, as the latter is a privilege of the technical and operational issues of Blockchain to the detriment of its strategic potential. This dissonance can cause Blockchain initiatives to have results below expectations. Finally, Brazilian professionals did not realize the potential for inclusion of Blockchain in an emerging market such as Brazil and did not notice the need and relevance of a specific legal governance for Blockchain, an issue also forgotten by academia.

AB  - At the Department of Management and Engineering (DTG) of the University of Padova (Italy), the research team led by Prof. Renato Lazzarin, formed by the authors, worked during the first fifteen years of the millennium on different topics focused on sustainable technologies for energy production and utilization in buildings. Both experimental and theoretical/modeling studies were carried out, all sharing the evaluation of energy performance and sustainability: From the life cycle assessment and life cycle cost of building insulation materials in Italy, to the measurement of energy performance of a green roof, to the experimental measurement of different photovoltaic/thermal modules, to the development of a simulation software for direct and indirect evaporative cooling techniques, to the evaluation of different energy savings techniques for refrigeration and air conditioning in supermarkets, to an extensive analysis of the urban heat island effect in the city of Padova. The paper summarizes the main theoretical and experimental approaches, providing the methods adopted in each line of research. The main results of the studies conducted during the fifteen-year period are described and commented on, some of which were a well-established reference for the following literature.

TI  - Blockchain-Enabled Energy Demand Side Management Cap and Trade Model
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 24
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Global economic growth, demographic explosion, digitization, increased mobility, and greater demand for heating and cooling due to climate change in different world areas are the main drivers for the surge in energy demand. The increase in energy demand is the basis of economic challenges for power companies alongside several socio-economic problems in communities, such as energy poverty, defined as the insufficient coverage of energy needs, especially in the residential sector. Two main strategies are considered to meet this increased demand. The first strategy focuses on new sustainable and eco-friendly modes of power generation, such as renewable energy resources and distributed energy resources. The second strategy is demand-side oriented rather than the supply side. Demand-side management, demand response (DR), and energy efficiency (EE) programs fall under this category. On the other hand, the decentralization and digitization of the energy sector convoyed by the emersion of new technologies such as blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), opened the door to new solutions for the energy demand dilemma. Among these technologies, blockchain has proved itself as a decentralized trading platform between untrusted peers without the involvement of a trusted third party. This newly introduced Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading model can be used to create a new demand load control model. In this article, the concept of an energy cap and trade demand-side management (DSM) model is introduced and simulated. The introduced DSM model is based on the concept of capping consumers&rsquo; monthly energy consumption and rewarding consumers who do not exceed this cap with energy tradeable credits that can be traded using blockchain-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. A model based on 200 households is used to simulate the proposed DSM model and prove that this model can be beneficial to both energy companies and consumers.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Evidence-based decision making is promoted as offering efficiency and effectiveness; however, its uptake has faced barriers such as underdeveloped supporting culture, limited access to evidence, and evidence that is not fully relevant. Smart city conceptualizations offer economic and environmental sustainability and better quality of life through evidence-based policy decision-making. We wondered whether smart city theory and practice has advanced the knowledge of evidence-based decision-making. We searched major databases for literature containing a mention of smart cities, decision-making, and policy. We identified relevant literature from a range of disciplines and supplemented these by following backwards and forwards citations. Evidence-based decision-making was found mostly in literature regarding the theory and practice of smart city operations, and, to lesser extents, the articles regarding policy decisions and tactical decisions. Better decision-making which supported the achievement of city sustainability objectives was reported in some articles; however, we found significant obstacles to the further achievement of city objectives in the areas of underachievement in collaborative decision-making, privileging of big data evidence, and artificial intelligence agents as decision-makers. We assembled a definition of smart city decision-making and developed an agenda of research which will support city governments, theorists, and practitioners in better achieving sustainability through improved decision-making.

AB  - To equip computers with human communication skills and to enable natural interaction between the computer and a human, intelligent solutions are required based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods, algorithms, and sensor technology. This study aimed at identifying and analyzing the state-of-the-art AI methods and algorithms and sensors technology in existing human&ndash;computer intelligent interaction (HCII) research to explore trends in HCII research, categorize existing evidence, and identify potential directions for future research. We conduct a systematic mapping study of the HCII body of research. Four hundred fifty-four studies published in various journals and conferences between 2010 and 2021 were identified and analyzed. Studies in the HCII and IUI fields have primarily been focused on intelligent recognition of emotion, gestures, and facial expressions using sensors technology, such as the camera, EEG, Kinect, wearable sensors, eye tracker, gyroscope, and others. Researchers most often apply deep-learning and instance-based AI methods and algorithms. The support sector machine (SVM) is the most widely used algorithm for various kinds of recognition, primarily an emotion, facial expression, and gesture. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is the often-used deep-learning algorithm for emotion recognition, facial recognition, and gesture recognition solutions.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has changed the worldwide network of people, smart devices, intelligent things, data, and information as an emergent technology. IoT development is still in its early stages, and numerous interrelated challenges must be addressed. IoT is the unifying idea of embedding everything. The Internet of Things offers a huge opportunity to improve the world&rsquo;s accessibility, integrity, availability, scalability, confidentiality, and interoperability. However, securing the Internet of Things is a difficult issue. The IoT aims to connect almost everything within the framework of a common infrastructure. This helps in controlling devices and, will allow device status to be updated everywhere and at any time. To develop technology via IoT, several critical scientific studies and inquiries have been carried out. However, many obstacles and problems remain to be tackled in order to reach IoT&rsquo;s maximum potential. These problems and concerns must be taken into consideration in different areas of the IoT, such as implementation in remote areas, threats to the system, development support, social and environmental impacts, etc. This paper reviews the current state of the art in different IoT architectures, with a focus on current technologies, applications, challenges, IoT protocols, and opportunities. As a result, a detailed taxonomy of IoT is presented here which includes interoperability, scalability, security and energy efficiency, among other things. Moreover, the significance of blockchains and big data as well as their analysis in relation to IoT, is discussed. This article aims to help readers and researchers understand the IoT and its applicability to the real world.

AB  - Cloud computing provides the flexible architecture where data and resources are dispersed at various locations and are accessible from various industrial environments. Cloud computing has changed the using, storing, and sharing of resources such as data, services, and applications for industrial applications. During the last decade, industries have rapidly switched to cloud computing for having more comprehensive access, reduced cost, and increased performance. In addition, significant improvement has been observed in the internet of things (IoT) with the integration of cloud computing. However, this rapid transition into the cloud raised various security issues and concerns. Traditional security solutions are not directly applicable and sometimes ineffective for cloud-based systems. Cloud platforms&rsquo; challenges and security concerns have been addressed during the last three years, despite the successive use and proliferation of multifaceted cyber weapons. The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain has brought many benefits that can be utilized to address industrial security issues in the cloud. The findings of the proposed research include the following: we present a comprehensive survey of enabling cloud-based IoT architecture, services, configurations, and security models; the classification of cloud security concerns in IoT into four major categories (data, network and service, applications, and people-related security issues), which are discussed in detail; we identify and inspect the latest advancements in cloud-based IoT attacks; we identify, discuss, and analyze significant security issues in each category and present the limitations from a general, artificial intelligence and deep learning perspective; we provide the technological challenges identified in the literature and then identify significant research gaps in the IoT-based cloud infrastructure to highlight future research directions to blend cybersecurity in cloud.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 12

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The rapid development of industrialization and urbanization has had a substantial impact on the increasing air pollution in many populated cities around the globe. Intensive research has shown that ambient aerosols, especially the fine particulate matter PM2.5, are highly correlated with human respiratory diseases. It is critical to analyze, forecast, and mitigate PM2.5 concentrations. One of the typical meteorological phenomena seducing PM2.5 concentrations to accumulate is temperature inversion which forms a warm-air cap to blockade the surface pollutants from dissipating. This paper analyzes the meteorological patterns which coincide with temperature inversion and proposes two machine learning classifiers for temperature inversion classification. A separate multivariate regression model is trained for the class with or without manifesting temperature inversion phenomena, in order to improve PM2.5 forecasting performance. We chose Puli township as the studied site, which is a basin city easily trapping PM2.5 concentrations. The experimental results with the dataset spanning from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019 show that the proposed temperature inversion classifiers exhibit satisfactory performance in F1-Score, and the regression models trained from the classified datasets can significantly improve the PM2.5 concentration forecast as compared to the model using a single dataset without considering the temperature inversion factor.

AB  - In recent years, the area of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has seen rapid growth. There has been a trend to build and produce UAVs that can carry out planetary exploration throughout the past decade. The technology of UAVs has tremendous potential to support various successful space mission solutions. In general, different techniques for observing space objects are available, such as telescopes, probes, and flying spacecraft, orbiters, landers, and rovers. However, a detailed analysis has been carried out due to the benefits of UAVs relative to other planetary exploration techniques. The deployment of UAVs to other solar bodies has been considered by numerous space agencies worldwide, including NASA. This article contributes to investigating the types of UAVs that have been considered for various planetary explorations. This study further investigates the behaviour of UAV prototypes on Mars&rsquo; surface in particular. It has been discovered that a prototype UAV flight on Mars has a higher chance of success. In this research, a prototype UAV has been successfully simulated to fly on Mars&rsquo; surface. This article discusses the opportunities, challenges, and future scope of deploying UAVs on Mars.

TI  - Big Data and Energy Security: Impacts on Private Companies, National Economies and Societies
T2  - IoT

PY  - 2022
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SN  - 2624-831X

AB  - The importance of energy security for the successful functioning of private companies, national economies, and the overall society cannot be underestimated. Energy is a critical infrastructure for any modern society, and its reliable functioning is essential for all economic sectors and for the well-being of everybody. Uncertainty in terms of the availability of information, namely reliable data to make predictions and to plan for investment as well as for other actions of stakeholders in the energy markets is one of the factors with the highest influence on energy security. This uncertainty can be connected with many factors, such as the availability of reliable data or actions of stakeholders themselves. For example, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed negative impacts of uncertainty on decision-making processes and markets. At the time point when the market participants started to receive real-time information about the situation, the energy markets began to ease. This is one scenario where Big Data can be used to amplify information to various stakeholders to prevent panic and to ensure market stability and security of supply. Considering the novelty of this topic, our methodology is based on the meta-analysis of existing studies in the area of impacts of energy security on private companies, the national economy, and society. The results show that, in a fast-paced digital world characterized by technological advances, the use of Big Data technology provides a unique niche point to close this gap in information disparity by levering the use of unconventional data sources to integrate technologies, stakeholders, and markets to promote energy security and market stability. The potential of Big Data technology is yet to be fully utilized. Big Data can handle large data sets characterized by volume, variety, velocity, value, and complexity. Our conclusion is that the challenge for energy markets is to leverage this technology to mine available socioeconomic, political, geographic, and environmental data responsibly and to provide indicators that predict future global supply and demand. This information is crucial for energy security and ensuring global economic prosperity.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Although fully automated vehicles (SAE level 5) are expected to acquire a major relevance for transportation dynamics by the next few years, the number of studies addressing their perceived benefits from the perspective of human factors remains substantially limited. This study aimed, firstly, to assess the relationships among drivers&rsquo; demographic factors, their assessment of five key features of automated vehicles (i.e., increased connectivity, reduced driving demands, fuel and trip-related efficiency, and safety improvements), and their intention to use them, and secondly, to test the predictive role of the feature&rsquo; valuations over usage intention, focusing on gender as a key differentiating factor. For this cross-sectional research, the data gathered from a sample of 856 licensed drivers (49.4% females, 50.6% males; M = 40.05 years), responding to an electronic survey, was analyzed. Demographic, driving-related data, and attitudinal factors were comparatively analyzed through robust tests and a bias-corrected Multi-Group Structural Equation Modeling (MGSEM) approach. Findings from this work suggest that drivers&rsquo; assessment of these AV features keep a significant set of multivariate relationships to their usage intention in the future. Additionally, and even though there are some few structural similarities, drivers&rsquo; intention to use an AV can be differentially explained according to their gender. So far, this research constitutes a first approximation to the intention of using AVs from a MGSEM gender-based approach, being these results of potential interest for researchers and practitioners from different fields, including automotive design, transport planning and road safety.

AB  - With the exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing is in the limelight for its ability to quickly and efficiently process numerous data generated by IoT devices. EdgeX Foundry is a representative open-source-based IoT gateway platform, providing various IoT protocol services and interoperability between them. However, due to the absence of container orchestration technology, such as automated deployment and dynamic resource management for application services, EdgeX Foundry has fundamental limitations of a potential edge computing platform. In this paper, we propose EdgeX over Kubernetes, which enables remote service deployment and autoscaling to application services by running EdgeX Foundry over Kubernetes, which is a product-grade container orchestration tool. Experimental evaluation results prove that the proposed platform increases manageability through the remote deployment of application services and improves the throughput of the system and service quality with real-time monitoring and autoscaling.

AB  - Investing in digital transformation turns out to be a strategic action to tackle contemporary issues and to improve competitiveness for enterprises. The high variability of options in the digital transformation process enforces a higher complexity level in configuring and setting up objectives and goals based on cities&rsquo; needs; hence, a systematic approach is required to assist decision makers for better and sustainable transformation. A reference model is described in this paper to support decision makers with comprehensive assessment data for digital transformation cities transport. The proposed reference model assesses the cities based on digital transformation of transport services to assist policy makers for better decisions in transforming the Mobility 4.0. The proposed model in this study functions as a knowledge-based systematic framework for assessing the capabilities of the cities, diagnosing their needs under given circumstances and identifying the best fitting workflow for digital transformation of urban transportation systems and related services. The reference model takes on board a group of smart city indices with respective assessment criteria in determining a smartness level of transportation components. A conceptual 4-tier smartness scale has been proposed to establish a consistent assessment subject to cities circumstances in many respects. The reference model has been formalised into a mathematical model to characterise the assessments. The mathematical model encompasses strategic assessments by experts to identify priorities of investments in the digitalization process, which are aligned with strategic goals and policies of cities&rsquo; management.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PSO Enhanced ANFIS Model in Prediction of Traffic Flow of Vehicles on Freeways: Traffic Data Evidence from South Africa
T2  - Infrastructures

PY  - 2022
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
SN  - 2412-3811

AB  - In the last few years, there has been a significant rise in the number of private vehicles ownership, migration of people from rural areas to urban cities, and the rise in the number of under-maintained freeways; all these have added to the perennial problem of traffic congestion. Traffic flow prediction has been recognized as the solution in alleviating and reducing the problem of traffic congestion. In this research, we developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system trained by particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO) by performing an evaluative performance of the model through traffic flow modelling of vehicles on five freeways (N1,N3,N12,N14&nbsp;and&nbsp;N17) using South Africa Transportation System as a case study. Six hundred and fifty (650) traffic data were collected using inductive loop detectors and video cameras from the five freeways. The traffic data used for developing these models comprises traffic volume, traffic density, speed of vehicles, time, and different types of vehicles. The traffic data were divided into 70% and 30% for the training and validation of the model. The model results show a positively correlated optimal performance between the inputs and the output with a regression value R2&nbsp; of 0.9978 and 0.9860 for the training and testing. The result of this research shows that the soft computing model ANFIS-PSO used in this research can model vehicular traffic flow on freeways. Furthermore, the evidence from this research suggests that the on-peak and off-peak hours are significant determinants of vehicular traffic flow on freeways. The modelling approach developed in this research will assist urban planners in developing practical ways to tackle traffic congestion and assist motorists and pedestrians in travel behaviour decision-making. Finally, the approach used in this study will assist transportation engineers in making constructive and safety dependent guidelines for drivers and pedestrians on freeways.

VL  - 22

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fire is an extraordinary event that can damage property and have a notable effect on people&rsquo;s lives. However, the early detection of smoke and fire has been identified as a challenge in many recent studies. Therefore, different solutions have been proposed to approach the timely detection of fire events and avoid human casualties. As a solution, we used an affordable visual detection system. This method is possibly effective because early fire detection is recognized. In most developed countries, CCTV surveillance systems are installed in almost every public location to take periodic images of a specific area. Notwithstanding, cameras are used under different types of ambient light, and they experience occlusions, distortions of view, and changes in the resulting images from different camera angles and the different seasons of the year, all of which affect the accuracy of currently established models. To address these problems, we developed an approach based on an attention feature map used in a capsule network designed to classify fire and smoke locations at different distances outdoors, given only an image of a single fire and smoke as input. The proposed model was designed to solve two main limitations of the base capsule network input and the analysis of large-sized images, as well as to compensate the absence of a deep network using an attention-based approach to improve the classification of the fire and smoke results. In term of practicality, our method is comparable with prior strategies based on machine learning and deep learning methods. We trained and tested the proposed model using our datasets collected from different sources. As the results indicate, a high classification accuracy in comparison with other modern architectures was achieved. Further, the results indicate that the proposed approach is robust and stable for the classification of images from outdoor CCTV cameras with different viewpoints given the presence of smoke and fire.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 8

SN  - 2311-7524

AB  - In order to realize the real-time and accurate detection of potted flowers on benches, in this paper we propose a method based on the ZED 2 stereo camera and the YOLO V4-Tiny deep learning algorithm for potted flower detection and location. First, an automatic detection model of flowers was established based on the YOLO V4-Tiny convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and the center points on the pixel plane of the flowers were obtained according to the prediction box. Then, the real-time 3D point cloud information obtained by the ZED 2 camera was used to calculate the actual position of the flowers. The test results showed that the mean average precision (MAP) and recall rate of the training model was 89.72% and 80%, respectively, and the real-time average detection frame rate of the model deployed under Jetson TX2 was 16 FPS. The results of the occlusion experiment showed that when the canopy overlap ratio between the two flowers is more than 10%, the recognition accuracy will be affected. The mean absolute error of the flower center location based on 3D point cloud information of the ZED 2 camera was 18.1 mm, and the maximum locating error of the flower center was 25.8 mm under different light radiation conditions. The method in this paper establishes the relationship between the detection target of flowers and the actual spatial location, which has reference significance for the machinery and automatic management of potted flowers on benches.

TI  - Inspecting Buildings Using Drones and Computer Vision: A Machine Learning Approach to Detect Cracks and Damages
T2  - Drones

PY  - 2022
VL  - 6
IS  - 1
SN  - 2504-446X

AB  - Manual inspection of infrastructure damages such as building cracks is difficult due to the objectivity and reliability of assessment and high demands of time and costs. This can be automated using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery of damages. Numerous computer vision-based approaches have been applied to address the limitations of crack detection but they have their limitations that can be overcome by using various hybrid approaches based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs), an application of the deep learning (DL) method, display remarkable potential for automatically detecting image features such as damages and are less sensitive to image noise. A modified deep hierarchical CNN architecture has been used in this study for crack detection and damage assessment in civil infrastructures. The proposed architecture is based on 16 convolution layers and a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). For this study, the crack images were collected using UAVs and open-source images of mid to high rise buildings (five stories and above) constructed during 2000 in Sydney, Australia. Conventionally, a CNN network only utilizes the last layer of convolution. However, our proposed network is based on the utility of multiple layers. Another important component of the proposed CNN architecture is the application of guided filtering (GF) and conditional random fields (CRFs) to refine the predicted outputs to get reliable results. Benchmarking data (600 images) of Sydney-based buildings damages was used to test the proposed architecture. The proposed deep hierarchical CNN architecture produced superior performance when evaluated using five methods: GF method, Baseline (BN) method, Deep-Crack BN, Deep-Crack GF, and SegNet. Overall, the GF method outperformed all other methods as indicated by the global accuracy (0.990), class average accuracy (0.939), mean intersection of the union overall classes (IoU) (0.879), precision (0.838), recall (0.879), and F-score (0.8581) values. Overall, the proposed CNN architecture provides the advantages of reduced noise, highly integrated supervision of features, adequate learning, and aggregation of both multi-scale and multilevel features during the training procedure along with the refinement of the overall output predictions.

TI  - Multilevel Central Trust Management Approach for Task Scheduling on IoT-Based Mobile Cloud Computing
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the increasing number of mobile devices and IoT devices across a wide range of real-life applications, our mobile cloud computing devices will not cope with this growing number of audiences soon, which implies and demands the need to shift to fog computing. Task scheduling is one of the most demanding scopes after the trust computation inside the trustable nodes. The mobile devices and IoT devices transfer the resource-intensive tasks towards mobile cloud computing. Some tasks are resource-intensive and not trustable to allocate to the mobile cloud computing resources. This consequently gives rise to trust evaluation and data sync-up of devices joining and leaving the network. The resources are more intensive for cloud computing and mobile cloud computing. Time, energy, and resources are wasted due to the nontrustable nodes. This research article proposes a multilevel trust enhancement approach for efficient task scheduling in mobile cloud environments. We first calculate the trustable tasks needed to offload towards the mobile cloud computing. Then, an efficient and dynamic scheduler is added to enhance the task scheduling after trust computation using social and environmental trust computation techniques. To improve the time and energy efficiency of IoT and mobile devices using the proposed technique, the energy computation and time request computation are compared with the existing methods from literature, which identified improvements in the results. Our proposed approach is centralized to tackle constant SyncUPs of incoming devices&rsquo; trust values with mobile cloud computing. With the benefits of mobile cloud computing, the centralized data distribution method is a positive approach.

AB  - Buildings shape cities as those cities grow from and nurture people living and working within the built environment. Thus, the conceptualization of smart building should be brought closer to the smart city initiatives that particularly target ensuring and enhancing the sustainability and quality of urban life. In this paper, we propose that a smart building should be interlinked with a smart city surrounding it; it should provide good experiences to its various occupants and it should be in an ongoing state of evolving as an ecosystem, wherein different stakeholders can join to co-produce, co-provide and co-consume services. Smart buildings require a versatile set of smart services based on digital solutions, solutions in the built environment and human activities. We conducted a multiphase collaborative study on new service opportunities guided by a Design Thinking approach. The approach brought people, technology, and business perspectives together and resulted in key service opportunities that have the potential to make the buildings smart and provide enjoyable experience to the occupants who support their living and working activities in smart cities. This paper provides the resulting practical implications as well as proposes future avenues for research.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Electricity loads are basic and important information for power generation facilities and traders, especially in terms of production plans, daily operations, unit commitments, and economic dispatches. Short-term load forecasting (STLF), which predicts power loads for a few days, plays a vital role in the reliable, safe, and efficient operation of a power system. Currently, two main challenges are faced by existing STLF prediction models. The first involves how to fuse multiscale electricity load data to obtain a high-performance model and remove data noise after integration. The second involves how to improve the local optimal solution despite the sample quality problem. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multiscale electricity load data fusion- and STLF-based short time series prediction model built on a sparse deep autoencoder and self-paced learning (SPL). A sparse deep autoencoder was used to solve the multiscale data fusion problem with data noise. Furthermore, SPL was utilized to solve the local optimal solution problem. The experimental results showed that our model was better than the existing STLF prediction models by more than 15.89% in terms of the mean squared error (MSE) indicator.

AB  - Broader understanding of waste management has the potential to bring about broad societal change impacting the climate crisis and public health. We present existing waste management tools and commercially-available games involving waste management, highlighting the strengths and opportunities left unaddressed by these tools in educational contexts and planning use cases. A survey motivates the need for enhanced interactive tools providing clear feedback through quick-visibility performance indicators. After identifying an opportunity to build upon highly-detailed multi-criteria simulation tools, we explore the need for easy-to-read performance metrics that will bring to the field of waste management easily identifiable and measurable key performance indicators (KPIs) that vary alongside factors affecting waste management policies. Such metrics are introduced and detailed as part of a unified waste management model. We then develop a representative gamified educational tool based upon this model to be used by students, decision makers planning real-world policies, and the public. This simulator is built upon the Unity Game Engine and emulates waste management techniques and resulting KPIs within the context of a virtual city.

AB  - The rapid expansion of a country&rsquo;s economy is highly dependent on timely product distribution, which is hampered by terrible traffic congestion. Additional staff are also required to follow the delivery vehicle while it transports documents or records to another destination. This study proposes Delicar, a self-driving product delivery vehicle that can drive the vehicle on the road and report the current geographical location to the authority in real-time through a map. The equipped camera module captures the road image and transfers it to the computer via socket server programming. The raspberry pi sends the camera image and waits for the steering angle value. The image is fed to the pre-trained deep learning model that predicts the steering angle regarding that situation. Then the steering angle value is passed to the raspberry pi that directs the L298 motor driver which direction the wheel should follow. Based upon this direction, L298 decides either forward or left or right or backwards movement. The 3-cell 12V LiPo battery handles the power supply to the raspberry pi and L298 motor driver. A buck converter regulates a 5V 3A power supply to the raspberry pi to be working. Nvidia CNN architecture has been followed, containing nine layers including five convolution layers and three dense layers to develop the steering angle predictive model. Geoip2 (a python library) retrieves the longitude and latitude from the equipped system&rsquo;s IP address to report the live geographical position to the authorities. After that, Folium is used to depict the geographical location. Moreover, the system&rsquo;s infrastructure is far too low-cost and easy to install.

AB  - Today, critical infrastructure is more interconnected, which allows more vulnerabilities in the case of disasters. In addition, the effect of one infrastructure can lead to one or more cascading failures in another infrastructure due to the dependency complexity between them. This article introduces a holistic approach using network indicators and machine learning to better understand the geographical representation of critical infrastructure. Previous work on a similar model was based on a single measure; such as in fashion, this paper introduces four measures utilized to identify the most vital geographic zone in the city. The model aims to increase resilience, focusing on the preparedness phase by assessing the essential nodes of infrastructure, which allows more space to adopt risk mitigation strategies before any disturbance event. Holding in-depth knowledge of the vital zones of small scales and accordingly ranking them will positively improve the overall system resilience.

As such, this paper presents case-study research for the definition of a business intelligence model and related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to support risk-related decision making. The study firstly comprises a literature review on approaches for governance management, which confirm a disconnection between theory and practice. It then progresses to mapping the main business areas and suggesting exemplary KPIs to fill this gap. Finally, it documents the design and usage of a BI dashboard, as emerged via a validation with four managers. This early application shows the advantages of BI for both business operators and governance managers.

AB  - In the construction of new smart cities, traditional fire-detection systems can be replaced with vision-based systems to establish fire safety in society using emerging technologies, such as digital cameras, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. In this study, we developed a fire detector that accurately detects even small sparks and sounds an alarm within 8 s of a fire outbreak. A novel convolutional neural network was developed to detect fire regions using an enhanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4network. Based on the improved YOLOv4 algorithm, we adapted the network to operate on the Banana Pi M3 board using only three layers. Initially, we examined the originalYOLOv4 approach to determine the accuracy of predictions of candidate fire regions. However, the anticipated results were not observed after several experiments involving this approach to detect fire accidents. We improved the traditional YOLOv4 network by increasing the size of the training dataset based on data augmentation techniques for the real-time monitoring of fire disasters. By modifying the network structure through automatic color augmentation, reducing parameters, etc., the proposed method successfully detected and notified the incidence of disastrous fires with a high speed and accuracy in different weather environments&mdash;sunny or cloudy, day or night. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method can be used successfully for the protection of smart cities and in monitoring fires in urban areas. Finally, we compared the performance of our method with that of recently reported fire-detection approaches employing widely used performance matrices to test the fire classification results achieved.

SN  - 2306-5354

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on hospitals and healthcare systems around the world. The cost of business disruption combined with lingering COVID-19 costs has placed many public hospitals on a course to insolvency. To quickly return to financial stability, hospitals should implement efficiency measure. An average technical efficiency (ATE) model made up of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) for assessing efficiency in public hospitals during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is offered. The DEA method is a non-parametric method that requires no information other than the input and output quantities. SFA is a parametric method that considers stochastic noise in data and allows statistical testing of hypotheses about production structure and degree of inefficiency. The rationale for using these two competing approaches is to balance each method&rsquo;s strengths, weaknesses and introduce a novel integrated approach. To show the applicability and efficacy of the proposed hybrid VRS-CRS-SFA (VCS) model, a case study is presented.

IS  - 1
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Accurate traffic status prediction is of great importance to improve the security and reliability of the intelligent transportation system. However, urban traffic status prediction is a very challenging task due to the tight symmetry among the Human&ndash;Vehicle&ndash;Environment (HVE). The recently proposed spatial&ndash;temporal 3D convolutional neural network (ST-3DNet) effectively extracts both spatial and temporal characteristics in HVE, but ignores the essential long-term temporal characteristics and the symmetry of historical data. Therefore, a novel spatial&ndash;temporal 3D residual correlation network (ST-3DRCN) is proposed for urban traffic status prediction in this paper. The ST-3DRCN firstly introduces the Pearson correlation coefficient method to extract a high correlation between traffic data. Then, a dynamic spatial feature extraction component is constructed by using 3D convolution combined with residual units to capture dynamic spatial features. After that, based on the idea of long short-term memory (LSTM), a novel architectural unit is proposed to extract dynamic temporal features. Finally, the spatial and temporal features are fused to obtain the final prediction results. Experiments have been performed using two datasets from Chengdu, China (TaxiCD) and California, USA (PEMS-BAY). Taking the root mean square error (RMSE) as the evaluation index, the prediction accuracy of ST-3DRCN on TaxiCD dataset is 21.4%, 21.3%, 11.7%, 10.8%, 4.7%, 3.6% and 2.3% higher than LSTM, convolutional neural network (CNN), 3D-CNN, spatial&ndash;temporal residual network (ST-ResNet), spatial&ndash;temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), dynamic global-local spatial&ndash;temporal network (DGLSTNet), and ST-3DNet, respectively.

AB  - Urban vitality is a key indicator for measuring urban development. This topic has been trending in urban planning and sustainable development, and significant progress has been made in measuring single indicators of urban vitality based on parcel or block units. With the continuous development of smart sensing technology, multisource urban data are becoming increasingly abundant. The application of such data to measure the multidimensional urban vitality of street space, reflecting multiple functions of an urban space, can significantly improve the accuracy of urban vitality analyses and promote the construction of people-oriented healthy cities. In this study, streets were taken as the analysis unit, and multisource data such as the trajectories of taxies and shared bicycles, user reviews and cultural facility points of interest (POIs) in Chengdu, a city in southwestern China, were used to identify spatial patterns of urban vitality on streets across social, economic and cultural dimensions. The correlation between the built environment factors and the multidimensional urban vitality on the street was analyzed using a multiple regression model. The spatial distribution of the different dimensions of urban vitality of the street space in Chengdu varies to a certain extent. It is common for areas with high social vitality to have production and life centers nearby. High economic vitality centers are typically found along busy streets with a high concentration of businesses. Areas with high cultural vitality centers tend to be concentrated on the city&rsquo;s central streets. Land use, transportation, external environment, population and employment are all closely linked to urban vitality on streets. The crowd counting and POI density have the greatest impact on multidimensional urban vitality. The crowd and the level of service facilities profoundly affect social interaction, trade activities and cultural communication. The goodness of fit (R2) of the regression models for social, economic and cultural vitality are 0.590, 0.423 and 0.409, respectively. Using multisource urban data, our findings can help stakeholders better understand the spatial patterns and influencing factors of multidimensional urban vitality on streets and provide sustainable urban planning and development strategies for the future.

AB  - Using extensive databases and known algorithms to predict short-term energy consumption comprises most computational solutions based on artificial intelligence today. State-of-the-art approaches validate their prediction models in offline environments that disregard automation, quality monitoring, and retraining challenges present in online scenarios. The existing demand response initiatives lack personalization, thus not engaging consumers. Obtaining specific and valuable recommendations is difficult for most digital platforms due to their solution pattern: extensive database, specialized algorithms, and using profiles with similar aspects. The challenges and present personalization tactics have been researched by adopting a digital twin model. This study creates a different approach by adding structural topology to build a new category of recommendation platform using the digital twin model with real-time data collected by IoT sensors to improve machine learning methods. A residential study case with 31 IoT smart meter and smart plug devices with 19-month data (measurements performed each second) validated Digital Twin MLOps architecture for personalized demand response suggestions based on online short-term energy consumption prediction.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to the wide availability and usage of connected devices in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the number of attacks on these networks is continually increasing. A particularly serious and dangerous type of attack in the IoT environment is the botnet attack, where the attackers can control the IoT systems to generate enormous networks of &ldquo;bot&rdquo; devices for generating malicious activities. To detect this type of attack, several Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been proposed for IoT networks based on machine learning and deep learning methods. As the main characteristics of IoT systems include their limited battery power and processor capacity, maximizing the efficiency of intrusion detection systems for IoT networks is still a research challenge. It is important to provide efficient and effective methods that use lower computational time and have high detection rates. This paper proposes an aggregated mutual information-based feature selection approach with machine learning methods to enhance detection of IoT botnet attacks. In this study, the N-BaIoT benchmark dataset was used to detect botnet attack types using real traffic data gathered from nine commercial IoT devices. The dataset includes binary and multi-class classifications. The feature selection method incorporates Mutual Information (MI) technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and ANOVA f-test at finely-granulated detection level to select the relevant features for improving the performance of IoT Botnet classifiers. In the classification step, several ensemble and individual classifiers were used, including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Gaussian Na&iuml;ve Bayes (GNB), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results showed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperformed other techniques using various evaluation metrics.

AB  - The emergence of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), has prompted a reconsideration of methodologies for network security as well as reducing operation and maintenance costs, especially at the physical layer, where the energy consumption plays an important role. This article demonstrates through simulations and experiments that, while the cooperative scheme is more efficient when a WSN is at normal operating conditions, the collaborative scheme offers more enhanced protection against the aggressiveness of jamming in the performance metrics, thus making it safer, reducing operation and maintenance costs and laying the foundations for jamming mitigation. This document additionally offers an algorithm to detect jamming in real time. Firstly, it examines the characteristics and damages caused by the type of aggressor. Secondly, it reflects on the natural immunity of the WSN (which depends on its node density and a cooperative or collaborative configuration). Finally, it considers the performance metrics, especially those that impact energy consumption during transmission.

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Ground-level ozone is a pollutant that is harmful to urban populations, particularly in developing countries where it is present in significant quantities. It greatly increases the risk of heart and lung diseases and harms agricultural crops. This study hypothesized that, as a secondary pollutant, ground-level ozone is amenable to 24 h forecasting based on measurements of weather conditions and primary pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. We developed software to analyze hourly records of 12 air pollutants and 5 weather variables over the course of one year in Delhi, India. To determine the best predictive model, eight machine learning algorithms were tuned, trained, tested, and compared using cross-validation with hourly data for a full year. The algorithms, ranked by R2 values, were XGBoost (0.61), Random Forest (0.61), K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (0.55), Support Vector Regression (0.48), Decision Trees (0.43), AdaBoost (0.39), and linear regression (0.39). When trained by separate seasons across five years, the predictive capabilities of all models increased, with a maximum R2 of 0.75 during winter. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory was the least accurate model for annual training, but had some of the best predictions for seasonal training. Out of five air quality index categories, the XGBoost model was able to predict the correct category 24 h in advance 90% of the time when trained with full-year data. Separated by season, winter is considerably more predictable (97.3%), followed by post-monsoon (92.8%), monsoon (90.3%), and summer (88.9%). These results show the importance of training machine learning methods with season-specific data sets and comparing a large number of methods for specific applications.

AB  - Cloud computing has become integral lately due to the ever-expanding Internet-of-things (IoT) network. It still is and continues to be the best practice for implementing complex computational applications, emphasizing the massive processing of data. However, the cloud falls short due to the critical constraints of novel IoT applications generating vast data, which entails a swift response time with improved privacy. The newest drift is moving computational and storage resources to the edge of the network, involving a decentralized distributed architecture. The data processing and analytics perform at proximity to end-users, and overcome the bottleneck of cloud computing. The trend of deploying machine learning (ML) at the network edge to enhance computing applications and services has gained momentum lately, specifically to reduce latency and energy consumed while optimizing the security and management of resources. There is a need for rigorous research efforts oriented towards developing and implementing machine learning algorithms that deliver the best results in terms of speed, accuracy, storage, and security, with low power consumption. This extensive survey presented on the prominent computing paradigms in practice highlights the latest innovations resulting from the fusion between ML and the evolving computing paradigms and discusses the underlying open research challenges and future prospects.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - This paper proposes enhanced prediction and control design methods for improving traffic flow with human-driven and automated vehicles. To achieve accurate prediction for the entire time horizon, data-driven and model-based prediction methods were integrated. The goal of the integration was to accurately predict the outflow of the traffic network, which was selected as the highway section in this paper. The proposed novel prediction method was used in the optimal design for calculating controlled inflows on highway ramps. The goal of the design was to reach the maximum outflow of the traffic network, even against disturbances on uncontrolled inflows of the network. The control design leads to an optimization problem based on the min&ndash;max principle, i.e., the traffic outflow is considered to be maximized by controlled inflows and to be minimized by uncontrolled inflows. The effectiveness of the prediction and the control methods through simulation examples are illustrated, i.e., traffic outflow can be maximized by the control system under various uncontrolled inflow values.

SN  - 1099-4300

AB  - Particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is an effective metaheuristic that can determine Pareto-optimal solutions. We propose an extended PSO by introducing quantum gates in order to ensure the diversity of particle populations that are looking for efficient alternatives. The quality of solutions was verified in the issue of assignment of resources in the computing cloud to improve the live migration of virtual machines. We consider the multi-criteria optimization problem of deep learning-based models embedded into virtual machines. Computing clouds with deep learning agents can support several areas of education, smart city or economy. Because deep learning agents require lots of computer resources, seven criteria are studied such as electric power of hosts, reliability of cloud, CPU workload of the bottleneck host, communication capacity of the critical node, a free RAM capacity of the most loaded memory, a free disc memory capacity of the most busy storage, and overall computer costs. Quantum gates modify an accepted position for the current location of a particle. To verify the above concept, various simulations have been carried out on the laboratory cloud based on the OpenStack platform. Numerical experiments have confirmed that multi-objective quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization algorithm provides better solutions than the other metaheuristics.

AB  - Intelligent traffic management is an important issue for smart cities. City councils try to implement the newest techniques and performant technologies in order to avoid traffic congestion, to optimize the use of traffic lights, to efficiently use car parking, etc. To find the best solution to this problem, Birmingham City Council decided to allow open-source predictive traffic forecasting by making the real-time datasets available. This paper proposes a multi-agent system (MAS) approach for intelligent urban traffic management in Birmingham using forecasting and classification techniques. The designed agents have the following tasks: forecast the occupancy rates for traffic flow, road junctions and car parking; classify the faults; control and monitor the entire process. The experimental results show that k-nearest neighbor forecasts with high accuracy rates for the traffic data and decision trees build the most accurate model for classifying the faults for their detection and repair in the shortest possible time. The whole learning process is coordinated by a monitoring agent in order to automate Birmingham city&rsquo;s traffic management.

AB  - Seaports are genuine, intermodal hubs connecting seaways to inland transport links, such as roads and railways. Seaports are located at the focal point of institutional, industrial, and control activities in a jungle of interconnected information systems. System integration is setting considerable challenges when a group of independent providers are asked to implement complementary software functionalities. For this reason, seaports are the ideal playground where software is highly composite and tailored to a large variety of final users (from the so-called port communities). Although the target would be that of shaping the Port Authorities to be providers of (digital) innovation services, the state-of-the-art is still that of considering them as final users, or proxies of them. For this reason, we show how a canonical cloud, virtualizing a distributed architecture, can be structured to host different, possibly overlapped, tenants, slicing the information system at the infrastructure, platform, and software layers. Resources at the infrastructure and platform layers are shared so that a variety of independent applications can make use of the local calculus and access the data stored in a Data Lake. Such a cloud is adopted by the Port of Livorno as a rapid prototyping framework for the development and deployment of ICT innovation services. In order to demonstrate the versatility of this framework, three case studies relating to as many prototype ICT services (Navigation Safety, e-Freight, and Logistics) released within three industrial tenants are here presented and discussed.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The paper presents a new security aspect for a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET)-based IoT model using the concept of artificial intelligence. The Black Hole Attack (BHA) is considered one of the most affecting threats in the MANET in which the attacker node drops the entire data traffic and hence degrades the network performance. Therefore, it necessitates the designing of an algorithm that can protect the network from the BHA node. This article introduces Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), a new updated routing protocol that combines the advantages of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The combination of the SVM with ANN is the novelty of the proposed model that helps to identify the attackers within the discovered route using the AODV routing mechanism. Here, the model is trained using ANN but the selection of training data is performed using the ABC fitness function followed by SVM. The role of ABC is to provide a better route for data transmission between the source and the destination node. The optimized route, suggested by ABC, is then passed to the SVM model along with the node&rsquo;s properties. Based on those properties ANN decides whether the node is a normal or an attacker node. The simulation analysis performed in MATLAB shows that the proposed work exhibits an improvement in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), throughput, and delay. To validate the system efficiency, a comparative analysis is performed against the existing approaches such as Decision Tree and Random Forest that indicate that the utilization of the SVM with ANN is a beneficial step regarding the detection of BHA attackers in the MANET-based IoT networks.

SN  - 2077-0472

AB  - Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and autonomous local stakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple participants linked by complicated interactions, impacting the production, processing, transportation, and delivery of food to end consumers. Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology&rsquo;s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally, we discussed the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed by a conclusion and future work.

AB  - Fifth-generation (5G) technology will play a vital role in future wireless networks. The breakthrough 5G technology will unleash a massive Internet of Everything (IoE), where billions of connected devices, people, and processes will be simultaneously served. The services provided by 5G include several use cases enabled by the enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication. Fifth-generation networks potentially merge multiple networks on a single platform, providing a landscape for seamless connectivity, particularly for high-mobility devices. With their enhanced speed, 5G networks are prone to various research challenges. In this context, we provide a comprehensive survey on 5G technologies that emphasize machine learning-based solutions to cope with existing and future challenges. First, we discuss 5G network architecture and outline the key performance indicators compared to the previous and upcoming network generations. Second, we discuss next-generation wireless networks and their characteristics, applications, and use cases for fast connectivity to billions of devices. Then, we confer physical layer services, functions, and issues that decrease the signal quality. We also present studies on 5G network technologies, 5G propelling trends, and architectures that help to achieve the goals of 5G. Moreover, we discuss signaling techniques for 5G massive multiple-input and multiple-output and beam-forming techniques to enhance data rates with efficient spectrum sharing. Further, we review security and privacy concerns in 5G and standard bodies&rsquo; actionable recommendations for policy makers. Finally, we also discuss emerging challenges and future directions.

AB  - Identifying changes in ambient air pollution levels and establishing causation is a research area of strategic importance to assess the effectiveness of air quality interventions. A major challenge in pursuing these objectives is represented by the confounding effects of the meteorological conditions which easily mask or emphasize changes in pollutants concentrations. In this study, a methodological procedure to analyze changes in pollutants concentrations levels after accounting for changes in meteorology over time was developed. The procedure integrated several statistical tools, such as the change points detection and trend analysis that are applied to the pollutants concentrations meteorologically normalized using a machine learning model. Data of air pollutants and meteorological parameters, collected over the period 2013&ndash;2019 in a rural area affected by anthropic emissive sources, were used to test the procedure. The joint analysis of the obtained results with the available metadata allowed providing plausible explanations of the observed air pollutants behavior. Consequently, the procedure appears promising in elucidating those changes in the air pollutant levels not easily identifiable in the original data, supplying valuable information to identify an atmospheric response after an intervention or an unplanned event.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), various tasks are created dynamically because of the small quantity batch production. Hence, it is difficult to execute tasks only with devices that have limited battery lives and computation capabilities. To solve this problem, we adopted the mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm. However, if there are numerous tasks to be processed on the MEC server (MECS), it may not be suitable to deal with all tasks in the server within a delay constraint owing to the limited computational capability and high network overhead. Therefore, among cooperative computing techniques, we focus on task offloading to nearby devices using device-to-device (D2D) communication. Consequently, we propose a method that determines the optimal offloading strategy in an MEC environment with D2D communication. We aim to minimize the energy consumption of the devices and task execution delay under certain delay constraints. To solve this problem, we adopt a Q-learning algorithm that is part of reinforcement learning (RL). However, if one learning agent determines whether to offload tasks from all devices, the computing complexity of that agent increases tremendously. Thus, we cluster the nearby devices that comprise the job shop, where each cluster&rsquo;s head determines the optimal offloading strategy for the tasks that occur within its cluster. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared methods in terms of device energy consumption, task completion rate, task blocking rate, and throughput.

AB  - Forests are an enduring component of the natural world and perform a vital role in protecting the environment. Forests are valuable resources to control global warming and provide oxygen for the survival of human life, including wood for households. Forest fires have recently emerged as a major threat to biological processes and the ecosystem. Unfortunately, almost every year, fire damages millions of hectares of forest land due to late and inefficient detection of fire. However, it is important to identify the forest fire at the initial level before it spreads to vast areas and destroys natural resources. In this paper, a formal model of the Internet of Things (IoT) and drone-based forest fire detection and counteraction system is presented. The proposed system comprises network maintenance. Sensor deployment is on trees, the ground, and animals in the form of subnets to transmit sensed data to the control room. All subnets are connected to the control room through gateway nodes. Alarms are being used to alert human beings and animals to save their lives, which will help to initially protect them from fire. The embedded sensors collect the information and transfer it to the gateways. Drones are being used for real-time visualization of fire-affected areas and to perform actions to control fires because they play a vital role in disasters. Graph theory is used to construct an efficient model and to show the connectivity of the network. To identify failures and develop recovery procedures, the algorithm is designed through the graph-based model. The model is developed by the Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL), and the correctness of the model is ensured using various VDM-SL toolbox facilities.

AB  - Charging station (CS) planning for electric vehicles (EVs) for a region has become an important concern for urban planners and the public alike to improve the adoption of EVs. Two major problems comprising this research area are: (i) the EV charging station placement (EVCSP) problem, and (ii) the CS need estimation problem for a region. In this work, different explainable solutions based on machine learning (ML) and simulation were investigated by incorporating quantitative and qualitative metrics. The solutions were compared with traditional approaches using a real CS area of Austin and a greenfield area of Bengaluru. For EVCSP, a different class of clustering solutions, i.e., mean-based, density-based, spectrum- or eigenvalues-based, and Gaussian distribution were evaluated. Different perspectives, such as the urban planner perspective, i.e., the clustering efficiency, and the EV owner perspective, i.e., an acceptable distance to the nearest CS, were considered. For the CS need estimation, ML solutions based on quadratic regression and simulations were evaluated. Using our CS planning methods urban planners can make better CS placement decisions and can estimate CS needs for the present and the future.

AB  - Aluminum windows are crucial components of building envelopes since they connect the indoor space to the external environment. Various external causes degrade or harm the functioning of aluminum windows. In this regard, inspecting the performance of aluminum windows is a necessary task to keep buildings healthy. This review illustrates the deterioration mechanisms of aluminum windows under various environmental conditions with an intention to provide comprehensive information for developing damage protection and inspection technologies. The illustrations reveal that moisture and chloride ions have the most detrimental effect on deteriorating aluminum windows in the long run, while mechanical loads can damage aluminum windows in a sudden manner. In addition, multiple advanced inspection techniques potential to benefit assessing aluminum window health state are discussed in order to help tackle the efficiency problem of traditional visual inspection. The comparison among those techniques demonstrates that infrared thermography can help acquire a preliminary defect profile of inspected windows, whereas ultrasonic phased arrays technology demonstrates a high level of competency in analyzing comprehensive defect information. This review also discusses the challenges in the scarcity of nanoscale corrosion information for insightful understandings of aluminum window corrosion and reliable window inspection tools for lifespan prediction. In this regard, molecular dynamics simulation and artificial intelligence technology are recommended as promising tools for better revealing the deterioration mechanisms and advancing inspection techniques, respectively, for future directions. It is envisioned that this paper will help upgrade the aluminum window inspection scheme and contribute to driving the construction of intelligent and safe cities.

AB  - With the rise of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of agricultural and farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT, in particular, can improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes by eliminating human intervention through automation. The fast rise of Internet of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life sectors, including business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various obstacles. IoT aids in collecting data that is useful in the farming sector, such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility, amount of water required for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively use technology to monitor their forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors, including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor networks), are utilized for agricultural inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact output and utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from afar. The goal of this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates IoT applications, benefits, current obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart agricultural system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield and save time, such as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer management.

SN  - 2624-8921

AB  - High-speed capsular vehicles are firstly suggested as an idea by Elon Musk of Tesla Company. Unlike conventional high-speed trains, capsular vehicles are individual vessels carrying passengers and freight with the expected maximum speed of near 1200 [km/h] in a near-vacuum tunnel. More individual vehicle speed, dispatch, and position control in the operational aspect are expected over connected trains. This numerical study and investigation evaluate and analyze inter-distance control and their characteristics for high-speed capsular vehicles and their operational aspects. Among many aspects of operation, the inter-distance of multiple vehicles is critical toward passenger/freight flow rate and infrastructural investment. In this paper, the system&rsquo;s equation, equation of the motion, and various characteristics of the system are introduced, and in particular control design parameters for inter-distance control and actuation are numerically shown. As a conclusion, (1) Inter-distance between vehicles is a function of error rate and second car start time, the magnitude range is determined by second car start time, (2) Inter-distance fluctuation rate is a function of error rate and second car start time, however; it can be minimized by choosing the correct second car start time, and (3) If the second car start time is chosen an integer number of push-down cycle time at specific velocity error rate, the inter-distance fluctuation can be zero.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are low-cost, special-purpose networks introduced to resolve various daily life domestic, industrial, and strategic problems. These networks are deployed in such places where the repairments, in most cases, become difficult. The nodes in WSNs, due to their vulnerable nature, are always prone to various potential threats. The deployed environment of WSNs is noncentral, unattended, and administrativeless; therefore, malicious attacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks can easily be commenced by the attackers. Most of the DDoS detection systems rely on the analysis of the flow of traffic, ultimately with a conclusion that high traffic may be due to the DDoS attack. On the other hand, legitimate users may produce a larger amount of traffic known, as the flash crowd (FC). Both DDOS and FC are considered abnormal traffic in communication networks. The detection of such abnormal traffic and then separation of DDoS attacks from FC is also a focused challenge. This paper introduces a novel mechanism based on a Bayesian model to detect abnormal data traffic and discriminate DDoS attacks from FC in it. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, compared with the existing systems.

AB  - Social distancing is crucial to restrain the spread of diseases such as COVID-19, but complete adherence to safety guidelines is not guaranteed. Monitoring social distancing through mass surveillance is paramount to develop appropriate mitigation plans and exit strategies. Nevertheless, it is a labor-intensive task that is prone to human error and tainted with plausible breaches of privacy. This paper presents a privacy-preserving adaptive social distance estimation and crowd monitoring solution for camera surveillance systems. We develop a novel person localization strategy through pose estimation, build a privacy-preserving adaptive smoothing and tracking model to mitigate occlusions and noisy/missing measurements, compute inter-personal distances in the real-world coordinates, detect social distance infractions, and identify overcrowded regions in a scene. Performance evaluation is carried out by testing the system&rsquo;s ability in person detection, localization, density estimation, anomaly recognition, and high-risk areas identification. We compare the proposed system to the latest techniques and examine the performance gain delivered by the localization and smoothing/tracking algorithms. Experimental results indicate a considerable improvement, across different metrics, when utilizing the developed system. In addition, they show its potential and functionality for applications other than social distancing.

TI  - An Efficient Algorithm for Ocean-Front Evolution Trend Recognition
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Marine hydrological elements are of vital importance in marine surveys. The evolution of these elements can have a profound effect on the relationship between human activities and marine hydrology. Therefore, the detection and explanation of the evolution laws of marine hydrological elements are urgently needed. In this paper, a novel method, named Evolution Trend Recognition (ETR), is proposed to recognize the trend of ocean fronts, being the most important information in the ocean dynamic process. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the task of ocean-front trend classification. A novel classification algorithm is first proposed for recognizing the ocean-front trend, in terms of the ocean-front scale and strength. Then, the GoogLeNet Inception network is trained to classify the ocean-front trend, i.e., enhancing or attenuating. The ocean-front trend is classified using the deep neural network, as well as a physics-informed classification algorithm. The two classification results are combined to make the final decision on the trend classification. Furthermore, two novel databases were created for this research, and their generation method is described, to foster research in this direction. These two databases are called the Ocean-Front Tracking Dataset (OFTraD) and the Ocean-Front Trend Dataset (OFTreD). Moreover, experiment results show that our proposed method on OFTreD achieves a higher classification accuracy, which is 97.5%, than state-of-the-art networks. This demonstrates that the proposed ETR algorithm is highly promising for trend classification.

TI  - Improved Mask R-CNN for Rural Building Roof Type Recognition from UAV High-Resolution Images: A Case Study in Hunan Province, China
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Accurate roof information of buildings can be obtained from UAV high-resolution images. The large-scale accurate recognition of roof types (such as gabled, flat, hipped, complex and mono-pitched roofs) of rural buildings is crucial for rural planning and construction. At present, most UAV high-resolution optical images only have red, green and blue (RGB) band information, which aggravates the problems of inter-class similarity and intra-class variability of image features. Furthermore, the different roof types of rural buildings are complex, spatially scattered, and easily covered by vegetation, which in turn leads to the low accuracy of roof type identification by existing methods. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a method for identifying roof types of complex rural buildings based on visible high-resolution remote sensing images from UAVs. First, the fusion of deep learning networks with different visual features is investigated to analyze the effect of the different feature combinations of the visible difference vegetation index (VDVI) and Sobel edge detection features and UAV visible images on model recognition of rural building roof types. Secondly, an improved Mask R-CNN model is proposed to learn more complex features of different types of images of building roofs by using the ResNet152 feature extraction network with migration learning. After we obtained roof type recognition results in two test areas, we evaluated the accuracy of the results using the confusion matrix and obtained the following conclusions: (1) the model with RGB images incorporating Sobel edge detection features has the highest accuracy and enables the model to recognize more and more accurately the roof types of different morphological rural buildings, and the model recognition accuracy (Kappa coefficient (KC)) compared to that of RGB images is on average improved by 0.115; (2) compared with the original Mask R-CNN, U-Net, DeeplabV3 and PSPNet deep learning models, the improved Mask R-CNN model has the highest accuracy in recognizing the roof types of rural buildings, with F1-score, KC and OA averaging 0.777, 0.821 and 0.905, respectively. The method can obtain clear and accurate profiles and types of rural building roofs, and can be extended for green roof suitability evaluation, rooftop solar potential assessment, and other building roof surveys, management and planning.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Analyzing data related to the conditions of city streets and avenues could help to make better decisions about public spending on mobility. Generally, streets and avenues are fixed as soon as they have a citizen report or when a major incident occurs. However, it is uncommon for cities to have real-time reactive systems that detect the different problems they have to fix on the pavement. This work proposes a solution to detect anomalies in streets through state analysis using sensors within the vehicles that travel daily and connecting them to a fog-computing architecture on a V2I network. The system detects and classifies the main road problems or abnormal conditions in streets and avenues using Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA), comparing roughness against a flat reference. An instrumented vehicle obtained the reference through accelerometry sensors and then sent the data through a mid-range communication system. With these data, the system compared an Artificial Neural Network (supervised MLA) and a K-Nearest Neighbor (Supervised MLA) to select the best option to handle the acquired data. This system makes it desirable to visualize the streets&rsquo; quality and map the areas with the most significant anomalies.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Ultra-Wide Bandwidth (UWB) and mm-wave radio systems can resolve specular multipath components (SMCs) from estimated channel impulse response measurements. A geometric model can describe the delays, angles-of-arrival, and angles-of-departure of these SMCs, allowing for a prediction of these channel features. For the modeling of the amplitudes of the SMCs, a data-driven approach has been proposed recently, using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to map and predict the SMC amplitudes. In this paper, the applicability of the proposed multipath-resolved, GPR-based channel model is analyzed by studying features of the propagation channel from a set of channel measurements. The features analyzed include the energy capture of the modeled SMCs, the number of resolvable SMCs, and the ranging information that could be extracted from the SMCs. The second contribution of the paper concerns the potential applicability of the channel model for a multipath-resolved, single-anchor positioning system. The predicted channel knowledge is used to evaluate the measurement likelihood function at candidate positions throughout the environment. It is shown that the environmental awareness created by the multipath-resolved, GPR-based channel model yields higher robustness against position estimation outliers.

AB  - Of the recent epidemics, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly severe, not only putting our health at risk, but also negatively affecting our daily lives. As there are no developed algorithms for the use of drones in epidemiological situations, it is ideal to analyze the experience gained on drones so far and outline the effective methods for future good practice. The author relies on a method of analyzing widely available open information, such as images and videos available on the Internet, reports from drone users, announcements by drone manufacturers and the contents of newspaper articles. Furthermore, the author has relied on the results of the relevant literature, as well as previous experience as a drone user and fire commander. The study reveals numerous possibilities associated with drone usage in epidemic related situations, but previous applications are based on previous experience gained during a non-epidemic situation, without developed algorithms. Applications can be divided into different types of groups: drones can collect data for management and provide information to the public, perform general or special logistical tasks to support health care and disinfect to reduce the risk of spreading the epidemic.

AB  - Traffic accident detection is an important strategy governments can use to implement policies intended to reduce accidents. They usually use techniques such as image processing, RFID devices, among others. Social network mining has emerged as a low-cost alternative. However, social networks come with several challenges such as informal language and misspellings. This paper proposes a method to extract traffic accident data from Twitter in Spanish. The method consists of four phases. The first phase establishes the data collection mechanisms. The second consists of vectorially representing the messages and classifying them as accidents or non-accidents. The third phase uses named entity recognition techniques to detect the location. In the fourth phase, locations pass through a geocoder that returns their geographic coordinates. This method was applied to Bogota city and the data on Twitter were compared with the official traffic information source; comparisons showed some influence of Twitter on the commercial and industrial area of the city. The results reveal how effective the information on accidents reported on Twitter can be. It should therefore be considered as a source of information that may complement existing detection methods.

AB  - With the emergence of networked devices, from the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes and cellular phones to vehicles connected to the Internet, there has been an ever-growing expansion of attack surfaces in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In the past decade, there has been a rapid growth in the automotive industry as network-enabled and electronic devices are now integral parts of vehicular ecosystems. These include the development of automobile technologies, namely, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and electric vehicles. Attacks on IoV may lead to malfunctioning of Electronic Control Unit (ECU), brakes, control steering issues, and door lock issues that can be fatal in CAV. To mitigate these risks, there is need for a lightweight model to identify attacks on vehicular systems. In this article, an efficient model of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to detect anomalies in the vehicular system. The dataset used in this study is an In-Vehicle Network (IVN) communication protocol, i.e., Control Area Network (CAN) dataset generated in a real-time environment. The model classifies different types of attacks on vehicles into reconnaissance, Denial of Service (DoS), and fuzzing attacks. Experimentation with performance metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score are compared across a variety of classification models. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other classification models.

AB  - In recent years, technology has advanced to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), where the Internet of things (IoTs), fog computing, computer security, and cyberattacks have evolved exponentially on a large scale. The rapid development of IoT devices and networks in various forms generate enormous amounts of data which in turn demand careful authentication and security. Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the most promising methods for addressing cybersecurity threats and providing security. In this study, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) that categorize, map and survey the existing literature on AI methods used to detect cybersecurity attacks in the IoT environment. The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation on most AI trending techniques in cybersecurity and state-of-art solutions. A systematic search was performed on various electronic databases (SCOPUS, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI). Out of the identified records, 80 studies published between 2016 and 2021 were selected, surveyed and carefully assessed. This review has explored deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques used in IoT security, and their effectiveness in detecting attacks. However, several studies have proposed smart intrusion detection systems (IDS) with intelligent architectural frameworks using AI to overcome the existing security and privacy challenges. It is found that support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) are among the most used methods, due to high accuracy detection another reason may be efficient memory. In addition, other methods also provide better performance such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural networks (NN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). This analysis also provides an insight into the AI roadmap to detect threats based on attack categories. Finally, we present recommendations for potential future investigations.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that can be utilized throughout a construction project lifecycle. Transition to incorporate AI technologies in the construction industry has been delayed due to the lack of know-how and research. There is also a knowledge gap regarding how the public perceives AI technologies, their areas of application, prospects, and constraints in the construction industry. This study aims to explore AI technology adoption prospects and constraints in the Australian construction industry by analyzing social media data. This study adopted social media analytics, along with sentiment and content analyses of Twitter messages (n = 7906), as the methodological approach. The results revealed that: (a) robotics, internet-of-things, and machine learning are the most popular AI technologies in Australia; (b) Australian public sentiments toward AI are mostly positive, whilst some negative perceptions exist; (c) there are distinctive views on the opportunities and constraints of AI among the Australian states/territories; (d) timesaving, innovation, and digitalization are the most common AI prospects; and (e) project risk, security of data, and lack of capabilities are the most common AI constraints. This study is the first to explore AI technology adoption prospects and constraints in the Australian construction industry by analyzing social media data. The findings inform the construction industry on public perceptions and prospects and constraints of AI adoption. In addition, it advocates the search for finding the most efficient means to utilize AI technologies. The study helps public perceptions and prospects and constraints of AI adoption to be factored in construction industry technology adoption.

AB  - Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm such that client data are processed at the periphery of the network, as close as possible to the originating source. Since the 21st century has come to be known as the century of data due to the rapid increase in the quantity of exchanged data worldwide (especially in smart city applications such as autonomous vehicles), collecting and processing such data from sensors and Internet of Things devices operating in real time from remote locations and inhospitable operating environments almost anywhere in the world is a relevant emerging need. Indeed, edge computing is reshaping information technology and business computing. In this respect, the paper is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of what edge computing is as well as the most relevant edge use cases, tradeoffs, and implementation considerations. In particular, this review article is focused on highlighting (i) the most recent trends relative to edge computing emerging in the research field and (ii) the main businesses that are taking operations at the edge as well as the most used edge computing platforms (both proprietary and open source). First, the paper summarizes the concept of edge computing and compares it with cloud computing. After that, we discuss the challenges of optimal server placement, data security in edge networks, hybrid edge-cloud computing, simulation platforms for edge computing, and state-of-the-art improved edge networks. Finally, we explain the edge computing applications to 5G/6G networks and industrial internet of things. Several studies review a set of attractive edge features, system architectures, and edge application platforms that impact different industry sectors. The experimental results achieved in the cited works are reported in order to prove how edge computing improves the efficiency of Internet of Things networks. On the other hand, the work highlights possible vulnerabilities and open issues emerging in the context of edge computing architectures, thus proposing future directions to be investigated.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Manual work accounts for one of the largest workgroups in the European manufacturing sector, and improving the training capacity, quality, and speed brings significant competitive benefits to companies. In this context, this paper presents an informed tree search on top of a Markov chain that suggests possible next assembly steps as a key component of an innovative assembly training station for manual operations. The goal of the next step suggestions is to provide support to inexperienced workers or to assist experienced workers by providing choices for the next assembly step in an automated manner without the involvement of a human trainer on site. Data stemming from 179 experiment participants, 111 factory workers, and 68 students, were used to evaluate different prediction methods. From our analysis, Markov chains fail in new scenarios and, therefore, by using an informed tree search to predict the possible next assembly step in such situations, the prediction capability of the hybrid algorithm increases significantly while providing robust solutions to unseen scenarios. The proposed method proved to be the most efficient for next assembly step prediction among all the evaluated predictors and, thus, the most suitable method for an adaptive assembly support system such as for manual operations in industry.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems, and makes application of technologies and advanced data processing techniques in agricultural field possible. Digital farming aims to use available information from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges for addressing food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The digital approaches are expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making supports. Digital twin in agriculture is a virtual representation of a farm with great potential for enhancing productivity and efficiency while declining energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of digital twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural contexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation, robotics, farm machineries, and food post-harvest processing in agricultural field. Data recording, modeling including artificial intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed. Digital twin systems can support farmers as a next generation of digitalization paradigm by continuous and real-time monitoring of physical world (farm) and updating the state of virtual world.

TI  - eSCIFI: An Energy Saving Mechanism for WLANs Based on Machine Learning
T2  - Energies

PY  - 2022
VL  - 15
IS  - 2
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - As wireless local area networks grow in size to provide access to users, power consumption becomes an important issue. Power savings in a large-scale Wi-Fi network, with low impact to user service, is undoubtedly desired. In this work, we propose and evaluate the eSCIFI energy saving mechanism for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). eSCIFI is an energy saving mechanism that uses machine learning algorithms as occupancy demand estimators. The eSCIFI mechanism is designed to cope with a broader range of WLANs, which includes Wi-Fi networks such as the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) SCIFI network. The eSCIFI can cope with WLANs that cannot acquire data in a real time manner and/or possess a limited CPU power. The eSCIFI design also includes two clustering algorithms, named cSCIFI and cSCIFI+, that help to guarantee the network&rsquo;s coverage. eSCIFI uses those network clusters and machine learning predictions as input features to an energy state decision algorithm that then decides which Access Points (AP) can be switched off during the day. To evaluate eSCIFI performance, we conducted several trace-driven simulations comparing the eSCIFI mechanism using both clustering algorithms with other energy saving mechanisms found in the literature using the UFF SCIFI network traces. The results showed that eSCIFI mechanism using the cSCIFI+ clustering algorithm achieves the best performance and that it can save up to 64.32% of the UFF SCIFI network energy without affecting the user coverage.

AB  - Lifelong learning approaches that include digital, transversal, and practical skills (i.e., critical thinking, communication, collaboration, information literacy, analytical, metacognitive, reflection, and other research skills) are required in order to be equitable and inclusive and stimulate personal development. Realtime interaction between teachers and students and the ability for students to choose courses from curricula are guaranteed by decentralized online learning. Moreover, through blockchain, it is possible to acquire skills regarding the structure and content while also implementing learning tools. Additionally, documentation validation should be equally crucial to speeding up the process and reducing costs and paperwork. Finally, blockchains are open and inclusive processes that include people and cultures from all walks of life. Learning in Higher Education Institutions (HEI) is facilitated by new technologies, connecting blockchain to sustainability, which helps understand the relationship between technologies and sustainability. Besides serving as a secure transaction system, blockchain technology can help decentralize, provide security and integrity, and offer anonymity and encryption, therefore, promoting a transaction rate increase. This study investigates an alternative in which HEI include a blockchain network to provide the best sustainable education system. Students&rsquo; opinions were analyzed, and they considered that blockchain technology had a very positive influence on learning performance.

VL  - 15

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Accurate short-term load forecasting can ensure the safe operation of the grid. Decomposing load data into smooth components by decomposition algorithms is a common approach to address data volatility. However, each component of the decomposition must be modeled separately for prediction, which leads to overly complex models. To solve this problem, a VMD-WSLSTM load prediction model based on Shapley values is proposed in this paper. First, the Shapley value is used to select the optimal set of special features, and then the VMD decomposition method is used to decompose the original load into several smooth components. Finally, WSLSTM is used to predict each component. Unlike the traditional LSTM model, WSLSTM can simplify the prediction model and extract common features among the components by sharing the parameters among the components. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, several control groups were used for experiments. The results show that the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy and training speed compared with traditional prediction methods.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Homomorphic Secure Search-Able Encryption for Keyword Search in Blockchain Healthcare System: A Novel Approach to Cryptography
T2  - Sensors

VL  - 22

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to the value and importance of patient health records (PHR), security is the most critical feature of encryption over the Internet. Users that perform keyword searches to gain access to the PHR stored in the database are more susceptible to security risks. Although a blockchain-based healthcare system can guarantee security, present schemes have several flaws. Existing techniques have concentrated exclusively on data storage and have utilized blockchain as a storage database. In this research, we developed a unique deep-learning-based secure search-able blockchain as a distributed database using homomorphic encryption to enable users to securely access data via search. Our suggested study will increasingly include secure key revocation and update policies. An IoT dataset was used in this research to evaluate our suggested access control strategies and compare them to benchmark models. The proposed algorithms are implemented using smart contracts in the hyperledger tool. The suggested strategy is evaluated in comparison to existing ones. Our suggested approach significantly improves security, anonymity, and monitoring of user behavior, resulting in a more efficient blockchain-based IoT system as compared to benchmark models.

TI  - Innovating the Construction Life Cycle through BIM/GIS Integration: A Review
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The construction sector is in continuous evolution due to the digitalisation and integration into daily activities of the building information modelling approach and methods that impact on the overall life cycle. This study investigates the topic of BIM/GIS integration with the adoption of ontologies and metamodels, providing a critical analysis of the existing literature. Ontologies and metamodels share several similarities and could be combined for potential solutions to address BIM/GIS integration for complex tasks, such as asset management, where heterogeneous sources of data are involved. The research adopts a systematic literature review (SLR), providing a formal approach to retrieve scientific papers from dedicated online databases. The results found are then analysed, in order to describe the state of the art and suggest future research paths, which is useful for both researchers and practitioners. From the SLR, it emerged that several studies address ontologies as a promising way to overcome the semantic barriers of the BIM/GIS integration. On the other hand, metamodels (and MDE and MDA approaches, in general) are rarely found in relation to the integration topic. Moreover, the joint application of ontologies and metamodels for BIM/GIS applications is an unexplored field. The novelty of this work is the proposal of the joint application of ontologies and metamodels to perform BIM/GIS integration, for the development of software and systems for asset management.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - Big data analytics can be used by smart cities to improve their citizens&rsquo; liveability, health, and wellbeing. Social surveys and also social media can be employed to engage with their communities, and these can require sophisticated analysis techniques. This research was focused on carrying out a sentiment analysis from social surveys. Data analysis techniques using RStudio and Python were applied to several open-source datasets, which included the 2018 Social Indicators Survey dataset published by the City of Melbourne (CoM) and the Casey Next short survey 2016 dataset published by the City of Casey (CoC). The qualitative nature of the CoC dataset responses could produce rich insights using sentiment analysis, unlike the quantitative CoM dataset. RStudio analysis created word cloud visualizations and bar charts for sentiment values. These were then used to inform social media analysis via the Twitter application programming interface. The R codes were all integrated within a Shiny application to create a set of user-friendly interactive web apps that generate sentiment analysis both from the historic survey data and more immediately from the Twitter feeds. The web apps were embedded within a website that provides a customisable solution to estimate sentiment for key issues. Global sentiment was also compared between the social media approach and the 2016 survey dataset analysis and showed some correlation, although there are caveats on the use of social media for sentiment analysis. Further refinement of the methodology is required to improve the social media app and to calibrate it against analysis of recent survey data.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Natural hazard-related disasters are disruptive events with significant impact on people, communities, buildings, infrastructure, animals, agriculture, and environmental assets. The exponentially increasing anthropogenic activities on the planet have aggregated the climate change and consequently increased the frequency and severity of these natural hazard-related disasters, and consequential damages in cities. The digital technological advancements, such as monitoring systems based on fusion of sensors and machine learning, in early detection, warning and disaster response systems are being implemented as part of the disaster management practice in many countries and presented useful results. Along with these promising technologies, crowdsourced social media disaster big data analytics has also started to be utilized. This study aims to form an understanding of how social media analytics can be utilized to assist government authorities in estimating the damages linked to natural hazard-related disaster impacts on urban centers in the age of climate change. To this end, this study analyzes crowdsourced disaster big data from Twitter users in the testbed case study of Australian states and territories. The methodological approach of this study employs the social media analytics method and conducts sentiment and content analyses of location-based Twitter messages (n = 131,673) from Australia. The study informs authorities on an innovative way to analyze the geographic distribution, occurrence frequency of various disasters and their damages based on the geo-tweets analysis.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Networks Used to Date Photographs
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2022
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Nowadays, the information provided by digital photographs is very complete and very relevant in different professional fields, such as scientific or forensic photography. Taking this into account, it is possible to determine the date when they were taken, as well as the type of device that they were taken with, and thus be able to locate the photograph in a specific context. This is not the case with analog photographs, which lack any information regarding the date they were taken. Extracting this information is a complicated task, so classifying each photograph according to the date it was taken is a laborious task for a human expert. Artificial intelligence techniques make it possible to determine the characteristics and classify the images automatically. Within the field of artificial intelligence, convolutional neural networks are one of the most widely used methods today. This article describes the application of convolutional neural networks to automatically classify photographs according to the year they were taken. To do this, only the photograph is used, without any additional information. The proposed method divides each photograph into several segments that are presented to the network so that it can estimate a year for each segment. Once all the segments of a photograph have been processed, a general year for the photograph is calculated from the values generated by the network for each of its segments. In this study, images taken between 1960 and 1999 were analyzed and classified using different architectures of a convolutional neural network. The computational results obtained indicate that 44% of the images were classified with an error of less than 5 years, 20.25% with a marginal error between 5 and 10 years, and 35.75% with a higher marginal error of more than 10 years. Due to the complexity of the problem, the results obtained are considered good since 64.25% of the photographs were classified with an error of less than 10 years. Another important result of the study carried out is that it was found that the color is a very important characteristic when classifying photographs by date. The results obtained show that the approach given in this study is an important starting point for this type of task and that it allows placing a photograph in a specific temporal context, thus facilitating the work of experts dedicated to scientific and forensic photography.

T2  - Agronomy

PY  - 2022
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
SN  - 2073-4395

AB  - The high demand of information and communication technology (ICT) in agriculture applications has led to the introduction of the concept of smart farming. In this respect, moving from the main features of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) promoted by the European Community, new approaches have been suggested and adopted in agriculture, giving rise to the so-called Agriculture 4.0. Improvements in automation, advanced information systems and Internet technologies allow for farmers to increase the productivity and to allocate the resources reasonably. For these reasons, agricultural decision support systems (DSS) for Agriculture 4.0 have become a very interesting research topic. DSS are interactive tools that enable users to make informed decisions about unstructured problems, and can be either fully computerized, human or a combination of both. In general, a DSS analyzes and synthesizes large amounts of data to assist in decision making. This paper presents an innovative decision support system solution to address the issues faced by coconut oil producers in making strategic decisions, particularly in the comparison of different methods of oil extraction. In more detail, the adopted methodology describes how to address the problems of coconut oil extraction in order to minimize the processing time and processing cost and to obtain energy savings. To this end, the coconut oil extraction process of the Le&atilde;o S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Principe Company is presented as a case study: a DSS instance that analyzes the problem of the optimal selection between two different oil coconut extraction methods (fermentation-based and standard extraction processes) is developed as a meta-heuristics with a mixed integer linear programming problem. The obtained results show that there is clearly a trade-off between the increase in cost and reliability that the decision-maker may be willing to evaluate. In this respect, the proposed model provides a tool to support the decision-maker in choosing the best combination between the two different coconut oil extraction methods. The proposed DSS has been tested in a real application context through an experimental campaign.

VL  - 14

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Digitalization, new work and leisure concepts and global challenges are transforming the way we live. More stakeholders, including residents and entrepreneurs, actively participate in the implementation of alternative socio-economic concepts; as such, entrepreneurial ecosystems are seen as drivers of regional development. The research still lacks holistic approaches to the application of ecosystems in tourism destinations. Hence, the objectives of this article are to capture research on entrepreneurial ecosystems in tourism and, specifically, to derive a holistic model that integrates destination and location management across stakeholders. This research utilizes the method of a systematic literature review, starting with 597 articles on ecosystems. Following four stages of exploring the literature, the results show that most articles have been published in rather isolated fields of smart tourism or quality of life aspects. Based on the rather qualitative review that reveals specific ecosystem components, we propose a model of an &ldquo;Ecosystem of Hospitality&rdquo; (EoH). Focusing on stakeholder interaction and encounters, the EoH fosters the adoption of the entrepreneurial ecosystem to destinations in a dynamic approach. The practical implications are, for example, a broader consideration of various stakeholders, including the local population, and a switch in typical destination management tasks from mere tourism service production to regional development and living space management.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The IoT refers to the interconnection of things to the physical network that is embedded with software, sensors, and other devices to exchange information from one device to the other. The interconnection of devices means there is the possibility of challenges such as security, trustworthiness, reliability, confidentiality, and so on. To address these issues, we have proposed a novel group theory (GT)-based binary spring search (BSS) algorithm which consists of a hybrid deep neural network approach. The proposed approach effectively detects the intrusion within the IoT network. Initially, the privacy-preserving technology was implemented using a blockchain-based methodology. Security of patient health records (PHR) is the most critical aspect of cryptography over the Internet due to its value and importance, preferably in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Search keywords access mechanism is one of the typical approaches used to access PHR from a database, but it is susceptible to various security vulnerabilities. Although blockchain-enabled healthcare systems provide security, it may lead to some loopholes in the existing state of the art. In literature, blockchain-enabled frameworks have been presented to resolve those issues. However, these methods have primarily focused on data storage and blockchain is used as a database. In this paper, blockchain as a distributed database is proposed with a homomorphic encryption technique to ensure a secure search and keywords-based access to the database. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a secure key revocation mechanism and updates various policies accordingly. As a result, a secure patient healthcare data access scheme is devised, which integrates blockchain and trust chain to fulfill the efficiency and security issues in the current schemes for sharing both types of digital healthcare data. Hence, our proposed approach provides more security, efficiency, and transparency with cost-effectiveness. We performed our simulations based on the blockchain-based tool Hyperledger Fabric and OrigionLab for analysis and evaluation. We compared our proposed results with the benchmark models, respectively. Our comparative analysis justifies that our proposed framework provides better security and searchable mechanism for the healthcare system.

AB  - This article reviews the use of wearable sensors for the monitoring of physical activity (PA) for different purposes, including assessment of gait and balance, prevention and/or detection of falls, recognition of various PAs, conduction and assessment of rehabilitation exercises and monitoring of neurological disease progression. The article provides in-depth information on the retrieved articles and discusses study shortcomings related to demographic factors, i.e., age, gender, healthy participants vs patients, and study conditions. It is well known that motion patterns change with age and the onset of illnesses, and that the risk of falling increases with age. Yet, studies including older persons are rare. Gender distribution was not even provided in several studies, and others included only, or a majority of, men. Another shortcoming is that none of the studies were conducted in real-life conditions. Hence, there is still important work to be done in order to increase the usefulness of wearable sensors in these areas. The article highlights flaws in how studies based on previously collected datasets report on study samples and the data collected, which makes the validity and generalizability of those studies low. Exceptions exist, such as the promising recently reported open dataset FallAllD, wherein a longitudinal study with older adults is ongoing.

AB  - Since the outbreak of the corona virus in the end of 2019, many worldwide attempts have been made to monitor and control the COVID-19 pandemic. A wealth of empirical data has been collected and used by national health authorities to understand and mitigate the spread and impacts of the corona virus. In various countries this serious health concern has led to the development of corona dashboards monitoring the COVID-19 evolution. The present study aims to design and test an extended corona dashboard, in which&mdash;beside up-to-date daily core data on infections, hospital and intensive care admissions, and numbers of deceased people&mdash;also the evolution of vaccinations in a country is mapped out. This dashboard system is next extended with time-dependent contextual information on lockdown and policy stringency measures, while disaggregate information on the geographic spread of the COVID-19 disease is provided by means of big data on contact intensity and mobility motives based on detailed Google Mobility data. Finally, this context-specific corona dashboard, named &lsquo;Dutchboard&rsquo;, is further extended towards the regional and local level so as to allow also for space-specific &lsquo;health checks&rsquo; and assessments.

AB  - Only one third of studies on the Industry 4.0&ndash;sustainability link have been conducted in manufacturing, despite its centrality to &ldquo;ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns&rdquo; (UN Sustainable Development Goal nr. 12). The European Ecodesign Directive singled out machine tools as key to the sustainability transition, not least due to their high energy usage and their increasingly becoming enmeshed in cyber-physical production systems. This paper aims to find out whether the digital transformation underway in machine tools is sustainable as well as to identify its central technological pathways. Externalities in machine tools are tracked over three decades (1990&ndash;2018) by means of a multi-method setting: (1) mapping the Technological Innovation System (TIS) of machine tools; (2) co-occurrence analysis of transnational patent families, in order to reduce geographical and market distortions (Questel&rsquo;s FAMPAT); and (3) analysis of the incidence of digital and sustainable technologies in machine tools patent applications (WIPO PATENTSCOPE). A smart sustainability transition is currently not hampered by a lack of smart technologies but rather by the sluggish introduction of sustainable machine tools. Cyber-physical and robot machine tools have been found to be central pathways to a smart sustainability transition. Implications for harnessing externalities reach beyond the machine tools industry.

AB  - Nowadays, recommendation systems offer a method of facilitating the user&rsquo;s desire. It is useful for recommending items from a variety of areas such as in the e-commerce, medical, education, tourism, and industry domains. The e-commerce area represents the most active research we found, which assists users in locating the things they want. A recommender system can also provide users with helpful knowledge about things that could be of interest. Sometimes, the user gets bored with recommendations which are similar to their profiles, which leads to the over-specialization problem. Over-specialization is caused by limited content data, under which content-based recommendation algorithms suggest goods directly related to the customer profile rather than new things. In this study, we are particularly interested in recommending surprising, new, and unexpected items that may likely be enjoyed by users and will mitigate this limited content. In order to recommend novel and serendipitous items along with familiar items, we need to introduce additional hacks and note of randomness, which can be achieved using genetic algorithms that brings diversity to recommendations being made. This paper describes a Revolutionary Recommender System using a Genetic Algorithm called RRSGA which improves the fitness functions for recommending optimal results. The proposed approach employs a genetic algorithm to address the over-specialization issue of content-based filtering. The proposed method aims to incorporate genetic algorithms that bring variety to recommendations and efficiently adjust and suggest unpredictable and innovative things to the user. Experiments objectively demonstrate that our technology can recommend additional products that every consumer is likely to appreciate. The results of RRSGA have been compared against recommendation results from the content-based filtering approach. The results indicate the effectiveness of RRSGA and its capacity to make more accurate predictions than alternative approaches.

VL  - 22

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Household appliances, climate control machines, vehicles, elevators, cash counting machines, etc., are complex machines with key contributions to the smart city. Those devices have limited memory and processing power, but they are not just actuators; they embed tens of sensors and actuators managed by several microcontrollers and microprocessors communicated by control buses. On the other hand, predictive maintenance and the capability of identifying failures to avoid greater damage of machines is becoming a topic of great relevance in Industry 4.0, and the large amount of data to be processed is a concern. This article proposes a layered methodology to enable complex machines with automatic fault detection or predictive maintenance. It presents a layered structure to perform the collection, filtering and extraction of indicators, along with their processing. The aim is to reduce the amount of data to work with, and to optimize them by generating indicators that concentrate the information provided by data. To test its applicability, a prototype of a cash counting machine has been used. With this prototype, different failure cases have been simulated by introducing defective elements. After the extraction of the indicators, using the Kullback&ndash;Liebler divergence, it has been possible to visualize the differences between the data associated with normal and failure operation. Subsequently, using a neural network, good results have been obtained, being able to correctly classify the failure in 90% of the cases. The result of this application demonstrates the proper functioning of the proposed approach in complex machines.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Data hiding is the technique of embedding data into video or audio media. With the development of deep neural networks (DNN), the quality of images generated by novel data hiding methods based on DNN is getting better. However, there is still room for the similarity between the original images and the images generated by the DNN models which were trained based on the existing hiding frameworks to improve, and it is hard for the receiver to distinguish whether the container image is from the real sender. We propose a framework by introducing a key_img for using the over-fitting characteristic of DNN and combined with difference image grafting symmetrically, named difference image grafting deep hiding (DIGDH). The key_img can be used to identify whether the container image is from the real sender easily. The experimental results show that without changing the structures of networks, the models trained based on the proposed framework can generate images with higher similarity to original cover and secret images. According to the analysis results of the steganalysis tool named StegExpose, the container images generated by the hiding model trained based on the proposed framework is closer to the random distribution.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 15

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - There is an increased interest in the district-scale energy transition within interdisciplinary research community. Agent-based modelling presents a suitable approach to address variety of questions related to policies, technologies, processes, and the different stakeholder roles that can foster such transition. However, it is a largely complex and versatile methodology which hinders its broader uptake by researchers as well as improved results. This state-of-the-art review focuses on the application of agent-based modelling for exploring policy interventions that facilitate the decarbonisation (i.e., energy transition) of districts and neighbourhoods while considering stakeholders&rsquo; social characteristics and interactions. We systematically select and analyse peer-reviewed literature and discuss the key modelling aspects, such as model purpose, agents and decision-making logic, spatial and temporal aspects, and empirical grounding. The analysis reveals that the most established agent-based models&rsquo; focus on innovation diffusion (e.g., adoption of solar panels) and dissemination of energy-saving behaviour among a group of buildings in urban areas. We see a considerable gap in exploring the decisions and interactions of agents other than residential households, such as commercial and even industrial energy consumers (and prosumers). Moreover, measures such as building retrofits and conversion to district energy systems involve many stakeholders and complex interactions between them that up to now have hardly been represented in the agent-based modelling environment. Hence, this work contributes to better understanding and further improving the research on transition towards decarbonised society.

AB  - Nowadays, there is tremendous growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications in our everyday lives. The proliferation of smart devices, sensors technology, and the Internet makes it possible to communicate between the digital and physical world seamlessly for distributed data collection, communication, and processing of several applications dynamically. However, it is a challenging task to monitor and track objects in real-time due to the distinct characteristics of the IoT system, e.g., scalability, mobility, and resource-limited nature of the devices. In this paper, we address the significant issue of IoT object tracking in real time. We propose a system called &lsquo;TrackInk&rsquo; to demonstrate our idea. TrackInk will be capable of pointing toward and taking pictures of visible satellites in the night sky, including but not limited to the International Space Station (ISS) or the moon. Data will be collected from sensors to determine the system&rsquo;s geographical location along with its 3D orientation, allowing for the system to be moved. Additionally, TrackInk will communicate with and send data to ThingSpeak for further cloud-based systems and data analysis. Our proposed system is lightweight, highly scalable, and performs efficiently in a resource-limited environment. We discuss a detailed system&rsquo;s architecture and show the performance results using a real-world hardware-based experimental setup.

AB  - Smart building issues are critical for current energy and comfort managing aspects in built environments. Nevertheless, the diffusion of smart monitoring solutions via user-friendly graphical interfaces is still an ongoing issue subject to the need to diffuse a smart building culture and a low-cost series of solutions. This paper proposes a new low-cost IoT sensor network, exploiting Raspberry Pi and Arduino platforms, for collecting real-time data and evaluating specific thermal comfort indicators (PMV and PPD). The overall architecture was accordingly designed, including the hardware setup, the back-end and the Android user interface. Eventually, three distinct prototyping platforms were deployed for initial testing of the general system, and we analysed the obtained results for different building typologies and seasonal periods, based on collected data and users&rsquo; preferences. This work is part of a large educational and citizen science activity.

TI  - A Probabilistic Approach to Estimating Allowed SNR Values for Automotive LiDARs in &ldquo;Smart Cities&rdquo; under Various External Influences
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The paper proposes an approach to assessing the allowed signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for light detection and ranging (LiDAR) of unmanned autonomous vehicles based on the predetermined probability of false alarms under various intentional and unintentional influencing factors. The focus of this study is on the relevant issue of the safe use of LiDAR data and measurement systems within the &ldquo;smart city&rdquo; infrastructure. The research team analyzed and systematized various external impacts on the LiDAR systems, as well as the state-of-the-art approaches to improving their security and resilience. It has been established that the current works on the analysis of external influences on the LiDARs and methods for their mitigation focus mainly on physical (hardware) approaches (proposing most often other types of modulation and optical signal frequencies), and less often software approaches, through the use of additional anomaly detection techniques and data integrity verification systems, as well as improving the efficiency of data filtering in the cloud point. In addition, the sources analyzed in this paper do not offer methodological support for the design of the LiDAR in the very early stages of their creation, taking into account a priori assessment of the allowed SNR threshold and probability of detecting a reflected pulse and the requirements to minimize the probability of &ldquo;missing&rdquo; an object when scanning with no a priori assessments of the detection probability characteristics of the LiDAR. The authors propose a synthetic approach as a mathematical tool for designing a resilient LiDAR system. The approach is based on the physics of infrared radiation, the Bayesian theory, and the Neyman&ndash;Pearson criterion. It features the use of a predetermined threshold for false alarms, the probability of interference in the analytics, and the characteristics of the LiDAR&rsquo;s receivers. The result is the analytical solution to the problem of calculating the allowed SNR while stabilizing the level of &ldquo;false alarms&rdquo; in terms of background noise caused by a given type of interference. The work presents modelling results for the &ldquo;false alarm&rdquo; probability values depending on the selected optimality criterion. The efficiency of the proposed approach has been proven by the simulation results of the received optical power of the LiDAR&rsquo;s signal based on the calculated SNR threshold and noise values.

SN  - 2078-2489

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the deaths of millions of people around the world. The scientific community faces a tough struggle to reduce the effects of this pandemic. Several investigations dealing with different perspectives have been carried out. However, it is not easy to find studies focused on COVID-19 contagion chains. A deep analysis of contagion chains may contribute new findings that can be used to reduce the effects of COVID-19. For example, some interesting chains with specific behaviors could be identified and more in-depth analyses could be performed to investigate the reasons for such behaviors. To represent, validate and analyze the information of contagion chains, we adopted an ontological approach. Ontologies are artificial intelligence techniques that have become widely accepted solutions for the representation of knowledge and corresponding analyses. The semantic representation of information by means of ontologies enables the consistency of the information to be checked, as well as automatic reasoning to infer new knowledge. The ontology was implemented in Ontology Web Language (OWL), which is a formal language based on description logics. This approach could have a special impact on smart cities, which are characterized as using information to enhance the quality of basic services for citizens. In particular, health services could take advantage of this approach to reduce the effects of COVID-19.

TI  - An Efficient Hyperparameter Control Method for a Network Intrusion Detection System Based on Proximal Policy Optimization
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - The complexity of network intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is increasing due to the continuous increases in network traffic, various attacks and the ever-changing network environment. In addition, network traffic is asymmetric with few attack data, but the attack data are so complex that it is difficult to detect one. Many studies on improving intrusion detection performance using feature engineering have been conducted. These studies work well in the dataset environment; however, it is challenging to cope with a changing network environment. This paper proposes an intrusion detection hyperparameter control system (IDHCS) that controls and trains a deep neural network (DNN) feature extractor and k-means clustering module as a reinforcement learning model based on proximal policy optimization (PPO). An IDHCS controls the DNN feature extractor to extract the most valuable features in the network environment, and identifies intrusion through k-means clustering. Through iterative learning using the PPO-based reinforcement learning model, the system is optimized to improve performance automatically according to the network environment, where the IDHCS is used. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the system performance using the CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets. In CICIDS2017, an F1-score of 0.96552 was achieved and UNSW-NB15 achieved an F1-score of 0.94268. An experiment was conducted by merging the two datasets to build a more extensive and complex test environment. By merging datasets, the attack types in the experiment became more diverse and their patterns became more complex. An F1-score of 0.93567 was achieved in the merged dataset, indicating 97% to 99% performance compared with CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15. The results reveal that the proposed IDHCS improved the performance of the IDS by automating learning new types of attacks by managing intrusion detection features regardless of the network environment changes through continuous learning.

VL  - 22

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has emerged in many aspects of life, such as transportation, healthcare, and even education. IoT technology incorporates several tasks to achieve the goals for which it was developed through smart services. These services are intelligent activities that allow devices to interact with the physical world to provide suitable services to users anytime and anywhere. However, the remarkable advancement of this technology has increased the number and the mechanisms of attacks. Attackers often take advantage of the IoTs&rsquo; heterogeneity to cause trust problems and manipulate the behavior to delude devices&rsquo; reliability and the service provided through it. Consequently, trust is one of the security challenges that threatens IoT smart services. Trust management techniques have been widely used to identify untrusted behavior and isolate untrusted objects over the past few years. However, these techniques still have many limitations like ineffectiveness when dealing with a large amount of data and continuously changing behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for trust management in IoT devices and services based on the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The SMART is used for calculating the trust value, while LSTM is used for identifying changes in the behavior based on the trust threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using accuracy, loss rate, precision, recall, and F-measure on different data samples with different sizes. Comparisons with existing deep learning and machine learning models show superior performance with a different number of iterations. With 100 iterations, the proposed model achieved 99.87% and 99.76% of accuracy and F-measure, respectively.

AB  - Despite the emergence of unique opportunities for social-industrial growth and development resulting from the use of the Internet of Things (IoT), lack of a well-posed IoT governance will cause serious threats on personal privacy, public safety, industrial security, and dubious data gathering by unauthorized entities. Furthermore, adopting a systemic governance approach, particularly for the IoT innovation system, requires a precise clarification on the concept and scope of IoT governance. In this study, by employing the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach, the role of governance in the Iran IoT innovation system is investigated. Contacting respondents across the seven industries, including Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Healthcare, Transportation, Oil and Gas, Energy, Agriculture, and Banking over the course of three months, the authors performed statistical analysis on 319 fulfilled questionnaires using SPPS and Smart PLS software. Findings show that all IoT-related TIS processes have been affected by IoT governance functions. The main result of this study is the proposition of particular governance functions, including policy-making, regulation, facilitation, and service provision with more notable impact on the indicators of the key processes in the IoT-based TIS.

At present, the prediction of hour-concentration of PM2.5 is mostly single-step prediction, which is to predict PM2.5 concentration at a future time point based on a period of historical data. In this paper, a model based on multi-time scale fusion is proposed to study single-step prediction and multi-step prediction, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed model is better than stacked LSTM and CNN-LSTM in predicting PM2.5 hour-concentration.

AB  - Behavior modeling has multiple applications in the intelligent environment domain. It has been used in different tasks, such as the stratification of different pathologies, prediction of the user actions and activities, or modeling the energy usage. Specifically, behavior prediction can be used to forecast the future evolution of the users and to identify those behaviors that deviate from the expected conduct. In this paper, we propose the use of embeddings to represent the user actions, and study and compare several behavior prediction approaches. We test multiple model (LSTM, CNNs, GCNs, and transformers) architectures to ascertain the best approach to using embeddings for behavior modeling and also evaluate multiple embedding retrofitting approaches. To do so, we use the Kasteren dataset for intelligent environments, which is one of the most widely used datasets in the areas of activity recognition and behavior modeling.

AB  - The increasing need for food in recent years means that environmental protection and sustainable agriculture are necessary. For this, smart agricultural systems and autonomous robots have become widespread. One of the most significant and persistent problems related to robots is 3D path planning, which is an NP-hard problem, for mobile robots. In this paper, efficient methods are proposed by two metaheuristic algorithms (Incremental Gray Wolf Optimization (I-GWO) and Expanded Gray Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). The proposed methods try to find collision-free optimal paths between two points for robots without human intervention in an acceptable time with the lowest process costs and efficient use of resources in large-scale and crowded farmlands. Thanks to the methods proposed in this study, various tasks such as tracking crops can be performed efficiently by autonomous robots. The simulations are carried out using three methods, and the obtained results are compared with each other and analyzed. The relevant results show that in the proposed methods, the mobile robots avoid the obstacles successfully and obtain the optimal path cost from source to destination. According to the simulation results, the proposed method based on the Ex-GWO algorithm has a better success rate of 55.56% in optimal path cost.

AB  - The Internet of Things that links the cyber and physical worlds brings revolutionary changes to society, however, its security and efficiency problems have not been solved. The Consortium Blockchain + IoT is considered to be an effective solution. The IoT blockchain network&rsquo;s demand for transaction processing speed is gradually increasing. The throughput problem of the blockchain needs to be solved urgently and the security problem of transaction processing that comes with it. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a reputation-driven dynamic node security sharding consensus model (RDSCM) in the blockchain, which consists of two parts: a reputation-driven node to eliminate PBFT (RE-PBFT) and a reputation-driven node cross reconfiguration sharding scheme (NCRS). The RE-PBFT eliminates abnormal nodes in the consensus network and reduces the probability of abnormal nodes becoming master nodes. NCRS improves the blockchain throughput while ensuring sharding reliability. Finally, the experiment proves that RE-PBFT can identify abnormal nodes and remove them in a short time. NCRS can effectively guarantee the reliability of sharding, and the transaction processing efficiency has been greatly improved after sharding.

TI  - WASN-Based Spectro-Temporal Analysis and Clustering of Road Traffic Noise in Urban and Suburban Areas
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2022
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Environmental noise has become one of the principal health risks for urban dwellers and road traffic noise (RTN) is considered to be the main source of these adverse effects. To address this problem, strategic noise maps and corresponding action plans have been developed throughout Europe in recent years in response to the European Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END), especially in populated cities. Recently, wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) have started to serve as an alternative to static noise maps to monitor urban areas by gathering environmental noise data in real time. Several studies have analysed and categorized the different acoustic environments described in the END (e.g., traffic, industrial, leisure, etc.). However, most of them have only considered the dynamic evolution of the A-weighted equivalent noise levels LAeq over different periods of time. In order to focus on the analysis of RTN solely, this paper introduces a clustering methodology to analyse and group spectro-temporal profiles of RTN collected simultaneously across an area of interest. The experiments were conducted on two acoustic databases collected during a weekday and a weekend day through WASNs deployed in the pilot areas of the LIFE+ DYNAMAP project. The results obtained show that the clustering of RTN, based on its spectro-temporal patterns, yields different solutions on weekdays and at weekends in both environments, being larger than those found in the suburban environment and lower than the number of clusters in the urban scenario.

AB  - Saffron, one of the most expensive crops on earth, having a vast domain of applications, has the potential to boost the economy of India. The cultivation of saffron has been immensely affected in the past few years due to the changing climate. Despite the use of different artificial methods for cultivation, hydroponic approaches using the IoT prove to give the best results. The presented study consists of potential artificial approaches used for cultivation and the selection of hydroponics as the best approach out of these based on different parameters. This paper also provides a comparative analysis of six present hydroponic approaches. The research work on different factors of saffron, such as the parameters responsible for growth, reasons for the decline in growth, and different agronomical variables, has been shown graphically. A smart hydroponic system for saffron cultivation has been proposed using the NFT (nutrient film technique) and renewable sources of energy.

AB  - Ever since the introduction of fifth generation (5G) mobile communications, the mobile telecommunications industry has been debating whether 5G is an &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; or &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; from the previous legacy mobile networks, but now that 5G has been commercially available for the past few years, the research direction has recently shifted towards the upcoming generation of mobile communication system, known as the sixth generation (6G), which is expected to drastically provide significant and evolutionary, if not revolutionary, improvements in mobile networks. The promise of extremely high data rates (in terabits), artificial intelligence (AI), ultra-low latency, near-zero/low energy, and immense connected devices is expected to enhance the connectivity, sustainability, and trustworthiness and provide some new services, such as truly immersive &ldquo;extended reality&rdquo; (XR), high-fidelity mobile hologram, and a new generation of entertainment. Sixth generation and its vision are still under research and open for developers and researchers to establish and develop their directions to realize future 6G technology, which is expected to be ready as early as 2028. This paper reviews 6G mobile technology, including its vision, requirements, enabling technologies, and challenges. Meanwhile, a total of 11 communication technologies, including terahertz (THz) communication, visible light communication (VLC), multiple access, coding, cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) zero-energy interface, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), and infusion of AI/machine learning (ML) in wireless transmission techniques, are presented. Moreover, this paper compares 5G and 6G in terms of services, key technologies, and enabling communications techniques. Finally, it discusses the crucial future directions and technology developments in 6G.

AB  - The growing importance and widespread adoption of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies have helped the enhancement of smart environments in numerous sectors such as manufacturing, smart cities, transportation and Internet of Things by providing pervasive real-time applications. In this survey, we analyze the existing research trends with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in WSN and the possible use of these methods for WSN enhancement. The main goal of data collection, aggregation and dissemination algorithms is to gather and aggregate data in an energy efficient manner so that network lifetime is enhanced. In this paper, we highlight data collection, aggregation and dissemination challenges in WSN and present a comprehensive discussion on the recent studies that utilized various AI methods to meet specific objectives of WSN, during the span of 2010 to 2021. We compare and contrast different algorithms on the basis of optimization criteria, simulation/real deployment, centralized/distributed kind, mobility and performance parameters. We conclude with possible future research directions. This would guide the reader towards an understanding of up-to-date applications of AI methods with respect to data collection, aggregation and dissemination challenges in WSN. Then, we provide a general evaluation and comparison of different AI methods used in WSNs, which will be a guide for the research community in identifying the mostly adapted methods and the benefits of using various AI methods for solving the challenges related to WSNs. Finally, we conclude the paper stating the open research issues and new possibilities for future studies.

TI  - Applying Federated Learning in Software-Defined Networks: A Survey
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Federated learning (FL) is a type of distributed machine learning approacs that trains global models through the collaboration of participants. It protects data privacy as participants only contribute local models instead of sharing private local data. However, the performance of FL highly relies on the number of participants and their contributions. When applying FL over conventional computer networks, attracting more participants, encouraging participants to contribute more local resources, and enabling efficient and effective collaboration among participants become very challenging. As software-defined networks (SDNs) enable open and flexible networking architecture with separate control and data planes, SDNs provide standardized protocols and specifications to enable fine-grained collaborations among devices. Applying FL approaches over SDNs can take use such advantages to address challenges. A SDN control plane can have multiple controllers organized in layers; the controllers in the lower layer can be placed in the network edge to deal with the asymmetries in the attached switches and hosts, and the controller in the upper layer can supervise the whole network centrally and globally. Applying FL in SDNs with a layered-distributed control plane may be able to protect the data privacy of each participant while improving collaboration among participants to produce higher-quality models over asymmetric networks. Accordingly, this paper aims to make a comprehensive survey on the related mechanisms and solutions that enable FL in SDNs. It highlights three major challenges, an incentive mechanism, privacy and security, and model aggregation, which affect the quality and quantity of participants, the security and privacy in model transferring, and the performance of the global model, respectively. The state of the art in mechanisms and solutions that can be applied to address such challenges in the current literature are categorized based on the challenges they face, followed by suggestions of future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first effort in surveying the state of the art in combining FL with SDNs.

TI  - Interpolation-Based Fusion of Sentinel-5P, SRTM, and Regulatory-Grade Ground Stations Data for Producing Spatially Continuous Maps of PM2.5 Concentrations Nationwide over Thailand
T2  - Atmosphere

PY  - 2022
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Atmospheric pollution has recently drawn significant attention due to its proven adverse effects on public health and the environment. This concern has been aggravated specifically in Southeast Asia due to increasing vehicular use, industrial activity, and agricultural burning practices. Consequently, elevated PM2.5 concentrations have become a matter of intervention for national authorities who have addressed the needs of monitoring air pollution by operating ground stations. However, their spatial coverage is limited and the installation and maintenance are costly. Therefore, alternative approaches are necessary at national and regional scales. In the current paper, we investigated interpolation models to fuse PM2.5 measurements from ground stations and satellite data in an attempt to produce spatially continuous maps of PM2.5 nationwide over Thailand. Four approaches are compared, namely the inverse distance weighted (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), random forest (RF), and random forest combined with OK (RFK) leveraging on the NO2, SO2, CO, HCHO, AI, and O3 products from the Sentinel-5P satellite, regulatory-grade ground PM2.5 measurements, and topographic parameters. The results suggest that RFK is the most robust, especially when the pollution levels are moderate or extreme, achieving an RMSE value of 7.11 &mu;g/m3 and an R2 value of 0.77 during a 10-day long period in February, and an RMSE of 10.77 &mu;g/m3 and R2 and 0.91 during the entire month of March. The proposed approach can be adopted operationally and expanded by leveraging regulatory-grade stations, low-cost sensors, as well as upcoming satellite missions such as the GEMS and the Sentinel-5.

TI  - A Road Truncation-Based Location Privacy-Preserving Method against Side-Weight Inference Attack
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2022
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Taking advantage of precise positioning technology, location-based service (LBS) has brought a lot of convenience to people&rsquo;s daily life and made the city smarter. However, the LBS applications also bring some challenges to personal location privacy protection. In order to obtain services from LBS providers, users have to upload their queries including sensitive information, such as identities and locations. This information may be leaked out by the LBS providers or even eavesdropped on by malicious adversaries, which may cause privacy leakage. To tackle this problem, many solutions have been investigated under the assumption that users are uniformly distributed. However, the users are not always uniformly distributed in real-world situations. For a side-weight inference attack, the adversary would infer that the target user is more likely to belong to the road section with more users, resulting in performance deterioration. In this paper, we investigate the issue of location privacy preservation against side-weight inference attack for non-uniform distributed road network. Meanwhile, we consider the cost function of LBS and formulate the object as a mixed integer programming problem. Then, we propose a road truncation-based scheme to protect location privacy. The road section with high user density is designed to be truncated. Finally, simulation results show that our scheme meets the demand for privacy protection at a low cost. As a result, our scheme is proven to protect users&rsquo; location privacy effectively and efficiently.

TI  - Image-Based Monitoring of Cracks: Effectiveness Analysis of an Open-Source Machine Learning-Assisted Procedure
T2  - Journal of Imaging

VL  - 8

SN  - 2313-433X

AB  - The proper inspection of a cracks pattern over time is a critical diagnosis step to provide a thorough knowledge of the health state of a structure. When monitoring cracks propagating on a planar surface, adopting a single-image-based approach is a more convenient (costly and logistically) solution compared to subjective operators-based solutions. Machine learning (ML)- based monitoring solutions offer the advantage of automation in crack detection; however, complex and time-consuming training must be carried out. This study presents a simple and automated ML-based crack monitoring approach implemented in open sources software that only requires a single image for training. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed conducting work in controlled and real case study sites. For both sites, the generated outputs are significant in terms of accuracy (~1 mm), repeatability (sub-mm) and precision (sub-pixel). The presented results highlight that the successful detection of cracks is achievable with only a straightforward ML-based training procedure conducted on only a single image of the multi-temporal sequence. Furthermore, the use of an innovative camera kit allowed exploiting automated acquisition and transmission fundamental for Internet of Things (IoTs) for structural health monitoring and to reduce user-based operations and increase safety.

VL  - 15

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Uncertainties are the most significant challenges in the smart power system, necessitating the use of precise techniques to deal with them properly. Such problems could be effectively solved using a probabilistic optimization strategy. It is further divided into stochastic, robust, distributionally robust, and chance-constrained optimizations. The topics of probabilistic optimization in smart power systems are covered in this review paper. In order to account for uncertainty in optimization processes, stochastic optimization is essential. Robust optimization is the most advanced approach to optimize a system under uncertainty, in which a deterministic, set-based uncertainty model is used instead of a stochastic one. The computational complexity of stochastic programming and the conservativeness of robust optimization are both reduced by distributionally robust optimization.Chance constrained algorithms help in solving the constraints optimization problems, where finite probability get violated. This review paper discusses microgrid and home energy management, demand-side management, unit commitment, microgrid integration, and economic dispatch as examples of applications of these techniques in smart power systems. Probabilistic mathematical models of different scenarios, for which deterministic approaches have been used in the literature, are also presented. Future research directions in a variety of smart power system domains are also presented.

AB  - In order to meet the requirements of high-tech enterprises for high power quality, high-quality operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) in smart distribution networks (SDN) is becoming increasingly important. As a significant element in enhancing the high-quality O&amp;M of SDN, situation awareness (SA) began to excite the significant interest of scholars and managers, especially after the integration of intermittent renewable energy into SDN. Specific to high-quality O&amp;M, the paper decomposes SA into three stages: detection, comprehension, and projection. In this paper, the state-of-the-art knowledge of SND SA is discussed, a review of critical technologies is presented, and a five-layer visualization framework of the SDN SA is constructed. SA detection aims to improve the SDN observability, SA comprehension is associated with the SDN operating status, and SA projection pertains to the analysis of the future SDN situation. The paper can provide researchers and utility engineers with insights into the technical achievements, barriers, and future research directions of SDN SA.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 3
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a sensing paradigm that allows ordinary citizens to use mobile and wearable technologies and become active observers of their surroundings. MCS services generate a massive amount of data due to the vast number of devices engaging in MCS tasks, and the intrinsic mobility of users can quickly make information obsolete, requiring efficient data processing. Our previous work shows that the Bloom filter (BF) is a promising technique to reduce the quantity of redundant data in a hierarchical edge-based MCS ecosystem, allowing users engaging in MCS tasks to make autonomous informed decisions on whether or not to transmit data. This paper extends the proposed BF algorithm to accept multiple data readings of the same type at an exact location if the MCS task requires such functionality. In addition, we thoroughly evaluate the overall behavior of our approach by taking into account the overhead generated in communication between edge servers and end-user devices on a real-world dataset. Our results indicate that using the proposed algorithm makes it possible to significantly reduce the amount of transmitted data and achieve energy savings up to 62% compared to a baseline approach.

TI  - Drivers for Digital Twin Adoption in the Construction Industry: A Systematic Literature Review
T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2022
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Digital twin (DT) is gaining increasing attention due to its ability to present digital replicas of existing assets, processes and systems. DT can integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create real-time simulation models. These models learn and update from multiple data sources to predict their physical counterparts&rsquo; current and future conditions. This has promoted its relevance in various industries, including the construction industry (CI). However, recognising the existence of a distinct set of factors driving its adoption has not been established. Therefore, this study aims to identify the drivers and integrate them into a classification framework to enhance its understanding. Utilising popular databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, a systematic literature review of 58 relevant DT adoptions in the CI research was conducted. From the review, the drivers for DT adoption in the CI were identified and classified. The results show that developed countries such as the UK, US, Australia, and Italy have been the top countries in advancing DT adoption in the CI, while developing countries have made commendable contributions. A conceptual framework has been developed to enhance the successful adoption of DT in the CI based on 50 identified drivers. The major categories of the framework include concept-oriented drivers, production-driven drivers, operational success drivers, and preservation-driven drivers. The developed framework serves as a guide to propel DT adoption in the CI. Furthermore, this study contributes to the body of knowledge about DT adoption drivers, which is essential for DT promotion in the CI.

AB  - Rapid technological evolution defines the first two decades of the millennium. This phenomenon has increased the digital gap, disparities, and inequalities in global and local contexts. This paper reports a systematic literature mapping of 180 articles published from 2000 to 2021 discussing the digital gap. The documents were retrieved using boolean operations in two databases, adding terms related to gender, age, ethnicity, and disabilities, focusing on population groups that are especially vulnerable to the effects of this phenomenon. The method included categorizing the retrieved documents to provide a general view of the most concerning topics in the academic and research community. This analysis concludes (a) the approaches to address this topic are diverse, as this is a multilayered, complex, and interconnected issue; (b) many studies refer to developed countries; however, fewer are those who observe or analyze the underdeveloped regions; (c) the majority of published papers in the last decade report information and communication technologies (ICT) and their role in bridging the gap, showing an opportunity area for designing these technologies considering more accessible approaches through flexible technology approaches; (d) this study&rsquo;s results are a valuable source of information to identify the design requirements for accessible products and service systems. The last section provides a detailed explanation of the findings.

AB  - Electrical load forecasting study is required in electric power systems for different applications with respect to the specific time horizon, such as optimal operations, grid stability, Demand Side Management (DSM) and long-term strategic planning. In this context, machine learning and data analytics models represent a valuable tool to cope with the intrinsic complexity and especially design future demand-side advanced services. The main novelty in this paper is that the combination of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques is proposed to improve the forecasting capability of the hourly load on an electric power substation. A historical dataset of measured loads related to a 33/11 kV MV substation is considered in India as a case study, in order to properly validate the designed method. Based on the presented numerical results, the proposed approach proved itself to accurately predict loads with a reduced dimensionality of input data, thus minimizing the overall computational effort.
