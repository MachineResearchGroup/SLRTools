TI  - Quantifying Uncertainty and Bridging the Scaling Gap in the Retrieval of Leaf Area Index by Coupling Sentinel-2 and UAV Observations

AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) estimates can inform decision-making in crop management. The European Space Agency&rsquo;s Sentinel-2 satellite, with observations in the red-edge spectral region, can monitor crops globally at sub-field spatial resolutions (10&ndash;20 m). However, satellite LAI estimates require calibration with ground measurements. Calibration is challenged by spatial heterogeneity and scale mismatches between field and satellite measurements. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), generating high-resolution (cm-scale) LAI estimates, provide intermediary observations that we use here to characterise uncertainty and reduce spatial scaling discrepancies between Sentinel-2 observations and field surveys. We use a novel UAV multispectral sensor that matches Sentinel-2 spectral bands, flown in conjunction with LAI ground measurements. UAV and field surveys were conducted on multiple dates&mdash;coinciding with different wheat growth stages&mdash;that corresponded to Sentinel-2 overpasses. We compared chlorophyll red-edge index (CIred-edge) maps, derived from the Sentinel-2 and UAV platforms. We used Gaussian processes regression machine learning to calibrate a UAV model for LAI, based on ground data. Using the UAV LAI, we evaluated a two-stage calibration approach for generating robust LAI estimates from Sentinel-2. The agreement between Sentinel-2 and UAV CIred-edge values increased with growth stage&mdash;R2 ranged from 0.32 (stem elongation) to 0.75 (milk development). The CIred-edge variance between the two platforms was more comparable later in the growing season due to a more homogeneous and closed wheat canopy. The single-stage Sentinel-2 LAI calibration (i.e., direct calibration from ground measurements) performed poorly (mean R2 = 0.29, mean NRMSE = 17%) when compared to the two-stage calibration using the UAV data (mean R2 = 0.88, mean NRMSE = 8%). The two-stage approach reduced both errors and biases by &gt;50%. By upscaling ground measurements and providing more representative model training samples, UAV observations provide an effective and viable means of enhancing Sentinel-2 wheat LAI retrievals. We anticipate that our UAV calibration approach to resolving spatial heterogeneity would enhance the retrieval accuracy of LAI and additional biophysical variables for other arable crop types and a broader range of vegetation cover types.

VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - What makes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) intelligent is their capability of sensing and understanding new unknown environments. Some studies utilize computer vision algorithms like Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) and Visual Odometry (VO) to sense the environment for pose estimation, obstacles avoidance and visual servoing. However, understanding the new environment (i.e., make the UAV recognize generic objects) is still an essential scientific problem that lacks a solution. Therefore, this paper takes a step to understand the items in an unknown environment. The aim of this research is to enable the UAV with basic understanding capability for a high-level UAV flock application in the future. Specially, firstly, the proposed understanding method combines machine learning and traditional algorithm to understand the unknown environment through RGB images; secondly, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection system is integrated (based on TensorFlow) in a smartphone to perceive the position and category of 80 classes of objects in the images; thirdly, the method makes the UAV more intelligent and liberates the operator from labor; fourthly, detection accuracy and latency in working condition are quantitatively evaluated, and properties of generality (can be used in various platforms), transportability (easily deployed from one platform to another) and scalability (easily updated and maintained) for UAV flocks are qualitatively discussed. The experiments suggest that the method has enough accuracy to recognize various objects with high computational speed, and excellent properties of generality, transportability and scalability.

AB  - The early detection of plant pathogens at the landscape scale holds great promise for better managing forest ecosystem threats. In Hawai&lsquo;i, two recently described fungal species are responsible for increasingly widespread mortality in &lsquo;ōhi&lsquo;a Metrosideros polymorpha, a foundational tree species in Hawaiian native forests. In this study, we share work from repeat laboratory and field measurements to determine if visible near-infrared and optical remote sensing can detect pre-symptomatic trees infected with these pathogens. After generating a dense time series of laboratory spectral reflectance data and red green blue (RGB) images for inoculated &lsquo;ōhi&lsquo;a seedlings, seedlings subjected to extreme drought, and control plants, we found few obvious spectral indicators that could be used for reliable pre-symptomatic detection in the inoculated seedlings, which quickly experienced complete and total wilting following stress onset. In the field, we found similar results when we collected repeat multispectral and RGB imagery over inoculated mature trees (sudden onset of symptoms with little advance warning). We found selected vegetation indices to be reliable indicators for detecting non-specific stress in &lsquo;ōhi&lsquo;a trees, but never providing more than five days prior warning relative to visual detection in the laboratory trials. Finally, we generated a sequence of linear support vector machine classification models from the laboratory data at time steps ranging from pre-treatment to late-stage stress. Overall classification accuracies increased with stress stage maturity, but poor model performance prior to stress onset and the sudden onset of symptoms in infected trees suggest that early detection of rapid &lsquo;ōhi&lsquo;a death over timescales helpful for land managers remains a challenge.

AB  - With the development of Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) communication, Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) has become a hot research area in recent years, which is widely used in civil and military fields due to its unique advantages. FANET is a special kind of networks which are composed of UAV nodes, and can be used to implement data transfer in certain unique scenarios. To achieve reliable and robust communication among UAVs, a routing algorithm is the key factor and should be designed elaborately. Because of its importance and usefulness, this topic has attracted many researchers, and various routing protocols have also been put forward to improve the quality of data transmission in FANETs. Thus, in this paper, we give a survey on the state-of-the-art of routing protocols proposed in recent years. First, an in-depth research of the routing in FANETs recently has been brought out by absolutely differentiating them based on their routing mechanism. Then, we give a comparative analysis of each protocol based on their characteristics and service quality indicators. Finally, we propose some unsolved problems and future research directions for FANET routing.

AB  - Topographic Base Maps (TBMs) are those maps that portray ground relief as the form of contour lines and show planimetric details. Various other maps like geomorphological maps, contour maps, and land use planning maps are derived from topographical maps. In this constantly changing world, the update of TBMs is indispensable. In Nepal, their update and maintenance are done by the Survey Department (SD) as a national mapping agency. This paper presents the history of topographical mapping and the reasons for the lack of updates. Currently, the SD is updating the TBM database using panchromatic and multispectral images from the Zi Yuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite with a resolution of 2.1 and 5.8 m, respectively. The updated methodology includes the orthorectification of images, the pansharpening of images, field data collection, digitization, change detection, and updating, the overlay of vector data and field verification, data quality control, and printing map production. A TBM in the Dang district of Nepal is presented as casework to show the changes in the area and issues faced during the update. Though the present digitizing procedure is time-consuming and labor-intensive, the use of high-resolution imagery has made mapping accurate and has produced high-quality maps. However, audit and automation can be introduced from the experiences of other countries for accurate and frequent updates of the TBM database in Nepal.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Bridges are designed to withstand different types of loads, including dead, live, environmental, and occasional loads during their service period. Moving vehicles are the main source of the applied live load on bridges. The applied load to highway bridges depends on several traffic parameters such as weight of vehicles, axle load, configuration of axles, position of vehicles on the bridge, number of vehicles, direction, and vehicle&rsquo;s speed. The estimation of traffic loadings on bridges are generally notional and, consequently, can be excessively conservative. Hence, accurate prediction of the in-service performance of a bridge structure is very desirable and great savings can be achieved through the accurate assessment of the applied traffic load in existing bridges. In this paper, a review is conducted on conventional vehicle-based health monitoring methods used for bridges. Vision-based, weigh in motion (WIM), bridge weigh in motion (BWIM), drive-by and vehicle bridge interaction (VBI)-based models are the methods that are generally used in the structural health monitoring (SHM) of bridges. The performance of vehicle-assisted methods is studied and suggestions for future work in this area are addressed, including alleviating the downsides of each approach to disentangle the complexities, and adopting intelligent and autonomous vehicle-assisted methods for health monitoring of bridges.

AB  - Timely and accurate agricultural information is needed to inform resource allocation and sustainable practices to improve food security in the developing world. Obtaining this information through traditional surveys is time consuming and labor intensive, making it difficult to collect data at the frequency and resolution needed to accurately estimate the planted areas of key crops and their distribution during the growing season. Remote sensing technologies can be leveraged to provide consistent, cost-effective, and spatially disaggregated data at high temporal frequency. In this study, we used imagery acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles to create a high-fidelity ground-truth dataset that included examples of large mono-cropped fields, small intercropped fields, and natural vegetation. The imagery was acquired in three rounds of flights at six sites in different agro-ecological zones to capture growing conditions. This dataset was used to train and test a random forest model that was implemented in Google Earth Engine for classifying cropped land using freely available Sentinel-1 and -2 data. This model achieved an overall accuracy of 83%, and a 91% accuracy for maize specifically. The model results were compared with Rwanda&rsquo;s Seasonal Agricultural Survey, which highlighted biases in the dataset including a lack of examples of mixed land cover.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Field mapping and information on agricultural landscapes is of increasing importance for many applications. Monitoring schemes and national cadasters provide a rich source of information but their maintenance and regular updating is costly and labor-intensive. Automatized mapping of fields based on remote sensing imagery may aid in this task and allow for a faster and more regular observation. Although remote sensing has seen extensive use in agricultural research topics, such as plant health monitoring, crop type classification, yield prediction, and irrigation, field delineation and extraction has seen comparatively little research interest. In this study, we present a field boundary detection technique based on deep learning and a variety of image features, and combine it with the graph-based growing contours (GGC) method to extract agricultural fields in a study area in northern Germany. The boundary detection step only requires red, green, and blue (RGB) data and is therefore largely independent of the sensor used. We compare different image features based on color and luminosity information and evaluate their usefulness for the task of field boundary detection. A model based on texture metrics, gradient information, Hessian matrix eigenvalues, and local statistics showed good results with accuracies up to 88.2%, an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of up to 0.94, and F1 score of up to 0.88. The exclusive use of these universal image features may also facilitate transferability to other regions. We further present modifications to the GGC method intended to aid in upscaling of the method through process acceleration with a minimal effect on results. We combined the boundary detection results with the GGC method for field polygon extraction. Results were promising, with the new GGC version performing similarly or better than the original version while experiencing an acceleration of 1.3&times; to 2.3&times; on different subsets and input complexities. Further research may explore other applications of the GGC method outside agricultural remote sensing and field extraction.

AB  - Wind disturbances and noise severely affect Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) when monitoring and finding faults in overhead power lines. Accordingly, we propose repetitive learning as a new solution for the problem. In particular, the performance of Iterative Learning Control (ILC) that are based on optimal approaches are examined, namely (i) Gradient-based ILC and (ii) Norm Optimal ILC. When considering the repetitive nature of fault-finding tasks for electrical overhead power lines, this study develops, implements and evaluates optimal ILC algorithms for a UAV model. Moreover, we suggest attempting a learning gain variation on the standard optimal algorithms instead of heuristically selecting from the previous range. The results of both simulations and experiments of gradient-based norm optimal control reveal that the proposed ILC algorithm has not only contributed to good trajectory tracking, but also good convergence speed and the ability to cope with exogenous disturbances such as wind gusts.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Generating Digital Elevation Models (DEM) from satellite imagery or other data sources constitutes an essential tool for a plethora of applications and disciplines, ranging from 3D flight planning and simulation, autonomous driving and satellite navigation, such as GPS, to modeling water flow, precision farming and forestry. The task of extracting this 3D geometry from a given surface hitherto requires a combination of appropriately collected corresponding samples and/or specialized equipment, as inferring the elevation from single image data is out of reach for contemporary approaches. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have experienced unprecedented growth in recent years as they can extrapolate rules in a data-driven manner and retrieve convoluted, nonlinear one-to-one mappings, such as an approximate mapping from satellite imagery to DEMs. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end Deep Learning (DL) approach to construct this mapping and to generate an absolute or relative point cloud estimation of a DEM given a single RGB satellite (Sentinel-2 imagery in this work) or drone image. The model has been readily extended to incorporate available information from the non-visible electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike existing methods, we only exploit one image for the production of the elevation data, rendering our approach less restrictive and constrained, but suboptimal compared to them at the same time. Moreover, recent advances in software and hardware allow us to make the inference and the generation extremely fast, even on moderate hardware. We deploy Conditional Generative Adversarial networks (CGAN), which are the state-of-the-art approach to image-to-image translation. We expect our work to serve as a springboard for further development in this field and to foster the integration of such methods in the process of generating, updating and analyzing DEMs.

AB  - The diversity of change detection (CD) methods and the limitations in generalizing these techniques using different types of remote sensing datasets over various study areas have been a challenge for CD applications. Additionally, most CD methods have been implemented in two intensive and time-consuming steps: (a) predicting change areas, and (b) decision on predicted areas. In this study, a novel CD framework based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to not only address the aforementioned problems but also to considerably improve the level of accuracy. The proposed CNN-based CD network contains three parallel channels: the first and second channels, respectively, extract deep features on the original first- and second-time imagery and the third channel focuses on the extraction of change deep features based on differencing and staking deep features. Additionally, each channel includes three types of convolution kernels: 1D-, 2D-, and 3D-dilated-convolution. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed CD method are evaluated using three different types of remote sensing benchmark datasets (i.e., multispectral, hyperspectral, and Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture RADAR (PolSAR)). The results of the CD maps are also evaluated both visually and statistically by calculating nine different accuracy indices. Moreover, the results of the CD using the proposed method are compared to those of several state-of-the-art CD algorithms. All the results prove that the proposed method outperforms the other remote sensing CD techniques. For instance, considering different scenarios, the Overall Accuracies (OAs) and Kappa Coefficients (KCs) of the proposed CD method are better than 95.89% and 0.805, respectively, and the Miss Detection (MD) and the False Alarm (FA) rates are lower than 12% and 3%, respectively.

AB  - Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) is a remote sensing image analysis paradigm that defines and examines image-objects: groups of neighboring pixels that represent real-world geographic objects. Recent reviews have examined methodological considerations and highlighted how GEOBIA improves upon the 30+ year pixel-based approach, particularly for H-resolution imagery. However, the literature also exposes an opportunity to improve guidance on the application of GEOBIA for novice practitioners. In this paper, we describe the theoretical foundations of GEOBIA and provide a comprehensive overview of the methodological workflow, including: (i) software-specific approaches (open-source and commercial); (ii) best practices informed by research; and (iii) the current status of methodological research. Building on this foundation, we then review recent research on the convergence of GEOBIA with deep convolutional neural networks, which we suggest is a new form of GEOBIA. Specifically, we discuss general integrative approaches and offer recommendations for future research. Overall, this paper describes the past, present, and anticipated future of GEOBIA in a novice-accessible format, while providing innovation and depth to experienced practitioners.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - This study aimed to develop empirical pasture dry matter (DM) yield prediction models using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne sensor at four flying altitudes. Three empirical models were developed using features generated from the multispectral sensor: Structure from Motion only (SfM), vegetation indices only (VI), and in combination (SfM+VI) within a machine learning modelling framework. Four flying altitudes were tested (25 m, 50 m, 75 m and 100 m) and based on independent model validation, combining features from SfM+VI outperformed the other models at all heights. However, the importance of SfM-based features changed with altitude, with limited importance at 25 m but at all higher altitudes SfM-based features were included in the top 10 features in a variable importance plot. Based on the independent validation results, data generated at 25 m flying altitude reported the best model performances with model accuracy of 328 kg DM/ha. In contrast, at 100 m flying altitude, the model reported an accuracy of 402 kg DM/ha which demonstrates the potential of scaling up this technology at farm scale. The spatial-temporal maps provide valuable information on pasture DM yield and DM accumulation of herbage mass over the time, supporting on-farm management decisions.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Accurate monitoring of plant dust retention can provide a basis for dust pollution control and environmental protection. The aims of this study were to analyze the spectral response features of grassland plants to mining dust and to predict the spatial distribution of dust retention using hyperspectral data. The dust retention content was determined by an electronic analytical balance and a leaf area meter. The leaf reflectance spectrum was measured by a handheld hyperspectral camera, and the airborne hyperspectral data were obtained using an imaging spectrometer. We analyzed the difference between the leaf spectral before and after dust removal. The sensitive spectra of dust retention on the leaf- and the canopy-scale were determined through two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS). The competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm was applied to select the feature bands of canopy dust retention. The estimation model of canopy dust retention was built through random forest regression (RFR), and the dust distribution map was obtained based on the airborne hyperspectral image. The results showed that dust retention enhanced the spectral reflectance of leaves in the visible wavelength but weakened the reflectance in the near-infrared wavelength. Caused by the canopy structure and multiple scattering, a slight difference in the sensitive spectra on dust retention existed between the canopy and leaves. Similarly, the sensitive spectra of leaves and the canopy were closely related to dust and plant physiological parameters. The estimation model constructed through 2DCOS-CARS-RFR showed higher precision, compared with genetic algorithm-random forest regression (GA-RFR) and simulated annealing algorithm-random forest regression (SAA-RFR). Spatially, the amount of canopy dust increased and then decreased with increasing distance from the mining area, reaching a maximum within 300&ndash;500 m. This study not only demonstrated the importance of extracting feature bands based on the response of plant physical and chemical parameters to dust, but also laid a foundation for the rapid and non-destructive monitoring of grassland plant dust retention.

The genetic algorithm (GA) is the proposed optimization technique to tune the consensus control parameters. The complete nonlinear model is used without any further simplifications in the simulations, while simplification in the model is used to theoretically design the controller. Different case studies and tests are done (i.e., trajectory tracking formation and switching topology) to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The results show good performance in all tests while achieving the consensus of the desired formations.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The optimization of crop nitrogen fertilization to accurately predict and match the nitrogen (N) supply to the crop N demand is the subject of intense research due to the environmental and economic impact of N fertilization. Excess N could seep into the water supplies around the field and cause unnecessary spending by the farmer. The drawbacks of N deficiency on crops include poor plant growth, ultimately reducing the final yield potential. The objective of this study is to use Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery to predict canopy nitrogen weight (g/m2) of corn fields in south-west Ontario, Canada. Simple/multiple linear regression, Random Forests, and support vector regression (SVR) were established to predict the canopy nitrogen weight from individual multispectral bands and associated vegetation indices (VI). Random Forests using the current techniques/methodologies performed the best out of all the models tested on the validation set with an R2 of 0.85 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.52 g/m2. Adding more spectral variables into the model provided a marginal improvement in the accuracy, while extending the overall processing time. Random Forests provided marginally better results than SVR, but the concepts and analysis are much easier to interpret on Random Forests. Both machine learning models provided a much better accuracy than linear regression. The best model was then applied to the UAV images acquired at different dates for producing maps that show the spatial variation of canopy nitrogen weight within each field at that date.

AB  - Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully applied in mapless navigation. An important issue in DRL is to design a reward function for evaluating actions of agents. However, designing a robust and suitable reward function greatly depends on the designer&rsquo;s experience and intuition. To address this concern, we consider employing reward shaping from trajectories on similar navigation tasks without human supervision, and propose a general reward function based on matching network (MN). The MN-based reward function is able to gain the experience by pre-training through trajectories on different navigation tasks and accelerate the training speed of DRL in new tasks. The proposed reward function keeps the optimal strategy of DRL unchanged. The simulation results on two static maps show that the DRL converge with less iterations via the learned reward function than the state-of-the-art mapless navigation methods. The proposed method performs well in dynamic maps with partially moving obstacles. Even when test maps are different from training maps, the proposed strategy is able to complete the navigation tasks without additional training.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Post-disaster recovery is a complex process in terms of measuring its progress after a disaster and understanding its components and influencing factors. During this process, disaster planners and governments need reliable information to make decisions towards building the affected region back to normal (pre-disaster), or even improved, conditions. Hence, it is essential to use methods to understand the dynamics/variables of the post-disaster recovery process, and rapid and cost-effective data and tools to monitor the process. Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides free access to vast amounts of remote sensing (RS) data and a powerful computing environment in a cloud platform, making it an attractive tool to analyze earth surface data. In this study we assessed the suitability of GEE to analyze and track recovery. To do so, we employed GEE to assess the recovery process over a three-year period after Typhoon Haiyan, which struck Leyte island, in the Philippines, in 2013. We developed an approach to (i) generate cloud and shadow-free image composites from Landsat 7 and 8 satellite imagery and produce land cover classification data using the Random Forest method, and (ii) generate damage and recovery maps based on post-classification change analysis. The method produced land cover maps with accuracies &gt;88%. We used the model to produce damage and three time-step recovery maps for 62 municipalities on Leyte island. The results showed that most of the municipalities had recovered after three years in terms of returning to the pre-disaster situation based on the selected land cover change analysis. However, more analysis (e.g., functional assessment) based on detailed data (e.g., land use maps) is needed to evaluate the more complex and subtle socio-economic aspects of the recovery. The study showed that GEE has good potential for monitoring the recovery process for extensive regions. However, the most important limitation is the lack of very-high-resolution RS data that are critical to assess the process in detail, in particular in complex urban environments.

AB  - Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (clustering, genetic, and principal component analysis) automate Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) missions as well as the creation and refinement of iterative 3D photogrammetric models with a next best view (NBV) approach. The novel approach uses Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to achieve convergence to a specified orthomosaic resolution by identifying edges in the point cloud and planning cameras that &ldquo;view&rdquo; the holes identified by edges without requiring an initial model. This iterative UAV photogrammetric method successfully runs in various Microsoft AirSim environments. Simulated ground sampling distance (GSD) of models reaches as low as     3.4     cm per pixel, and generally, successive iterations improve resolution. Besides analogous application in simulated environments, a field study of a retired municipal water tank illustrates the practical application and advantages of automated UAV iterative inspection of infrastructure using     63 %     fewer photographs than a comparable manual flight with analogous density point clouds obtaining a GSD of less than 3 cm per pixel. Each iteration qualitatively increases resolution according to a logarithmic regression, reduces holes in models, and adds details to model edges.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In this study, an image registration algorithm was applied to calculate the rotation angle of objects when matching images. Some commonly used image feature detection algorithms such as features from accelerated segment test (FAST), speeded up robust features (SURF) and maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) algorithms were chosen as feature extraction components. Comparing the running time and accuracy, the image registration algorithm based on SURF has better performance than the other algorithms. Accurately obtaining the roll angle is one of the key technologies to improve the positioning accuracy and operation quality of agricultural equipment. To acquire the roll angle of agriculture machinery, a roll angle acquisition model based on the image registration algorithm was built. Then, the performance of the model with a monocular camera was tested in the field. The field test showed that the average error of the rolling angle was 0.61&deg;, while the minimum error was 0.08&deg;. The field test indicated that the model could accurately obtain the attitude change trend of agricultural machinery when it was working in irregular farmlands. The model described in this paper could provide a foundation for agricultural equipment navigation and autonomous driving.

AB  - Corn yields vary spatially and temporally in the plots as a result of weather, altitude, variety, plant density, available water, nutrients, and planting date; these are the main factors that influence crop yield. In this study, different multispectral and red-green-blue (RGB) vegetation indices were analyzed, as well as the digitally estimated canopy cover and plant density, in order to estimate corn grain yield using a neural network model. The relative importance of the predictor variables was also analyzed. An experiment was established with five levels of nitrogen fertilization (140, 200, 260, 320, and 380 kg/ha) and four replicates, in a completely randomized block design, resulting in 20 experimental polygons. Crop information was captured using two sensors (Parrot Sequoia_4.9, and DJI FC6310_8.8) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for two flight dates at 47 and 79 days after sowing (DAS). The correlation coefficient between the plant density, obtained through the digital count of corn plants, and the corn grain yield was 0.94; this variable was the one with the highest relative importance in the yield estimation according to Garson&rsquo;s algorithm. The canopy cover, digitally estimated, showed a correlation coefficient of 0.77 with respect to the corn grain yield, while the relative importance of this variable in the yield estimation was 0.080 and 0.093 for 47 and 79 DAS, respectively. The wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), plant density, and canopy cover showed the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.99, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.028 t ha&minus;1, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.125 t ha&minus;1) in the corn grain yield estimation at 47 DAS, with the WDRVI index and the density being the variables with the highest relative importance for this crop development date. For the 79 DAS flight, the combination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge (NDRE), WDRVI, excess green (EXG), triangular greenness index (TGI), and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI), as well as plant density and canopy cover, generated the highest correlation coefficient and the smallest errors (R = 0.97, MAE = 0.249 t ha&minus;1, RMSE = 0.425 t ha&minus;1) in the corn grain yield estimation, where the density and the NDVI were the variables with the highest relative importance, with values of 0.295 and 0.184, respectively. However, the WDRVI, plant density, and canopy cover estimated the corn grain yield with acceptable precision (R = 0.96, MAE = 0.209 t ha&minus;1, RMSE = 0.449 t ha&minus;1). The generated neural network models provided a high correlation coefficient between the estimated and the observed corn grain yield, and also showed acceptable errors in the yield estimation. The spectral information registered through remote sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and its processing in vegetation indices, canopy cover, and plant density allowed the characterization and estimation of corn grain yield. Such information is very useful for decision-making and agricultural activities planning.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 14
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Eight years after the first record in Italy, Kiwifruit Decline (KD), a destructive disease causing root rot, has already affected more than 25% of the area under kiwifruit cultivation in Italy. Diseased plants are characterised by severe decay of the fine roots and sudden wilting of the canopy, which is only visible after the season&rsquo;s first period of heat (July&ndash;August). The swiftness of symptom appearance prevents correct timing and positioning for sampling of the disease, and is therefore a barrier to aetiological studies. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of thermal and multispectral imaging for the detection of KD using an unsupervised classifier. Thus, RGB, multispectral and thermal data from a kiwifruit orchard, with healthy and diseased plants, were acquired simultaneously during two consecutive growing seasons (2017&ndash;2018) using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform. Data reduction was applied to the clipped areas of the multispectral and thermal data from the 2017 survey. Reduced data were then classified with two unsupervised algorithms, a K-means and a hierarchical method. The plant vigour (canopy size and presence/absence of wilted leaves) and the health shifts exhibited by asymptomatic plants between 2017 and 2018 were evaluated from RGB data via expert assessment and used as the ground truth for cluster interpretation. Multispectral data showed a high correlation with plant vigour, while temperature data demonstrated a good potential use in predicting health shifts, especially in highly vigorous plants that were asymptomatic in 2017 and became symptomatic in 2018. The accuracy of plant vigour assessment was above 73% when using multispectral data, while clustering of the temperature data allowed the prediction of disease outbreak one year in advance, with an accuracy of 71%. Based on our results, the unsupervised clustering of remote sensing data could be a reliable tool for the identification of sampling areas, and can greatly improve aetiological studies of this new disease in kiwifruit.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Intelligent UAV will be widely used in future autonomous aerial combat. Previous researches on autonomous aerial combat within visual range (WVR) have limitations due to simplifying assumptions, limited robustness, and ignoring sensor errors. In this paper, in order to consider the error of the aircraft sensors, we model the aerial combat WVR as a state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP), which introduce the small adversarial perturbations on state observations and these perturbations do not alter the environment directly, but can mislead the agent into making suboptimal decisions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel autonomous aerial combat maneuver strategy generation algorithm with high-performance and high-robustness based on state-adversarial deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (SA-DDPG), which add a robustness regularizers related to an upper bound on performance loss at the actor-network. At the same time, a reward shaping method based on maximum entropy (MaxEnt) inverse reinforcement learning algorithm (IRL) is proposed to improve the aerial combat strategy generation algorithm&rsquo;s efficiency. Finally, the efficiency of the aerial combat strategy generation algorithm and the performance and robustness of the resulting aerial combat strategy is verified by simulation experiments. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, to introduce the observation errors of UAV, we are modeling air combat as SA-MDP. Second, to make the strategy network of air combat maneuver more robust in the presence of observation errors, we introduce regularizers into the policy gradient. Third, to solve the problem that air combat&rsquo;s reward function is too sparse, we use MaxEnt IRL to design a shaping reward to accelerate the convergence of SA-DDPG.

AB  - A challenging problem in the field of avian ecology is deriving information on bird population movement trends. This necessitates the regular counting of birds which is usually not an easily-achievable task. A promising attempt towards solving the bird counting problem in a more consistent and fast way is to predict the number of birds in different regions from their photos. For this purpose, we exploit the ability of computers to learn from past data through deep learning which has been a leading sub-field of AI for image understanding. Our data source is a collection of on-ground photos taken during our long run of birding activity. We employ several state-of-the-art generic object-detection algorithms to learn to detect birds, each being a member of one of the 38 identified species, in natural scenes. The experiments revealed that computer-aided counting outperformed the manual counting with respect to both accuracy and time. As a real-world application of image-based bird counting, we prepared the spatial bird order distribution and species diversity maps of Turkey by utilizing the geographic information system (GIS) technology. Our results suggested that deep learning can assist humans in bird monitoring activities and increase citizen scientists&rsquo; participation in large-scale bird surveys.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based communications gained a lot of attention due to their numerous applications, especially in rescue services in post-disaster areas where the terrestrial network is wholly malfunctioned. Multiple access/gateway UAVs are distributed to fully cover the post-disaster area as flying base stations to provide communication coverage, collect valuable information, disseminate essential instructions, etc. The access UAVs after gathering/broadcasting the necessary information should select and fly towards one of the surrounding gateways for relaying their information. In this paper, the gateway UAV selection problem is addressed. The main aim is to maximize the long-term average data rates of the UAVs relays while minimizing the flights&rsquo; battery cost, where millimeter wave links, i.e., using 30~300 GHz band, employing antenna beamforming, are used for backhauling. A tool of machine learning (ML) is exploited to address the problem as a budget-constrained multi-player multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. In this setup, access UAVs act as the players, and the arms are the gateway UAVs, while the rewards are the average data rates of the constructed relays constrained by the battery cost of the access UAV flights. In this decentralized setting, where information is neither prior available nor exchanged among UAVs, a selfish and concurrent multi-player MAB strategy is suggested. Towards this end, three battery-aware MAB (BA-MAB) algorithms, namely upper confidence bound (UCB), Thompson sampling (TS), and the exponential weight algorithm for exploration and exploitation (EXP3), are proposed to realize gateways selection efficiently. The proposed BA-MAB-based gateway UAV selection algorithms show superior performance over approaches based on near and random selections in terms of total system rate and energy efficiency.

AB  - High-resolution terrain models of open-pit mine highwalls and benches are essential in developing new automated slope monitoring systems for operational optimization. This paper presents several contributions to the field of remote sensing in surface mines providing a practical framework for generating high-resolution images using low-trim Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). First, a novel mobile application was developed for autonomous drone flights to follow mine terrain and capture high-resolution images of the mine surface. In this article, case study is presented showcasing the ability of developed software to import area terrain, plan the flight accordingly, and finally execute the area mapping mission autonomously. Next, to model the drone&rsquo;s battery performance, empirical studies were conducted considering various flight scenarios. A multivariate linear regression model for drone power consumption was derived from experimental data. The model has also been validated using data from a test flight. Finally, a genetic algorithm for solving the problem of flight planning and optimization has been employed. The developed power consumption model was used as the fitness function in the genetic algorithm. The designed algorithm was then validated using simulation studies. It is shown that the offered path optimization can reduce the time and energy of high-resolution imagery missions by over 50%. The current work provides a practical framework for stability monitoring of open-pit highwalls while achieving required energy optimization and imagery performance.

PY  - 2020

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Flood occurrence is increasing due to escalated urbanization and extreme climate change; hence, various studies on this issue and methods of flood monitoring and mapping are also increasing to reduce the severe impacts of flood disasters. The advancement of current technologies such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems facilitated and improved flood applications. In a LiDAR system, a laser emits light that travels to the ground and reflects off objects like buildings and trees. The reflected light energy returns to the sensor, whereby the time interval is recorded. Since the conventional methods cannot produce high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data, which results in low accuracy of flood simulation results, LiDAR data are extensively used as an alternative. This review aims to study the potential and the applications of LiDAR-derived DEM in flood studies. It also provides insight into the operating principles of different LiDAR systems, system components, and advantages and disadvantages of each system. This paper discusses several topics relevant to flood studies from a LiDAR-derived DEM perspective. Furthermore, the challenges and future perspectives regarding DEM LiDAR data for flood mapping and assessment are also reviewed. This study demonstrates that LiDAR-derived data are useful in flood risk management, especially in the future assessment of flood-related problems.

T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 14
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Snowmelt from mountain forests is critically important for water resources and hydropower generation. More than 75% of surface water supply originates as snowmelt in mountainous regions, such as the western U.S. Remote sensing has the potential to measure snowpack in these areas accurately. In this research, we combine light detection and ranging (lidar) from crewed aircraft (currently, the most reliable way of measuring snow depth in mountain forests) and structure from motion (SfM) remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) for cost-effective multi-temporal monitoring of snowpack in mountain forests. In sparsely forested areas, both technologies give similar snow depth maps, with a comparable agreement with ground-based snow depth observations (RMSE ~10 cm). In densely forested areas, airborne lidar is better able to represent snow depth than RPAS-SfM (RMSE ~10 cm vs ~10&ndash;20 cm). In addition, we find the relationship between RPAS-SfM and previous lidar snow depth data can be used to estimate snow depth conditions outside of relatively small RPAS-SfM monitoring plots, with RMSE&rsquo;s between these observed and estimated snow depths on the order of 10&ndash;15 cm for the larger lidar coverages. This suggests that when a single airborne lidar snow survey exists, RPAS-SfM may provide useful multi-temporal snow monitoring that can estimate basin-scale snowpack, at a much lower cost than multiple airborne lidar surveys. Doing so requires a pre-existing mid-winter or peak-snowpack airborne lidar snow survey, and subsequent well-designed paired SfM and field snow surveys that accurately capture substantial snow depth variability.

T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 14
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Coastal and marine management require the evaluation of multiple environmental threats and issues. However, there are gaps in the necessary data and poor access or dissemination of existing data in many countries around the world. This research identifies how remote sensing can contribute to filling these gaps so that environmental agencies, such as the United Nations Environmental Programme, European Environmental Agency, and International Union for Conservation of Nature, can better implement environmental directives in a cost-effective manner. Remote sensing (RS) techniques generally allow for uniform data collection, with common acquisition and reporting methods, across large areas. Furthermore, these datasets are sometimes open-source, mainly when governments finance satellite missions. Some of these data can be used in holistic, coastal and marine environmental management frameworks, such as the DAPSI(W)R(M) framework (Drivers–Activities–Pressures–State changes–Impacts (on Welfare)–Responses (as Measures), an updated version of Drivers–Pressures–State–Impact–Responses. The framework is a useful and holistic problem-structuring framework that can be used to assess the causes, consequences, and responses to change in the marine environment. Six broad classifications of remote data collection technologies are reviewed for their potential contribution to integrated marine management, including Satellite-based Remote Sensing, Aerial Remote Sensing, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Unmanned Surface Vehicles, Unmanned Underwater Vehicles, and Static Sensors. A significant outcome of this study is practical inputs into each component of the DAPSI(W)R(M) framework. The RS applications are not expected to be all-inclusive; rather, they provide insight into the current use of the framework as a foundation for developing further holistic resource technologies for management strategies in the future. A significant outcome of this research will deliver practical insights for integrated coastal and marine management and demonstrate the usefulness of RS to support the implementation of environmental goals, descriptors, targets, and policies, such as the Water Framework Directive, Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Ocean Health Index, and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Additionally, the opportunities and challenges of these technologies are discussed.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20
IS  - 14
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a low-cost method for rice growth information obtained quickly using digital images taken with smartphone. A new canopy parameter, namely, the canopy volume parameter (CVP), was proposed and developed for rice using the leaf area index (LAI) and plant height (PH). Among these parameters, the CVP was selected as an optimal parameter to characterize rice yields during the growth period. Rice canopy images were acquired with a smartphone. Image feature parameters were extracted, including the canopy cover (CC) and numerous vegetation indices (VIs), before and after image segmentation. A rice CVP prediction model in which the CC and VIs served as independent variables was established using a random forest (RF) regression algorithm. The results revealed the following. The CVP was better than the LAI and PH for predicting the final yield. And a CVP prediction model constructed according to a local modelling method for distinguishing different types of rice varieties was the most accurate (coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.92; root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.44). These findings indicate that digital images can be used to track the growth of crops over time and provide technical support for estimating rice yields.

AB  - Using intelligent agricultural machines in paddy fields has received great attention. An obstacle avoidance system is required with the development of agricultural machines. In order to make the machines more intelligent, detecting and tracking obstacles, especially the moving obstacles in paddy fields, is the basis of obstacle avoidance. To achieve this goal, a red, green and blue (RGB) camera and a computer were used to build a machine vision system, mounted on a transplanter. A method that combined the improved You Only Look Once version 3 (Yolov3) and deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (deep SORT) was used to detect and track typical moving obstacles, and figure out the center point positions of the obstacles in paddy fields. The improved Yolov3 has 23 residual blocks and upsamples only once, and has new loss calculation functions. Results showed that the improved Yolov3 obtained mean intersection over union (mIoU) score of 0.779 and was 27.3% faster in processing speed than standard Yolov3 on a self-created test dataset of moving obstacles (human and water buffalo) in paddy fields. An acceptable performance for detecting and tracking could be obtained in a real paddy field test with an average processing speed of 5&ndash;7 frames per second (FPS), which satisfies actual work demands. In future research, the proposed system could support the intelligent agriculture machines more flexible in autonomous navigation.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The present work aims to assess the usefulness of five vegetation indices (VI) derived from multispectral UAS imagery to capture the effects of deficit irrigation on the canopy structure of sweet cherry trees (Prunus avium L.) in southeastern Spain. Three irrigation treatments were assayed, a control treatment and two regulated deficit irrigation treatments. Four airborne flights were carried out during two consecutive seasons; to compare the results of the remote sensing VI, the conventional and continuous water status indicators commonly used to manage sweet cherry tree irrigation were measured, including midday stem water potential (&Psi;s) and maximum daily shrinkage (MDS). Simple regression between individual VIs and &Psi;s or MDS found stronger relationships in postharvest than in preharvest. Thus, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), resulted in the strongest relationship with &Psi;s (r2 = 0.67) and MDS (r2 = 0.45), followed by the normalized difference red edge (NDRE). The sensitivity analysis identified the optimal soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) as the VI with the highest coefficient of variation in postharvest and the difference vegetation index (DVI) in preharvest. A new index is proposed, the transformed red range vegetation index (TRRVI), which was the only VI able to statistically identify a slight water deficit applied in preharvest. The combination of the VIs studied was used in two machine learning models, decision tree and artificial neural networks, to estimate the extra labor needed for harvesting and the sweet cherry yield.

AB  - The construction sector has proven to be one of the slowest sectors to embrace technology&mdash;a problem that must be addressed. This problem can be quickly and efficiently addressed in certain aspects of seismic engineering: from seismic risk assessment to damage detection, as well as condition assessments existing structures before or after an earthquake. In this paper, the literature review of assessment methods and damage detection technologies for existing (mainly) masonry structures is presented. Traditional methods are briefly explained, and modern are critically discussed. Special focus is given to unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as, photogrammetry and close-range remote sensing as a technology that can complement traditional ways of assessment and give us data about a structure that is often different to obtain. Graphical interpretation of one post-earthquake case study is provided. Open challenges and opportunities of emerging technologies for faster and easier assessment of seismic safety and vulnerability are presented.

TI  - The Classification Performance and Mechanism of Machine Learning Algorithms in Winter Wheat Mapping Using Sentinel-2 10 m Resolution Imagery
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 15
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Machine learning algorithms are crucial for crop identification and mapping. However, many works only focus on the identification results of these algorithms, but pay less attention to their classification performance and mechanism. In this paper, based on Google Earth Engine (GEE), Sentinel-2 10 m resolution images during a specific phenological period of winter wheat were obtained. Then, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and classification and regression tree (CART) machine learning algorithms were employed to identify and map winter wheat in a large-scale area. The hyperparameters of the three machine learning algorithms were tuned by grid search and the 5-fold cross-validation method. The classification performance of the three machine learning algorithms were compared, the results of which demonstrate that SVM achieves best performance in identifying winter wheat, and its overall accuracy (OA), user&rsquo;s accuracy (UA), producer&rsquo;s accuracy (PA), and kappa coefficient (Kappa) are 0.94, 0.95, 0.95, and 0.92, respectively. Moreover, 50 various combinations of training and validation sets were used to analyze the generalization ability of the algorithms, and the results show that the average OA of SVM, RF, and CART are 0.93, 0.92, and 0.88, respectively, thus indicating that SVM and RF are more robust than CART. To further explore the sensitivity of SVM, RF, and CART to variations of the algorithm parameters&mdash;namely, (C and gamma), (tree and split), and (maxD and minSP)&mdash;we employed the grid search method to iterate these parameters, respectively, and to analyze the effect of these parameters on the accuracy scores and classification residuals. It was found that with the change of (C and gamma) in (0.01~1000), SVM&rsquo;s maximum variation of accuracy score is up to 0.63, and the maximum variation of residuals is 76,215 km2. We concluded that SVM is sensitive to the parameters (C and gamma) and presents a positive correlation. When the parameters (tree and split) change between (100~600) and (1~6), respectively, the RF&rsquo;s maximum variation of accuracy score is 0.08, and the maximum variation of residuals is 1157 km2, indicating that RF is low in sensitivity toward the parameters (tree and split). When the parameters (maxD and minSP) are between (10~60), the maximum accuracy change value is 0.06, and the maximum variation of residuals is 6943 km2. Therefore, compared to RF, CART is sensitive to the parameters (maxD and minSP) and has poor robustness. In general, under the conditions of the hyperparameters, SVM and RF exhibit optimal classification performance, while CART has relatively inferior performance. Meanwhile, SVM, RF, and CART have different sensitivities toward the algorithm parameters; that is, SVM and CART are more sensitive to the algorithm parameters, while RF has low sensitivity toward changes in the algorithm parameters. The different parameters cause great changes in the accuracy scores and residuals, so it is necessary to determine the algorithm hyperparameters. Generally, default parameters can be used to achieve crop classification, but we recommend the enumeration method, similar to grid search, as a practical way to improve the classification performance of the algorithm if the best classification effect is expected.

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are increasingly being used in search and rescue (SAR) operations to assist in the discovery of missing persons. UAS are useful to first responders in SAR operations due to rapid deployment, high data volume, and high spatial resolution data collection capabilities. Relying on traditional manual interpretation methods to find a missing person in imagery data sets containing several hundred images is both challenging and time consuming. To better find small signs of missing persons in large UAS datasets, computer assisted interpretation methods have been developed. This article presents the results of an initial evaluation of a computer assisted interpretation method tested against manual methods in a simulated SAR operation. The evaluation performed focused on using resources available to first responders performing SAR operations, specifically: RGB data, volunteers, and a commercially available software program. Results from this field test were mixed, as the traditional group discovered more objects but required more time, in man hours, to discover the objects. Further field experiments, based on the capabilities of current first responder groups, should be conducted to determine to what extent computer assisted methods are useful in SAR operations.

AB  - Detecting individual trees and quantifying their biomass is crucial for carbon accounting procedures at the stand, landscape, and national levels. A significant challenge for many organizations is the amount of effort necessary to document carbon storage levels, especially in terms of human labor. To advance towards the goal of efficiently assessing the carbon content of forest, we evaluate methods to detect trees from high-resolution images taken from unoccupied aerial systems (UAS). In the process, we introduce the Digital Elevated Vegetation Model (DEVM), a representation that combines multispectral images, digital surface models, and digital terrain models. We show that the DEVM facilitates the development of refined synthetic data to detect individual trees using deep learning-based approaches. We carried out experiments in two tree fields located in different countries. Simultaneously, we perform comparisons among an array of classical and deep learning-based methods highlighting the precision and reliability of the DEVM.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter for vegetation monitoring and land surface ecosystem research. Although a variety of LAI products have been generated, the moderate to coarse spatial resolution and low temporal resolution of these products are insufficient for regional-scale analysis. In this study, a modified ensemble Kalman filter model (MEnKF) was proposed to generate spatio-temporal complete 30 m LAI data. High-quality, filtered historical Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI data were used to obtain the LAI background, and an LAI temporal dynamic model was constructed based on it. An improved back-propagation (BP) neural network based on a simulated annealing algorithm (SA-BP) was constructed with paired Landsat surface reflectance data and field LAI data to generate a 30 m LAI. The MEnKF was used to estimate the spatio-temporal complete LAI beginning from the LAI peak value position where Landsat observations were available. The spatio-temporal 30 m LAI was estimated in farmland (Pshenichne), grassland (Zhangbei), and woodland (Genhe) sites. The results indicate that the MEnKF-estimated LAI is consistent with the field measurements for all sites (the coefficient of determination (     R 2     ) = 0.70; root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.40) and is better than that of the conventional sequence data assimilation algorithm (     R 2      = 0.40; RMSE = 0.78). The regional LAI captures the vegetation growth pattern and is consistent with the Landsat LAI, with an      R 2      larger than 0.65 and an RMSE less than 0.51. The proposed MEnKF algorithm, which effectively avoids error accumulation in the data assimilation scheme, is an efficient method for spatio-temporal complete 30 m LAI estimation.

AB  - Reliable information about wildlife is absolutely important for making informed management decisions. The issues with the effectiveness of the control and monitoring of both large and small wild animals are relevant to assess and protect the world&rsquo;s biodiversity. Monitoring becomes part of the methods in wildlife ecology for observation, assessment, and forecasting of the human environment. World practice reveals the potential of the joint application of both proven traditional and modern technologies using specialized equipment to organize environmental control and management processes. Monitoring large terrestrial animals require an individual approach due to their low density and larger habitat. Elk/moose are such animals. This work aims to evaluate the methods for monitoring large wild animals, suitable for controlling the number of elk/moose in the framework of nature conservation activities. Using different models allows determining the population size without affecting the animals and without significant financial costs. Although, the accuracy of each model is determined by its postulates implementation and initial conditions that need statistical data. Depending on the geographical, climatic, and economic conditions in each territory, it is possible to use different tools and equipment (e.g., cameras, GPS sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles), a flexible variation of which will allow reaching the golden mean between the desires and capabilities of researchers.

AB  - Urban sprawl related increase of built-in areas requires reliable monitoring methods and remote sensing can be an efficient technique. Aerial surveys, with high spatial resolution, provide detailed data for building monitoring, but archive images usually have only visible bands. We aimed to reveal the efficiency of visible orthophotographs and photogrammetric dense point clouds in building detection with segmentation-based machine learning (with five algorithms) using visible bands, texture information, and spectral and morphometric indices in different variable sets. Usually random forest (RF) had the best (99.8%) and partial least squares the worst overall accuracy (~60%). We found that &gt;95% accuracy can be gained even in class level. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was an efficient variable selection tool, its result with six variables was like when we applied all the available 31 variables. Morphometric indices had 82% producer&rsquo;s and 85% user&rsquo;s Accuracy (PA and UA, respectively) and combining them with spectral and texture indices, it had the largest contribution in the improvement. However, morphometric indices are not always available but by adding texture and spectral indices to red-green-blue (RGB) bands the PA improved with 12% and the UA with 6%. Building extraction from visual aerial surveys can be accurate, and archive images can be involved in the time series of a monitoring.

T2  - Remote Sensing

VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Traditional methods for individual tree-crown (ITC) detection (image classification, segmentation, template matching, etc.) applied to very high-resolution remote sensing imagery have been shown to struggle in disparate landscape types or image resolutions due to scale problems and information complexity. Deep learning promised to overcome these shortcomings due to its superior performance and versatility, proven with reported detection rates of ~90%. However, such models still find their limits in transferability across study areas, because of different tree conditions (e.g., isolated trees vs. compact forests) and/or resolutions of the input data. This study introduces a highly replicable deep learning ensemble design for ITC detection and species classification based on the established single shot detector (SSD) model. The ensemble model design is based on varying the input data for the SSD models, coupled with a voting strategy for the output predictions. Very high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), aerial remote sensing imagery and elevation data are used in different combinations to test the performance of the ensemble models in three study sites with highly contrasting spatial patterns. The results show that ensemble models perform better than any single SSD model, regardless of the local tree conditions or image resolution. The detection performance and the accuracy rates improved by 3&ndash;18% with only as few as two participant single models, regardless of the study site. However, when more than two models were included, the performance of the ensemble models only improved slightly and even dropped.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 11

SN  - 1999-4907

AB  - Background and Objectives: Increased frequency and intensity of drought events are predicted to occur throughout the world because of climate change. These extreme climate events result in higher tree mortality and fraction of dead woody components, phenomena that are currently being reported worldwide as critical indicators of the impacts of climate change on forest diversity and function. In this paper, we assess the accuracy and processing times of ten machine learning (ML) techniques, applied to multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data to detect dead canopy woody components. Materials and Methods: This work was conducted on five secondary dry forest plots located at the Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super Site, Costa Rica. Results: The coverage of dead woody components at the selected secondary dry forest plots was estimated to range from 4.8% to 16.1%, with no differences between the successional stages. Of the ten ML techniques, the support vector machine with radial kernel (SVMR) and random forests (RF) provided the highest accuracies (0.982 vs. 0.98, respectively). Of these two ML algorithms, the processing time of SVMR was longer than the processing time of RF (8735.64 s vs. 989 s). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to detect and quantify dead woody components, such as dead stands and fallen trees, using a combination of high-resolution UAV data and ML algorithms. Using this technology, accuracy values higher than 95% were achieved. However, it is important to account for a series of factors, such as the optimization of the tuning parameters of the ML algorithms, the environmental conditions and the time of the UAV data acquisition.

AB  - This paper combines interval type-2 fuzzy logic with adaptive control theory for the control of a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) helicopter. This strategy yields robustness to various kinds of uncertainties and guaranteed stability of the closed-loop control system. Thus, precise trajectory tracking is maintained under various operational conditions with the presence of various types of uncertainties. Unlike other controllers, the proposed controller approximates the helicopter&rsquo;s inverse dynamic model and assumes no a priori knowledge of the helicopter&rsquo;s dynamics or parameters. The proposed controller is applied to a 3-DOF helicopter model and compared against three other controllers, i.e., PID control, adaptive control, and adaptive sliding-mode control. Numerical results show its high performance and robustness under the presence of uncertainties. To better assess the performance of the control system, two quantitative tracking performance metrics are introduced, i.e., the integral of the tracking errors and the integral of the control signals. Comparative numerical results reveal the superiority of the proposed method by achieving the highest tracking accuracy with the lowest control effort.

SN  - 2073-4395

AB  - Soybean plant density is an important factor of successful agricultural production. Due to the high number of plants per unit area, early plant overlapping and eventual plant loss, the estimation of soybean plant density in the later stages of development should enable the determination of the final plant number and reflect the state of the harvest. In order to assess soybean plant density in a digital, nondestructive, and less intense way, analysis was performed on RGB images (containing three channels: RED, GREEN, and BLUE) taken with a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) on 66 experimental plots in 2018, and 200 experimental plots in 2019. Mean values of the R, G, and B channels were extracted for each plot, then vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated and used as predictors for the machine learning model (MLM). The model was calibrated in 2018 and validated in 2019. For validation purposes, the predicted values for the 200 experimental plots were compared with the real number of plants per unit area (m2). Model validation resulted in the correlation coefficient&mdash;R = 0.87, mean absolute error (MAE) = 6.24, and root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.47. The results of the research indicate the possibility of using the MLM, based on simple values of VIs, for the prediction of plant density in agriculture without using human labor.

AB  - Modern means of transport increasingly utilize sandwich constructions. Among other things, the reasons for such state of affairs include the reduced weight of means of transport, and through this, better fuel economy as well as price. This work is dedicated to a systematic experimental study of the influence of various materials and sandwich designs on their mechanical properties. In the framework of experiments, sandwich-structured composites were exposed to two types of stressing: static as well as impact stressing. The testing of prepared samples was performed according to ASTM C-393 Standard, dealing specifically with the bending behavior of sandwich composite constructions and impact testing under the scope of ISO 6603-2 Standard test. In this article we deal with static and impact testing of the eight types of core materials, two types of coatings, two types of surface finishes, and two types of resins with a special emphasis on their use in constructions of some exterior or interior components of transport means.

AB  - Auxetic structures have attracted attention in energy absorption applications owing to their improved shear modulus and enhanced resistance to indentation. On the other hand, four-dimensional (4D) printing is an emerging technology that is capable of 3D printing smart materials with additional functionality. This paper introduces the development of a NiTi negative-Poisson&rsquo;s-ratio structure with superelasticity/shape memory capabilities for improved ballistic applications. An analytical model was initially used to optimize the geometrical parameters of a re-entrant auxetic structure. It was found that the re-entrant auxetic structure with a cell angle of &minus;30&deg; produced the highest Poisson&rsquo;s ratio of &minus;2.089. The 4D printing process using a powder bed fusion system was used to fabricate the optimized NiTi auxetic structure. The measured negative Poisson&rsquo;s ratio of the fabricated auxetic structure was found in agreement with both the analytical model and the finite element simulation. A finite element model was developed to simulate the dynamic response of the optimized auxetic NiTi structure subjected to different projectile speeds. Three stages of the impact process describing the penetration of the top plate, auxetic structure, and bottom plate have been identified. The results show that the optimized auxetic structures affect the dynamic response of the projectile by getting denser toward the impact location. This helped to improve the energy absorbed per unit mass of the NiTi auxetic structure to about two times higher than that of the solid NiTi plate and five times higher than that of the solid conventional steel plate.

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Crop productivity is readily reduced by competition from weeds. It is particularly important to control weeds early to prevent yield losses. Limited herbicide choices and increasing costs of weed management are threatening the profitability of crops. Smart agriculture can use intelligent technology to accurately measure the distribution of weeds in the field and perform weed control tasks in selected areas, which cannot only improve the effectiveness of pesticides, but also increase the economic benefits of agricultural products. The most important thing for an automatic system to remove weeds within crop rows is to utilize reliable sensing technology to achieve accurate differentiation of weeds and crops at specific locations in the field. In recent years, there have been many significant achievements involving the differentiation of crops and weeds. These studies are related to the development of rapid and non-destructive sensors, as well as the analysis methods for the data obtained. This paper presents a review of the use of three sensing methods including spectroscopy, color imaging, and hyperspectral imaging in the discrimination of crops and weeds. Several algorithms of machine learning have been employed for data analysis such as convolutional neural network (CNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). Successful applications include the weed detection in grain crops (such as maize, wheat, and soybean), vegetable crops (such as tomato, lettuce, and radish), and fiber crops (such as cotton) with unsupervised or supervised learning. This review gives a brief introduction into proposed sensing and machine learning methods, then provides an overview of instructive examples of these techniques for weed/crop discrimination. The discussion describes the recent progress made in the development of automated technology for accurate plant identification as well as the challenges and future prospects. It is believed that this review is of great significance to those who study automatic plant care in crops using intelligent technology.

AB  - Bearing in mind that dwellings generate a high environmental impact, the aim of this research is to improve their energy efficiency. The incorporation of an insulating layer in the extrados of the building envelope is the most effective way of reducing the transmittance of a facade, eliminating thermal bridges, and optimizing its energy consumption. There is no doubt about the effectiveness of this solution in terms of thermal protection. However, this process collides with the preservation of the original composition of buildings with ornate facades. This article presents a protocol for the rehabilitation of ornate facades of historic buildings through the application of an insulating layer on the outside of the walls. The protocol shows that advanced techniques applied with an integrated approach permit compatibility between energy rehabilitation and the preservation of the original value. In addition to applying strategies of a high technological level, the protocol proposes a reflection upon a balanced intervention on ornamental elements, as well as the relationship between the degree of energy improvement of an ornate facade, and the degree of preservation of the original composition. A methodology is established that combines different avant-guard techniques and systems. These include capturing reality in 3D, the Building Information Model (BIM), monitoring, advanced manufacturing, and active and passive solution simulations.

AB  - A drone be able to fly without colliding to preserve the surroundings and its own safety. In addition, it must also incorporate numerous features of interest for drone users. In this paper, an aerial mixed-reality environment for first-person-view drone flying is proposed to provide an immersive experience and a safe environment for drone users by creating additional virtual obstacles when flying a drone in an open area. The proposed system is effective in perceiving the depth of obstacles, and enables bidirectional interaction between real and virtual worlds using a drone equipped with a stereo camera based on human binocular vision. In addition, it synchronizes the parameters of the real and virtual cameras to effectively and naturally create virtual objects in a real space. Based on user studies that included both general and expert users, we confirm that the proposed system successfully creates a mixed-reality environment using a flying drone by quickly recognizing real objects and stably combining them with virtual objects.

SN  - 2223-7747

AB  - Grape downy mildew is a devastating disease worldwide and new molecular phenotyping tools are required to detect metabolic changes associated to plant disease symptoms. In this purpose, we used UPLC-DAD-MS-based semi-targeted metabolomics to screen downy mildew symptomatic leaves that expressed oil spots (6 dpi, days post-infection) and necrotic lesions (15 dpi) under natural infections in the field. Leaf extract analyses enabled the identification of 47 metabolites belonging to the primary metabolism including 6 amino acids and 1 organic acid, as well as an important diversity of specialized metabolites including 9 flavonols, 11 flavan-3-ols, 3 phenolic acids, and stilbenoids with various degree of polymerization (DP) including 4 stilbenoids DP1, 8 stilbenoids DP2, and 4 stilbenoids DP3. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied as unsupervised multivariate statistical analysis method to reveal metabolic variables that were affected by the infection status. Univariate and multivariate statistics revealed 33 and 27 metabolites as relevant infection biomarkers at 6 and 15 dpi, respectively. Correlation-based networks highlighted a general decrease of flavonoid-related metabolites, whereas stilbenoid DP1 and DP2 concentrations increased upon downy mildew infection. Stilbenoids DP3 were identified only in necrotic lesions representing late biomarkers of downy mildew infection.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper formulates a new problem for the optimal placement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) geared towards wireless coverage provision for Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) service to a set of ground users confined in an open area. Our objective function is constrained by coverage and by VoIP speech quality and minimizes the ratio between the number of UAVs deployed and energy efficiency in UAVs, hence providing the layout that requires fewer UAVs per hour of service. Solutions provide the number and position of UAVs to be deployed, and are found using well-known heuristic search methods such as genetic algorithms (used for the initial deployment of UAVs), or particle swarm optimization (used for the periodical update of the positions). We examine two communication services: (a) one bidirectional VoWiFi channel per user; (b) single broadcast VoWiFi channel for announcements. For these services, we study the results obtained for an increasing number of users confined in a small area of 100 m2 as well as in a large area of 10,000 m2. Results show that the drone turnover rate is related to both users&rsquo; sparsity and the number of users served by each UAV. For the unicast service, the ratio of UAVs per hour of service tends to increase with user sparsity and the power of radio communication represents 14&ndash;16% of the total UAV energy consumption depending on ground user density. In large areas, solutions tend to locate UAVs at higher altitudes seeking increased coverage, which increases energy consumption due to hovering. However, in the VoWiFi broadcast communication service, the traffic is scarce, and solutions are mostly constrained only by coverage. This results in fewer UAVs deployed, less total power consumption (between 20% and 75%), and less sensitivity to the number of served users.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Fire is one of the primary sources of damages to natural environments globally. Estimates show that approximately 4 million km2 of land burns yearly. Studies have shown that such estimates often underestimate the real extent of burnt land, which highlights the need to find better, state-of-the-art methods to detect and classify these areas. This study aimed to analyze the use of deep convolutional Autoencoders in the classification of burnt areas, considering different sample patch sizes. A simple Autoencoder and the U-Net and ResUnet architectures were evaluated. We collected Landsat 8 OLI+ data from three scenes in four consecutive dates to detect the changes specifically in the form of burnt land. The data were sampled according to four different sampling strategies to evaluate possible performance changes related to sampling window sizes. The training stage used two scenes, while the validation stage used the remaining scene. The ground truth change mask was created using the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) spectral index through a thresholding approach. The classifications were evaluated according to the F1 index, Kappa index, and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) value. Results have shown that the U-Net and ResUnet architectures offered the best classifications with average F1, Kappa, and mIoU values of approximately 0.96, representing excellent classification results. We have also verified that a sampling window size of 256 by 256 pixels offered the best results.

SN  - 2077-0472

AB  - Soybean yield estimation is either based on yield monitors or agro-meteorological and satellite imagery data, but they present several limiting factors regarding on-farm decision level. Aware that machine learning approaches have been largely applied to estimate soybean yield and the availability of data regarding soybean yield and its components (number of grains (NG) and thousand grains weight (TGW)), there is an opportunity to study their relationships. The objective was to explore the relationships between soybean yield and its components, generate equations to estimate yield and evaluate its prediction accuracy. The training dataset was composed of soybean yield and its components&rsquo; data from 2010 to 2019. Linear regression models based on NG, TGW and yield were fitted on the training dataset and applied to a validation dataset composed of 58 on-field collected samples. It was found that globally TGW and NG presented weak (r = 0.50) and strong (r = 0.92) linear relationships with yield, respectively. In addition to that, applying the fitted models to the validation dataset, model based on NG presented the highest accuracy, coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.70, mean absolute error (MAE) of 639.99 kg ha&minus;1 and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 726.67 kg ha&minus;1.

However, their advantages and disadvantages have not been systematically summarized and evaluated. Here, we reviewed the state-of-the-art of non-destructive optical methods for monitoring the N status of crops, and summarized their advantages and disadvantages. We mainly focused on the contribution of spectral and machine vision technology to the accurate diagnosis of crop N status from three aspects: system selection, data processing, and estimation methods. Finally, we discussed the opportunities and challenges of the application of these technologies, followed by recommendations for future work to address the challenges.

TI  - A Subject-Sensitive Perceptual Hash Based on MUM-Net for the Integrity Authentication of High Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information

PY  - 2020
VL  - 9
IS  - 8
SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Data security technology is of great significance to the application of high resolution remote sensing image (HRRS) images. As an important data security technology, perceptual hash overcomes the shortcomings of cryptographic hashing that is not robust and can achieve integrity authentication of HRRS images based on perceptual content. However, the existing perceptual hash does not take into account whether the user focuses on certain types of information of the HRRS image. In this paper, we introduce the concept of subject-sensitive perceptual hash, which can be seen as a special case of conventional perceptual hash, for the integrity authentication of HRRS image. To achieve subject-sensitive perceptual hash, we propose a new deep convolutional neural network architecture, named MUM-Net, for extracting robust features of HRRS images. MUM-Net is the core of perceptual hash algorithm, and it uses focal loss as the loss function to overcome the imbalance between the positive and negative samples in the training samples. The robust features extracted by MUM-Net are further compressed and encoded to obtain the perceptual hash sequence of HRRS image. Experiments show that our algorithm has higher tamper sensitivity to subject-related malicious tampering, and the robustness is improved by about 10% compared to the existing U-net-based algorithm; compared to other deep learning-based algorithms, this algorithm achieves a better balance between robustness and tampering sensitivity, and has better overall performance.

TI  - Quantifying Marine Macro Litter Abundance on a Sandy Beach Using Unmanned Aerial Systems and Object-Oriented Machine Learning Methods
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 16
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have recently been proven to be valuable remote sensing tools for detecting marine macro litter (MML), with the potential of supporting pollution monitoring programs on coasts. Very low altitude images, acquired with a low-cost RGB camera onboard a UAS on a sandy beach, were used to characterize the abundance of stranded macro litter. We developed an object-oriented classification strategy for automatically identifying the marine macro litter items on a UAS-based orthomosaic. A comparison is presented among three automated object-oriented machine learning (OOML) techniques, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). Overall, the detection was satisfactory for the three techniques, with mean F-scores of 65% for KNN, 68% for SVM, and 72% for RF. A comparison with manual detection showed that the RF technique was the most accurate OOML macro litter detector, as it returned the best overall detection quality (F-score) with the lowest number of false positives. Because the number of tuning parameters varied among the three automated machine learning techniques and considering that the three generated abundance maps correlated similarly with the abundance map produced manually, the simplest KNN classifier was preferred to the more complex RF. This work contributes to advances in remote sensing marine litter surveys on coasts, optimizing the automated detection on UAS-derived orthomosaics. MML abundance maps, produced by UAS surveys, assist coastal managers and authorities through environmental pollution monitoring programs. In addition, they contribute to search and evaluation of the mitigation measures and improve clean-up operations on coastal environments.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Hyperspectral remote-sensing instruments on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aircraft and satellites offer new opportunities for sea ice observations. We present the first study using airborne hyperspectral imagery of Arctic sea ice and evaluate two atmospheric correction approaches (ATCOR-4 (Atmospheric and Topographic Correction version 4; v7.0.0) and empirical line calibration). We apply an existing, field data-based model to derive the depth of melt ponds, to airborne hyperspectral AisaEAGLE imagery and validate results with in situ measurements. ATCOR-4 results roughly match the shape of field spectra but overestimate reflectance resulting in high root-mean-square error (RMSE) (between 0.08 and 0.16). Noisy reflectance spectra may be attributed to the low flight altitude of 200 ft and Arctic atmospheric conditions. Empirical line calibration resulted in smooth, accurate spectra (RMSE &lt; 0.05) that enabled the assessment of melt pond bathymetry. Measured and modeled pond bathymetry are highly correlated (r = 0.86) and accurate (RMSE = 4.04 cm), and the model explains a large portion of the variability (R2 = 0.74). We conclude that an accurate assessment of melt pond bathymetry using airborne hyperspectral data is possible subject to accurate atmospheric correction. Furthermore, we see the necessity to improve existing approaches with Arctic-specific atmospheric profiles and aerosol models and/or by using multiple reference targets on the ground.

AB  - Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have been proven cost- and time-effective remote-sensing platforms for precision agriculture applications. This study presents a method for automatic delineation of field areas and boundaries that uses UAS multispectral orthomosaics acquired over 7 vegetated fields having a variety of crops in Prince Edward Island (PEI). This information is needed by crop insurance agencies and growers for an accurate determination of crop insurance premiums. The field areas and boundaries were delineated by applying both a pixel-based and an object-based supervised random forest (RF) classifier applied to reflectance and vegetation index images, followed by a vectorization pipeline. Both methodologies performed exceptionally well, resulting in a mean area goodness of fit (AGoF) for the field areas greater than 98% and a mean boundary mean positional error (BMPE) lower than 0.8 m for the seven surveyed fields.

AB  - The Białowieża Forest (BF), a unique ecosystem of historical significance in central Europe, has a long history of assumed human settlement, with at least 200 known archaeological sites (until 2016). This study uncovers new evidence of the cultural heritage of this unique forest area using Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) technology combined with traditional archaeological field assessment methods to verify the ALS data interpretations and to provide additional evidence about the function and origin of the newly detected archaeological sites. The results of this study include (1) a scientific approach for an improved identification of archaeological resources in forest areas; (2) new evidence about the history of the human use of the BF based on ALS data, covering the entire Polish part of the BF; and (3) an improved remote sensing infrastructure, supporting existing GIS (Geographic Information System) systems for the BF, a famous UNESCO Heritage site. Our study identified numerous locations with evidence of past human agricultural activities known in the literature as &ldquo;field systems&rdquo;, &ldquo;lynchets&rdquo; and &ldquo;Celtic fields&rdquo;. The initial identification included more than 300 km of possible field boundaries and plough headlands, many of which we have verified on the ground. Various past human activities creating those boundaries have existed since the (pre-) Roman Period up to the 13th century AD. The results of this study demonstrate that past human activities in the Polish part of the Białowieża Forest had been more prevalent than previously believed. As a practical result of the described activities, a geodatabase was created; this has practical applications for the system of monument protection in Poland, as well as for local communities and the BF&rsquo;s management and conservation. The more widely achieved results are in line with the implementation of the concept of a cultural heritage inventory in forested and protected areas&mdash;the actions taken specify (built globally) the forms of protection and management of cultural and environmental goods.

AB  - Formation control and cooperative motion planning are two major research areas currently being used in multi robot motion planning and coordination. The current study proposes a hybrid framework for guidance and navigation of swarm of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) by combining the key characteristics of formation control and cooperative motion planning. In this framework, two layers of offline planning and online planning are integrated and applied on a practical marine environment. In offline planning, an optimal path is generated from a constrained A* path planning approach, which is later smoothed using a spline. This optimal trajectory is fed as an input for the online planning where virtual target (VT) based multi-agent guidance framework is used to navigate the swarm of USVs. This VT approach combined with a potential theory based swarm aggregation technique provides a robust methodology of global and local collision avoidance based on known positions of the USVs. The combined approach is evaluated with the different number of USVs to understand the effectiveness of the approach from the perspective of practicality, safety and robustness.

These innovations have made feasible close-range and high-resolution remote sensing for numerous archaeological applications, including documentation, prospection, and monitoring bridging the gap between satellite, high-altitude airborne, and terrestrial sensing of historical sites and landscapes. In this article, we track the progress made so far, by systematically reviewing the literature relevant to the combined use of UAS platforms with visible, infrared, multi-spectral, hyper-spectral, laser, and radar sensors to reveal archaeological features otherwise invisible to archaeologists with applied non-destructive techniques. We review, specific applications and their global distribution, as well as commonly used platforms, sensors, and data-processing workflows. Furthermore, we identify the contemporary state-of-the-art and discuss the challenges that have already been overcome, and those that have not, to propose suggestions for future research.

AB  - With the development of artificial intelligence and big data analytics, an increasing number of researchers have tried to use deep-learning technology to train neural networks and achieved great success in the field of vehicle detection. However, as a special domain of object detection, vehicle detection in aerial images still has made limited progress because of low resolution, complex backgrounds and rotating objects. In this paper, an improved feature-balanced pyramid network (FBPN) has been proposed to enhance the network&rsquo;s ability to detect small objects. By combining FBPN with modified faster region convolutional neural network (faster-RCNN), a vehicle detection framework for aerial images is proposed. The focal loss function is adopted in the proposed framework to reduce the imbalance between easy and hard samples. The experimental results based on the VEDIA, USCAS-AOD, and DOTA datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art vehicle detection algorithms for aerial images.

AB  - In this study, we present a framework for seagrass habitat mapping in shallow (5&ndash;50 m) and very shallow water (0&ndash;5 m) by combining acoustic, optical data and Object-based Image classification. The combination of satellite multispectral images-acquired from 2017 to 2019, together with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photomosaic maps, high-resolution multibeam bathymetry/backscatter and underwater photogrammetry data, provided insights on the short-term characterization and distribution of Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, 1813 meadows in the Calabrian Tyrrhenian Sea. We used a supervised Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) processing and classification technique to create a high-resolution thematic distribution map of P. oceanica meadows from multibeam bathymetry, backscatter data, drone photogrammetry and multispectral images that can be used as a model for classification of marine and coastal areas. As a part of this work, within the SIC CARLIT project, a field application was carried out in a Site of Community Importance (SCI) on Cirella Island in Calabria (Italy); different multiscale mapping techniques have been performed and integrated: the optical and acoustic data were processed and classified by different OBIA algorithms, i.e., k-Nearest Neighbors&rsquo; algorithm (k-NN), Random Tree algorithm (RT) and Decision Tree algorithm (DT). These acoustic and optical data combinations were shown to be a reliable tool to obtain high-resolution thematic maps for the preliminary characterization of seagrass habitats. These thematic maps can be used for time-lapse comparisons aimed to quantify changes in seabed coverage, such as those caused by anthropogenic impacts (e.g., trawl fishing activities and boat anchoring) to assess the blue carbon sinks and might be useful for future seagrass habitats conservation strategies.

AB  - Tomato crops are susceptible to multiple diseases, several of which may be present during the same season. Therefore, rapid disease identification could enhance crop management consequently increasing the yield. In this study, nondestructive methods were developed to detect diseases that affect tomato crops, such as bacterial spot (BS), target spot (TS), and tomato yellow leaf curl (TYLC) for two varieties of tomato (susceptible and tolerant to TYLC only) by using hyperspectral sensing in two conditions: a) laboratory (benchtop scanning), and b) in field using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-based). The stepwise discriminant analysis (STDA) and the radial basis function were applied to classify the infected plants and distinguish them from noninfected or healthy (H) plants. Multiple vegetation indices (VIs) and the M statistic method were utilized to distinguish and classify the diseased plants. In general, the classification results between healthy and diseased plants were highly accurate for all diseases; for instance, when comparing H vs. BS, TS, and TYLC in the asymptomatic stage and laboratory conditions, the classification rates were 94%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. Similarly, in the symptomatic stage, the classification rates between healthy and infected plants were 98% for BS, and 99&ndash;100% for TS and TYLC diseases. The classification results in the field conditions also showed high values of 98%, 96%, and 100%, for BS, TS, and TYLC, respectively. The VIs that could best identify these diseases were the renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), and the modified triangular vegetation index 1 (MTVI 1) in both laboratory and field. The results were promising and suggest the possibility to identify these diseases using remote sensing.

AB  - Elephant herding optimization (EHO) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on the herding behavior of elephants. EHO uses a clan operator to update the distance of the elephants in each clan with respect to the position of a matriarch elephant. The superiority of the EHO method to several state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms has been demonstrated for many benchmark problems and in various application areas. A comprehensive review for the EHO-based algorithms and their applications are presented in this paper. Various aspects of the EHO variants for continuous optimization, combinatorial optimization, constrained optimization, and multi-objective optimization are reviewed. Future directions for research in the area of EHO are further discussed.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In the headwater catchments of the Rocky Mountains, plant productivity and its dynamics are largely dependent upon water availability, which is influenced by changing snowmelt dynamics associated with climate change. Understanding and quantifying the interactions between snow, plants and soil moisture is challenging, since these interactions are highly heterogeneous in mountainous terrain, particularly as they are influenced by microtopography within a hillslope. Recent advances in satellite remote sensing have created an opportunity for monitoring snow and plant dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolutions that can capture microtopographic effects. In this study, we investigate the relationships among topography, snowmelt, soil moisture and plant dynamics in the East River watershed, Crested Butte, Colorado, based on a time series of 3-meter resolution PlanetScope normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. To make use of a large volume of high-resolution time-lapse images (17 images total), we use unsupervised machine learning methods to reduce the dimensionality of the time lapse images by identifying spatial zones that have characteristic NDVI time series. We hypothesize that each zone represents a set of similar snowmelt and plant dynamics that differ from other identified zones and that these zones are associated with key topographic features, plant species and soil moisture. We compare different distance measures (Ward and complete linkage) to understand the effects of their influence on the zonation map. Results show that the identified zones are associated with particular microtopographic features; highly productive zones are associated with low slopes and high topographic wetness index, in contrast with zones of low productivity, which are associated with high slopes and low topographic wetness index. The zones also correspond to particular plant species distributions; higher forb coverage is associated with zones characterized by higher peak productivity combined with rapid senescence in low moisture conditions, while higher sagebrush coverage is associated with low productivity and similar senescence patterns between high and low moisture conditions. In addition, soil moisture probe and sensor data confirm that each zone has a unique soil moisture distribution. This cluster-based analysis can tractably analyze high-resolution time-lapse images to examine plant-soil-snow interactions, guide sampling and sensor placements and identify areas likely vulnerable to ecological change in the future.

AB  - Ore processing is a source of soil heavy metal pollution. Vegetation traits (structural characteristics such as spatial cover and repartition; biochemical parameters&mdash;pigment and water contents, growth rate, phenological cycle&hellip;) and plant species identity are indirect and powerful indicators of residual contamination detection in soil. Multi-temporal multispectral satellite imagery, such as the Sentinel-2 time series, is an operational environment monitoring system widely used to access vegetation traits and ensure vegetation surveillance across large areas. For this purpose, methodology based on a multi-temporal fusion method at the feature level is applied to vegetation monitoring for several years from the closure and revegetation of an ore processing site. Features are defined by 26 spectral indices from the literature and seasonal and annual change detection maps are inferred. Three indices&mdash;CIred-edge (CIREDEDGE), IRECI (Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index) and PSRI (Plant Senescence Reflectance Index)&mdash;are particularly suitable for detecting changes spatially and temporally across the study area. The analysis is conducted separately for phyto-stabilized vegetation zones and natural vegetation zones. Global and specific changes are emphasized and explained by information provided by the site operator or meteorological conditions.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Remote sensing of plant phenology as an indicator of climate change and for mapping land cover has received significant scientific interest in the past two decades. The advancing of spring events, the lengthening of the growing season, the shifting of tree lines, the decreasing sensitivity to warming and the uniformity of spring across elevations are a few of the important indicators of trends in phenology. The Sentinel-2 satellite sensors launched in June 2015 (A) and March 2017 (B), with their high temporal frequency and spatial resolution for improved land mapping missions, have contributed significantly to knowledge on vegetation over the last three years. However, despite the additional red-edge and short wave infra-red (SWIR) bands available on the Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments, with improved vegetation species detection capabilities, there has been very little research on their efficacy to track vegetation cover and its phenology. For example, out of approximately every four papers that analyse normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from Sentinel-2 imagery, only one mentions either SWIR or the red-edge bands. Despite the short duration that the Sentinel-2 platforms have been operational, they have proved their potential in a wide range of phenological studies of crops, forests, natural grasslands, and other vegetated areas, and in particular through fusion of the data with those from other sensors, e.g., Sentinel-1, Landsat and MODIS. This review paper discusses the current state of vegetation phenology studies based on the first five years of Sentinel-2, their advantages, limitations, and the scope for future developments.

AB  - While coral reef ecosystems hold immense biological, ecological, and economic value, frequent anthropogenic and environmental disturbances have caused these ecosystems to decline globally. Current coral reef monitoring methods include in situ surveys and analyzing remotely sensed data from satellites. However, in situ methods are often expensive and inconsistent in terms of time and space. High-resolution satellite imagery can also be expensive to acquire and subject to environmental conditions that conceal target features. High-resolution imagery gathered from remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS or drones) is an inexpensive alternative; however, processing drone imagery for analysis is time-consuming and complex. This study presents the first semi-automatic workflow for drone image processing with Google Earth Engine (GEE) and free and open source software (FOSS). With this workflow, we processed 230 drone images of Heron Reef, Australia and classified coral, sand, and rock/dead coral substrates with the Random Forest classifier. Our classification achieved an overall accuracy of 86% and mapped live coral cover with 92% accuracy. The presented methods enable efficient processing of drone imagery of any environment and can be useful when processing drone imagery for calibrating and validating satellite imagery.

AB  - Urban land-use information is important for urban land-resource planning and management. However, current methods using traditional surveys cannot meet the demand for the rapid development of urban land management. There is an urgent need to develop new methods to overcome the shortcomings of conventional methods. To address the issue, this study used the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural network (ANN) models to build machine-leaning methods for urban land-use classification. Taking Hangzhou as an example, these machine-leaning methods could all successfully classify the essential urban land use into 6 Level I classes and 13 Level II classes based on the semantic features extracted from Sentinel-2A images, multi-source features of types of points of interest (POIs), land surface temperature, night lights, and building height. The validation accuracy of the RF model for the Level I and Level II land use was 79.88% and 71.89%, respectively, performing better compared to SVM (78.40% and 68.64%) and ANN models (71.30% and 63.02%). However, the variations of the user accuracy among the methods depended on the urban land-use level. For the Level I land-use classification, the user accuracy was high, except for the transportation land by all methods. In general, the RF and SVM models performed better than the ANN model. For the Level II land-use classification, the user accuracy of different models was quite distinct. With the RF model, the user accuracy of educational and medical land was above 80%. Moreover, with the SVM model, the user accuracy of the business office and educational land classification was above 75%. However, the user accuracy of the ANN model on the Level II land-use classification was poor. Our results showed that the RF model performs best, followed by SVM model, and ANN model was relatively poor in the essential urban land-use classification. The results proved that the use of machine-learning methods can quickly extract land-use types with high accuracy, and provided a better method choice for urban land-use information acquisition.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Sugarcane is a multifunctional crop mainly used for sugar and renewable bioenergy production. Accurate and timely estimation of the sugarcane yield before harvest plays a particularly important role in the management of agroecosystems. The rapid development of remote sensing technologies, especially Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR), significantly enhances aboveground fresh weight (AFW) estimations. In our study, we evaluated the capability of LiDAR mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in estimating the sugarcane AFW in Fusui county, Chongzuo city of Guangxi province, China. We measured the height and the fresh weight of sugarcane plants in 105 sampling plots, and eight variables were extracted from the field-based measurements. Six regression algorithms were used to build the sugarcane AFW model: multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise multiple regression (SMR), generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosted model (GBM), kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS), and random forest regression (RFR). The results demonstrate that RFR (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 1.27 kg m&minus;2) performs better than other models in terms of prediction accuracy. The final fitted sugarcane AFW distribution maps exhibited good agreement with the observed values (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 1.33 kg m&minus;2). Canopy cover, the distance to the road, and tillage methods all have an impact on sugarcane AFW. Our study provides guidance for calculating the optimum planting density, reducing the negative impact of human activities, and selecting suitable tillage methods in actual cultivation and production.

AB  - Detecting small objects and objects with large scale variants are always challenging for deep learning based object detection approaches. Many efforts have been made to solve these problems such as adopting more effective network structures, image features, loss functions, etc. However, for both small objects detection and detecting objects with various scale in single image, the first thing should be solve is the matching mechanism between anchor boxes and ground-truths. In this paper, an approach based on multi-scale balanced sampling(MB-RPN) is proposed for the difficult matching of small objects and detecting multi-scale objects. According to the scale of the anchor boxes, different positive and negative sample IOU discriminate thresholds are adopted to improve the probability of matching the small object area with the anchor boxes so that more small object samples are included in the training process. Moreover, the balanced sampling method is proposed for the collected samples, the samples are further divided and uniform sampling to ensure the diversity of samples in training process. Several datasets are adopted to evaluate the MB-RPN, the experimental results show that compare with the similar approach, MB-RPN improves detection performances effectively.

T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 17
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The extreme form of land degradation caused by the formation of gullies is a major challenge for the sustainability of land resources. This problem is more vulnerable in the arid and semi-arid environment and associated damage to agriculture and allied economic activities. Appropriate modeling of such erosion is therefore needed with optimum accuracy for estimating vulnerable regions and taking appropriate initiatives. The Golestan Dam has faced an acute problem of gully erosion over the last decade and has adversely affected society. Here, the artificial neural network (ANN), general linear model (GLM), maximum entropy (MaxEnt), and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm with 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 60/40, and 50/50 random partitioning of training and validation samples was selected purposively for estimating the gully erosion susceptibility. The main objective of this work was to predict the susceptible zone with the maximum possible accuracy. For this purpose, random partitioning approaches were implemented. For this purpose, 20 gully erosion conditioning factors were considered for predicting the susceptible areas by considering the multi-collinearity test. The variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance (TOL) limit were considered for multi-collinearity assessment for reducing the error of the models and increase the efficiency of the outcome. The ANN with 50/50 random partitioning of the sample is the most optimal model in this analysis. The area under curve (AUC) values of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) in ANN (50/50) for the training and validation data are 0.918 and 0.868, respectively. The importance of the causative factors was estimated with the help of the Jackknife test, which reveals that the most important factor is the topography position index (TPI). Apart from this, the prioritization of all predicted models was estimated taking into account the training and validation data set, which should help future researchers to select models from this perspective. This type of outcome should help planners and local stakeholders to implement appropriate land and water conservation measures.

AB  - With the rapid process of both urban sprawl and urban renewal, large numbers of old buildings have been demolished in China, leading to wide spread construction sites, which could cause severe dust contamination. To alleviate the accompanied dust pollution, green plastic mulch has been widely used by local governments of China. Therefore, timely and accurate mapping of urban green plastic covered regions is of great significance to both urban environmental management and the understanding of urban growth status. However, the complex spatial patterns of the urban landscape make it challenging to accurately identify these areas of green plastic cover. To tackle this issue, we propose a deep semi-supervised learning framework for green plastic cover mapping using very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery. Specifically, a multi-scale deformable convolution neural network (CNN) was exploited to learn representative and discriminative features under complex urban landscapes. Afterwards, a semi-supervised learning strategy was proposed to integrate the limited labeled data and massive unlabeled data for model co-training. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method could accurately identify green plastic-covered regions in Jinan with an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.63%. An ablation study indicated that, compared with supervised learning, the semi-supervised learning strategy in this study could increase the OA by 6.38%. Moreover, the multi-scale deformable CNN outperforms several classic CNN models in the computer vision field. The proposed method is the first attempt to map urban green plastic-covered regions based on deep learning, which could serve as a baseline and useful reference for future research.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - In order to ensure the safety of transmission lines, the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images for automatic object detection has important application prospects, such as the detection of birds&rsquo; nests. The traditional bird&rsquo;s nest detection methods mainly include the study of morphological characteristics of the bird&rsquo;s nest. These methods have poor applicability and low accuracy. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based birds&rsquo; nests automatic detection framework&mdash;region of interest (ROI) mining faster region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN). First, the prior dimensions of anchors are obtained by using k-means clustering to improve the accuracy of coordinate boxes generation. Second, in order to balance the number of foreground and background samples in the training process, the focal loss function is introduced in the region proposal network (RPN) classification stage. Finally, the ROI mining module is added to solve the class imbalance problem in the classification stage, combined with the characteristics of difficult-to-classify bird&rsquo;s nest samples in the UAV images. After parameter optimization and experimental verification, the deep learning-based bird&rsquo;s nest automatic detection framework proposed in this work achieves high detection accuracy. In addition, the mean average precision (mAP) and formula 1 (F1) score of the proposed method are higher than the original faster RCNN and cascade RCNN. Our comparative analysis verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A fusion particle swarm optimization (PSO)&ndash;evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm, which is an improved version of the stochastic optimization strategy PSO, was presented for designing and optimizing controller gains in this study. The mathematical calculations of this study include the reproduction of EP with PSO. By minimizing the integral of the absolute error (IAE) criterion that is used for estimating the system response as a fitness function, the obtained integrated design of the fusion PSO&ndash;EP algorithm generated and updated the new elite parameters for proposed controller schemes. This progression was used for the complicated non-linear systems of the attitude-control pilot models of a tricopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to demonstrate an improvement on the performance in terms of rapid response, precision, reliability, and stability.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The vegetation index (VI) has been successfully used to monitor the growth and to predict the yield of agricultural crops. In this paper, a long-term observation was conducted for the yield prediction of maize using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and estimations of chlorophyll contents using SPAD-502. A new vegetation index termed as modified red blue VI (MRBVI) was developed to monitor the growth and to predict the yields of maize by establishing relationships between MRBVI- and SPAD-502-based chlorophyll contents. The coefficients of determination (R2s) were 0.462 and 0.570 in chlorophyll contents&rsquo; estimations and yield predictions using MRBVI, and the results were relatively better than the results from the seven other commonly used VI approaches. All VIs during the different growth stages of maize were calculated and compared with the measured values of chlorophyll contents directly, and the relative error (RE) of MRBVI is the lowest at 0.355. Further, machine learning (ML) methods such as the backpropagation neural network model (BP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were adopted for predicting the yields of maize. All VIs calculated for each image captured during important phenological stages of maize were set as independent variables and the corresponding yields of each plot were defined as dependent variables. The ML models used the leave one out method (LOO), where the root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 2.157, 1.099, 1.146, and 1.698 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) were 1.739, 0.886, 0.925, and 1.356 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM, respectively. Thus, the SVM method performed better in predicting the yields of maize than the other ML methods. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the MRBVI calculated from images acquired at different growth stages integrated with advanced ML methods should be used for agricultural- and ecological-related chlorophyll estimation and yield predictions.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel method for person detection in aerial images of nonurban terrain gathered by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which plays an important role in Search And Rescue (SAR) missions. The UAV in SAR operations contributes significantly due to the ability to survey a larger geographical area from an aerial viewpoint. Because of the high altitude of recording, the object of interest (person) covers a small part of an image (around 0.1%), which makes this task quite challenging. To address this problem, a multimodel deep learning approach is proposed. The solution consists of two different convolutional neural networks in region proposal, as well as in the classification stage. Additionally, contextual information is used in the classification stage in order to improve the detection results. Experimental results tested on the HERIDAL dataset achieved precision of 68.89% and a recall of 94.65%, which is better than current state-of-the-art methods used for person detection in similar scenarios. Consequently, it may be concluded that this approach is suitable for usage as an auxiliary method in real SAR operations.

Although many sophisticated algorithms have been developed to address the task; crowd management in real time conditions is still a challenging problem being completely solved, particularly in wild and unconstrained conditions. In the proposed paper, we present a detailed review of crowd analysis and management, focusing on state-of-the-art methods for both controlled and unconstrained conditions. The paper illustrates both the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art methods. The methods presented comprise the seminal research works on crowd management, and monitoring and then culminating state-of-the-art methods of the newly introduced deep learning methods. Comparison of the previous methods is presented, with a detailed discussion of the direction for future research work. We believe this review article will contribute to various application domains and will also augment the knowledge of the crowd analysis within the research community.

TI  - Detecting Montane Flowering Phenology with CubeSat Imagery

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Shifts in wildflower phenology in response to climate change are well documented in the scientific literature. The majority of studies have revealed phenological shifts using in-situ observations, some aided by citizen science efforts (e.g., National Phenology Network). Such investigations have been instrumental in quantifying phenological shifts but are challenged by the fact that limited resources often make it difficult to gather observations over large spatial scales and long-time frames. However, recent advances in finer scale satellite imagery may provide new opportunities to detect changes in phenology. These approaches have documented plot level changes in vegetation characteristics and leafing phenology, but it remains unclear whether they can also detect flowering in natural environments. Here, we test whether fine-resolution imagery (&lt;10 m) can detect flowering and whether combining multiple sources of imagery improves the detection process. Examining alpine wildflowers at Mt. Rainier National Park (MORA), we found that high-resolution Random Forest (RF) classification from 3-m resolution PlanetScope (from Planet Labs) imagery was able to delineate the flowering season captured by ground-based phenological surveys with an accuracy of 70% (Cohen&rsquo;s kappa = 0.25). We then combined PlanetScope data with coarser resolution but higher quality imagery from Sentinel and Landsat satellites (10-m Sentinel and 30-m Landsat), resulting in higher accuracy predictions (accuracy = 77%, Cohen&rsquo;s kappa = 0.39). The model was also able to identify the timing of peak flowering in a particularly warm year (2015), despite being calibrated on normal climate years. Our results suggest PlanetScope imagery holds utility in global change ecology where temporal frequency is important. Additionally, we suggest that combining imagery may provide a new approach to cross-calibrate sensors to account for radiometric irregularity inherent in fine resolution PlanetScope imagery. The development of this approach for wildflower phenology predictions provides new possibilities to monitor climate change effects on flowering communities at broader spatiotemporal scales. In protected and tourist areas where the flowering season draws large numbers of visitors, such as Mt. Rainier National Park, the modeling framework presented here could be a useful tool to manage and prioritize park resources.

TI  - Assessment of Earthquake Destructive Power to Structures Based on Machine Learning Methods

PY  - 2020
VL  - 10
IS  - 18
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - This study presents a machine learning-based method for the destructive power assessment of earthquake to structures. First, the analysis procedure of the method is presented, and the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are used as the machine learning algorithms. Second, the optimized BPNN architecture is obtained by discussing the influence of a different number of hidden layers and nodes. Third, the CNN architecture is proposed based on several classical deep learning networks. To build the machine learning models, 50,570 time-history analysis results of a structural system subjected to different ground motions are used as training, validation, and test samples. The results of the BPNN indicate that the features extraction method based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) can well reflect the frequency-/time-domain characteristics of ground motions. The results of the CNN indicate that the CNN exhibits better accuracy (R2 = 0.8737) compared with that of the BPNN (R2 = 0.6784). Furthermore, the CNN model exhibits remarkable computational efficiency, the prediction of 1000 structures based on the CNN model takes 0.762 s, while 507.81 s are required for the conventional time-history analysis (THA)-based simulation. Feature visualization of different layers of the CNN reveals that the shallow to deep layers of the CNN can extract the high to low-frequency features of ground motions. The proposed method can assist in the fast prediction of engineering demand parameters of large-number structures, which facilitates the damage or loss assessments of regional structures for timely emergency response and disaster relief after earthquake.

TI  - Regional Terrain Complexity Assessment Based on Principal Component Analysis and Geographic Information System: A Case of Jiangxi Province, China

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Regional terrain complexity assessment (TCA) is an important theoretical foundation for geological feature identification, hydrological information extraction and land resources utilization. However, the previous TCA models have many disadvantages; for example, comprehensive consideration and redundancy information analysis of terrain factors is lacking, and the terrain complexity index is difficult to quantify. To overcome these drawbacks, a TCA model based on principal component analysis (PCA) and a geographic information system (GIS) is proposed. Taking Jiangxi province of China as an example, firstly, ten terrain factors are extracted using a digital elevation model (DEM) in GIS software. Secondly, PCA is used to analyze the information redundancy of these terrain factors and deal with data compression. Then, the comprehensive evaluation of the compressed terrain factors is conducted to obtain quantitative terrain complexity indexes and a terrain complexity map (TCM). Finally, the TCM produced by the PCA method is compared with those produced by the slope-only, the variation coefficient and K-means clustering models based on the topographic map drawn by the Bureau of Land and Resources of Jiangxi province. Meanwhile, the TCM is also verified by the actual three-dimensional aerial images. Results show that the correlation coefficients between the TCMs produced by the PCA, slope-only, variable coefficient and K-means clustering models and the local topographic map are 0.894, 0.763, 0.816 and 0.788, respectively. It is concluded that the TCM of the PCA method matches well with the actual field terrain features, and the PCA method can reflect the regional terrain complexity characteristics more comprehensively and accurately when compared to the other three methods.

TI  - Scaling Effects on Chlorophyll Content Estimations with RGB Camera Mounted on a UAV Platform Using Machine-Learning Methods

PY  - 2020
VL  - 20

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Timely monitoring and precise estimation of the leaf chlorophyll contents of maize are crucial for agricultural practices. The scale effects are very important as the calculated vegetation index (VI) were crucial for the quantitative remote sensing. In this study, the scale effects were investigated by analyzing the linear relationships between VI calculated from red&ndash;green&ndash;blue (RGB) images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and ground leaf chlorophyll contents of maize measured using SPAD-502. The scale impacts were assessed by applying different flight altitudes and the highest coefficient of determination (R2) can reach 0.85. We found that the VI from images acquired from flight altitude of 50 m was better to estimate the leaf chlorophyll contents using the DJI UAV platform with this specific camera (5472 &times; 3648 pixels). Moreover, three machine-learning (ML) methods including backpropagation neural network (BP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) were applied for the grid-based chlorophyll content estimation based on the common VI. The average values of the root mean square error (RMSE) of chlorophyll content estimations using ML methods were 3.85, 3.11, and 2.90 for BP, SVM, and RF, respectively. Similarly, the mean absolute error (MAE) were 2.947, 2.460, and 2.389, for BP, SVM, and RF, respectively. Thus, the ML methods had relative high precision in chlorophyll content estimations using VI; in particular, the RF performed better than BP and SVM. Our findings suggest that the integrated ML methods with RGB images of this camera acquired at a flight altitude of 50 m (spatial resolution 0.018 m) can be perfectly applied for estimations of leaf chlorophyll content in agriculture.

AB  - Intelligent vehicles for search and rescue, whose mission is assisting emergency personnel by visually exploring an unfamiliar building, require accurate localization. With GPS not available, and approaches relying on new infrastructure installation, artificial landmarks, or pre-constructed dense 3D maps not feasible, the question is whether there is an approach which can combine ubiquitous prior map information with a monocular camera for accurate positioning. Enter FloorVLoc&mdash;Floorplan Vision Vehicle Localization. We provide a means to integrate a monocular camera with a floorplan in a unified and modular fashion so that any monocular visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system can be seamlessly incorporated for global positioning. Using a floorplan is especially beneficial since walls are geometrically stable, the memory footprint is low, and prior map information is kept at a minimum. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis of the visual features associated with the walls shows how drift is corrected. To see this approach in action, we developed two full global positioning systems based on the core methodology introduced, operating in both Monte Carlo Localization and linear optimization frameworks. Experimental evaluation of the systems in simulation and a challenging real-world environment demonstrates that FloorVLoc performs with an average error of 0.06 m across 80 m in real-time.

AB  - Nondestructive and accurate estimating of the forage nitrogen&ndash;phosphorus (N:P) ratio is conducive to the real-time diagnosis of nutrient limitation and the formulation of a management scheme during the growth and development of forage. New-generation high-resolution remote sensors equipped with strategic red-edge wavebands offer opportunities and challenges for estimating and mapping forage N:P ratio in support of the sustainable utilization of alpine grassland resources. This study aims to detect the forage N:P ratio as an ecological indicator of grassland nutrient content by employing Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) data and a random forest (RF) algorithm. The results showed that the estimation accuracy (R2) of the forage N:P ratio model established by combining the optimized spectral bands and vegetation indices (VIs) is 0.49 and 0.59 in the vigorous growth period (July) and the senescing period (November) of forage, respectively. Moreover, Sentinel-2 MSI B9 and B12 bands contributed greatly to the estimation of the forage N:P ratio, and the VIs (RECI2) constructed by B5 and B8A bands performed well in the estimation of the forage N:P ratio. Overall, it is promising to map the spatial distribution of the forage N:P ratio in alpine grassland using Sentinel-2 MSI data at regional scales. This study will be potentially beneficial in implementing precise positioning of vegetation nutrient deficiency and scientific fertilization management of grassland.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important vegetation leaf structure parameter in forest and agricultural ecosystems. Remote sensing techniques can provide an effective alternative to field-based observation of LAI. Differences in canopy structure result in different sensor types (active or passive), platforms (terrestrial, airborne, or satellite), and models being appropriate for the LAI estimation of forest and agricultural systems. This study reviews the application of remote sensing-based approaches across different system configurations (passive, active, and multisource sensors on different collection platforms) that are used to estimate forest and crop LAI and explores uncertainty analysis in LAI estimation. A comparison of the difference in LAI estimation for forest and agricultural applications given the different structure of these ecosystems is presented, particularly as this relates to spatial scale. The ease of use of empirical models supports these as the preferred choice for forest and crop LAI estimation. However, performance variation among different empirical models for forest and crop LAI estimation limits the broad application of specific models. The development of models that facilitate the strategic incorporation of local physiology and biochemistry parameters for specific forests and crop growth stages from various temperature zones could improve the accuracy of LAI estimation models and help develop models that can be applied more broadly. In terms of scale issues, both spectral and spatial scales impact the estimation of LAI. Exploration of the quantitative relationship between scales of data from different sensors could help forest and crop managers more appropriately and effectively apply different data sources. Uncertainty coming from various sources results in reduced accuracy in estimating LAI. While Bayesian approaches have proven effective to quantify LAI estimation uncertainty based on the uncertainty of model inputs, there is still a need to quantify uncertainty from remote sensing data source, ground measurements and related environmental factors to mitigate the impacts of model uncertainty and improve LAI estimation.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Italian ryegrass (Lolium perenne ssp. multiflorum (Lam) Husnot) is a troublesome weed species in wheat (Triticum aestivum) production in the United States, severely affecting grain yields. Spatial mapping of ryegrass infestation in wheat fields and early prediction of its impact on yield can assist management decision making. In this study, unmanned aerial systems (UAS)-based red, green and blue (RGB) imageries acquired at an early wheat growth stage in two different experimental sites were used for developing predictive models. Deep neural networks (DNNs) coupled with an extensive feature selection method were used to detect ryegrass in wheat and estimate ryegrass canopy coverage. Predictive models were developed by regressing early-season ryegrass canopy coverage (%) with end-of-season (at wheat maturity) biomass and seed yield of ryegrass, as well as biomass and grain yield reduction (%) of wheat. Italian ryegrass was detected with high accuracy (precision = 95.44 &plusmn; 4.27%, recall = 95.48 &plusmn; 5.05%, F-score = 95.56 &plusmn; 4.11%) using the best model which included four features: hue, saturation, excess green index, and visible atmospheric resistant index. End-of-season ryegrass biomass was predicted with high accuracy (R2 = 0.87), whereas the other variables had moderate to high accuracy levels (R2 values of 0.74 for ryegrass seed yield, 0.73 for wheat biomass reduction, and 0.69 for wheat grain yield reduction). The methodology demonstrated in the current study shows great potential for mapping and quantifying ryegrass infestation and predicting its competitive response in wheat, allowing for timely management decisions.

TI  - Plant Counting of Cotton from UAS Imagery Using Deep Learning-Based Object Detection Framework

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 18
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Assessing plant population of cotton is important to make replanting decisions in low plant density areas, prone to yielding penalties. Since the measurement of plant population in the field is labor intensive and subject to error, in this study, a new approach of image-based plant counting is proposed, using unmanned aircraft systems (UAS; DJI Mavic 2 Pro, Shenzhen, China) data. The previously developed image-based techniques required a priori information of geometry or statistical characteristics of plant canopy features, while also limiting the versatility of the methods in variable field conditions. In this regard, a deep learning-based plant counting algorithm was proposed to reduce the number of input variables, and to remove requirements for acquiring geometric or statistical information. The object detection model named You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3) and photogrammetry were utilized to separate, locate, and count cotton plants in the seedling stage. The proposed algorithm was tested with four different UAS datasets, containing variability in plant size, overall illumination, and background brightness. Root mean square error (RMSE) and R2 values of the optimal plant count results ranged from 0.50 to 0.60 plants per linear meter of row (number of plants within 1 m distance along the planting row direction) and 0.96 to 0.97, respectively. The object detection algorithm, trained with variable plant size, ground wetness, and lighting conditions generally resulted in a lower detection error, unless an observable difference of developmental stages of cotton existed. The proposed plant counting algorithm performed well with 0&ndash;14 plants per linear meter of row, when cotton plants are generally separable in the seedling stage. This study is expected to provide an automated methodology for in situ evaluation of plant emergence using UAS data.

AB  - This study presents the first accuracy assessment of a low cost small unmanned aerial vehicle (sUAV) in reconstructing three dimensional (3D) models of traffic accidents at extreme operating environments. To date, previous studies have focused on the feasibility of adopting sUAVs in traffic accidents photogrammetry applications as well as the accuracy at normal operating conditions. In this study, 3D models of simulated accident scenes were reconstructed using a low-cost sUAV and cloud-based photogrammetry platform. Several experiments were carried out to evaluate the measurements accuracy at different flight altitudes during high temperature, low light, scattered rain and dusty high wind environments. Quantitative analyses are presented to highlight the precision range of the reconstructed traffic accident 3D model. Reported results range from highly accurate to fairly accurate represented by the root mean squared error (RMSE) range between 0.97 and 4.66 and a mean percentage absolute error (MAPE) between 1.03% and 20.2% at normal and extreme operating conditions, respectively. The findings offer an insight into the robustness and generalizability of UAV-based photogrammetry method for traffic accidents at extreme environments.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - In precision agriculture, the development of proximal imaging systems embedded in autonomous vehicles allows to explore new weed management strategies for site-specific plant application. Accurate monitoring of weeds while controlling wheat growth requires indirect measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground dry matter biomass (BM) at early growth stages. This article explores the potential of RGB images to assess crop-weed competition in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop by generating two new indicators, the weed pressure (WP) and the local wheat biomass production (&delta;BMc). The fractional vegetation cover (FVC) of the crop and the weeds was automatically determined from the images with a SVM-RBF classifier, using bag of visual word vectors as inputs. It is based on a new vegetation index called MetaIndex, defined as a vote of six indices widely used in the literature. Beyond a simple map of weed infestation, the map of WP describes the crop-weed competition. The map of &delta;BMc, meanwhile, evaluates the local wheat above-ground biomass production and informs us about a potential stress. It is generated from the wheat FVC because it is highly correlated with LAI (r2 = 0.99) and BM (r2 = 0.93) obtained by destructive methods. By combining these two indicators, we aim at determining whether the origin of the wheat stress is due to weeds or not. This approach opens up new perspectives for the monitoring of weeds and the monitoring of their competition during crop growth with non-destructive and proximal sensing technologies in the early stages of development.

AB  - Introduced as a soil erosion deterrent, salt cedar has become a menace along riverbeds in the desert southwest. Salt cedar replaces native species, permanently altering the structure, composition, function, and natural processes of the landscape. Remote sensing technologies have the potential to monitor the level of invasion and its impacts on ecosystem services. In this research, we developed a species map by segmenting and classifying various species along a stretch of the Lower Gila River. We calculated metrics from high-resolution multispectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to identify salt cedar, mesquite, and creosote. Analysts derived training and validation information from drone-acquired orthophotos to achieve an overall accuracy of 94%. It is clear from the results that salt cedar completely dominates the study area with small numbers of mesquite and creosote present. We also show that vegetation has declined in the study area over the last 25 years. We discuss how water usage may be influencing the plant health and biodiversity in the region. An examination of ground well, stream gauge, and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) groundwater storage data indicates a decline in water levels near the study area over the last 25 years.

AB  - An emergency action plan (EAP) for reservoirs and urban areas downstream of dams can alleviate damage caused by extreme flooding. An EAP is a disaster action plan that can designate evacuation paths for vulnerable districts. Generally, calculation of dam-break discharge in accordance with dam inflow conditions, calculation of maximum water surface elevation as per hydraulic channel routing, and flood map generation using topographical data are prepared for the purposes of creating an EAP. However, rainfall and flood patterns exhibited in the context of climate change can be extremely diverse. In order to prepare an efficient flood response, techniques should be considered that are capable of generating flood maps promptly while taking dam inflow conditions into account. Therefore, this study aims to propose methodology that is capable of generating flood maps rapidly for any dam inflow conditions. The proposed methodology was performed by linking a dynamic numerical analysis model (DAMBRK) with a random forest regression technique. The previous standard method of drawing flood maps often requires a significant amount of time depending on accuracy and personnel availability; however, the technique proposed here is capable of generating a flood map within one minute. Through use of this methodology, the time taken to prepare flood maps in large-scale water-disaster situations can be reduced. Moreover, methodology for estimating flood risk via use of flood mapping has been proposed. This study would provide assistance in establishing disaster countermeasures that take various flood scenarios into account by promptly providing flood inundation information to disaster-related agencies.

AB  - Mapping geological outcrops is a crucial part of mineral exploration, mine planning and ore extraction. With the advent of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) for rapid spatial and spectral mapping, opportunities arise in fields where traditional ground-based approaches are established and trusted, but fail to cover sufficient area or compromise personal safety. Multi-sensor UAS are a technology that change geoscientific research, but they are still not routinely used for geological mapping in exploration and mining due to lack of trust in their added value and missing expertise and guidance in the selection and combination of drones and sensors. To address these limitations and highlight the potential of using UAS in exploration settings, we present an UAS multi-sensor mapping approach based on the integration of drone-borne photography, multi- and hyperspectral imaging and magnetics. Data are processed with conventional methods as well as innovative machine learning algorithms and validated by geological field mapping, yielding a comprehensive and geologically interpretable product. As a case study, we chose the northern extension of the Siilinj&auml;rvi apatite mine in Finland, in a brownfield exploration setting with plenty of ground truth data available and a survey area that is partly covered by vegetation. We conducted rapid UAS surveys from which we created a multi-layered data set to investigate properties of the ore-bearing carbonatite-glimmerite body. Our resulting geologic map discriminates between the principal lithologic units and distinguishes ore-bearing from waste rocks. Structural orientations and lithological units are deduced based on high-resolution, hyperspectral image-enhanced point clouds. UAS-based magnetic data allow an insight into their subsurface geometry through modeling based on magnetic interpretation. We validate our results via ground survey including rock specimen sampling, geochemical and mineralogical analysis and spectroscopic point measurements. We are convinced that the presented non-invasive, data-driven mapping approach can complement traditional workflows in mineral exploration as a flexible tool. Mapping products based on UAS data increase efficiency and maximize safety of the resource extraction process, and reduce expenses and incidental wastes.

We estimated leaf area, leaf area index (LAI), and plant height using coordinates of polygon vertices from plant and canopy surface models constructed using a three-dimensional (3D) scanner. A significant correlation was observed between the measured and estimated leaf area, LAI, and plant height (R2 &gt; 0.8, except for tomato LAI). The canopy structure of each fruit vegetable was predicted by integrating the estimated leaf area at each height of the canopy surface models. A linear relationship was observed between the measured total leaf area and the total dry weight of each fruit vegetable; thus, the dry weight of the plant can be predicted using the estimated leaf area. The fruit weights of tomato and paprika were estimated using the fruit solid model constructed by the fruit point cloud data extracted using the RGB value. A significant correlation was observed between the measured and estimated fruit weights (tomato: R2 = 0.739, paprika: R2 = 0.888). Therefore, it was possible to estimate the growth parameters (leaf area, plant height, canopy structure, and yield) of different fruit vegetables non-destructively using a 3D scanner.

AB  - The fast and accurate creation of land use/land cover maps from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery is crucial for urban planning and environmental monitoring. Geographic object-based image analysis methods (GEOBIA) provide an effective solution using image objects instead of individual pixels in VHR remote sensing imagery analysis. Simultaneously, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely used in the image processing field because of their powerful feature extraction capabilities. This study presents a patch-based strategy for integrating deep features into GEOBIA for VHR remote sensing imagery classification. To extract deep features from irregular image objects through CNN, a patch-based approach is proposed for representing image objects and learning patch-based deep features, and a deep features aggregation method is proposed for aggregating patch-based deep features into object-based deep features. Finally, both object and deep features are integrated into a GEOBIA paradigm for classifying image objects. We explored the influences of segmentation scales and patch sizes in our method and explored the effectiveness of deep and object features in classification. Moreover, we performed 5-fold stratified cross validations 50 times to explore the uncertainty of our method. Additionally, we explored the importance of deep feature aggregation, and we evaluated our method by comparing it with three state-of-the-art methods in a Beijing dataset and Zurich dataset. The results indicate that smaller segmentation scales were more conducive to VHR remote sensing imagery classification, and it was not appropriate to select too large or too small patches as the patch size should be determined by imagery and its resolution. Moreover, we found that deep features are more effective than object features, while object features still matter for image classification, and deep feature aggregation is a critical step in our method. Finally, our method can achieve the highest overall accuracies compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and the overall accuracies are 91.21% for the Beijing dataset and 99.05% for the Zurich dataset.

AB  - The variability of currently available remote sensing datasets raises the question of which specific processing methods should be used for feature detection and feature extraction in both large and small-scale overhead images. In some cases, particular analyses allow us to carry out feature detection much more easily and effectively. The high-definition approach enables enhanced analysis of remote sensing data using all the spectral and graphical potential of multi-temporal ordered components. The deserted urban site of Kona Makhmūr, Iraqi Kurdistan, is taken as a case study to demonstrate this fine-grained approach. The analysis described in this paper is based on the complementary use of a variety of overlayed imagery, augmented by data from terrestrial surveys. The resulting map substantially enhances our knowledge of the built environment and the economic and environmental conditions of this early Islamic-period site. Spectral analysis of raster images allowed us to detect the real shapes of features, and with the addition of digital elevation model (DEM) (created via unmanned aerial system (UAV)) we were also able to interpret the state of preservation of the overground relics and the diachronic dynamics of their degradation.

AB  - Distance information of an obstacle is important for obstacle avoidance in many applications, and could be used to determine the potential risk of object collision. In this study, the detection of a moving fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with deep learning-based distance estimation to conduct a feasibility study of sense and avoid (SAA) and mid-air collision avoidance of UAVs is proposed by using a monocular camera to detect and track an incoming UAV. A quadrotor is regarded as an owned UAV, and it is able to estimate the distance of an incoming fixed-wing intruder. The adopted object detection method is based on the you only look once (YOLO) object detector. Deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods are applied to exam their performance in the distance estimation of moving objects. The feature extraction of fixed-wing UAVs is based on the VGG-16 model, and then its result is applied to the distance network to estimate the object distance. The proposed model is trained by using synthetic images from animation software and validated by using both synthetic and real flight videos. The results show that the proposed active vision-based scheme is able to detect and track a moving UAV with high detection accuracy and low distance errors.

AB  - Understanding social interactions in livestock groups could improve management practices, but this can be difficult and time-consuming using traditional methods of live observations and video recordings. Sensor technologies and machine learning techniques could provide insight not previously possible. In this study, based on the animals&rsquo; location information acquired by a new cooperative wireless localisation system, unsupervised machine learning approaches were performed to identify the social structure of a small group of cattle yearlings (n=10) and the social behaviour of an individual. The paper first defined the affinity between an animal pair based on the ranks of their distance. Unsupervised clustering algorithms were then performed, including K-means clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. In particular, K-means clustering was applied based on logical and physical distance. By comparing the clustering result based on logical distance and physical distance, the leader animals and the influence of an individual in a herd of cattle were identified, which provides valuable information for studying the behaviour of animal herds. Improvements in device robustness and replication of this work would confirm the practical application of this technology and analysis methodologies.

SN  - 2073-431X

AB  - Currently, unmanned aerial vehicles, such as drones, are becoming a part of our lives and extend to many areas of society, including the industrialized world. A common alternative for controlling the movements and actions of the drone is through unwired tactile interfaces, for which different remote control devices are used. However, control through such devices is not a natural, human-like communication interface, which sometimes is difficult to master for some users. In this research, we experimented with a domain-based speech recognition architecture to effectively control an unmanned aerial vehicle such as a drone. The drone control was performed in a more natural, human-like way to communicate the instructions. Moreover, we implemented an algorithm for command interpretation using both Spanish and English languages, as well as to control the movements of the drone in a simulated domestic environment. We conducted experiments involving participants giving voice commands to the drone in both languages in order to compare the effectiveness of each, considering the mother tongue of the participants in the experiment. Additionally, different levels of distortion were applied to the voice commands to test the proposed approach when it encountered noisy input signals. The results obtained showed that the unmanned aerial vehicle was capable of interpreting user voice instructions. Speech-to-action recognition improved for both languages with phoneme matching in comparison to only using the cloud-based algorithm without domain-based instructions. Using raw audio inputs, the cloud-based approach achieves 74.81% and 97.04% accuracy for English and Spanish instructions, respectively. However, with our phoneme matching approach the results are improved, yielding 93.33% accuracy for English and 100.00% accuracy for Spanish.

AB  - An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to capture high-resolution aerial images of crop fields. Software-based image analysis was performed to classify land uses. The purpose was to help relevant agencies use aerial imaging in managing agricultural production. This study involves five townships in the Chianan Plain of Chiayi County, Taiwan. About 100 ha of farmland in each township was selected as a sample area, and a quadcopter and a handheld fixed-wing drone were used to capture visible-light images and multispectral images. The survey was carried out from August to October 2018 and aerial photographs were captured in clear and dry weather. This study used high-resolution images captured from a UAV to classify the uses of agricultural land, and then employed information from multispectral images and elevation data from a digital surface model. The results revealed that visible-light images led to low interpretation accuracy. However, multispectral images and elevation data increased the accuracy rate to nearly 90%. Accordingly, such images and data can effectively enhance the accuracy of land use classification. The technology can reduce costs that are associated with labor and time and can facilitate the establishment of a real-time mapping database.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Chlorophyll is an essential pigment for photosynthesis in crops, and leaf chlorophyll content can be used as an indicator for crop growth status and help guide nitrogen fertilizer applications. Estimating crop chlorophyll content plays an important role in precision agriculture. In this study, a variable, rate of change in reflectance between wavelengths &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;b&rsquo; (RCRWa-b), derived from in situ hyperspectral remote sensing data combined with four advanced machine learning techniques, Gaussian process regression (GPR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), were used to estimate the chlorophyll content (measured by a portable soil&ndash;plant analysis development meter) of rice. The performances of the four machine learning models were assessed and compared using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The results revealed that four features of RCRWa-b, RCRW551.0&ndash;565.6, RCRW739.5&ndash;743.5, RCRW684.4&ndash;687.1 and RCRW667.9&ndash;672.0, were effective in estimating the chlorophyll content of rice, and the RFR model generated the highest prediction accuracy (training set: RMSE = 1.54, MAE =1.23 and R2 = 0.95; validation set: RMSE = 2.64, MAE = 1.99 and R2 = 0.80). The GPR model was found to have the strongest generalization (training set: RMSE = 2.83, MAE = 2.16 and R2 = 0.77; validation set: RMSE = 2.97, MAE = 2.30 and R2 = 0.76). We conclude that RCRWa-b is a useful variable to estimate chlorophyll content of rice, and RFR and GPR are powerful machine learning algorithms for estimating the chlorophyll content of rice.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Although efforts and progress have been made in crop classification using optical remote sensing images, it is still necessary to make full use of the high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions of remote sensing images. However, with the increasing volume of remote sensing data, a key emerging issue in the field of crop classification is how to find useful information from massive data to balance classification accuracy and processing time. To address this challenge, we developed a novel crop classification method, combining optimal feature selection (OFSM) with hybrid convolutional neural network-random forest (CNN-RF) networks for multi-temporal optical remote sensing images. This research used 234 features including spectral, segmentation, color, and texture features from three scenes of Sentinel-2 images to identify crop types in the Jilin province of northeast China. To effectively extract the effective features of remote sensing data with lower time requirements, the use of OFSM was proposed with the results compared with two traditional feature selection methods (TFSM): random forest feature importance selection (RF-FI) and random forest recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE). Although the time required for OFSM was 26.05 s, which was between RF-FI with 1.97 s and RF-RFE with 132.54 s, OFSM outperformed RF-FI and RF-RFE in terms of the overall accuracy (OA) of crop classification by 4% and 0.3%, respectively. On the basis of obtaining effective feature information, to further improve the accuracy of crop classification we designed two hybrid CNN-RF networks to leverage the advantages of one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) and Visual Geometry Group (VGG) with random forest (RF), respectively. Based on the selected optimal features using OFSM, four networks were tested for comparison: Conv1D-RF, VGG-RF, Conv1D, and VGG. Conv1D-RF achieved the highest OA at 94.27% as compared with VGG-RF (93.23%), Conv1D (92.59%), and VGG (91.89%), indicating that the Conv1D-RF method with optimal feature input provides an effective and efficient method of time series representation for multi-temporal crop-type classification.

AB  - As an important production base for livestock and a unique ecological zone in China, the northeast Tibetan Plateau has experienced dramatic land use/land cover (LULC) changes with increasing human activities and continuous climate change. However, extensive cloud cover limits the ability of optical remote sensing satellites to monitor accurately LULC changes in this area. To overcome this problem in LULC mapping in the Ganan Prefecture, 2000&ndash;2018, we used the dense time stacking of multi-temporal Landsat images and random forest algorithm based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The dynamic trends of LULC changes were analyzed, and geographical detectors quantitatively evaluated the key driving factors of these changes. The results showed that (1) the overall classification accuracy varied between 89.14% and 91.41%, and the kappa values were greater than 86.55%, indicating that the classification results were reliably accurate. (2) The major LULC types in the study area were grassland and forest, and their area accounted for 50% and 25%, respectively. During the study period, the grassland area decreased, while the area of forest land and construction land increased to varying degrees. The land-use intensity presents multi-level intensity, and it was higher in the northeast than that in the southwest. (3) Elevation and population density were the major driving factors of LULC changes, and economic development has also significantly affected LULC. These findings revealed the main factors driving LULC changes in Gannan Prefecture and provided a reference for assisting in the development of sustainable land management and ecological protection policy decisions.

AB  - The use of drones to study marine animals shows promise for the examination of numerous aspects of their ecology, behaviour, health and movement patterns. However, the responses of some marine phyla to the presence of drones varies broadly, as do the general operational protocols used to study them. Inconsistent methodological approaches could lead to difficulties comparing studies and can call into question the repeatability of research. This review draws on current literature and researchers with a wealth of practical experience to outline the idiosyncrasies of studying various marine taxa with drones. We also outline current best practice for drone operation in marine environments based on the literature and our practical experience in the field. The protocols outlined herein will be of use to researchers interested in incorporating drones as a tool into their research on marine animals and will help form consistent approaches for drone-based studies in the future.

AB  - In the near future, the fifth-generation wireless technology is expected to be rolled out, offering low latency, high bandwidth and multiple antennas deployed in a single access point. This ecosystem will help further enhance various location-based scenarios such as assets tracking in smart factories, precise smart management of hydroponic indoor vertical farms and indoor way-finding in smart hospitals. Such a system will also integrate existing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), WiFi and other network infrastructures. In this respect, 5G precise indoor localization using heterogeneous IoT technologies (Zigbee, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, BLE, etc.) is a challenging research area. In this work, an experimental 5G testbed has been designed integrating C-RAN and IoT networks. This testbed is used to improve both vertical and horizontal localization (3D Localization) in a 5G IoT environment. To achieve this, we propose the DEep Learning-based co-operaTive Architecture (DELTA) machine learning model implemented on a 3D multi-layered fingerprint radiomap. The DELTA begins by estimating the 2D location. Then, the output is recursively used to predict the 3D location of a mobile station. This approach is going to benefit use cases such as 3D indoor navigation in multi-floor smart factories or in large complex buildings. Finally, we have observed that the proposed model has outperformed traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).

AB  - This article tackles the problem of detecting small objects in satellite or aerial remote sensing images by relying on super-resolution to increase image spatial resolution, thus the size and details of objects to be detected. We show how to improve the super-resolution framework starting from the learning of a generative adversarial network (GAN) based on residual blocks and then its integration into a cycle model. Furthermore, by adding to the framework an auxiliary network tailored for object detection, we considerably improve the learning and the quality of our final super-resolution architecture, and more importantly increase the object detection performance. Besides the improvement dedicated to the network architecture, we also focus on the training of super-resolution on target objects, leading to an object-focused approach. Furthermore, the proposed strategies do not depend on the choice of a baseline super-resolution framework, hence could be adopted for current and future state-of-the-art models. Our experimental study on small vehicle detection in remote sensing data conducted on both aerial and satellite images (i.e., ISPRS Potsdam and xView datasets) confirms the effectiveness of the improved super-resolution methods to assist with the small object detection tasks.

AB  - Efficient, precise and timely measurement of plant traits is important in the assessment of a breeding population. Estimating crop biomass in breeding trials using high-throughput technologies is difficult, as reproductive and senescence stages do not relate to reflectance spectra, and multiple growth stages occur concurrently in diverse genotypes. Additionally, vegetation indices (VIs) saturate at high canopy coverage, and vertical growth profiles are difficult to capture using VIs. A novel approach was implemented involving a fusion of complementary spectral and structural information, to calculate intermediate metrics such as crop height model (CHM), crop coverage (CC) and crop volume (CV), which were finally used to calculate dry (DW) and fresh (FW) weight of above-ground biomass in wheat. The intermediate metrics, CHM (R2 = 0.81, SEE = 4.19 cm) and CC (OA = 99.2%, &Kappa; = 0.98) were found to be accurate against equivalent ground truth measurements. The metrics CV and CV&times;VIs were used to develop an effective and accurate linear regression model relationship with DW (R2 = 0.96 and SEE = 69.2 g/m2) and FW (R2 = 0.89 and SEE = 333.54 g/m2). The implemented approach outperformed commonly used VIs for estimation of biomass at all growth stages in wheat. The achieved results strongly support the applicability of the proposed approach for high-throughput phenotyping of germplasm in wheat and other crop species.

AB  - Classical univariate and multivariate statistics are the most common methods used for data analysis in plant breeding and biotechnology studies. Evaluation of genetic diversity, classification of plant genotypes, analysis of yield components, yield stability analysis, assessment of biotic and abiotic stresses, prediction of parental combinations in hybrid breeding programs, and analysis of in vitro-based biotechnological experiments are mainly performed by classical statistical methods. Despite successful applications, these classical statistical methods have low efficiency in analyzing data obtained from plant studies, as the genotype, environment, and their interaction (G &times; E) result in nondeterministic and nonlinear nature of plant characteristics. Large-scale data flow, including phenomics, metabolomics, genomics, and big data, must be analyzed for efficient interpretation of results affected by G &times; E. Nonlinear nonparametric machine learning techniques are more efficient than classical statistical models in handling large amounts of complex and nondeterministic information with &ldquo;multiple-independent variables versus multiple-dependent variables&rdquo; nature. Neural networks, partial least square regression, random forest, and support vector machines are some of the most fascinating machine learning models that have been widely applied to analyze nonlinear and complex data in both classical plant breeding and in vitro-based biotechnological studies. High interpretive power of machine learning algorithms has made them popular in the analysis of plant complex multifactorial characteristics. The classification of different plant genotypes with morphological and molecular markers, modeling and predicting important quantitative characteristics of plants, the interpretation of complex and nonlinear relationships of plant characteristics, and predicting and optimizing of in vitro breeding methods are the examples of applications of machine learning in conventional plant breeding and in vitro-based biotechnological studies. Precision agriculture is possible through accurate measurement of plant characteristics using imaging techniques and then efficient analysis of reliable extracted data using machine learning algorithms. Perfect interpretation of high-throughput phenotyping data is applicable through coupled machine learning-image processing. Some applied and potentially applicable capabilities of machine learning techniques in conventional and in vitro-based plant breeding studies have been discussed in this overview. Discussions are of great value for future studies and could inspire researchers to apply machine learning in new layers of plant breeding.

AB  - Prompt updates of land cover maps are important, as spatial information of land cover is widely used in many areas. However, current manual digitizing methods are time consuming and labor intensive, hindering rapid updates of land cover maps. The objective of this study was to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) based land cover classification model that allows for rapid land cover classification from high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images. The model comprises of three modules: pre-processing, land cover classification, and post-processing modules. The pre-processing module separates the HRRS image into multiple aspects by overlapping 75% using the sliding window algorithm. The land cover classification module was developed using the convolutional neural network (CNN) concept, based the FusionNet network and used to assign a land cover type to the separated HRRS images. Post-processing module determines ultimate land cover types by summing up the separated land cover result from the land cover classification module. Model training and validation were conducted to evaluate the performance of the developed model. The land cover maps and orthographic images of 547.29 km2 in area from the Jeonnam province in Korea were used to train the model. For model validation, two spatial and temporal different sites, one from Subuk-myeon of Jeonnam province in 2018 and the other from Daseo-myeon of Chungbuk province in 2016, were randomly chosen. The model performed reasonably well, demonstrating overall accuracies of 0.81 and 0.71, and kappa coefficients of 0.75 and 0.64, for the respective validation sites. The model performance was better when only considering the agricultural area by showing overall accuracy of 0.83 and kappa coefficients of 0.73. It was concluded that the developed model may assist rapid land cover update especially for agricultural areas and incorporation field boundary lineation is suggested as future study to further improve the model accuracy.

AB  - The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for remote sensing of natural environments has increased over the last decade. However, applications of this technology for high-throughput individual tree phenotyping in a quantitative genetic framework are rare. We here demonstrate a two-phased analytical pipeline that rapidly phenotypes and filters for genetic signals in traditional and novel tree productivity and architectural traits derived from ultra-dense light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The goal of this study was rapidly phenotype individual trees to understand the genetic basis of ecologically and economically significant traits important for guiding the management of natural resources. Individual tree point clouds were acquired using UAV-LiDAR captured over a multi-provenance common-garden restoration field trial located in Tasmania, Australia, established using two eucalypt species (Eucalyptus pauciflora and Eucalyptus tenuiramis). Twenty-five tree productivity and architectural traits were calculated for each individual tree point cloud. The first phase of the analytical pipeline found significant species differences in 13 of the 25 derived traits, revealing key structural differences in productivity and crown architecture between species. The second phase investigated the within species variation in the same 25 structural traits. Significant provenance variation was detected for 20 structural traits in E. pauciflora and 10 in E. tenuiramis, with signals of divergent selection found for 11 and 7 traits, respectively, putatively driven by the home-site environment shaping the observed variation. Our results highlight the genetic-based diversity within and between species for traits important for forest structure, such as crown density and structural complexity. As species and provenances are being increasingly translocated across the landscape to mitigate the effects of rapid climate change, our results that were achieved through rapid phenotyping using UAV-LiDAR, raise the need to understand the functional value of productivity and architectural traits reflecting species and provenance differences in crown structure and the interplay they have on the dependent biotic communities.

SN  - 2410-3888

AB  - Stingrays play a key role in the regulation of nearshore ecosystems. However, their movement ecology in high-energy surf areas remains largely unknown due to the notorious difficulties in conducting research in these environments. Using a blimp as an aerial platform for video surveillance, we overcame some of the limitations of other tracking methods, such as the use of tags and drones. This novel technology offered near-continuous coverage to characterise the fine-scale movements of stingrays in a surf area in Kiama, Australia, without any invasive procedures. A total of 98 stingray tracks were recorded, providing 6 h 27 min of movement paths. The tracking data suggest that stingrays may use a depth gradient located in the sandflat area of the bay for orientating their movements and transiting between locations within their home range. Our research also indicates that stingray behaviour was influenced by diel periods and tidal states. We observed a higher stingray occurrence during the afternoon, potentially related to foraging and anti-predatory strategies. We also saw a reduced route fidelity during low tide, when the bathymetric reference was less accessible due to stranding risk. Considering the increasing threat of anthropogenic development to nearshore coastal environments, the identification of these patterns can better inform the management and mitigation of threats.

VL  - 10

SN  - 2077-0472

AB  - Knowing the total Nitrogen content (Nt) of forage maize (Zea mays) is important so that decisions can be made quickly and efficiently to adjust the timing and amount of both irrigation and fertilizer. In 2017 and 2018 during three growing cycles in two study plots, leaf samples were collected and the Dumas method was used to estimate Nt. During the same growing seasons and on the same sampling plots, a Parrot Sequoia camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to collect high resolution images of forage maize study plots. Thirteen multispectral indices were generated and, from these, a Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to estimate Nt. RF is a machine-learning technique and is designed to work with extremely large datasets. Overall analysis showed five of the 13 indices as the most important. One of these five, the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index, was found to be the most important for estimation of Nt in forage maize (R2 = 0.76). RF handled the complex dataset in a time-efficient manner and Nt did not differ significantly when compared between traditional methods of evaluating Nt at the canopy level and using UAVs and RF to estimate Nt in forage maize. This result is an opportunity to explore many new research options in precision farming and digital agriculture.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Because of low accuracy and density of crop point clouds obtained by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-borne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanning system of UAV, an integrated navigation and positioning optimization method based on the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and a point cloud density enhancement method were proposed. Firstly, a global positioning system (GPS)/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated navigation and positioning information fusion method based on a Kalman filter was constructed. Then, the GOA was employed to find the optimal solution by iterating the system noise variance matrix Q and measurement noise variance matrix R of Kalman filter. By feeding the optimal solution into the Kalman filter, the error variances of longitude were reduced to 0.00046 from 0.0091, and the error variances of latitude were reduced to 0.00034 from 0.0047. Based on the integrated navigation, an UAV-borne LiDAR scanning system was built for obtaining the crop point. During offline processing, the crop point cloud was filtered and transformed into WGS-84, the density clustering algorithm improved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was employed to the clustering segment. After the clustering segment, the pre-trained Point Cloud Up-Sampling Network (PU-net) was used for density enhancement of point cloud data and to carry out three-dimensional reconstruction. The features of the crop point cloud were kept under the processing of reconstruction model; meanwhile, the density of the crop point cloud was quadrupled.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous tracking and landing is playing an increasingly important role in military and civil applications. In particular, machine learning has been successfully introduced to robotics-related tasks. A novel UAV autonomous tracking and landing approach based on a deep reinforcement learning strategy is presented in this paper, with the aim of dealing with the UAV motion control problem in an unpredictable and harsh environment. Instead of building a prior model and inferring the landing actions based on heuristic rules, a model-free method based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is proposed. In the POMDP model, the UAV automatically learns the landing maneuver by an end-to-end neural network, which combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm and heuristic rules. A Modular Open Robots Simulation Engine (MORSE)-based reinforcement learning framework is designed and validated with a continuous UAV tracking and landing task on a randomly moving platform in high sensor noise and intermittent measurements. The simulation results show that when the moving platform is moving in different trajectories, the average landing success rate of the proposed algorithm is about 10% higher than that of the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) method. As an indirect result, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning-based UAV control method is validated, where the UAV can learn the optimal strategy of a continuously autonomous landing and perform properly in a simulation environment.

TI  - Leveraging Very-High Spatial Resolution Hyperspectral and Thermal UAV Imageries for Characterizing Diurnal Indicators of Grapevine Physiology
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 19
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Efficient and accurate methods to monitor crop physiological responses help growers better understand crop physiology and improve crop productivity. In recent years, developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and sensor technology have enabled image acquisition at very-high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. However, potential applications and limitations of very-high-resolution (VHR) hyperspectral and thermal UAV imaging for characterization of plant diurnal physiology remain largely unknown, due to issues related to shadow and canopy heterogeneity. In this study, we propose a canopy zone-weighting (CZW) method to leverage the potential of VHR (&le;9 cm) hyperspectral and thermal UAV imageries in estimating physiological indicators, such as stomatal conductance (Gs) and steady-state fluorescence (Fs). Diurnal flights and concurrent in-situ measurements were conducted during grapevine growing seasons in 2017 and 2018 in a vineyard in Missouri, USA. We used neural net classifier and the Canny edge detection method to extract pure vine canopy from the hyperspectral and thermal images, respectively. Then, the vine canopy was segmented into three canopy zones (sunlit, nadir, and shaded) using K-means clustering based on the canopy shadow fraction and canopy temperature. Common reflectance-based spectral indices, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and simplified canopy water stress index (siCWSI) were computed as image retrievals. Using the coefficient of determination (R2) established between the image retrievals from three canopy zones and the in-situ measurements as a weight factor, weighted image retrievals were calculated and their correlation with in-situ measurements was explored. The results showed that the most frequent and the highest correlations were found for Gs and Fs, with CZW-based Photochemical reflectance index (PRI), SIF, and siCWSI (PRICZW, SIFCZW, and siCWSICZW), respectively. When all flights combined for the given field campaign date, PRICZW, SIFCZW, and siCWSICZW significantly improved the relationship with Gs and Fs. The proposed approach takes full advantage of VHR hyperspectral and thermal UAV imageries, and suggests that the CZW method is simple yet effective in estimating Gs and Fs.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - There is a substantial opportunity to lift feed utilization and profitability on pasture-based dairy systems through both increased pasture monitoring accuracy and frequency. The first objective of this experiment was to determine the impact of the number of electronic rising plate meter (RPM) readings and walking pattern on the accuracy of the RPM to determine pasture biomass. The second objective was to evaluate current satellite technology (i.e., small CubeSats and traditional large satellites) in combination with the electronic RPM as an accurate tool for systematic pasture monitoring. The experiment was conducted from October to December 2019 at Camden, Australia. Two experimental paddocks, each of 1.1 ha, were sown with annual ryegrass and monitored with an electronic RPM integrated with Global Navigation Satellite System and with two different satellites (Planet CubeSats and Sentinel-2 satellite). Here we show that 70 RPM readings achieve a &plusmn; 5% error in the pasture biomass estimations (kg DM/ha), with no effect of the walking pattern on accuracy. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from satellites showed a good correlation with pasture biomass estimated using the electronic RPM (R2 0.74&ndash;0.94). Satellite pasture biomass and growth rate estimations were similar to RPM in one regrowth period but underestimated by &asymp;20% in the other. Our results also reveal that the accuracy of uncalibrated satellites (i.e., biomass estimated using NDVI to kg DM/ha standard equations) is low (R2 0.61, RMSE 566&ndash;1307 kg DM/ha). However, satellites calibrated with a RPM showed greater accuracy in the estimations (R2 0.72, RMSE 255 kg DM/ha). Current satellite technology, when used with the electronic RPM, has the potential to not only reduce the time required to monitor pasture biomass manually but provide finer scale measurements of pasture biomass within paddocks. Further work is required to test this hypothesis, both spatially and temporally.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The accurate estimation of the key growth indicators of rice is conducive to rice production, and the rapid monitoring of these indicators can be achieved through remote sensing using the commercial RGB cameras of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the method of using UAV RGB images lacks an optimized model to achieve accurate qualifications of rice growth indicators. In this study, we established a correlation between the multi-stage vegetation indices (VIs) extracted from UAV imagery and the leaf dry biomass, leaf area index, and leaf total nitrogen for each growth stage of rice. Then, we used the optimal VI (OVI) method and object-oriented segmentation (OS) method to remove the noncanopy area of the image to improve the estimation accuracy. We selected the OVI and the models with the best correlation for each growth stage to establish a simple estimation model database. The results showed that the OVI and OS methods to remove the noncanopy area can improve the correlation between the key growth indicators and VI of rice. At the tillering stage and early jointing stage, the correlations between leaf dry biomass (LDB) and the Green Leaf Index (GLI) and Red Green Ratio Index (RGRI) were 0.829 and 0.881, respectively; at the early jointing stage and late jointing stage, the coefficient of determination (R2) between the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Modified Green Red Vegetation Index (MGRVI) was 0.803 and 0.875, respectively; at the early stage and the filling stage, the correlations between the leaf total nitrogen (LTN) and UAV vegetation index and the Excess Red Vegetation Index (ExR) were 0.861 and 0.931, respectively. By using the simple estimation model database established using the UAV-based VI and the measured indicators at different growth stages, the rice growth indicators can be estimated for each stage. The proposed estimation model database for monitoring rice at the different growth stages is helpful for improving the estimation accuracy of the key rice growth indicators and accurately managing rice production.

AB  - Under ideal conditions of nitrogen (N), maize (Zea mays L.) can grow to its full potential, reaching maximum plant height (PH). As a rapid and nondestructive approach, the analysis of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based imagery may be of assistance to estimate N and height. The main objective of this study is to present an approach to predict leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC, g kg&minus;1) and PH (m) with machine learning techniques and UAV-based multispectral imagery in maize plants. An experiment with 11 maize cultivars under two rates of N fertilization was carried during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons. The spectral vegetation indices (VI) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), green normalized difference vegetation (GNDVI), and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were extracted from the images and, in a computational system, used alongside the spectral bands as input parameters for different machine learning models. A randomized 10-fold cross-validation strategy, with a total of 100 replicates, was used to evaluate the performance of 9 supervised machine learning (ML) models using the Pearson&rsquo;s correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of regression (R&sup2;), and root mean square error (RMSE) metrics. The results indicated that the random forest (RF) algorithm performed better, with r and RMSE, respectively, of 0.91 and 1.9 g.kg&minus;&sup1; for LNC, and 0.86 and 0.17 m for PH. It was also demonstrated that VIs contributed more to the algorithm&rsquo;s performances than individual spectral bands. This study concludes that the RF model is appropriate to predict both agronomic variables in maize and may help farmers to monitor their plants based upon their LNC and PH diagnosis and use this knowledge to improve their production rates in the subsequent seasons.

AB  - The author proposes a new approach for bridge crack detection by a 360&deg; camera on top of a drone. Traditionally, bridge inspection is performed manually and although the use of drones has been implemented before, researchers used standard high definition cameras underneath the drone. To make the approach comparable to the conventional approach, two bridges were selected in Germany and inspected for cracks and defects by applying both methods. The author follows an engineering design process and after developing a prototype of the drone with a 360&deg; camera above the body of the drone, the system is built, tested, and the bridges are inspected. First, the critical parts of the bridges are inspected with an off-the-shelf drone with a high definition camera underneath the drone. The results provide a benchmark for comparison. Next, the new approach to bridge inspection by using a 360&deg; camera on top of the drone is tested. The images of the critical parts of the bridge that were taken with the 360&deg; camera on top of the drone are analyzed and compared to the images of the conventional approach with the camera underneath the drone. The results show that a 360&deg; camera can be used for crack and defect detection with similar results to a standard high definition camera. Furthermore, the 360&deg; camera is more suitable for inspecting corners or the ceiling of, e.g., an arch bridge.

AB  - Conveyor belts are the most widespread means of transportation for large quantities of materials in the mining sector. Therefore, autonomous methods that can help human beings to perform the inspection of the belt conveyor system is a major concern for companies. In this context, we present in this work a novel and automatic visual detector that recognizes dirt buildup on the structures of conveyor belts, which is one of the tasks of the maintenance inspectors. This visual detector can be embedded as sensors in autonomous robots for the inspection activity. The proposed system involves training a convolutional neural network from RGB images. The use of the transfer learning technique, i.e., retraining consolidated networks for image classification with our collected images has shown very effective. Two different approaches for transfer learning have been analyzed. The best one presented an average accuracy of 0.8975 with an F-1 Score of 0.8773 for the dirt recognition. A field validation experiment served to evaluate the performance of the proposed system in a real time classification task.

VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Forest species classifications are becoming increasingly automated as advances are made in machine learning. Complex algorithms can reach high accuracies, but are not always suitable for small-scale classifications, which may benefit from simpler conventional methods. The goal of this classification was to identify contiguous stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Douglas ex Lawson) against a mix of forest and non-forest background in the southern Willamette Valley, Oregon. The study area is approximately 816,600 ha, considerably larger than most study areas used for presenting techniques for tree species classification. To achieve the objective, we used two classification procedures, one parametric and one non-parametric. For the parametric method, we selected the maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm, whereas for the non-parametric method we chose the random forest (RF) algorithm. To identify ponderosa pine, we used 1 m spatial resolution red-green-blue-infrared (RGBI) aerial images supplied by the U.S. National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and 1 m spatial resolution canopy height models (CHMs) provided by the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI). We tested four data variations for each method: Aerial imagery, CHM-masked aerial imagery, aerial imagery with an additional CHM band, and CHM-masked aerial imagery with a CHM band. The parametric classifications of aerial imagery alone reached an average kappa coefficient of 0.29, which increased to 0.51 when masked with CHM data. The incorporation of CHM data as a fifth band resulted in a similar improvement in kappa (0.47), but the most effective parametric method was the incorporation of CHM data as both a fifth band and a post-classification mask, resulting in a kappa coefficient of 0.89. The non-parametric classification of aerial imagery achieved a mean validation kappa coefficient of 0.85 collectively and 0.90 individually, which only increased by approximately 0.01 or less when the CHM masks were applied. The addition of the CHM band increased the kappa value to 0.91 for both individual and collective tile classifications. The highest kappa of all methods was achieved through five-band non-parametric classification with the addition of the CHM band (0.94) for both collective and individual classifications. Our results suggest that parametric methods, when enhanced with a CHM mask, could be suitable for large-area, small-scale classifications based on RGBI imagery, but a non-parametric classification of fused spectral and height data will generally achieve the highest accuracy for large, unbalanced datasets.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Information from seedling stands in time and space is essential for sustainable forest management. To fulfil these informational needs with limited resources, remote sensing is seen as an intriguing alternative for forest inventorying. The structure and tree species composition in seedling stands have created challenges for capturing this information using sensors providing sparse point densities that do not have the ability to penetrate canopy gaps or provide spectral information. Therefore, multispectral airborne laser scanning (mALS) systems providing dense point clouds coupled with multispectral intensity data theoretically offer advantages for the characterization of seedling stands. The aim of this study was to investigate the capability of Optech Titan mALS data to characterize seedling stands in leaf-off and leaf-on conditions, as well as to retrieve the most important forest inventory attributes, such as distinguishing deciduous from coniferous trees, and estimating tree density and height. First, single-tree detection approaches were used to derive crown boundaries and tree heights from which forest structural attributes were aggregated for sample plots. To predict tree species, a random forests classifier was trained using features from two single-channel intensities (SCIs) with wavelengths of 1550 (SCI-Ch1) and 1064 nm (SCI-Ch2), and multichannel intensity (MCI) data composed of three mALS channels. The most important and uncorrelated features were analyzed and selected from 208 features. The highest overall accuracies in classification of Norway spruce, birch, and nontree class in leaf-off and leaf-on conditions obtained using SCI-Ch1 and SCI-Ch2 were 87.36% and 69.47%, respectively. The use of MCI data improved classification by up to 96.55% and 92.54% in leaf-off and leaf-on conditions, respectively. Overall, leaf-off data were favorable for distinguishing deciduous from coniferous trees and tree density estimation with a relative root mean square error (RMSE) of 37.9%, whereas leaf-on data provided more accurate height estimations, with a relative RMSE of 10.76%. Determining the canopy threshold for separating ground returns from vegetation returns was found to be critical, as mapped trees might have a height below one meter. The results showed that mALS data provided benefits for characterizing seedling stands compared to single-channel ALS systems.

Many works have tried to address these challenges but without a focus on optimizing all of them and assuming fixed models of environments and security threats. This paper proposes the UbiPriSEQ framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adaptively, dynamically, and holistically optimize QoS, energy-efficiency, security, and privacy. UbiPriSEQ is built on a three-layered model and comprises two modules. UbiPriSEQ devises policies and makes decisions related to important parameters including local processing and offloading rates for data and computations, radio channel states, transmit power, task priority, and selection of fog nodes for offloading, data migration, and so forth. UbiPriSEQ is implemented in Python over the TensorFlow platform and is evaluated using a real-life application in terms of SINR, privacy metric, latency, and utility function, manifesting great promise.

AB  - Aspect ratio and crack density are essential parameters to understand the physical properties of porous-cracked rocks, although it is difficult to independently determine each parameter, as both are closely linked. The objective of this study is to propose a relationship between aspect ratio and crack density that can be used to solve for each through experimental and optimization methods. Two different constitutive equations are solved to create expressions explicitly defining aspect ratio and crack density, with all remaining variables arranged as functions of elastic wave velocity. Ten core specimens extracted from construction sites, with diameters of 46 mm, are subjected to artificial weathering to identify how their crack density and aspect ratio evolved with time. The artificial weathering process consisted of chemical and physical weathering cycles using saline solution and slake durability tests, respectively. Compressional and shear wave velocities are measured at every weathering step, and both aspect ratio and crack density are calculated. The random forest as an optimization method is selected to define the important score among input variables. The calculated aspect ratios and crack densities are converted into a crack porosity, the reliability of which is verified through percentage of crack porosity (~6%) in total porosity. This study demonstrates that the relationship between aspect ratio and crack density is robust and has wide-ranging applications in determining individual aspect ratio and crack density parameters in porous-cracked rock.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In recent years, advanced threats against Cyber&ndash;Physical Systems (CPSs), such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, are increasing. Furthermore, traditional machine learning-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) often fail to efficiently detect such attacks when corrupted datasets are used for IDS training. To face these challenges, this paper proposes a novel error-robust multidimensional technique for DDoS attack detection. By applying the well-known Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), initially, the average value of the common features among instances is filtered out from the dataset. Next, the filtered data are forwarded to machine learning classification algorithms in which traffic information is classified as a legitimate or a DDoS attack. In terms of results, the proposed scheme outperforms traditional low-rank approximation techniques, presenting an accuracy of 98.94%, detection rate of 97.70% and false alarm rate of 4.35% for a dataset corruption level of 30% with a random forest algorithm applied for classification. In addition, for error-free conditions, it is found that the proposed approach outperforms other related works, showing accuracy, detection rate and false alarm rate of 99.87%, 99.86% and 0.16%, respectively, for the gradient boosting classifier.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The dehydration cracking of saline soil is a kind of common natural phenomenon, and the cracks of saline soil will affect the satellite spectrum, and then affect the accuracy of satellite spectral inversion of electrical conductivity (EC). This study introduces the concept of crack rate (CR) to describe the crack information of saline soil, and quantifies the influence of saline soil crack on the EC of satellite spectral inversion. In 2014 and 2020, the satellite-ground synchronous observation experiments of soda-type inland saline soil and coastal chlorinated-type saline soil were carried out, and the CR of surface cracked saline soil was extracted by an image processing algorithm. For the saline soil spectrum data, the correlation analysis method is used to establish the best band combination that characterizes the relationship between the different saline soil spectrum data and salinity, and the EC inversion model is established using the BP neural network method. The results show that: after the CR is introduced, the determination coefficient (R2) for the EC of soda-type saline soil satellite spectral inversion increased from 0.59 to 0.67, with an increase of 14.42%, and the mean square error (MSE) reduced from 0.20 to 0.16, with a decrease of 19.49%. The R2 for the EC of coastal chlorinated-type saline soil satellite spectral inversion increased from 0.64 to 0.75, an increase of 17.73%, and the MSE decreased from 0.16 to 0.12, a decrease of 25.15%. The study proved the influence of the cracks in the saline soil on the satellite spectrum and provided a new way to improve the accuracy of the satellite spectrum inversion of the EC of the cracked saline soil.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12
IS  - 20
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Leaf nitrogen (N) directly correlates to chlorophyll production, affecting crop growth and yield. Farmers use soil plant analysis development (SPAD) devices to calculate the amount of chlorophyll present in plants. However, monitoring large-scale crops using SPAD is prohibitively time-consuming and demanding. This paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) solution for estimating leaf N content in rice crops, from multispectral imagery. Our contribution is twofold: (i) a novel trajectory control strategy to reduce the angular wind-induced perturbations that affect image sampling accuracy during UAV flight, and (ii) machine learning models to estimate the canopy N via vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from the aerial imagery. This approach integrates an image processing algorithm using the GrabCut segmentation method with a guided filtering refinement process, to calculate the VIs according to the plots of interest. Three machine learning methods based on multivariable linear regressions (MLR), support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks (NN), were applied and compared through the entire phonological cycle of the crop: vegetative (V), reproductive (R), and ripening (Ri). Correlations were obtained by comparing our methods against an assembled ground-truth of SPAD measurements. The higher N correlations were achieved with NN: 0.98 (V), 0.94 (R), and 0.89 (Ri). We claim that the proposed UAV stabilization control algorithm significantly improves on the N-to-SPAD correlations by minimizing wind perturbations in real-time and reducing the need for offline image corrections.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Secondary roads represent the largest part of the road network. However, due to the absence of clearly defined edges, presence of occlusions, and differences in widths, monitoring and mapping them represents a great effort for public administration. We believe that recent advancements in machine vision allow the extraction of these types of roads from high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and can enable the automation of the mapping operation. In this work, we leverage these advances and propose a deep learning-based solution capable of efficiently extracting the surface area of secondary roads at a large scale. The solution is based on hybrid segmentation models trained with high-resolution remote sensing imagery divided in tiles of 256 &times; 256 pixels and their correspondent segmentation masks, resulting in increases in performance metrics of 2.7&ndash;3.5% when compared to the original architectures. The best performing model achieved Intersection over Union and F1 scores of maximum 0.5790 and 0.7120, respectively, with a minimum loss of 0.4985 and was integrated on a web platform which handles the evaluation of large areas, the association of the semantic predictions with geographical coordinates, the conversion of the tiles&rsquo; format and the generation of geotiff results compatible with geospatial databases.

VL  - 12
IS  - 20
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Although advancements in remote sensing technology have facilitated quick capture and identification of the source and location of oil spills in water bodies, the presence of other biogenic elements (lookalikes) with similar visual attributes hinder rapid detection and prompt decision making for emergency response. To date, different methods have been applied to distinguish oil spills from lookalikes with limited success. In addition, accurately modeling the trajectory of oil spills remains a challenge. Thus, we aim to provide further insights on the multi-faceted problem by undertaking a holistic review of past and current approaches to marine oil spill disaster reduction as well as explore the potentials of emerging digital trends in minimizing oil spill hazards. The scope of previous reviews is extended by covering the inter-related dimensions of detection, discrimination, and trajectory prediction of oil spills for vulnerability assessment. Findings show that both optical and microwave airborne and satellite remote sensors are used for oil spill monitoring with microwave sensors being more widely used due to their ability to operate under any weather condition. However, the accuracy of both sensors is affected by the presence of biogenic elements, leading to false positive depiction of oil spills. Statistical image segmentation has been widely used to discriminate lookalikes from oil spills with varying levels of accuracy but the emergence of digitalization technologies in the fourth industrial revolution (IR 4.0) is enabling the use of Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, which are more promising than the statistical methods. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are the most used machine learning algorithms for oil spill detection, although the restriction of ML models to feed forward image classification without support for the end-to-end trainable framework limits its accuracy. On the other hand, deep learning models&rsquo; strong feature extraction and autonomous learning capability enhance their detection accuracy. Also, mathematical models based on lagrangian method have improved oil spill trajectory prediction with higher real time accuracy than the conventional worst case, average and survey-based approaches. However, these newer models are unable to quantify oil droplets and uncertainty in vulnerability prediction. Considering that there is yet no single best remote sensing technique for unambiguous detection and discrimination of oil spills and lookalikes, it is imperative to advance research in the field in order to improve existing technology and develop specialized sensors for accurate oil spill detection and enhanced classification, leveraging emerging geospatial computer vision initiatives.

AB  - Remote sensing (RS) has been an effective tool to monitor agricultural production systems, but for vegetable crops, precision agriculture has received less interest to date. The objective of this study was to test the predictive performance of two types of RS data&mdash;crop height information derived from point clouds based on RGB UAV data, and reflectance information from terrestrial hyperspectral imagery&mdash;to predict fresh matter yield (FMY) for three vegetable crops (eggplant, tomato, and cabbage). The study was conducted in an experimental layout in Bengaluru, India, at five dates in summer 2017. The prediction accuracy varied strongly depending on the RS dataset used. For all crops, a good predictive performance with cross-validated prediction error &lt; 10% was achieved. The growth stage of the crops had no significant effect on the prediction accuracy, although increasing trends of an underestimation of FMY with later sampling dates for eggplant and tomato were found. The study proves that an estimation of vegetable FMY using RS data is successful throughout the growing season. Different RS datasets were best for biomass prediction of the three vegetables, indicating that multi-sensory data collection should be preferred to single sensor use, as no one sensor system is superior.

AB  - In the last years, the commercial drone/unmanned aerial vehicles market has grown due to their technological performances (provided by the multiple onboard available sensors), low price, and ease of use. Being very attractive for an increasing number of applications, their presence represents a major issue for public or classified areas with a special status, because of the rising number of incidents. Our paper proposes a new approach for the drone movement detection and characterization based on the ultra-wide band (UWB) sensing system and advanced signal processing methods. This approach characterizes the movement of the drone using classical methods such as correlation, envelope detection, time-scale analysis, but also a new method, the recurrence plot analysis. The obtained results are compared in terms of movement map accuracy and required computation time in order to offer a future starting point for the drone intrusion detection.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Cloud computing and freely available, high-resolution satellite data have enabled recent progress in crop yield mapping at fine scales. However, extensive validation data at a matching resolution remain uncommon or infeasible due to data availability. This has limited the ability to evaluate different yield estimation models and improve understanding of key features useful for yield estimation in both data-rich and data-poor contexts. Here, we assess machine learning models&rsquo; capacity for soybean yield prediction using a unique ground-truth dataset of high-resolution (5 m) yield maps generated from combine harvester yield monitor data for over a million field-year observations across the Midwestern United States from 2008 to 2018. First, we compare random forest (RF) implementations, testing a range of feature engineering approaches using Sentinel-2 and Landsat spectral data for 20- and 30-m scale yield prediction. We find that Sentinel-2-based models can explain up to 45% of out-of-sample yield variability from 2017 to 2018 (r2 = 0.45), while Landsat models explain up to 43% across the longer 2008&ndash;2018 period. Using discrete Fourier transforms, or harmonic regressions, to capture soybean phenology improved the Landsat-based model considerably. Second, we compare RF models trained using this ground-truth data to models trained on available county-level statistics. We find that county-level models rely more heavily on just a few predictors, namely August weather covariates (vapor pressure deficit, rainfall, temperature) and July and August near-infrared observations. As a result, county-scale models perform relatively poorly on field-scale validation (r2 = 0.32), especially for high-yielding fields, but perform similarly to field-scale models when evaluated at the county scale (r2 = 0.82). Finally, we test whether our findings on variable importance can inform a simple, generalizable framework for regions or time periods beyond ground data availability. To do so, we test improvements to a Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) approach that uses crop simulations to train statistical models for yield estimation. Based on findings from our RF models, we employ harmonic regressions to estimate peak vegetation index (VI) and a VI observation 30 days later, with August rainfall as the sole weather covariate in our new SCYM model. Modifications improved SCYM&rsquo;s explained variance (r2 = 0.27 at the 30 m scale) and provide a new, parsimonious model.

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Environmental epidemiological studies have consistently reported associations between ambient particulate matter (PM) concentrations and everyday mortality/morbidity. Many urban dwellers in Asia live in high-rise apartment buildings; thus, the pollutant concentrations of their immediate outdoor environments are affected by the vertical distribution of pollutants in the atmosphere. The vertical distributions of pollutants provide unique information about their sources and dynamic transport in urban areas, as well as their relationship to people&rsquo;s exposure at ground level, while the vertical distributions of pollutants have rarely been considered in exposure assessment. In the current study, PM concentrations (with aerodynamic diameters less than 1.0 &mu;m (PM1), 2.5 &mu;m (PM2.5), and 10 &mu;m (PM10)), nanoparticles, black carbon (BC), and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (p-PAHs) were measured at different residential heights&mdash;6 m, 16 m, and 27 m&mdash;at Feng Chia University near a popular night market in Western Taiwan. PM2.5 data were further adopted for health risk estimations. In winter, the magnitude of PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations were 16 m &gt; 6 m &gt; 27 m; nanoparticle concentrations were 6 m &gt; 27 m &gt; 16 m; and BC and p-PAHs concentrations were 27 m &gt; 16 m &gt; 6 m. In summer, PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations ranged from 6 m &gt; 16 m &gt; 27 m; nanoparticle concentrations were 6 m &gt; 16 m; and BC and p-PAHs concentrations were from 27 m &gt; 16 m. PM and constituents concentrations during winter were significantly higher in the nighttime than those in daytime, and levels of PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 increased rapidly on 6 m and 16 m heights (but did not increase at 27 m) after 5 pm, whereas these trends became less significant in summer. Health risk analysis for PM2.5 concentrations showed a decrease in lung cancer mortality rate and an extended lifespan for residents living at 27 m. Overall, the current study investigated the vertical profile of particulate matters and analyzed health impacts of PM2.5 at different residential heights in urban area of Taiwan. As the distributions of PM and the constituents varied at different residential heights, exposure and risk assessment of particle concentrations with multiple sizes and various components at broader vertical heights should be further investigated.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Green leaf area index (LAI) is an important variable related to crop growth. Accurate and timely information on LAI is essential for developing suitable field management strategies to mitigate risk and boost yield. Several remote sensing (RS) based methods have been recently developed to estimate LAI at the regional scale. However, the performance of these methods tends to be affected by the quality of RS data, especially when time-series LAI are required. For crop LAI estimation, supplementary growth information from crop model is helpful to address this issue. In this study, we focus on the regional-scale LAI estimations of spring maize for the entire growth season. Using time-series multispectral RS data acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the World Food Studies (WOFOST) crop model, three methods were applied at different crop growth stages: empirical method using vegetation index (VI), data assimilation method and hybrid method. The VI-based method and assimilation method were used to generate time-series LAI estimations for the whole crop growth season. Then, a hybrid method specially for the late-stage LAI retrieval was developed by integrating WOFOST model and data assimilation. Using field-collected LAI data in Hongxing Farm in 2014, the performances of these three methods were evaluated. At the early stage, the VI-based method (R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.16, n = 36) achieved higher accuracy than the assimilation method (R2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.52, n = 36), whereas at the mid stage, the assimilation method (R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.46, n = 28) showed higher accuracy than the VI-based method (R2 = 0.41, RMSE = 0.51, n = 28). At the late stage, the hybrid method yielded the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.46, n = 29), compared with the VI-based method (R2 = 0.19, RMSE = 0.43, n = 28) and the assimilation method (R2 = 0.20, RMSE = 0.44, n = 29). Based on the results above, we considered a combination of the three methods, i.e., the VI-based method for the early stage, the assimilation method for the mid stage, and the hybrid method for the late stage, as an ideal strategy for spring-maize LAI estimation for the entire growth season of 2014 in Hongxing Farm, and the accuracy of the combined method over the whole growth season is higher than that of any single method.

AB  - Estimations of world population growth urgently require improving the efficiency of agricultural processes, as well as improving safety for people and environmental sustainability, which can be opposing characteristics. Industry is pursuing these objectives by developing the concept of the &ldquo;intelligent factory&rdquo; (also referred to as the &ldquo;smart factory&rdquo;) and, by studying the similarities between industry and agriculture, we can exploit the achievements attained in industry for agriculture. This article focuses on studying those similarities regarding robotics to advance agriculture toward the concept of &ldquo;intelligent farms&rdquo; (smart farms). Thus, this article presents some characteristics that agricultural robots should gain from industrial robots to attain the intelligent farm concept regarding robot morphologies and features as well as communication, computing, and data management techniques. The study, restricted to robotics for outdoor farms due to the fact that robotics for greenhouse farms deserves a specific study, reviews different structures for robot manipulators and mobile robots along with the latest techniques used in intelligent factories to advance the characteristics of robotics for future intelligent farms. This article determines similarities, contrasts, and differences between industrial and field robots and identifies some techniques proven in the industry with an extraordinary potential to be used in outdoor farms such as those derived from methods based on artificial intelligence, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, Big Data techniques, and cloud computing procedures. Moreover, different types of robots already in use in industry and services are analyzed and their advantages in agriculture reported (parallel, soft, redundant, and dual manipulators) as well as ground and aerial unmanned robots and multi-robot systems.

Several approaches have been proposed for this task by using statistical language model which focuses on syntax and structure of codes rather than deep semantic information underlying codes. In this paper, a Siamese Neural Network is proposed that maps codes into continuous space vectors and try to capture their semantic meaning. Firstly, an unsupervised pre-trained method that models code snippets as a weighted series of word vectors. The weights of the series are fitted by the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). Then, a Siamese Neural Network trained model is constructed to learn semantic vector representation of code snippets. Finally, the cosine similarity is provided to measure the similarity score between pairs of code snippets. Moreover, we have implemented our approach on a dataset of functionally similar code. The experimental results show that our method improves some performance over single word embedding method.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imaging systems have recently gained significant attention from researchers and practitioners as a cost-effective means for agro-environmental applications. In particular, machine learning algorithms have been applied to UAV-based remote sensing data for enhancing the UAV capabilities of various applications. This systematic review was performed on studies through a statistical meta-analysis of UAV applications along with machine learning algorithms in agro-environmental monitoring. For this purpose, a total number of 163 peer-reviewed articles published in 13 high-impact remote sensing journals over the past 20 years were reviewed focusing on several features, including study area, application, sensor type, platform type, and spatial resolution. The meta-analysis revealed that 62% and 38% of the studies applied regression and classification models, respectively. Visible sensor technology was the most frequently used sensor with the highest overall accuracy among classification articles. Regarding regression models, linear regression and random forest were the most frequently applied models in UAV remote sensing imagery processing. Finally, the results of this study confirm that applying machine learning approaches on UAV imagery produces fast and reliable results. Agriculture, forestry, and grassland mapping were found as the top three UAV applications in this review, in 42%, 22%, and 8% of the studies, respectively.

AB  - Assessment of the nitrogen status of grapevines with high spatial, temporal resolution offers benefits in fertilizer use efficiency, crop yield and quality, and vineyard uniformity. The primary objective of this study was to develop a robust predictive model for grapevine nitrogen estimation at bloom stage using high-resolution multispectral images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Aerial imagery and leaf tissue sampling were conducted from 150 grapevines subjected to five rates of nitrogen applications. Subsequent to appropriate pre-processing steps, pixels representing the canopy were segmented from the background per each vine. First, we defined a binary classification problem using pixels of three vines with the minimum (low-N class) and two vines with the maximum (high-N class) nitrogen concentration. Following optimized hyperparameters configuration, we trained five machine learning classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest, XGBoost, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and deep neural network (DNN) with fully-connected layers. Among the classifiers, SVM offered the highest F1-score (82.24%) on the test dataset at the cost of a very long training time compared to the other classifiers. Alternatively, QDA and XGBoost required the minimum training time with promising F1-score of 80.85% and 80.27%, respectively. Second, we transformed the classification into a regression problem by averaging the posterior probability of high-N class for all pixels within each of 150 vines. XGBoost exhibited a slightly larger coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.56) and lower root mean square error (RMSE) (0.23%) compared to other learning methods in the prediction of nitrogen concentration of all vines. The proposed approach provides values in (i) leveraging high-resolution imagery, (ii) investigating spatial distribution of nitrogen across a vine&rsquo;s canopy, and (iii) defining spatial zones for nitrogen application and smart sampling.

AB  - The use of monitoring sensors is increasingly present in the context of precision agriculture. Usually, these sensor nodes (SNs) alternate their states between periods of activation and hibernation to reduce battery usage. When employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from SNs distributed over a large agricultural area, we must synchronize the UAV route with the activation period of each SN. In this article, we address the problem of optimizing the UAV path through all the SNs to reduce its flight time, while also maximizing the SNs&rsquo; lifetime. Using the concept of timeslots for time base management combined with the idea of flight prohibition list, we propose an efficient algorithm for discovering and reconfiguring the activation time of the SNs. Experimental results were obtained through the development of our own simulator&mdash;UAV Simulator. These results demonstrate a considerable reduction in the distance traveled by the UAV and also in its flight time. In addition, the model provides a reduction in transmission time by SNs after reconfiguration, thus ensuring a longer lifetime for the SNs in the monitoring environment, as well as improving the freshness and continuity of the gathered data, which support the decision-making process.

AB  - The spatio-temporal change of the surface water is very important to agricultural, economic, and social development in the Hetao Plain, as well as the structure and function of the ecosystem. To understand the long-term changes of the surface water area in the Hetao Plain, we used all available Landsat images (7534 scenes) and adopted the modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to map the open-surface water from 1989 to 2019 in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. We further analyzed precipitation, temperature, and irrigated area, revealing the impact of climate change and human activities on long-term surface water changes. The results show the following. (1) In the last 31 years, the maximum, seasonal, and annual average water body area values in the Hetao Plain have exhibited a downward trend. Meanwhile, the number of maximum, seasonal, and permanent water bodies displayed a significant upward trend. (2) The variation of the surface water area in the Hetao Plain is mainly affected by the maximum water body area, while the variation of the water body number is mainly affected by the number of minimum water bodies. (3) Precipitation has statistically significant positive effects on the water body area and water body number, which has statistically significant negative effects with temperature and irrigation. The findings of this study can be used to help the policy-makers and farmers understand changing water resources and its driving mechanism and provide a reference for water resources management, agricultural irrigation, and ecological protection.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), although hardly a new technology, have recently gained a prominent role in many industries being widely used not only among enthusiastic consumers, but also in high demanding professional situations, and will have a massive societal impact over the coming years. However, the operation of UAVs is fraught with serious safety risks, such as collisions with dynamic obstacles (birds, other UAVs, or randomly thrown objects). These collision scenarios are complex to analyze in real-time, sometimes being computationally impossible to solve with existing State of the Art (SoA) algorithms, making the use of UAVs an operational hazard and therefore significantly reducing their commercial applicability in urban environments. In this work, a conceptual framework for both stand-alone and swarm (networked) UAVs is introduced, with a focus on the architectural requirements of the collision avoidance subsystem to achieve acceptable levels of safety and reliability. The SoA principles for collision avoidance against stationary objects are reviewed and a novel approach is described, using deep learning techniques to solve the computational intensive problem of real-time collision avoidance with dynamic objects. The proposed framework includes a web-interface allowing the full control of UAVs as remote clients with a supervisor cloud-based platform. The feasibility of the proposed approach was demonstrated through experimental tests using a UAV, developed from scratch using the proposed framework. Test flight results are presented for an autonomous UAV monitored from multiple countries across the world.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Single visual object tracking from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) poses fundamental challenges such as object occlusion, small-scale objects, background clutter, and abrupt camera motion. To tackle these difficulties, we propose to integrate the 3D structure of the observed scene into a detection-by-tracking algorithm. We introduce a pipeline that combines a model-free visual object tracker, a sparse 3D reconstruction, and a state estimator. The 3D reconstruction of the scene is computed with an image-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) component that enables us to leverage a state estimator in the corresponding 3D scene during tracking. By representing the position of the target in 3D space rather than in image space, we stabilize the tracking during ego-motion and improve the handling of occlusions, background clutter, and small-scale objects. We evaluated our approach on prototypical image sequences, captured from a UAV with low-altitude oblique views. For this purpose, we adapted an existing dataset for visual object tracking and reconstructed the observed scene in 3D. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms methods using plain visual cues as well as approaches leveraging image-space-based state estimations. We believe that our approach can be beneficial for trafficmonitoring, video surveillance, and navigation.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Cotton foreign fibers directly affect the quality of a textile product; the less foreign fibers in raw cotton, the higher the quality grade of the textile product. Based on the foreign fiber clean machine, this paper proposed an evaluation method of foreign fiber content using deep learning. First of all, a large number of images of foreign fibers were collected from different production lines and annotated to obtain the mask image dataset of foreign fibers. Secondly, by comparing the image segmentation algorithm based on deep learning, tests showed that U-Net has a better performance on different segment metrics evaluations, and U-Net is improved to realize the real-time segmentation of foreign fiber images. The actual size of the foreign fiber could be calculated through the combination of the segment result and the mechanical parameters of the machine. Finally, the test results showed that the relative error between the estimated size and the actual size was less than 4%. After the prototype test, the algorithm was deployed on the actual production line and, by comparing the algorithm data in a random time with the actual foreign fiber statistical data, the overall error was less than 2%. The test showed that the new evaluation method can fully reflect the content of foreign fiber in raw cotton.

AB  - P&aacute;ramos host more than 3500 vascular plant species and are crucial water providers for millions of people in the northern Andes. Monitoring species distribution at large scales is an urgent conservation priority in the face of ongoing climatic changes and increasing anthropogenic pressure on this ecosystem. For the first time in this ecosystem, we explored the potential of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV)-borne red, green, and blue wavelengths (RGB) and hyperspectral imagery for p&aacute;ramo species classification by collecting both types of images in a 10-ha area, and ground vegetation cover data from 10 plots within this area. Five plots were used for calibration and the other five for validation. With the hyperspectral data, we tested our capacity to detect five representative p&aacute;ramo species with different growth forms using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers in combination with three feature selection methods and two class groups. Using RGB images, we could classify 21 species with an accuracy greater than 97%. From hyperspectral imaging, the highest accuracy (89%) was found using models built with RF or SVM classifiers combined with a binary grouping method and the sequential floating forward selection feature. Our results demonstrate that p&aacute;ramo species can be accurately mapped using both RGB and hyperspectral imagery.

AB  - High-throughput phenotyping using high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution remote sensing (RS) data has become a critical part of the plant breeding chain focused on reducing the time and cost of the selection process for the &ldquo;best&rdquo; genotypes with respect to the trait(s) of interest. In this paper, the potential of accurate and reliable sorghum biomass prediction using visible and near infrared (VNIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral data as well as light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data acquired by sensors mounted on UAV platforms is investigated. Predictive models are developed using classical regression-based machine learning methods for nine experiments conducted during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons at the Agronomy Center for Research and Education (ACRE) at Purdue University, Indiana, USA. The impact of the regression method, data source, timing of RS and field-based biomass reference data acquisition, and the number of samples on the prediction results are investigated. R2 values for end-of-season biomass ranged from 0.64 to 0.89 for different experiments when features from all the data sources were included. Geometry-based features derived from the LiDAR point cloud to characterize plant structure and chemistry-based features extracted from hyperspectral data provided the most accurate predictions. Evaluation of the impact of the time of data acquisition during the growing season on the prediction results indicated that although the most accurate and reliable predictions of final biomass were achieved using remotely sensed data from mid-season to end-of-season, predictions in mid-season provided adequate results to differentiate between promising varieties for selection. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the accuracies of the predictive models showed that both the data source and regression method are important factors for a reliable prediction; however, the data source was more important with 69% significance, versus 28% significance for the regression method.

AB  - Blue agave is an important commercial crop in Mexico, and it is the main source of the traditional mexican beverage known as tequila. The variety of blue agave crop known as Tequilana Weber is a crucial element for tequila agribusiness and the agricultural economy in Mexico. The number of agave plants in the field is one of the main parameters for estimating production of tequila. In this manuscript, we describe a mathematical morphology-based algorithm that addresses the agave automatic counting task. The proposed methodology was applied to a set of real images collected using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle equipped with a digital Red-Green-Blue (RGB) camera. The number of plants automatically identified in the collected images was compared to the number of plants counted by hand. Accuracy of the proposed algorithm depended on the size heterogeneity of plants in the field and illumination. Accuracy ranged from 0.8309 to 0.9806, and performance of the proposed algorithm was satisfactory.

AB  - Soybean maturity is a trait of critical importance for the development of new soybean cultivars, nevertheless, its characterization based on visual ratings has many challenges. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) imagery-based high-throughput phenotyping methodologies have been proposed as an alternative to the traditional visual ratings of pod senescence. However, the lack of scalable and accurate methods to extract the desired information from the images remains a significant bottleneck in breeding programs. The objective of this study was to develop an image-based high-throughput phenotyping system for evaluating soybean maturity in breeding programs. Images were acquired twice a week, starting when the earlier lines began maturation until the latest ones were mature. Two complementary convolutional neural networks (CNN) were developed to predict the maturity date. The first using a single date and the second using the five best image dates identified by the first model. The proposed CNN architecture was validated using more than 15,000 ground truth observations from five trials, including data from three growing seasons and two countries. The trained model showed good generalization capability with a root mean squared error lower than two days in four out of five trials. Four methods of estimating prediction uncertainty showed potential at identifying different sources of errors in the maturity date predictions. The architecture developed solves limitations of previous research and can be used at scale in commercial breeding programs.

AB  - Manual traffic surveillance can be a daunting task as Traffic Management Centers operate a myriad of cameras installed over a network. Injecting some level of automation could help lighten the workload of human operators performing manual surveillance and facilitate making proactive decisions which would reduce the impact of incidents and recurring congestion on roadways. This article presents a novel approach to automatically monitor real time traffic footage using deep convolutional neural networks and a stand-alone graphical user interface. The authors describe the results of research received in the process of developing models that serve as an integrated framework for an artificial intelligence enabled traffic monitoring system. The proposed system deploys several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to automate different traffic monitoring needs. Taking advantage of a large database of annotated video surveillance data, deep learning-based models are trained to detect queues, track stationary vehicles, and tabulate vehicle counts. A pixel-level segmentation approach is applied to detect traffic queues and predict severity. Real-time object detection algorithms coupled with different tracking systems are deployed to automatically detect stranded vehicles as well as perform vehicular counts. At each stage of development, interesting experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Overall, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework performs satisfactorily under varied conditions without being immensely impacted by environmental hazards such as blurry camera views, low illumination, rain, or snow.

AB  - The growth of location-based services (LBS) has increased rapidly in last years, mainly due to the possibility to exploit low-cost sensors installed in portable devices, such as smartphones and tablets. This work aims to show a low-cost multi-sensor platform developed by the authors in which an ultra-wideband (UWB) indoor positioning system is added to a classical global navigation satellite systems&ndash;inertial navigation system (GNSS-INS) integration, in order to acquire different synchronized data for further data fusion analysis in order to exploit seamless positioning. The data fusion is based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) and on a geo-fencing approach which allows the navigation solution to be provided continuously. In particular, the proposed algorithm aims to solve a navigation task of a pedestrian user moving from an outdoor space to an indoor environment. The methodology and the system setup is presented with more details in the paper. The data acquired and the real-time positioning estimation are analysed in depth and compared with ground truth measurements. Particular attention is given to the UWB positioning system and its behaviour with respect to the environment. The proposed data fusion algorithm provides an overall horizontal and 3D accuracy of 35 cm and 45 cm, respectively, obtained considering 5 different measurement campaigns.

AB  - Immediate assessment of structural integrity of important civil infrastructures, like bridges, hospitals, or dams, is of utmost importance after natural disasters. Currently, inspection is performed manually by engineers who look for local damages and their extent on significant locations of the structure to understand its implication on its global stability. However, the whole process is time-consuming and prone to human errors. Due to their size and extent, some regions of civil structures are hard to gain access for manual inspection. In such situations, a vision-based system of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) programmed with Artificial Intelligence algorithms may be an effective alternative to carry out a health assessment of civil infrastructures in a timely manner. This paper proposes a framework of achieving the above-mentioned goal using computer vision and deep learning algorithms for detection of cracks on the concrete surface from its image by carrying out image segmentation of pixels, i.e., classification of pixels in an image of the concrete surface and whether it belongs to cracks or not. The image segmentation or dense pixel level classification is carried out using a deep neural network architecture named U-Net. Further, morphological operations on the segmented images result in dense measurements of crack geometry, like length, width, area, and crack orientation for individual cracks present in the image. The efficacy and robustness of the proposed method as a viable real-life application was validated by carrying out a laboratory experiment of a four-point bending test on an 8-foot-long concrete beam of which the video is recorded using a camera mounted on a UAV-based, as well as a still ground-based, video camera. Detection, quantification, and localization of damage on a civil infrastructure using the proposed framework can directly be used in the prognosis of the structure&rsquo;s ability to withstand service loads.

AB  - Capturing high spatial resolution imagery is becoming a standard operation in many agricultural applications. The increased capacity for image capture necessitates corresponding advances in analysis algorithms. This study introduces automated raster geoprocessing methods to automatically extract strawberry (Fragaria &times; ananassa) canopy size metrics using raster image analysis and utilize the extracted metrics in statistical modeling of strawberry dry weight. Automated canopy delineation and canopy size metrics extraction models were developed and implemented using ArcMap software v 10.7 and made available by the authors. The workflows were demonstrated using high spatial resolution (1 mm resolution) orthoimages and digital surface models (2 mm) of 34 strawberry plots (each containing 17 different plant genotypes) planted on raised beds. The images were captured on a weekly basis throughout the strawberry growing season (16 weeks) between early November and late February. The results of extracting four canopy size metrics (area, volume, average height, and height standard deviation) using automatically delineated and visually interpreted canopies were compared. The trends observed in the differences between canopy metrics extracted using the automatically delineated and visually interpreted canopies showed no significant differences. The R2 values of the models were 0.77 and 0.76 for the two datasets and the leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation root mean square error (RMSE) of the two models were 9.2 g and 9.4 g, respectively. The results show the feasibility of using automated methods for canopy delineation and canopy metric extraction to support plant phenotyping applications.

AB  - The open nature of radio propagation enables ubiquitous wireless communication. This allows for seamless data transmission. However, unauthorized users may pose a threat to the security of the data being transmitted to authorized users. This gives rise to network vulnerabilities such as hacking, eavesdropping, and jamming of the transmitted information. Physical layer security (PLS) has been identified as one of the promising security approaches to safeguard the transmission from eavesdroppers in a wireless network. It is an alternative to the computationally demanding and complex cryptographic algorithms and techniques. PLS has continually received exponential research interest owing to the possibility of exploiting the characteristics of the wireless channel. One of the main characteristics includes the random nature of the transmission channel. The aforesaid nature makes it possible for confidential and authentic signal transmission between the sender and the receiver in the physical layer. We start by introducing the basic theories of PLS, including the wiretap channel, information-theoretic security, and a brief discussion of the cryptography security technique. Furthermore, an overview of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication is provided. The main focus of our review is based on the existing key-less PLS optimization techniques, their limitations, and challenges. The paper also looks into the promising key research areas in addressing these shortfalls. Lastly, a comprehensive overview of some of the recent PLS research in 5G and 6G technologies of wireless communication networks is provided.

AB  - Recent advancements in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things (IoT) create new opportunities for autonomous industrial environments monitoring. Nevertheless, detecting anomalies in harsh industrial settings remains challenging. This paper proposes an edge-fog-cloud architecture with mobile IoT edge nodes carried on autonomous robots for thermal anomalies detection in aluminum factories. We use companion drones as fog nodes to deliver first response services and a cloud back-end for thermal anomalies analysis. We also propose a self-driving deep learning architecture and a thermal anomalies detection and visualization algorithm. Our results show our robot surveyors are low-cost, deliver reduced response time, and more accurately detect anomalies compared to human surveyors or fixed IoT nodes monitoring the same industrial area. Our self-driving architecture has a root mean square error of 0.19 comparable to VGG-19 with a significantly reduced complexity and three times the frame rate at 60 frames per second. Our thermal to visual registration algorithm maximizes mutual information in the image-gradient domain while adapting to different resolutions and camera frame rates.

AB  - Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is one of the significant indicators to measure environmental changes; thus, the relevant study of NPP in Northeast China, Asia, is essential to climate changes and ecological sustainable development. Based on the Global Production Efficiency (GLO-PEM) model, this study firstly estimated the NPP in Northeast China, from 2001 to 2019, and then analyzed its spatio-temporal evolution, future changing trend and phenology regularity. Over the years, the NPP of different forests type in Northeast China showed a gradual increasing trend. Compared with other different time stages, the high-value NPP (700&ndash;1300 gC&middot;m&minus;2&middot;a&minus;1) in Changbai Mountain, from 2017 to 2019, is more widely distributed. For instance, the NPP has an increasing rate of 6.92% compared to the stage of 2011&ndash;2015. Additionally, there was a significant advance at the start of the vegetation growth season (SOS), and a lag at the end of the vegetation growth season (EOS), from 2001 to 2019. Thus, the whole growth period of forests in Northeast China became prolonged with the change of phenology. Moreover, analysis on the sustainability of NPP in the future indicates that the reverse direction feature of NPP change will be slightly stronger than the co-directional feature, meaning that about 30.68% of the study area will switch from improvement to degradation. To conclude, these above studies could provide an important reference for the sustainable development of forests in Northeast China.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Wireless networks are vulnerable to jamming attacks. Jamming in wireless communication becomes a major research problem due to ease in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) launching and blocking of communication channels. Jamming is a subset of Denial of Service Attack (DoS) and an intentional interference where the malicious node disrupts the wireless communication by increasing the noise at the receiver node through transmission interference signal towards the target channel. In this work, the considered jammer is a UAV hovering around the target area to block the communication channel between two transceivers. We proposed a three-dimensional (3-D) UAV jamming localization scheme to track and detect the jammer position at each time step by employing a single boundary node observer. For this purpose, we developed two distributed Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based schemes: (1) the Distributed EKF (DEKF) scheme using the information of the received power from the jammer at a single nearby boundary node only and (2) Distance Ratio aided Distributed EKF (DEKF-DR) based scheme utilizing an edge node in addition to a single boundary node. Extensive simulations are conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed distributed algorithms for a 3-D trajectory and compared with that of the conventional Centralized EKF (EKF-Centr) based method (which is also modified for the 3-D scenario). The results show the clear supremacy of the proposed distributed algorithms with much lesser complexity in contrast to the conventional EKF-Centr technique.

AB  - The status, changes, and disturbances in geomorphological regimes can be regarded as controlling and regulating factors for biodiversity. Therefore, monitoring geomorphology at local, regional, and global scales is not only necessary to conserve geodiversity, but also to preserve biodiversity, as well as to improve biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Numerous remote sensing (RS) approaches and platforms have been used in the past to enable a cost-effective, increasingly freely available, comprehensive, repetitive, standardized, and objective monitoring of geomorphological characteristics and their traits. This contribution provides a state-of-the-art review for the RS-based monitoring of these characteristics and traits, by presenting examples of aeolian, fluvial, and coastal landforms. Different examples for monitoring geomorphology as a crucial discipline of geodiversity using RS are provided, discussing the implementation of RS technologies such as LiDAR, RADAR, as well as multi-spectral and hyperspectral sensor technologies. Furthermore, data products and RS technologies that could be used in the future for monitoring geomorphology are introduced. The use of spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait variation (STV) approaches with RS enable the status, changes, and disturbances of geomorphic diversity to be monitored. We focus on the requirements for future geomorphology monitoring specifically aimed at overcoming some key limitations of ecological modeling, namely: the implementation and linking of in-situ, close-range, air- and spaceborne RS technologies, geomorphic traits, and data science approaches as crucial components for a better understanding of the geomorphic impacts on complex ecosystems. This paper aims to impart multidimensional geomorphic information obtained by RS for improved utilization in biodiversity monitoring.

AB  - With the tremendous increase of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the different service requirements of these IoT applications, machine-type communication (MTC) has attracted considerable attention from both industry and academia. Owing to the prominent advantages of supporting pervasive connectivity and wide area coverage, the cellular network is advocated as the potential wireless solution to realize IoT deployment for MTC, and this creative network paradigm is called the cellular IoT (C-IoT). In this paper, we propose the three-layer structured C-IoT architecture for MTC and review the challenges for deploying green C-IoT. Then, effective strategies for realizing green C-IoT are presented, including the energy efficient and energy harvesting schemes. We put forward several strategies to make the C-IoT run in an energy-saving manner, such as efficient random access and barring mechanisms, self-adapting machine learning predictions, scheduling optimization, resource allocation, fog computing, and group-oriented transmission. As for the energy harvesting schemes, the ambient and dedicated energy harvesting strategies are investigated. Afterwards, we give a detailed case study, which shows the effectiveness of reducing power consumption for the proposed layered C-IoT architecture. Additionally, for real-time and non-real-time applications, the power consumption of different on-off states for MTC devices is discussed.

AB  - The environmental challenges the world faces nowadays have never been greater or more complex. Global areas covered by forests and urban woodlands are threatened by natural disasters that have increased dramatically during the last decades, in terms of both frequency and magnitude. Large-scale forest fires are one of the most harmful natural hazards affecting climate change and life around the world. Thus, to minimize their impacts on people and nature, the adoption of well-planned and closely coordinated effective prevention, early warning, and response approaches are necessary. This paper presents an overview of the optical remote sensing technologies used in early fire warning systems and provides an extensive survey on both flame and smoke detection algorithms employed by each technology. Three types of systems are identified, namely terrestrial, airborne, and spaceborne-based systems, while various models aiming to detect fire occurrences with high accuracy in challenging environments are studied. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of fire detection systems based on optical remote sensing are discussed aiming to contribute to future research projects for the development of early warning fire systems.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
SN  - 1999-4907

AB  - The breeding of forest trees is only a few decades old, and is a much more complicated, longer, and expensive endeavor than the breeding of agricultural crops. One breeding cycle for forest trees can take 20&ndash;30 years. Recent advances in genomics and molecular biology have revolutionized traditional plant breeding based on visual phenotype assessment: the development of different types of molecular markers has made genotype selection possible. Marker-assisted breeding can significantly accelerate the breeding process, but this method has not been shown to be effective for selection of complex traits on forest trees. This new method of genomic selection is based on the analysis of all effects of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) using a large number of molecular markers distributed throughout the genome, which makes it possible to assess the genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV) of an individual. This approach is expected to be much more efficient for forest tree improvement than traditional breeding. Here, we review the current state of the art in the application of genomic selection in forest tree breeding and discuss different methods of genotyping and phenotyping. We also compare the accuracies of genomic prediction models and highlight the importance of a prior cost-benefit analysis before implementing genomic selection. Perspectives for the further development of this approach in forest breeding are also discussed: expanding the range of species and the list of valuable traits, the application of high-throughput phenotyping methods, and the possibility of using epigenetic variance to improve of forest trees.

AB  - In many developed countries with a long history of urbanization, there is an increasing need for automated computer vision (CV)-based inspection to replace conventional labor-intensive visual inspection. This paper proposes a technique for the automated detection of multiple concrete damage based on a state-of-the-art deep learning framework, Mask R-CNN, developed for instance segmentation. The structure of Mask R-CNN, which consists of three stages (region proposal, classification, and segmentation) is optimized for multiple concrete damage detection. The optimized Mask R-CNN is trained with 765 concrete images including cracks, efflorescence, rebar exposure, and spalling. The performance of the trained Mask R-CNN is evaluated with 25 actual test images containing damage as well as environmental objects. Two types of metrics are proposed to measure localization and segmentation performance. On average, 90.41% precision and 90.81% recall are achieved for localization and 87.24% precision and 87.58% recall for segmentation, which indicates the excellent field applicability of the trained Mask R-CNN. This paper also qualitatively discusses the test results by explaining that the architecture of Mask R-CNN that is optimized for general object detection purposes, can be modified to detect long and slender shapes of cracks, rebar exposure, and efflorescence in further research.

AB  - Latest advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) allow us to detect crop lodging in a more precise and accurate way. However, the performance and generalization of a model capable of detecting lodging when the plants may show different spectral and morphological signatures have not been investigated much. This study investigated and compared the performance of models trained using aerial imagery collected at two growth stages of winter wheat with different canopy phenotypes. Specifically, three CNN-based models were trained with aerial imagery collected at early grain filling stage only, at physiological maturity only, and at both stages. Results show that the multi-stage model trained by images from both growth stages outperformed the models trained by images from individual growth stages on all testing data. The mean accuracy of the multi-stage model was 89.23% for both growth stages, while the mean of the other two models were 52.32% and 84.9%, respectively. This study demonstrates the importance of diversity of training data in big data analytics, and the feasibility of developing a universal decision support system for wheat lodging detection and mapping multi-growth stages with high-resolution remote sensing imagery.

AB  - Soil salinization is an important factor affecting winter wheat growth in coastal areas. The rapid, accurate and efficient estimation of soil salt content is of great significance for agricultural production. The Kenli area in the Yellow River Delta was taken as the research area. Three machine learning inversion models, namely, BP neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) were constructed using ground-measured data and UAV images, and the optimal model is applied to UAV images to obtain the salinity inversion result, which is used as the true salt value of the Sentinel-2A image to establish BPNN, SVM and RF collaborative inversion models, and apply the optimal model to the study area. The results showed that the RF collaborative inversion model is optimal, R2 = 0.885. The inversion results are verified by using the measured soil salt data in the study area, which is significantly better than the directly satellite remote sensing inversion method. This study integrates the advantages of multi-scale data and proposes an effective &ldquo;Satellite-UAV-Ground&rdquo; collaborative inversion method for soil salinity, so as to obtain more accurate soil information, and provide more effective technical support for agricultural production.

AB  - The damage investigation and inspection methods for infrastructures performed in small-scale (type III) facilities usually involve a visual examination by an inspector using surveying tools (e.g., cracking, crack microscope, etc.) in the field. These methods can interfere with the subjectivity of the inspector, which may reduce the objectivity and reliability of the record. Therefore, a new image analysis technique is needed to automatically detect cracks and analyze the characteristics of the cracks objectively. In this study, an image analysis technique using deep learning is developed to detect cracks and analyze characteristics (e.g., length, and width) in images for small-scale facilities. Three stages of image processing pipeline are proposed to obtain crack detection and its characteristics. In the first and second stages, two-dimensional convolutional neural networks are used for crack image detection (e.g., classification and segmentation). Based on convolution neural network for the detection, hierarchical feature learning architecture is applied into our deep learning network. After deep learning-based detection, in the third stage, thinning and tracking algorithms are applied to analyze length and width of crack in the image. The performance of the proposed method was tested using various crack images with label and the results showed good performance of crack detection and its measurement.

AB  - Recently, more and more smart homes have become one of important parts of home infrastructure. However, most of the smart home applications are not interconnected and remain isolated. They use the cloud center as the control platform, which increases the risk of link congestion and data security. Thus, in the future, smart homes based on edge computing without using cloud center become an important research area. In this paper, we assume that all applications in a smart home environment are composed of edge nodes and users. In order to maximize the utility of users, we assume that all users and edge nodes are placed in a market and formulate a pricing resource allocation model with utility maximization. We apply the Lagrangian method to analyze the model, so an edge node (provider in the market) allocates its resources to a user (customer in the market) based on the prices of resources and the utility related to the preference of users. To obtain the optimal resource allocation, we propose a pricing-based resource allocation algorithm by using low-pass filtering scheme and conform that the proposed algorithm can achieve an optimum within reasonable convergence times through some numerical examples.

SN  - 2624-7402

AB  - Black spot is one of the seriously damaging plant diseases in China, especially in rose production. Hyperspectral technology reflects both external features and internal structure information of measured samples, which can be used to identify the disease. In this research, both the spectral and image features of two infected roses with black spot were used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Multiple scattering correction (MSC) and standard normal variable (SNV) methods were applied to preprocess the spectral data. Cropping, median filtering and binarization were pretreatments used on the hyperspectral images. Three CNN models based on Alexnet, VGG16 and neural discriminative dimensionality reduction (NDDR) were evaluated by analyzing the classification accuracy and loss function. The results show that the CNN model based on the fusion of features has higher accuracy. The highest accuracies of detection of blackspot in different roses are 12&ndash;26 (100%) and 13&ndash;54 (99.95%), applying the NDDR-CNN model. Therefore, this research indicates that the spectral analysis based on CNN can detect black spot of roses, which provides a reference for the detection of other plant diseases, and has favorable research significance as well as prospect for development.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Predicting the crop nitrogen (N) nutrition status is critical for optimizing nitrogen fertilizer application. The present study examined the ability of multiple image features derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB images for winter wheat N status estimation across multiple critical growth stages. The image features consisted of RGB-based vegetation indices (VIs), color parameters, and textures, which represented image features of different aspects and different types. To determine which N status indicators could be well-estimated, we considered two mass-based N status indicators (i.e., the leaf N concentration (LNC) and plant N concentration (PNC)) and two area-based N status indicators (i.e., the leaf N density (LND) and plant N density (PND)). Sixteen RGB-based VIs associated with crop growth were selected. Five color space models, including RGB, HSV, L*a*b*, L*c*h*, and L*u*v*, were used to quantify the winter wheat canopy color. The combination of Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and Gabor-based textures with four orientations and five scales was proposed to estimate the winter wheat N status. The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based textures with four orientations were extracted for comparison. The heterogeneity in the textures of different orientations was evaluated using the measures of mean and coefficient of variation (CV). The variable importance in projection (VIP) derived from partial least square regression (PLSR) and a band analysis tool based on Gaussian processes regression (GPR-BAT) were used to identify the best performing image features for the N status estimation. The results indicated that (1) the combination of RGB-based VIs or color parameters only could produce reliable estimates of PND and the GPR model based on the combination of color parameters yielded a higher accuracy for the estimation of PND (R2val = 0.571, RMSEval = 2.846 g/m2, and RPDval = 1.532), compared to that based on the combination of RGB-based VIs; (2) there was no significant heterogeneity in the textures of different orientations and the textures of 45 degrees were recommended in the winter wheat N status estimation; (3) compared with the RGB-based VIs and color parameters, the GPR model based on the Gabor-based textures produced a higher accuracy for the estimation of PND (R2val = 0.675, RMSEval = 2.493 g/m2, and RPDval = 1.748) and the PLSR model based on the GLCM-based textures produced a higher accuracy for the estimation of PNC (R2val = 0.612, RMSEval = 0.380%, and RPDval = 1.601); and (4) the combined use of RGB-based VIs, color parameters, and textures produced comparable estimation results to using textures alone. Both VIP-PLSR and GPR-BAT analyses confirmed that image textures contributed most to the estimation of winter wheat N status. The experimental results reveal the potential of image textures derived from high-definition UAV-based RGB images for the estimation of the winter wheat N status. They also suggest that a conventional low-cost digital camera mounted on a UAV could be well-suited for winter wheat N status monitoring in a fast and non-destructive way.

AB  - This paper combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with meta-learning and proposes a novel approach, named meta twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (Meta-TD3), to realize the control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), allowing a UAV to quickly track a target in an environment where the motion of a target is uncertain. This approach can be applied to a variety of scenarios, such as wildlife protection, emergency aid, and remote sensing. We consider a multi-task experience replay buffer to provide data for the multi-task learning of the DRL algorithm, and we combine meta-learning to develop a multi-task reinforcement learning update method to ensure the generalization capability of reinforcement learning. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), experimental results show that the Meta-TD3 algorithm has achieved a great improvement in terms of both convergence value and convergence rate. In a UAV target tracking problem, Meta-TD3 only requires a few steps to train to enable a UAV to adapt quickly to a new target movement mode more and maintain a better tracking effectiveness.

AB  - Debris-covered glaciers are common features on the eastern Pamir and serve as important indicators of climate change promptly. However, mapping of debris-covered glaciers in alpine regions is still challenging due to many factors including the spectral similarity between debris and the adjacent bedrock, shadows cast from mountains and clouds, and seasonal snow cover. Considering that few studies have added movement velocity features when extracting glacier boundaries, we innovatively developed an automatic algorithm consisting of rule-based image segmentation and Random Forest to extract information about debris-covered glaciers with Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data for spectral, texture and temperature features, multi-digital elevation models (DEMs) for elevation and topographic features, and the Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE) for movement velocity features, and accuracy evaluation was performed to determine the optimal feature combination extraction of debris-covered glaciers. The study found that the overall accuracy of extracting debris-covered glaciers using combined movement velocity features is 97.60%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.9624, which is better than the extraction results using other schemes. The high classification accuracy obtained using our method overcomes most of the above-mentioned challenges and can detect debris-covered glaciers, illustrating that this method can be executed efficiently, which will further help water resources management.

With the recent advancements in sensor technologies, data management and data analytics, currently, several RS options are available to the agricultural community. However, the agricultural sector is yet to implement RS technologies fully due to knowledge gaps on their sufficiency, appropriateness and techno-economic feasibilities. This study reviewed the literature between 2000 to 2019 that focused on the application of RS technologies in production agriculture, ranging from field preparation, planting, and in-season applications to harvesting, with the objective of contributing to the scientific understanding on the potential for RS technologies to support decision-making within different production stages. We found an increasing trend in the use of RS technologies in agricultural production over the past 20 years, with a sharp increase in applications of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) after 2015. The largest number of scientific papers related to UASs originated from Europe (34%), followed by the United States (20%) and China (11%). Most of the prior RS studies have focused on soil moisture and in-season crop health monitoring, and less in areas such as soil compaction, subsurface drainage, and crop grain quality monitoring. In summary, the literature highlighted that RS technologies can be used to support site-specific management decisions at various stages of crop production, helping to optimize crop production while addressing environmental quality, profitability, and sustainability.

AB  - Currently, deploying fixed terrestrial infrastructures is not cost-effective in temporary circumstances, such as natural disasters, hotspots, and so on. Thus, we consider a system of caching-based UAV-assisted communications between multiple ground users (GUs) and a local station (LS). Specifically, a UAV is exploited to cache data from the LS and then serve GUs&rsquo; requests to handle the issue of unavailable or damaged links from the LS to the GUs. The UAV can harvest solar energy for its operation. We investigate joint cache scheduling and power allocation schemes by using the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique to maximize the long-term downlink rate. Two scenarios for the network are taken into account. In the first, the harvested energy distribution of the GUs is assumed to be known, and we propose a partially observable Markov decision process framework such that the UAV can allocate optimal transmission power for each GU based on proper content caching over each flight period. In the second scenario where the UAV does not know the environment&rsquo;s dynamics in advance, an actor-critic-based scheme is proposed to achieve a solution by learning with a dynamic environment. Afterwards, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, compared to baseline approaches.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - The agricultural industry suffers from a significant amount of food waste, some of which originates from an inability to apply site-specific management at the farm-level. Snap bean, a broad-acre crop that covers hundreds of thousands of acres across the USA, is not exempt from this need for informed, within-field, and spatially-explicit management approaches. This study aimed to assess the utility of machine learning algorithms for growth stage and pod maturity classification of snap bean (cv. Huntington), as well as detecting and discriminating spectral and biophysical features that lead to accurate classification results. Four major growth stages and six main sieve size pod maturity levels were evaluated for growth stage and pod maturity classification, respectively. A point-based in situ spectroradiometer in the visible-near-infrared and shortwave-infrared domains (VNIR-SWIR; 400&ndash;2500 nm) was used and the radiance values were converted to reflectance to normalize for any illumination change between samples. After preprocessing the raw data, we approached pod maturity assessment with multi-class classification and growth stage determination with binary and multi-class classification methods. Results from the growth stage assessment via the binary method exhibited accuracies ranging from 90&ndash;98%, with the best mathematical enhancement method being the continuum-removal approach. The growth stage multi-class classification method used raw reflectance data and identified a pair of wavelengths, 493 nm and 640 nm, in two basic transforms (ratio and normalized difference), yielding high accuracies (~79%). Pod maturity assessment detected narrow-band wavelengths in the VIS and SWIR region, separating between not ready-to-harvest and ready-to-harvest scenarios with classification measures at the ~78% level by using continuum-removed spectra. Our work is a best-case scenario, i.e., we consider it a stepping-stone to understanding snap bean harvest maturity assessment via hyperspectral sensing at a scalable level (i.e., airborne systems). Future work involves transferring the concepts to unmanned aerial system (UAS) field experiments and validating whether or not a simple multispectral camera, mounted on a UAS, could incorporate &lt; 10 spectral bands to meet the need of both growth stage and pod maturity classification in snap bean production.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Remote sensing can be applied to optimize efficiency in pest detection, as an insect sampling tool. This efficiency can result in more precise recommendations for decision making in pest management. Pest detection with remote sensing is often feasible because plant biotic stress caused by herbivory triggers a defensive physiological response in plants, which generally results in changes to leaf reflectance. Therefore, the key objective of this study was to use hyperspectral proximal remote sensing and gas exchange parameters to characterize peanut leaf responses to herbivory by Stegasta bosqueella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) and Spodoptera cosmioides (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), two major pests in South American peanut (Arachis hypogaea) production. The experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with a 2 &times; 3 factorial scheme (two lepidopterous species and 3 categories of injury). The injury treatments were: (1) natural infestation by third instars of S. bosqueella, (2) natural infestation by third instars of S. cosmioides, and (3) simulation of injury with scissors to mimic larval injury. We verified that peanut leaf reflectance is different between herbivory by the two larval species, but similar among real and simulated defoliation. Similarly, we observed differences in photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration, and photosynthetic water use efficiency only between species but not between real and simulated larval defoliation. Our results provide information that is essential for the development of sampling and economic thresholds of S. bosqueella and S. cosmioides on the peanut.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are cost-effective, flexible and offer a wide range of applications. If equipped with optical sensors, orthophotos with very high spatial resolution can be retrieved using photogrammetric processing. The use of these images in multi-temporal analysis and the combination with spatial data imposes high demands on their spatial accuracy. This georeferencing accuracy of UAS orthomosaics is generally expressed as the checkpoint error. However, the checkpoint error alone gives no information about the reproducibility of the photogrammetrical compilation of orthomosaics. This study optimizes the geolocation of UAS orthomosaics time series and evaluates their reproducibility. A correlation analysis of repeatedly computed orthomosaics with identical parameters revealed a reproducibility of 99% in a grassland and 75% in a forest area. Between time steps, the corresponding positional errors of digitized objects lie between 0.07 m in the grassland and 0.3 m in the forest canopy. The novel methods were integrated into a processing workflow to enhance the traceability and increase the quality of UAS remote sensing.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Deep learning has become an effective method for hyperspectral image classification. However, the high band correlation and data volume associated with airborne hyperspectral images, and the insufficiency of training samples, present challenges to the application of deep learning in airborne image classification. Prototypical networks are practical deep learning networks that have demonstrated effectiveness in handling small-sample classification. In this study, an improved prototypical network is proposed (by adding L2 regularization to the convolutional layer and dropout to the maximum pooling layer) to address the problem of overfitting in small-sample classification. The proposed network has an optimal sample window for classification, and the window size is related to the area and distribution of the study area. After performing dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis, the time required for training using hyperspectral images shortened significantly, and the test accuracy increased drastically. Furthermore, when the size of the sample window was 27 &times; 27 after dimensionality reduction, the overall accuracy of forest species classification was 98.53%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.9838. Therefore, by using an improved prototypical network with a sample window of an appropriate size, the network yielded desirable classification results, thereby demonstrating its suitability for the fine classification and mapping of tree species.

AB  - The number of severe storm events has increased in recent decades due to climate change. These storms are one of the main causes for timber loss in European forests and damaged areas are prone to further degradation by, for example, bark beetle infestations. Usually, manual mapping of damaged areas based on aerial photographs is conducted by forest departments. This is very time-consuming and therefore automatic detection of windthrows based on active and passive remote sensing data is an ongoing research topic. In this study we evaluated state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for calamity assessment. The study area is in in the northern part of Hesse (Germany) and was covered by twelve Sentinel-2 scenes from 2018. Labels of damaged areas from the Friedericke storm (18 January 2018) were provided by HessenForst. We conducted several experiments based on a custom U-Net setup to derive the optimal architecture and input data as well as to assess the transferability of the model. Results highlight the possibility to detect damaged forest areas using Sentinel-2 data. Using a binary classification, accuracies of more than 92% were achieved with an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 46.6%. The proposed workflow was integrated into ArcGIS and is suitable for fast detection of damaged areas directly after a storm and for disaster management but is limited by the deca-meter spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 data.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - To perform precise approach and landing concerning an aircraft in automatic mode, local airfield-based landing systems are used. For joint processing of measurements of the onboard inertial navigation systems (INS), altimeters and local landing systems, the Kalman filter is usually used. The application of the quadratic criterion in the Kalman filter entails the well-known problem of high sensitivity of the estimate to anomalous measurement errors. During the automatic approach phase, abnormal navigation errors can lead to disaster, so the data fusion algorithm must automatically identify and isolate abnormal measurements. This paper presents a recurrent filtering algorithm that is resistant to anomalous errors in measurements and considers its application in the data fusion problem for landing system measurements with onboard sensor measurements&mdash;INS and altimeters. The robustness of the estimate is achieved through the combined use of the least modulus method and the Kalman filter. To detect and isolate failures the chi-square criterion is used. It makes possible the customization of the algorithm in accordance with the requirements for false alarm probability and the alarm missing probability. Testing results of the robust filtering algorithm are given both for synthesized data and for real measurements.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Extreme rainfall has caused severe road damage and landslide disasters in mountainous areas. Rainfall forecasting derived from remote sensing data has been widely adopted for disaster prevention and early warning as a trend in recent years. By integrating high-resolution radar rain data, for example, the QPESUMS (quantitative precipitation estimation and segregation using multiple sensors) system provides a great opportunity to establish the extreme climate-based landslide susceptibility model, which would be helpful in the prevention of hillslope disasters under climate change. QPESUMS was adopted to obtain spatio-temporal rainfall patterns, and further, multi-temporal landslide inventories (2003&ndash;2018) would integrate with other explanatory factors and therefore, we can establish the logistic regression method for prediction of landslide susceptibility sites in the Laonong River watershed, which was devastated by Typhoon Morakot in 2009. Simulations of landslide susceptibility under the critical rainfall (300, 600, and 900 mm) were designed to verify the model&rsquo;s sensitivity. Due to the orographic effect, rainfall was concentrated at the low mountainous and middle elevation areas in the southern Laonong River watershed. Landslide change analysis indicates that the landslide ratio increased from 1.5% to 7.0% after Typhoon Morakot in 2009. Subsequently, the landslide ratio fluctuated between 3.5% and 4.5% after 2012, which indicates that the recovery of landslide areas is still in progress. The validation results showed that the calibrated model of 2005 is preferred in the general period, with an accuracy of 78%. For extreme rainfall typhoons, the calibrated model of 2009 would perform better (72%). This study presented that the integration of multi-temporal landslide inventories in a logistic regression model is capable of predicting rainfall-triggered landslide risk under climate change.

SN  - 2218-6581

AB  - As systems grow more automatized, the human operator is all too often overlooked. Although human-robot interaction (HRI) can be quite demanding in terms of cognitive resources, the mental states (MS) of the operators are not yet taken into account by existing systems. As humans are no providential agents, this lack can lead to hazardous situations. The growing number of neurophysiology and machine learning tools now allows for efficient operators&rsquo; MS monitoring. Sending feedback on MS in a closed-loop solution is therefore at hand. Involving a consistent automated planning technique to handle such a process could be a significant asset. This perspective article was meant to provide the reader with a synthesis of the significant literature with a view to implementing systems that adapt to the operator&rsquo;s MS to improve human-robot operations&rsquo; safety and performance. First of all, the need for this approach is detailed regarding remote operation, an example of HRI. Then, several MS identified as crucial for this type of HRI are defined, along with relevant electrophysiological markers. A focus is made on prime degraded MS linked to time-on-task and task demands, as well as collateral MS linked to system outputs (i.e., feedback and alarms). Lastly, the principle of symbiotic HRI is detailed and one solution is proposed to include the operator state vector into the system using a mixed-initiative decisional framework to drive such an interaction.

TI  - Estimation of Tree Height by Combining Low Density Airborne LiDAR Data and Images Using the 3D Tree Model: A Case Study in a Subtropical Forest in China

PY  - 2020
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SN  - 1999-4907

AB  - In general, low density airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data are typically used to obtain the average height of forest trees. If the data could be used to obtain the tree height at the single tree level, it would greatly extend the usage of the data. Since the tree top position is often missed by the low density LiDAR pulse point, the estimated forest tree height at the single tree level is generally lower than the actual tree height when low density LiDAR data are used for the estimation. To resolve this problem, in this paper, a modified approach based on three-dimensional (3D) parameter tree model was adopted to reconstruct the tree height at the single tree level by combining the characteristics of high resolution remote sensing images and low density airborne LiDAR data. The approach was applied to two coniferous forest plots in the subtropical forest region, Fujian Province, China. The following conclusions were reached after analyzing the results: The marker-controlled watershed segmentation method is able to effectively extract the crown profile from sub meter-level resolution images without the aid of the height information of LiDAR data. The adaptive local maximum method satisfies the need for detecting the vertex of a single tree crown. The improved following-valley approach is available for estimating the tree crown diameter. The 3D parameter tree model, which can take advantage of low-density airborne LiDAR data and high resolution images, is feasible for improving the estimation accuracy of the tree height. Compared to the tree height results from only using the low density LiDAR data, this approach can achieve higher estimation accuracy. The accuracy of the tree height estimation at the single tree level for two test areas was more than 80%, and the average estimation error of the tree height was 0.7 m. The modified approach based on the three-dimensional parameter tree model can effectively increase the estimation accuracy of individual tree height by combining the characteristics of high resolution remote sensing images and low density airborne LiDAR data.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Cereals grains are the prime component of the human diet worldwide. To promote food security and sustainability, new approaches to non-chemical weed control are needed. Early vigor cultivars with enhanced weed-competitiveness ability are a potential tool, nonetheless, the introduction of such trait in breeding may be a long and labor-intensive process. Here, two image-driven plant phenotyping methods were evaluated to facilitate effective and accurate selection for early vigor in cereals. For that purpose, two triticale genotypes differentiating in vigor and growth rate early in the season were selected as model plants: X-1010 (high) and Triticale1 (low). Two modeling approaches, 2-D and 3-D, were applied on the plants offering an evaluation of various morphological growth parameters for the triticale canopy development, under controlled and field conditions. The morphological advantage of X-1010 was observed only at the initial growth stages, which was reflected by significantly higher growth parameter values compared to the Triticale1 genotype. Both modeling approaches were sensitive enough to detect phenotypic differences in growth as early as 21 days after sowing. All growth parameters indicated a faster early growth of X-1010. However, the 2-D related parameter [projected shoot area (PSA)] is the most available one that can be extracted via end user-friendly imaging equipment. PSA provided adequate indication for the triticale early growth under weed-competition conditions and for the improved weed-competition ability. The adequate phenotyping ability for early growth and competition was robust under controlled and field conditions. PSA can be extracted from close and remote sensing platforms, thus, facilitate high throughput screening. Overall, the results of this study may improve cereal breeding for early vigor and weed-competitiveness.

AB  - Data on the distribution of tree species are often requested by forest managers, inventory agencies, foresters as well as private and municipal forest owners. However, the automated detection of tree species based on passive remote sensing data from aerial surveys is still not sufficiently developed to achieve reliable results independent of the phenological stage, time of day, season, tree vitality and prevailing atmospheric conditions. Here, we introduce a novel tree species classification approach based on high resolution RGB image data gathered during automated UAV flights that overcomes these insufficiencies. For the classification task, a computationally lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed. We show that with the chosen CNN model architecture, average classification accuracies of 92% can be reached independently of the illumination conditions and the phenological stages of four different tree species. We also show that a minimal ground sampling density of 1.6 cm/px is needed for the classification model to be able to make use of the spatial-structural information in the data. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the presented approach to derive spatially explicit tree species information, a gridded product is generated that yields an average classification accuracy of 88%.

AB  - Bathymetry is considered an important component in marine applications as several coastal erosion monitoring and engineering projects are carried out in this field. It is traditionally acquired via shipboard echo sounding, but nowadays, multispectral satellite imagery is also commonly applied using different remote sensing-based algorithms. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) relates the surface reflectance of shallow coastal waters to the depth of the water column. The present study shows the results of the application of Stumpf and Lyzenga algorithms to derive the bathymetry for a small area using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), also known as a drone, equipped with a multispectral camera acquiring images in the same WorldView-2 satellite sensor spectral bands. A hydrographic Multibeam Echosounder survey was performed in the same period in order to validate the method&rsquo;s results and accuracy. The study area was approximately 0.5 km2 and located in Tuscany (Italy). Because of the high percentage of water in the images, a new methodology was also implemented for producing a georeferenced orthophoto mosaic. UAV multispectral images were processed to retrieve bathymetric data for testing different band combinations and evaluating the accuracy as a function of the density and quantity of sea bottom control points. Our results indicate that UAV-Derived Bathymetry (UDB) permits an accuracy of about 20 cm to be obtained in bathymetric mapping in shallow waters, minimizing operative expenses and giving the possibility to program a coastal monitoring surveying activity. The full sea bottom coverage obtained using this methodology permits detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) comparable to a Multibeam Echosounder survey, and can also be applied in very shallow waters, where the traditional hydrographic approach requires hard fieldwork and presents operational limits.

AB  - Ganodermaboninense (G. boninense) is a fungus that causes one of the most destructive diseases in oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia called basal stem rot (BSR), resulting in annual losses of up to USD 500 million. The G. boninense infects both mature trees and seedlings. The current practice of detection still depends on manual inspection by a human expert every two weeks. This study aimed to detect early G. boninense infections using visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) hyperspectral images where there are no BSR symptoms present. Twenty-eight samples of oil palm seedlings at five months old were used whereby 15 of them were inoculated with the G. boninense pathogen. Five months later, spectral reflectance oil palm leaflets taken from fronds 1 (F1) and 2 (F2) were obtained from the VIS-NIR hyperspectral images. The significant bands were identified based on the high separation between uninoculated (U) and inoculated (I) seedlings. The results indicate that the differences were evidently seen in the NIR spectrum. The bands were later used as input parameters for the development of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification models, and these bands were optimized according to the classification accuracy achieved by the classifiers. It was observed that the U and I seedlings were excellently classified with 100% accuracy using 35 bands and 18 bands of F1. However, the combination of F1 and F2 (F12) gave better accuracy than F2 and almost similar to F1 for specific classifiers. This finding will provide an advantage when using aerial images where there is no need to separate F1 and F2 during the data pre-processing stage.

AB  - The presented study demonstrates a bi-sensor approach suitable for rapid and precise up-to-date mapping of forest canopy gaps for the larger spatial extent. The approach makes use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) red, green and blue (RGB) images on smaller areas for highly precise forest canopy mask creation. Sentinel-2 was used as a scaling platform for transferring information from the UAV to a wider spatial extent. Various approaches to an improvement in the predictive performance were examined: (I) the highest R2 of the single satellite index was 0.57, (II) the highest R2 using multiple features obtained from the single-date, S-2 image was 0.624, and (III) the highest R2 on the multitemporal set of S-2 images was 0.697. Satellite indices such as Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI), Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index (IPVI), Normalized Difference Index (NDI45), Pigment-Specific Simple Ratio Index (PSSRa), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI), Color Index (CI), Redness Index (RI), and Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI) were the dominant predictors in most of the Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The more complex ML algorithms such as the Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Catboost that provided the best performance on the training set exhibited weaker generalization capabilities. Therefore, a simpler and more robust Elastic Net (ENET) algorithm was chosen for the final map creation.

AB  - Indonesia is the world&rsquo;s fourth largest coffee producer. Coffee plantations cover 1.2 million ha of the country with a production of 500 kg/ha. However, information regarding the distribution of coffee plantations in Indonesia is limited. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of classification model and determine its important variables for mapping coffee plantations. The model obtained 29 variables which derived from the integration of multi-resolution, multi-temporal, and multi-sensor remote sensing data, namely, pan-sharpened GeoEye-1, multi-temporal Sentinel 2, and DEMNAS. Applying a random forest algorithm (tree = 1000, mtry = all variables, minimum node size: 6), this model achieved overall accuracy, kappa statistics, producer accuracy, and user accuracy of 79.333%, 0.774, 92.000%, and 90.790%, respectively. In addition, 12 most important variables achieved overall accuracy, kappa statistics, producer accuracy, and user accuracy 79.333%, 0.774, 91.333%, and 84.570%, respectively. Our results indicate that random forest algorithm is efficient in mapping coffee plantations in an agroforestry system.

AB  - This paper proposes an innovative approach to classify the losses related to photovoltaic (PV) systems, through the use of thermographic non-destructive tests (TNDTs) supported by artificial intelligence techniques. Low electricity production in PV systems can be caused by an efficiency decrease in PV modules due to abnormal operating conditions such as failures or malfunctions. The most common performance decreases are due to the presence of dirt on the surface of the module, the impact of which depends on many parameters and conditions, and can be identified through the use of the TNDTs. The proposed approach allows one to automatically classify the thermographic images from the convolutional neural network (CNN) of the system, achieving an accuracy of 98% in tests that last a couple of minutes. This approach, compared to approaches in literature, offers numerous advantages, including speed of execution, speed of diagnosis, reduced costs, reduction in electricity production losses.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Coverage path planning on a complex free-form surface is a representative problem that has been steadily investigated in path planning and automatic control. However, most methods do not consider many optimisation conditions and cannot deal with complex surfaces, closed surfaces, and the intersection of multiple surfaces. In this study, a novel and efficient coverage path-planning method is proposed that considers trajectory optimisation information and uses point cloud data for environmental modelling. First, the point cloud data are denoised and simplified. Then, the path points are converted into the rotation angle of each joint of the manipulator. A mathematical model dedicated to energy consumption, processing time, and path smoothness as optimisation objectives is developed, and an improved ant colony algorithm is used to solve this problem. Two measures are proposed to prevent the algorithm from being trapped in a local optimum, thereby improving the global search ability of the algorithm. The standard test results indicate that the improved algorithm performs better than the ant colony algorithm and the max&ndash;min ant system. The numerical simulation results reveal that compared with the point cloud slicing technique, the proposed method can obtain a more efficient path. The laser ablation de-rusting experiment results specify the utility of the proposed approach.

VL  - 12
IS  - 12
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Domain adaptation manages to learn a robust classifier for target domain, using the source domain, but they often follow different distributions. To bridge distribution shift between the two domains, most of previous works aim to align their feature distributions through feature transformation, of which optimal transport for domain adaptation has attract researchers&rsquo; interest, as it can exploit the local information of the two domains in the process of mapping the source instances to the target ones by minimizing Wasserstein distance between their feature distributions. However, it may weaken the feature discriminability of source domain, thus degrade domain adaptation performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes a two-stage feature-based adaptation approach, referred to as optimal transport with dimensionality reduction (OTDR). In the first stage, we apply the dimensionality reduction with intradomain variant maximization but source intraclass compactness minimization, to separate data samples as much as possible and enhance the feature discriminability of the source domain. In the second stage, we leverage optimal transport-based technique to preserve the local information of the two domains. Notably, the desirable properties in the first stage can mitigate the degradation of feature discriminability of the source domain in the second stage. Extensive experiments on several cross-domain image datasets validate that OTDR is superior to its competitors in classification accuracy.

AB  - This work addresses the problem of using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to deploy a wireless aerial relay communications infrastructure for stations scattered on the ground. In our problem, every station in the network must be assigned to a single UAV, which is responsible for handling all data transfer on behalf of the stations that are assigned to it. Consequently, the placement of UAVs is key to achieving both network coverage and the maximization of the aggregate link capacities between UAVs and stations, and among the UAVs themselves. Because the complexity of this problem increases significantly with the number of stations to cover, for a given fixed number p of available UAVs, we model it as a single allocation p-hub median optimization problem, and we propose a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm to solve it. A series of numerical experiments illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm against traditional optimization tools, which achieves high-quality results in very short time intervals, thus making it an attractive solution for real-world application scenarios.

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Extracting diverse spectral features from hyperspectral images has become a hot topic in recent years. However, these models are time consuming for training and test and suffer from a poor discriminative ability, resulting in low classification accuracy. In this paper, we design an effective feature extracting framework for the spectra of hyperspectral data. We construct a structured dictionary to encode spectral information and apply learning machine to map coding coefficients. To reduce training and testing time, the sparsity constraint is replaced by a block-diagonal constraint to accelerate the iteration, and an efficient extreme learning machine is employed to fit the spectral characteristics. To optimize the discriminative ability of our model, we first add spectral convolution to extract abundant spectral information. Then, we design shared constraints for subdictionaries so that the common features of subdictionaries can be expressed more effectively, and the discriminative and reconstructive ability of dictionary will be improved. The experimental results on diverse databases show that the proposed feature extraction framework can not only greatly reduce the training and testing time, but also lead to very competitive accuracy performance compared with deep learning models.

AB  - Considering the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory, 3D antenna array, and 3D beamforming of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a novel non-stationary millimeter wave (mmWave) geometry-based stochastic model for UAV to vehicle communication channels is proposed. Based on the analysis results of measured and ray tracing simulation data of UAV mmWave communication links, the proposed parametric channel model is constructed by a line-of-sight path, a ground specular path, and two strongest single-bounce paths. Meanwhile, a new parameter computation method is also developed, which is divided into the deterministic (or geometry-based) part and the random (or empirical) part. The simulated power delay profile and power angle profile demonstrate that the statistical properties of proposed channel model are time-variant with respect to the scattering scenarios, positions and beam direction. Moreover, the simulation results of autocorrelation functions fit well with the theoretical ones as well as the measured ones.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 12

SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - This study investigated how different remote sensing techniques can be combined to accurately monitor mangroves. In this paper, we present a framework to use drone imagery to calculate correction factors which can improve the accuracy of satellite-based mangrove extent. We focus on semi-arid dwarf mangroves of Baja California Sur, Mexico, where the mangroves tend to be stunted in height and found in small patches, as well as larger forests. Using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro, we imaged mangroves and labeled the extent by manual classification in QGIS. Using ArcGIS, we compared satellite-based mangrove extent maps from Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) in 2016 and Mexico&rsquo;s national government agency (National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity, CONABIO) in 2015, with extent maps generated from in situ drone studies in 2018 and 2019. We found that satellite-based extent maps generally overestimated mangrove coverage compared to that of drone-based maps. To correct this overestimation, we developed a method to derive correction factors for GMW mangrove extent. These correction factors correspond to specific pixel patterns generated from a convolution analysis and mangrove coverage defined from drone imagery. We validated our model by using repeated k-fold cross-validation, producing an accuracy of 98.3% &plusmn; 2.1%. Overall, drones and satellites are complementary tools, and the rise of machine learning can help stakeholders further leverage the strengths of the two tools, to better monitor mangroves for local, national, and international management.

AB  - The existing remote sensing image datasets target the identification of objects, features, or man-made targets but lack the ability to provide the date and spatial information for the same feature in the time-series images. The spatial and temporal information is important for machine learning methods so that networks can be trained to support precision classification, particularly for agricultural applications of specific crops with distinct phenological growth stages. In this paper, we built a high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image dataset for middle-season rice. We scheduled the UAV data acquisition in five villages of Hubei Province for three years, including 11 or 13 growing stages in each year that were accompanied by the annual agricultural surveying business. We investigated the accuracy of the vector maps for each field block and the precise information regarding the crops in the field by surveying each village and periodically arranging the UAV flight tasks on a weekly basis during the phenological stages. Subsequently, we developed a method to generate the samples automatically. Finally, we built a high-resolution UAV image dataset, including over 500,000 samples with the location and phenological growth stage information, and employed the imagery dataset in several machine learning algorithms for classification. We performed two exams to test our dataset. First, we used four classical deep learning networks for the fine classification of spatial and temporal information. Second, we used typical models to test the land cover on our dataset and compared this with the UCMerced Land Use Dataset and RSSCN7 Dataset. The results showed that the proposed image dataset supported typical deep learning networks in the classification task to identify the location and time of middle-season rice and achieved high accuracy with the public image dataset.

AB  - The p&aacute;ramo is home to a significant proportion of global biodiversity and provides essential services for the development of life for millions of people in Ecuador. However, land use/land cover (LULC) changes threaten biodiversity and modify its functioning. The objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the conservation status of the herbaceous p&aacute;ramo (HP) ecosystem by analyzing its LULC in Ecuador&rsquo;s southern region. (2) to identify possible regions where the native p&aacute;ramo ecosystem is being restored. We analyzed Landsat 8 images using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and a Classifier Decision Tree (CDT) to achieve these objectives. The results show that the native herbaceous p&aacute;ramo (NHP) ecosystem is being transformed into an anthropogenic HP (AHP). The area covered by the NHP ecosystem (296,964 ha) has been reduced by 50% (149,834 ha). Nevertheless, we identified five regions where the NHP is upgrading. These regions are relevant for studying NHP regeneration in Ecuador&rsquo;s southern region, where soils are mostly andosols. The LU of the p&aacute;ramo, with cycles of exploitation, abandonment, and regeneration in a secondary p&aacute;ramo, is transforming the NHP ecosystem. These exploitation practices, global climate change, and lack of knowledge about the NHP ecosystem&rsquo;s regeneration and its soils&rsquo; recovery threaten to substantially reduce the NHP area, its functionality, and its ecosystem services.

AB  - This paper proposes a real-time trajectory prediction method for quadrotors based on a bidirectional gated recurrent unit model. Historical trajectory data of ten types of quadrotors were obtained. The bidirectional gated recurrent units were constructed and utilized to learn the historic data. The prediction results were compared with the traditional gated recurrent unit method to test its prediction performance. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm was investigated by comparing the training loss and training time. The results over the testing datasets showed that the proposed model produced better prediction results than the baseline models for all scenarios of the testing datasets. It was also found that the proposed model can converge to a stable state faster than the traditional gated recurrent unit model. Moreover, various types of training samples were applied and compared. With the same randomly selected test datasets, the performance of the prediction model can be improved by selecting the historical trajectory samples of the quadrotors close to the weight or volume of the target quadrotor for training. In addition, the performance of stable trajectory samples is significantly better than that with unstable trajectory segments with a frequent change of speed and direction with large angles.

AB  - In the context of soil pollution, plants suffer stress when exposed to extreme concentrations of potentially toxic elements (PTEs). The alterations to the plants caused by such stressors can be monitored by multispectral imagery in the form of vegetation indices, which can inform pollution management strategies. Here we combined geochemistry and remote sensing techniques to offer a preliminary soil pollution assessment of a vast abandoned spoil heap in the surroundings of La Soterra&ntilde;a mining site (Asturias, Spain). To study the soil distribution of the PTEs over time, twenty-seven soil samples were randomly collected downstream of and around the main spoil heap. Furthermore, the area was covered by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying a high-resolution multispectral camera with four bands (red, green, red-edge and near infrared). Multielement analysis revealed mercury and arsenic as principal pollutants. Two indices (from a database containing up to 55 indices) offered a proper correlation with the concentration of PTEs. These were: CARI2, presenting a Pearson Coefficient (PC) of 0.89 for concentrations &gt;200 mg/kg of As; and NDVIg, PC of &minus;0.67 for &gt;40 mg/kg of Hg. The combined approach helps prediction of those areas susceptible to greatest pollution, thus reducing the costs of geochemical campaigns.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been recognized as a serious problem for aquatic ecosystems and a threat to drinking water systems. The proposed method aimed to develop a practical and rapid countermeasure, enabling preemptive responses to massive algal blooms, through which prior to the algal bloom season we can identify HAB-prone regions based on estimations of where harmful algae initiates and develops significantly. The HAB-prone regions were derived from temperature, depth, flow velocity, and sediment concentration data based only on acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) without relying further on supplementary data collection, such as the water quality. For HAB-prone regions, we employed hot-spot analysis using K-means clustering and the Getis-Ord G*, in conjunction with the spatial autocorrelation of Moran&rsquo;s I and the local index of spatial association (LISA). The validation of the derived HAB-prone regions was conducted for ADCP measurements located at the downstream of Nam and Nakdong River confluence, South Korea, which preceded three months of algal bloom season monitored by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The visual inspection demonstrated that the comparison resulted in an acceptable range of agreement and consistency between the predicted HAB-prone regions and actual UAV-based observations of actual algal blooms.

VL  - 9

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Developments in UAV sensors and platforms in recent decades have stimulated an upsurge in its application for 3D mapping. The relatively low-cost nature of UAVs combined with the use of revolutionary photogrammetric algorithms, such as dense image matching, has made it a strong competitor to aerial lidar mapping. However, in the context of 3D city mapping, further 3D modeling is required to generate 3D city models which is often performed manually using, e.g., photogrammetric stereoplotting. The aim of the paper was to try to implement an algorithmic approach to building point cloud segmentation, from which an automated workflow for the generation of roof planes will also be presented. 3D models of buildings are then created using the roofs’ planes as a base, therefore satisfying the requirements for a Level of Detail (LoD) 2 in the CityGML paradigm. Consequently, the paper attempts to create an automated workflow starting from UAV-derived point clouds to LoD 2-compatible 3D model. Results show that the rule-based segmentation approach presented in this paper works well with the additional advantage of instance segmentation and automatic semantic attribute annotation, while the 3D modeling algorithm performs well for low to medium complexity roofs. The proposed workflow can therefore be implemented for simple roofs with a relatively low number of planar surfaces. Furthermore, the automated approach to the 3D modeling process also helps to maintain the geometric requirements of CityGML such as 3D polygon coplanarity vis-à-vis manual stereoplotting.

AB  - Plant transpiration is a key element in the hydrological cycle. Widely used methods for its assessment comprise sap flux techniques for whole-plant transpiration and porometry for leaf stomatal conductance. Recently emerging approaches based on surface temperatures and a wide range of machine learning techniques offer new possibilities to quantify transpiration. The focus of this study was to predict sap flux and leaf stomatal conductance based on drone-recorded and meteorological data and compare these predictions with in-situ measured transpiration. To build the prediction models, we applied classical statistical approaches and machine learning algorithms. The field work was conducted in an oil palm agroforest in lowland Sumatra. Random forest predictions yielded the highest congruence with measured sap flux (r2 = 0.87 for trees and r2 = 0.58 for palms) and confidence intervals for intercept and slope of a Passing-Bablok regression suggest interchangeability of the methods. Differences in model performance are indicated when predicting different tree species. Predictions for stomatal conductance were less congruent for all prediction methods, likely due to spatial and temporal offsets of the measurements. Overall, the applied drone and modelling scheme predicts whole-plant transpiration with high accuracy. We conclude that there is large potential in machine learning approaches for ecological applications such as predicting transpiration.
