AB  - Diverse forms of artificial intelligence (AI) are at the forefront of triggering digital security innovations based on the threats that are arising in this post-COVID world. On the one hand, companies are experiencing difficulty in dealing with security challenges with regard to a variety of issues ranging from system openness, decision making, quality control, and web domain, to mention a few. On the other hand, in the last decade, research has focused on security capabilities based on tools such as platform complacency, intelligent trees, modeling methods, and outage management systems in an effort to understand the interplay between AI and those issues. the dependence on the emergence of AI in running industries and shaping the education, transports, and health sectors is now well known in the literature. AI is increasingly employed in managing data security across economic sectors. Thus, a literature review of AI and system security within the current digital society is opportune. This paper aims at identifying research trends in the field through a systematic bibliometric literature review (LRSB) of research on AI and system security. the review entails 77 articles published in the Scopus® database, presenting up-to-date knowledge on the topic. the LRSB results were synthesized across current research subthemes. Findings are presented. the originality of the paper relies on its LRSB method, together with an extant review of articles that have not been categorized so far. Implications for future research are suggested.

TI  - Forest Vertical Structure Mapping Using Two-Seasonal Optic Images and LiDAR DSM Acquired from UAV Platform through Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine Approaches

AB  - Research on the forest structure classification is essential, as it plays an important role in assessing the vitality and diversity of vegetation. However, classifying forest structure involves in situ surveying, which requires considerable time and money, and cannot be conducted directly in some instances; also, the update cycle of the classification data is very late. To overcome these drawbacks, feasibility studies on mapping the forest vertical structure from aerial images using machine learning techniques were conducted. In this study, we investigated (1) the performance improvement of the forest structure classification, using a high-resolution LiDAR-derived digital surface model (DSM) acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform and (2) the performance comparison of results obtained from the single-seasonal and two-seasonal data, using random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM). For the performance comparison, the UAV optic and LiDAR data were divided into three cases: (1) only used autumn data, (2) only used winter data, and (3) used both autumn and winter data. From the results, the best model was XGBoost, and the F1 scores achieved using this method were approximately 0.92 in the autumn and winter cases. A remarkable improvement was achieved when both two-seasonal images were used. The F1 score improved by 35.3% from 0.68 to 0.92. This implies that (1) the seasonal variation in the forest vertical structure can be more important than the spatial resolution, and (2) the classification performance achieved from the two-seasonal UAV optic images and LiDAR-derived DSMs can reach 0.9 with the application of an optimal machine learning approach.

AB  - COVID-19 disease shocked global economic activity and affected the electricity markets due to lockdown and work-from-home policies. Therefore, this study proposes an empirical analysis to identify the electricity spot price response during the preventive and mandatory insulation in Colombia, where the economic contraction caused the largest decrease in the electricity demand, especially in the industrial sector. The methodology applied was quantile regression to quantify the non-linear effect on the spot price returns, and two sample periods were selected to contrast the results: 2018 and 2019. The main findings showed that regulated demand variation caused the highest variability on the spot price dynamic during the strict quarantine. However, the price could not fully capture the effects of the demand change due to the short duration of the shock and, also, the price variability in 2019 was higher than 2020 by an El Niño shock.

IS  - 21
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) is playing a major role in smart cities to make a digital environment. Traffic congestion is a serious road issue because of an increasing number of vehicles in urban areas. Some crucial traffic problems include accidents and traffic jams that cause waste of fuel, health diseases, and a waste of time. Present traffic signaling systems are not efficient in resolving congestion problems because of the lack of traffic signals. Nowadays, traffic signaling systems are modeled with fixed time intervals in which no proper mechanism for emergency vehicles is available. Such traffic mechanisms failed to deal with traffic problems effectively. The major objective is to establish a robust traffic monitoring and signaling system that improves signal efficiency by providing a responsive scheme; appropriate routes; a mechanism for emergency vehicles and pedestrians in real-time using Vienna Development Method Specification Language (VDM-SL) formal method and graph theory. A formal model is constructed by considering objects, such as wireless sensors and cameras that are used for collecting information. Graph theory is used to represent the network and find appropriate routes. Unified Modeling Language is used to design the system requirements. The graph-based framework is converted into a formal model by using VDM-SL. The model has been validated and analyzed using many facilities available in the VDM-SL toolbox.

SN  - 2673-7426

AB  - Sleep deficiency impacts the quality of life and may have serious health consequences in the long run. Questionnaire-based subjective assessment of sleep deficiency has many limitations. On the other hand, objective assessment of sleep deficiency is challenging. In this study, we propose a polysomnography-based mathematical model for computing baseline sleep deficiency severity score and then investigated the estimation of sleep deficiency severity using features available only from wearable sensor data including heart rate variability and single-channel electroencephalography for a dataset of 500 subjects. We used Monte-Carlo feature selection (MCFS) and inter-dependency discovery for selecting the best features and removing multi-collinearity. For developing the Regression model we investigated both the frequentist and the Bayesian approaches. An artificial neural network achieved the best performance of RMSE = 5.47 and an R-squared value of 0.67 for sleep deficiency severity estimation. The developed method is comparable to conventional methods of Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale for assessing the impact of sleep apnea on sleep deficiency. Moreover, the results pave the way for reliable and interpretable sleep deficiency severity estimation using single-channel EEG.

TI  - An Intelligent Clustering-Based Routing Protocol (CRP-GR) for 5G-Based Smart Healthcare Using Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 21
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - With advantages such as short and long transmission ranges, D2D communication, low latency, and high node density, the 5G communication standard is a strong contender for smart healthcare. Smart healthcare networks based on 5G are expected to have heterogeneous energy and mobility, requiring them to adapt to the connected environment. As a result, in 5G-based smart healthcare, building a routing protocol that optimizes energy consumption, reduces transmission delay, and extends network lifetime remains a challenge. This paper presents a clustering-based routing protocol to improve the Quality of services (QoS) and energy optimization in 5G-based smart healthcare. QoS and energy optimization are achieved by selecting an energy-efficient clustering head (CH) with the help of game theory (GT) and best multipath route selection with reinforcement learning (RL). The cluster head selection is modeled as a clustering game with a mixed strategy considering various attributes to find equilibrium conditions. The parameters such as distance between nodes, the distance between nodes and base station, the remaining energy and speed of mobility of the nodes were used for cluster head (CH) selection probability. An energy-efficient multipath routing based on reinforcement learning (RL) having (Q-learning) is proposed. The simulation result shows that our proposed clustering-based routing approach improves the QoS and energy optimization compared to existing approaches. The average performances of the proposed schemes CRP-GR and CRP-G are 78% and 71%, respectively, while the existing schemes, such as FBCFP, TEEN and LEACH have average performances of 63%, 48% and 35% accordingly.

T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Predicting the travel demand plays an indispensable role in urban transportation planning. Data collection methods for estimating the origin–destination (OD) demand matrix are being extensively shifted from traditional survey techniques to the pre-collected data from intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). This shift is partly due to the high cost of conducting traditional surveys and partly due to the diversity of scattered data produced by ITSs and the opportunity to derive extra benefits out of this big data. This study attempts to predict the OD matrix of Tehran metropolis using a set of ITS data, including the data extracted from automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, smart fare cards, loop detectors at intersections, global positioning systems (GPS) of navigation software, socio-economic and demographic characteristics as well as land-use features of zones. For this purpose, five models based on machine learning (ML) techniques are developed for training and test. In evaluating the performance of the models, the statistical methods show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to the best performance in terms of accuracy in predicting the OD matrix and has the lowest error in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Moreover, the predicted OD matrix was structurally compared with the ground truth matrix, and the CNN model also shows the highest structural similarity with the ground truth OD matrix in the presented case.

TI  - An Optimization Model with Network Edges for Multimedia Sensors Using Artificial Intelligence of Things

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In modern years, network edges have been explored by many applications to lower communication and management costs. They are also integrated with the internet of things (IoT) to achieve network design, in terms of scalability and heterogeneous services for multimedia applications. Many proposed solutions are performing a vital role in the development of robust protocols and reducing the response time for critical networks. However, most of them are not able to support the forwarding processes of high multimedia traffic under dynamic characteristics with constraint bandwidth. Moreover, they increase the rate of data loss in an uncertain environment and compromise network performance by increasing delivery delay. Therefore, this paper presents an optimization model with mobile edges for multimedia sensors using artificial intelligence of things, which aims to maintain the process of real-time data collection with low consumption of resources. Moreover, it improves the unpredictability of network communication with the integration of software-defined networks (SDN) and mobile edges. Firstly, it utilizes the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), forming the multi-hop network and guaranteed the primary services for constraints network with stable resources management. Secondly, the SDN performs direct association with mobile edges to support the load balancing for multimedia sensors and centralized the management. Finally, multimedia traffic is heading towards applications in an unchanged form and without negotiating using the sharing of subkeys. The experimental results demonstrated its effectiveness for delivery rate by an average of 35%, processing delay by an average of 29%, network overheads by an average of 41%, packet drop ratio by an average of 39%, and packet retransmission by an average of 34% against existing solutions.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - Decision makers and policy analysts at different administrative levels often lack a holistic view of the problem as there are semantic variations in policy documents due to domain-specific content. For example, smart city initiatives are derived from national and international initiatives which may influence the incentives for local participants, but local initiatives reflect the local contextual elements of the city. Balanced assessment of smart city initiatives should include a systemic evaluation of the initiatives at multiple levels including the city, the country in which the city resides as well as at international level. In this paper, a knowledge elicitation methodology is presented for multi-granularity evaluation of policies and initiatives. The methodology is demonstrated on the evaluation of smart city initiatives generated at different administrative levels. Semantic networks are constructed using formal ontologies and deep learning methods for automatic semantic evaluation of initiatives to abstract knowledge found in text. Three smart city initiatives published by different administrative levels including international, national, and city level are evaluated in terms of relevance, coherence, and alignment of multi-level smart city initiatives. Experiments and analysis ultimately provide a holistic view of the problem which is necessary for decision makers and policy analysts of smart cities.

Social and environmental factors in this ecosystem of innovation are highlighted, as well as the perspectives of actors within it. The relationships between art, technology and science of historical Bauhaus are assessed. The investigation of transversality was carried out using a visual tool developed by the authors, CATI, considering sustainability as the backbone. The New European Bauhaus is a pool of innovation that is supported by governments, academia, industry, society and the (natural) environment. It aims at social, environmental and cultural sustainability and includes ideas of social transformation. It is necessary to absorb the impact and overwhelming cultural consequences of previous and current Industrial Revolutions, principally relying on cyber–physical systems to generate spaces and collective intelligence. The climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the need for new approaches, expanding the concept of smart cities to smart territories, taking into account participation in society and general inclusivity.

AB  - In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become an inseparable part of our lives. With the growing demand for Smart Applications, it becomes clear that IoT will bring regular automation and intelligent sensing to a new level thus improving quality of life. The core component of the IoT ecosystem is data which exists in various forms and formats. The collected data is then later used to create context awareness and make meaningful decisions. Besides an undoubtedly large number of advantages from the usage of IoT, there exist numerous challenges attributed to the security of objects that cannot be neglected for uninterrupted services. The Mirai botnet attack demonstrated that the IoT system is susceptible to different forms of cyberattacks. While advanced data analytics and Machine Learning have proved efficiency in various applications of cybersecurity, those still have not been explored enough in the literature from the applicability perspective in the domain of resource-constrained IoT. Several architectures and frameworks have been proposed for defining the ways for analyzing the data, yet mostly investigating off-chip analysis. In this contribution, we show how an Artificial Neural Network model can be trained and deployed on trivial IoT nodes for detecting intelligent similarity-based network attacks. This article proposes a concept of the resource-constrained intelligent system as a part of the IoT infrastructure to be able to harden the cybersecurity on microcontrollers. This work will serve as a stepping stone for the application of Artificial Intelligence on devices with limited computing capabilities such as end-point IoT nodes.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - In recent years, Environmental Sound Recognition (ESR) has become a relevant capability for urban monitoring applications. The techniques for automated sound recognition often rely on machine learning approaches, which have increased in complexity in order to achieve higher accuracy. Nonetheless, such machine learning techniques often have to be deployed on resource and power-constrained embedded devices, which has become a challenge with the adoption of deep learning approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are power efficient and highly suitable for computationally intensive algorithms like CNNs. By fully exploiting their parallel nature, they have the potential to accelerate the inference time as compared to other embedded devices. Similarly, dedicated architectures to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) promise to deliver high accuracy while achieving high performance. In this work, we evaluate existing tool flows to deploy CNN models on FPGAs as well as on TPU platforms. We propose and adjust several CNN-based sound classifiers to be embedded on such hardware accelerators. The results demonstrate the maturity of the existing tools and how FPGAs can be exploited to outperform TPUs.

PY  - 2021

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are spatially scattered networks equipped with an extensive number of nodes to check and record different ecological states such as humidity, temperature, pressure, and lightning states. WSN network provides different services to a client such as monitoring, detection, and runtime decision-making against events occurrence. However, the WSN network still has some limitations in computing power, storage resources, and battery life, which make the network is restricted for data transformation. It is due to less supportive battery power, and limited memory of nodes. The integration of WSN and cloud offers an open, adaptable, and more reconfigurable stage for different security checks and regulating requirements. In this paper, we discovered how WSN and cloud computing (CC) are integrated and help to accomplish different goals. Additionally, a comprehensive study about procedures and issues for an effective combination of WSN-CC is presented. This work also presents the work proposed by the research community for WSN-CC. Besides, we explored the integration of WSN/IoT with Fog computing (FC). Based on investigations, WSN integration with Fog computing (FC) has many benefits with respect to latency, energy consumption, data processing, and real-time data streaming. FC is not a substitute for distributed computing, so far it is utilized to improve the productivity of the sensor.

TI  - A User-Oriented Local Coastal Flooding Early Warning System Using Metamodelling Techniques
T2  - Journal of Marine Science and Engineering

PY  - 2021
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
SN  - 2077-1312

AB  - Given recent scientific advances, coastal flooding events can be properly modelled. Nevertheless, such models are computationally expensive (requiring many hours), which prevents their use for forecasting and warning. In addition, there is a gap between the model outputs and information actually needed by decision makers. The present work aims to develop and test a method capable of forecasting coastal flood information adapted to users’ needs. The method must be robust and fast and must integrate the complexity of coastal flood processes. The explored solution relies on metamodels, i.e., mathematical functions that precisely and efficiently (within minutes) estimate the results that would provide the numerical model. While the principle of relying on metamodel solutions is not new, the originality of the present work is to tackle and validate the entire process from the identification of user needs to the establishment and validation of the rapid forecast and early warning system (FEWS) while relying on numerical modelling, metamodelling, the development of indicators, and information technologies. The development and validation are performed at the study site of Gâvres (France). This site is subject to wave overtopping, so the numerical phase-resolving SWASH model is used to build the learning dataset required for the metamodel setup. Gaussian process- and random forest classifier-based metamodels are used and post-processed to estimate 14 indicators of interest for FEWS users. These metamodelling and post-processing schemes are implemented in an FEWS prototype, which is employed by local users and exhibits good warning skills during the validation period. Based on this experience, we provide recommendations for the improvement and/or application of this methodology and individual steps to other sites.

SN  - 2227-9709

AB  - The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic still involves many struggles and challenges. The greatest challenge that most governments are currently facing is the lack of a precise, accurate, and automated mechanism for detecting and tracking new COVID-19 cases. In response to this challenge, this study proposes the first blockchain-based system, called the COVID-19 contact tracing system (CCTS), to verify, track, and detect new cases of COVID-19. The proposed system consists of four integrated components: an infection verifier subsystem, a mass surveillance subsystem, a P2P mobile application, and a blockchain platform for managing all transactions between the three subsystem models. To investigate the performance of the proposed system, CCTS has been simulated and tested against a created dataset consisting of 300 confirmed cases and 2539 contacts. Based on the metrics of the confusion matrix (i.e., recall, precision, accuracy, and F1 Score), the detection evaluation results proved that the proposed blockchain-based system achieved an average of accuracy of 75.79% and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.004 in recognizing persons in contact with COVID-19 patients within two different areas of infection covered by GPS. Moreover, the simulation results also demonstrated the success of the proposed system in performing self-estimation of infection probabilities and sending and receiving infection alerts in P2P communications in crowds of people by users. The infection probability results have been calculated using the binomial distribution function technique. This result can be considered unique compared with other similar systems in the literature. The new system could support governments, health authorities, and citizens in making critical decisions regarding infection detection, prediction, tracking, and avoiding the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the functionality of the proposed CCTS can be adapted to work against any other similar pandemics in the future.

AB  - The two-part series of papers provides a survey on recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach to simulate the human’s natural learning process, whose key is to let the agent learn by interacting with the stochastic environment. The fact that the agent has limited access to the information of the environment enables AI to be applied efficiently in most fields that require self-learning. It’s essential to have an organized investigation—we can make good comparisons and choose the best structures or algorithms when applying DRL in various applications. The first part of the overview introduces Markov Decision Processes (MDP) problems and Reinforcement Learning and applications of DRL for solving POMDP problems in games, robotics, and natural language processing. In part two, we continue to introduce applications in transportation, industries, communications and networking, etc. and discuss the limitations of DRL.

AB  - This study analyses the main challenges, trends, technological approaches, and artificial intelligence methods developed by new researchers and professionals in the field of machine learning, with an emphasis on the most outstanding and relevant works to date. This literature review evaluates the main methodological contributions of artificial intelligence through machine learning. The methodology used to study the documents was content analysis; the basic terminology of the study corresponds to machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data between the years 2017 and 2021. For this study, we selected 181 references, of which 120 are part of the literature review. The conceptual framework includes 12 categories, four groups, and eight subgroups. The study of data management using AI methodologies presents symmetry in the four machine learning groups: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforced learning. Furthermore, the artificial intelligence methods with more symmetry in all groups are artificial neural networks, Support Vector Machines, K-means, and Bayesian Methods. Finally, five research avenues are presented to improve the prediction of machine learning.

AB  - Automakers manage vast fleets of connected vehicles and face an ever-increasing demand for their sensor readings. This demand originates from many stakeholders, each potentially requiring different sensors from different vehicles. Currently, this demand remains largely unfulfilled due to a lack of systems that can handle such diverse demands efficiently. Vehicles are usually passive participants in data acquisition, each continuously reading and transmitting the same static set of sensors. However, in a multi-tenant setup with diverse data demands, each vehicle potentially needs to provide different data instead. We present a system that performs such vehicle-specific minimization of data acquisition by mapping individual data demands to individual vehicles. We collect personal data only after prior consent and fulfill the requirements of the GDPR. Non-personal data can be collected by directly addressing individual vehicles. The system consists of a software component natively integrated with a major automaker’s vehicle platform and a cloud platform brokering access to acquired data. Sensor readings are either provided via near real-time streaming or as recorded trip files that provide specific consistency guarantees. A performance evaluation with over 200,000 simulated vehicles has shown that our system can increase server capacity on-demand and process streaming data within 269 ms on average during peak load. The resulting architecture can be used by other automakers or operators of large sensor networks. Native vehicle integration is not mandatory; the architecture can also be used with retrofitted hardware such as OBD readers.

AB  - The fundamental issue for Beyond fifth Generation (B5G) is providing a pervasive connection to heterogeneous and various devices in smart environments. Therefore, Drones play a vital role in the B5G, allowing for wireless broadcast and high-speed communications. In addition, the drone offers several advantages compared to fixed terrestrial communications, including flexible deployment, robust Line of Sight (LoS) connections, and more design degrees of freedom due to controlled mobility. Drones can provide reliable and high data rate connectivity to users irrespective of their location. However, atmospheric disturbances impact the signal quality between drones and users and degrade the system performance. Considering practical implementation, the location of drones makes the drone–user communication susceptible to several environmental disturbances. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of drone-user connectivity during atmospheric disturbances. Further, a Machine Learning (ML)-assisted algorithm is proposed to adapt to a modulation technique that offers optimal performance during atmospheric disturbances. The results show that, with the algorithm, the system switches to a lower order modulation scheme during higher rain rate and provides reliable communication with optimized data rate and error performance.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Profound changes driven by decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization are disrupting the energy industry, bringing new challenges to its key stakeholders. In the attempt to address the climate change issue, increasing penetration of renewables and mobility electrification augment the complexity of the electric grid, thus calling for new management approaches to govern energy exchanges while ensuring reliable and secure operations. The emerging blockchain technology is regarded as one of the most promising solutions to respond to the matter in a decentralized, efficient, fast, and secure way. In this work, we propose an Ethereum-based charging management framework for electric vehicles (EVs), tightly interlinked with physical and software infrastructure and implemented in a real-world demonstration site. With a specifically designed solidity-based smart contract governing the charging process, the proposed framework enables secure and reliable accounting of energy exchanges in a network of trustless peers, thus facilitating the EVs’ deployment and encouraging the adoption of blockchain technology for everyday tasks such as EV charging through private and semi-private charging infrastructure. The results of a multi-actor implementation case study in Switzerland demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed blockchain framework and highlight its potential to reduce costs in a typical EV charging business model. Moreover, the study shows that the suggested framework can speed up the charging and billing processes for EV users, simplify the access to energy markets for charging station owners, and facilitate the interaction between the two through specifically designed mobile and web applications. The implementation presented in this paper can be used as a guideline for future blockchain applications for EV charging and other smart grid projects.

TI  - Lossless Compression of Sensor Signals Using an Untrained Multi-Channel Recurrent Neural Predictor
T2  - Applied Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 21
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The use of sensor applications has been steadily increasing, leading to an urgent need for efficient data compression techniques to facilitate the storage, transmission, and processing of digital signals generated by sensors. Unlike other sequential data such as text sequences, sensor signals have more complex statistical characteristics. Specifically, in every signal point, each bit, which corresponds to a specific precision scale, follows its own conditional distribution depending on its history and even other bits. Therefore, applying existing general-purpose data compressors usually leads to a relatively low compression ratio, since these compressors do not fully exploit such internal features. What is worse, partitioning a bit stream into groups with a preset size will sometimes break the integrity of each signal point. In this paper, we present a lossless data compressor dedicated to compressing sensor signals which is built upon a novel recurrent neural architecture named multi-channel recurrent unit (MCRU). Each channel in the proposed MCRU models a specific precision range of each signal point without breaking data integrity. During compressing and decompressing, the mirrored network will be trained on observed data; thus, no pre-training is needed. The superiority of our approach over other compressors is demonstrated experimentally on various types of sensor signals.

VL  - 21
IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - As a result of the limited resources available in IoT local devices, the large scale cloud consumer’s data that are produced by IoT related machines are contracted out to the cloud. Cloud computing is unreliable, using it can compromise user privacy, and data may be leaked. Because cloud-data and grid infrastructure are both growing exponentially, there is an urgent need to explore computational sources and cloud large-data protection. Numerous cloud service categories are assimilated into numerous fields, such as defense systems and pharmaceutical databases, to compute information space and allocation of resources. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key, encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic non-linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes are guaranteed by using a dynamic non- polynomial chaotic map function for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding. Compared to existing models, the real-time simulation results demonstrate that the stated standard is more precise than 90% in terms of bit change and more precise than 95% in terms of dynamic key generation, encipherment, and decipherment time.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Empowered by the emergence of novel information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as sensors and high-performance digital communication systems, Europe has adapted its electricity distribution network into a modern infrastructure known as a smart grid (SG). The benefits of this new infrastructure include precise and real-time capacity for measuring and monitoring the different energy-relevant parameters on the various points of the grid and for the remote operation and optimization of distribution. Furthermore, a new user profile is derived from this novel infrastructure, known as a prosumer (a user that can produce and consume energy to/from the grid), who can benefit from the features derived from applying advanced analytics and semantic technologies in the rich amount of big data generated by the different subsystems. However, this novel, highly interconnected infrastructure also presents some significant drawbacks, like those related to information security (IS). We provide a systematic literature survey of the ICT-empowered environments that comprise SGs and homes, and the application of modern artificial intelligence (AI) related technologies with sensor fusion systems and actuators, ensuring energy efficiency in such systems. Furthermore, we outline the current challenges and outlook for this field. These address new developments on microgrids, and data-driven energy efficiency that leads to better knowledge representation and decision-making for smart homes and SGs.

AB  - Physical activity contributes to the maintenance of health conditions and functioning. However, the percentage of older adults who comply with the recommendations for physical activity levels is low when compared to the same percentages on younger groups. The SmartWalk system aims to encourage older adults to perform physical activity (i.e., walking in the city), which is monitored and adjusted by healthcare providers for best results. The study reported in this article focused on the implementation of SmartWalk security services to keep personal data safe during communications and while at rest, which were validated considering a comprehensive use case. The security framework offers various mechanisms, including an authentication system that was designed to complement the pairs of usernames and passwords with trusted execution environments and token-based features, authorization with different access levels, symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography, critical transactions review, and logging supported by blockchain technology. The resulting implementation contributes for a common understanding of the security features of trustful smart cities’ applications, which conforms with existing legislation and regulations.

AB  - Air pollution has become the most important issue concerning human evolution in the last century, as the levels of toxic gases and particles present in the air create health problems and affect the ecosystems of the planet. Scientists and environmental organizations have been looking for new ways to combat and control the air pollution, developing new solutions as technologies evolves. In the last decade, devices able to observe and maintain pollution levels have become more accessible and less expensive, and with the appearance of the Internet of Things (IoT), new approaches for combating pollution were born. The focus of the research presented in this paper was predicting behaviours regarding the air quality index using machine learning. Data were collected from one of the six atmospheric stations set in relevant areas of Bucharest, Romania, to validate our model. Several algorithms were proposed to study the evolution of temperature depending on the level of pollution and on several pollution factors. In the end, the results generated by the algorithms are presented considering the types of pollutants for two distinct periods. Prediction errors were highlighted by the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for each of the three machine learning algorithms used.

AB  - This article aims to improve the secondary distribution process in a mass consumer company implementing technologies, such as transport management system (TMS) to achieve the objectives set by the company. A DMAIC based methodology is proposed to define and solve structured problems related to secondary distribution, following the performance of the process based on critical to logistics (CTL) factors. The methodology prioritized the design of a master plan for the secondary distribution and the characterization of the secondary distribution process, defining the principal technologies that should compose the business architecture of the secondary distribution, with emphasis on the TMS due to its significant impact and relevance for planning, execution, and control of the distribution process. This study replaces the control component of the DMAIC with the assess component to perform the economic and productivity evaluation of the implementation of a TMS since the improvement proposals were formulated and evaluated. The results show that TMS allows the reduction of delivery time variability, order processing time, voided invoices, distribution costs, the increase in customer service and efficiency in the distribution operation and generates profitability for the medium and long term.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 21
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to the limitations of data transfer technologies, existing studies on urban traffic control mainly focused on isolated dimension control such as traffic signal control or vehicle route guidance to alleviate traffic congestion. However, in real traffic, the distribution of traffic flow is the result of multiple dimensions whose future state is influenced by each dimension’s decisions. Presently, the development of the Internet of Vehicles enables an integrated intelligent transportation system. This paper proposes an integrated intelligent transportation model that can optimize predictive traffic signal control and predictive vehicle route guidance simultaneously to alleviate traffic congestion based on their feedback regulation relationship. The challenges of this model lie in that the formulation of the nonlinear feedback relationship between various dimensions is hard to describe and the design of a corresponding solving algorithm that can obtain Pareto optimality for multi-dimension control is complex. In the integrated model, we introduce two medium variables—predictive traffic flow and the predictive waiting time—to two-way link the traffic signal control and vehicle route guidance. Inspired by game theory, an asymmetric information exchange framework-based updating distributed algorithm is designed to solve the integrated model. Finally, an experimental study in two typical traffic scenarios shows that more than 73.33% of the considered cases adopting the integrated model achieve Pareto optimality.

T2  - Education Sciences

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
SN  - 2227-7102

AB  - In this study, we focus on teachers’ attitudes to compare and evaluate their ability and readiness to implement technology education in geography lessons. First, the lack of suitable measuring instruments for our intent was identified, and we thus attempted to develop the Modern Technology Attitude Index (MTAI) for remedy. An exploratory factor analysis helped to identify three distinguishable dimensions that depict areas of intimidation (INT), loss of control (LOC), and benefits and easement (BAE), with or through modern technology. The scales were then applied to German university students (n = 357). As a result, the pre-service geography teachers (n = 72) showed higher scores on the affinity scale than on the two aversion scales. Their subject-specific interest correlated negatively with intimidation and positively with the perceived benefits and easements of modern technology, while the perceived loss of control showed no significant correlation. This allows for the conclusion that the subject’s technology-related interest has an influence on cognitive and behavioral attitudes, while this is not the case for affective ones. Further, there are indications that the much-discussed gender gap in technology topics might particularly be related to people’s affective attitudes, while cognitive and behavioral dimensions seem not to be affected. Differing results in other studies on whether the gender gap still exists or not could be due to the fact that, in addition to growing social awareness and a generational change, the measuring tools used may have not yet been able to depict a sufficiently diverse range of attitudes.

AB  - Monitoring the progress on a construction site during the construction phase is crucial. An inadequate understanding of the project status can lead to mistakes and inappropriate actions, causing delays and increased costs. Monitoring and controlling projects via digital tools would reduce the risk of error and enable timely corrective actions. Although there is currently a wide range of technologies for these purposes, these technologies and interoperability between them are still limited. Because of this, it is important to know the possibilities of integration and interoperability regarding their implementation. This article presents a bibliographic synthesis and interpretation of 30 nonconventional digital tools for monitoring progress in terms of field data capture technologies (FDCT) and communication and collaborative technologies (CT) that are responsible for information processing and management. This research aims to perform an integration and interoperability analysis of technologies to demonstrate their potential for monitoring and controlling construction projects during the execution phase. A network analysis was conducted, and the results suggest that the triad formed by building information modeling (BIM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and photogrammetry is an effective tool; the use of this set extends not only to monitoring and control, but also to all phases of a project.

AB  - The elderly are the most predicted users for smart home technology in the United Arab Emirates and the population over 65 is expected to increase to 24.3% by 2030. Despite the rapid development of smart home technology, research has been mainly focused on technology development. To encourage conservative elderly users, however, smart home technology should be implemented for UAE elderly users to accept and integrate it into their daily lives. The objective of this paper is to analyze the preferences and needs of smart home technologies to understand the behaviors of UAE elderly users, and the factors affecting the acceptance of technology. As a methodology, a survey and interview were conducted for 110 people in their 40s and 60s and a total of 105 valid survey responses were collected and used as data for frequency, mean, cross-analysis, independent sample t-test, one-way variance analysis, and multiple regression analysis with IBM SPSS statistics 27. The results showed that 67.0% of UAE elderly users have chronic diseases such as high blood pressure (16.2%), heart disease (3.8%), diabetes (32.4%), or arthritis (10.5%). Therefore, smart home technology for health management is inevitable to improve overall lifestyles. It was statistically proven that UAE elderly users want automatic fall detection in the living room (39.0%) and bedroom (25.7%). Lifestyle monitoring in living room (44.7%) and bedroom (18.1%); the elderly preferred living room most for daily life assistance (36.2%), environmental control (50.5%), health and biometric monitoring (49.5%), and video conferencing (82.9%). In the case of sensors, elderly preferred the switch at the entrance (36.2%), and motion detecting sensors (42.9%), video cameras (56.2%), and voice recognition (50.5%) sensors in the living room. However, UAE elderly users do not think smart home technology can protect their privacy. It is found that age group and computer technology affinity are the most influential variables and UAE elderly users have an anxiety about technology, which influenced the acceptance of smart home technology.

SN  - 2073-431X

AB  - For public safety and physical security, currently more than a billion closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are in use around the world. Proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine/deep learning (M/DL) technologies have gained significant applications including crowd surveillance. The state-of-the-art distance and area estimation algorithms either need multiple cameras or a reference object as a ground truth. It is an open question to obtain an estimation using a single camera without a scale reference. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called E-SEC, which estimates interpersonal distance between a pair of dynamic human objects, area occupied by a dynamic crowd, and density using a single edge camera. The E-SEC framework comprises edge CCTV cameras responsible for capturing a crowd on video frames leveraging a customized YOLOv3 model for human detection. E-SEC contributes an interpersonal distance estimation algorithm vital for monitoring the social distancing of a crowd, and an area estimation algorithm for dynamically determining an area occupied by a crowd with changing size and position. A unified output module generates the crowd size, interpersonal distances, social distancing violations, area, and density per every frame. Experimental results validate the accuracy and efficiency of E-SEC with a range of different video datasets.

AB  - Owing to climate change and human indiscriminate development, the population of endangered species has been decreasing. To protect endangered species, many countries worldwide have adopted the CITES treaty to prevent the extinction of endangered plants and animals. Moreover, research has been conducted using diverse approaches, particularly deep learning-based animal and plant image recognition methods. In this paper, we propose an automated image classification method for 11 endangered parrot species included in CITES. The 11 species include subspecies that are very similar in appearance. Data images were collected from the Internet and built in cooperation with Seoul Grand Park Zoo to build an indigenous database. The dataset for deep learning training consisted of 70% training set, 15% validation set, and 15% test set. In addition, a data augmentation technique was applied to reduce the data collection limit and prevent overfitting. The performance of various backbone CNN architectures (i.e., VGGNet, ResNet, and DenseNet) were compared using the SSD model. The experiment derived the test set image performance for the training model, and the results show that the DenseNet18 had the best performance with an mAP of approximately 96.6% and an inference time of 0.38 s.

In this paper, zero-crossing points of a sinusoidal signal are detected using deep neural networks. In order to train and evaluate the deep neural network model, new datasets for sinusoidal signals having noise levels from 5% to 50% and harmonic distortion from 10% to 50% are developed. This complete study is implemented in Google Colab using deep learning framework Keras. Results shows that the proposed deep learning model is able to detect zero-crossing points in a distorted sinusoidal signal with good accuracy.

AB  - The enhancement of physical activity is highly correlated with the conditions of the built environment. Walking is considered to be a fundamental daily physical activity, which requires an appropriate environment. Therefore, the barriers of the built environment should be identified and addressed. Barriers can act as external stimuli for pedestrians, so pedestrians may diversely respond to them. Based on this consideration, this study examines the feasibility of information-entropy-based behavioral analysis for the detection of environmental barriers. The physical responses of pedestrians were collected using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor in a smartphone. After the acquired data were converted to behavioral probability distributions, the information entropy of each grid cell was calculated. The grid cells whereby the participants indicated that environmental barriers were present yielded relatively high information entropy values. The findings of this study will facilitate the design of more pedestrian-friendly environments and the development of diverse approaches that utilize citizens for monitoring the built environment.

AB  - There is a tendency, during the last years, to migrate from the traditional homogeneous clouds and centralized provisioning of resources to heterogeneous clouds with specialized hardware governed in a distributed and autonomous manner. The CloudLightning architecture proposed recently introduced a dynamic way to provision heterogeneous cloud resources, by shifting the selection of underlying resources from the end-user to the system in an efficient way. In this work, an optimized Suitability Index and assessment function are proposed, along with their theoretical analysis, for improving the computational efficiency, energy consumption, service delivery and scalability of the distributed orchestration. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is being evaluated with the use of simulation, by comparing the optimized methods with the original approach and the traditional centralized resource management, on real and synthetic High Performance Computing applications. Finally, numerical results are presented and discussed regarding the improvements over the defined evaluation criteria.

SN  - 2077-0472

AB  - Mechanical damages of sugar beet during harvesting affects the quality of the final products and sugar yield. The mechanical damage of sugar beet is assessed randomly by operators of harvesters and can depend on the subjective opinion and experience of the operator due to the complexity of the harvester machines. Thus, the main aim of this study was to determine whether a digital two-dimensional imaging system coupled with convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques could be utilized to detect visible mechanical damage in sugar beet during harvesting in a harvester machine. In this research, various detector models based on the CNN, including You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4, region-based fully convolutional network (R-FCN) and faster regions with convolutional neural network features (Faster R-CNN) were developed. Sugar beet image data during harvesting from a harvester in different farming conditions were used for training and validation of the proposed models. The experimental results showed that the YOLO v4 CSPDarknet53 method was able to detect damage in sugar beet with better performance (recall, precision and F1-score of about 92, 94 and 93%, respectively) and higher speed (around 29 frames per second) compared to the other developed CNNs. By means of a CNN-based vision system, it was possible to automatically detect sugar beet damage within the sugar beet harvester machine.

AB  - Presently, due to the establishment of a sensor network, residual buildings in urban areas are being converted into smart buildings. Many sensors are deployed in various buildings to perform different functions, such as water quality monitoring and temperature monitoring. However, the major concern faced in smart building Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is energy depletion and security threats. Many researchers have attempted to solve these issues by various authors in different applications of WSNs. However, limited research has been conducted on smart buildings. Thus, the present research is focused on designing an energy-efficient and secure routing protocol for smart building WSNs. The process in the proposed framework is carried out in two stages. The first stage is the design of the optimal routing protocol based on the grid-clustering approach. In the grid-based model, a grid organizer was selected based on the sailfish optimization algorithm. Subsequently, a fuzzy expert system is used to select the relay node to reach the shortest path for data transmission. The second stage involves designing a trust model for secure data transmission using the two-fish algorithm. A simulation study of the proposed framework was conducted to evaluate its performance. Some metrics, such as the packet delivery ratio, end-end delay, and average residual energy, were calculated for the proposed model. The average residual energy for the proposed framework was 96%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed routing design.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) poses serious challenges in preserving network longevity since the IoT necessitates a considerable amount of energy usage for sensing, processing, and data communication. As a result, there are several conventional algorithms that aim to enhance the performance of WSN networks by incorporating various optimization strategies. These algorithms primarily focus on the network layer by developing routing protocols to perform reliable communication in an energy-efficient manner, thus leading to an enhanced network life. For increasing the network lifetime in WSNs, clustering has been widely accepted as an important method that groups sensor nodes (SNs) into clusters. Additionally, numerous researchers have been focusing on devising various methods to increase the network lifetime. The prime factor that helps to maximize the network lifetime is the minimization of energy consumption. The authors of this paper propose a multi-objective optimization approach. It selects the optimal route for transmitting packets from source to sink or the base station (BS). The proposed model employs a two-step approach. The first step employs a trust model to select the cluster heads (CHs) that manage the data communication between the BS and nodes in the cluster. Further, a novel hybrid algorithm, combining a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and a genetic algorithm (GA), is proposed to determine the routes for data transmission. To validate the efficacy of the proposed hybrid algorithm, named PSOGA, simulations were conducted and the results were compared with the existing LEACH method and PSO, with a random route selection for five different cases. The obtained results establish the efficiency of the proposed approach, as it outperforms existing methods with increased energy efficiency, increased network throughput, high packet delivery rate, and high residual energy throughout the entire iterations.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - There is a significant interest in facial emotion recognition in the fields of human–computer interaction and social sciences. With the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the field of human behavioral prediction and analysis, especially human emotion, has evolved significantly. The most standard methods of emotion recognition are currently being used in models deployed in remote servers. We believe the reduction in the distance between the input device and the server model can lead us to better efficiency and effectiveness in real life applications. For the same purpose, computational methodologies such as edge computing can be beneficial. It can also encourage time-critical applications that can be implemented in sensitive fields. In this study, we propose a Raspberry-Pi based standalone edge device that can detect real-time facial emotions. Although this edge device can be used in variety of applications where human facial emotions play an important role, this article is mainly crafted using a dataset of employees working in organizations. A Raspberry-Pi-based standalone edge device has been implemented using the Mini-Xception Deep Network because of its computational efficiency in a shorter time compared to other networks. This device has achieved 100% accuracy for detecting faces in real time with 68% accuracy, i.e., higher than the accuracy mentioned in the state-of-the-art with the FER 2013 dataset. Future work will implement a deep network on Raspberry-Pi with an Intel Movidious neural compute stick to reduce the processing time and achieve quick real time implementation of the facial emotion recognition system.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is the main driving force behind smart manufacturing, industrial automation, and industry 4.0. Conversely, industrial IoT as the evolving technological paradigm is also becoming a compelling target for cyber adversaries. Particularly, advanced persistent threats (APT) and especially botnets are the foremost promising and potential attacks that may throw the complete industrial IoT network into chaos. IIoT-enabled botnets are highly scalable, technologically diverse, and highly resilient to classical and conventional detection mechanisms. Subsequently, we propose a deep learning (DL)-enabled novel hybrid architecture that can efficiently and timely tackle distributed, multivariant, lethal botnet attacks in industrial IoT. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated on a current state-of-the-art, publicly available dataset using standard performance evaluation metrics. Moreover, our proposed technique has been precisely verified with our constructed hybrid DL-enabled architectures and current benchmark DL algorithms. Our devised mechanism shows promising results in terms of high detection accuracy with a trivial trade-off in speed efficiency, assuring the proposed scheme as an optimal and legitimate cyber defense in prevalent IIoTs. Besides, we have cross-validated our results to show utterly unbiased performance.

AB  - Big Data, the Internet of Things, and robotic and augmented realities are just some of the technologies that belong to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions and increase productivity and the quality of industry production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. A new perspective is oriented towards social well-being and it is called Society 5.0. Industry 4.0 supports the transition to the new society, but other drivers are also needed. To guide the transition, it is necessary to identify the enabling factors that integrate Industry 4.0. A conceptual framework was developed in which these factors were identified through a literature review and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. Furthermore, the way in which they relate was evaluated with the help of the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The proposed framework fills a research gap, which has not yet consolidated a strategy that includes all aspects of Society 5.0. As a result, the main driver, in addition to technology, is international politics.

AB  - High-definition maps (HDM) for autonomous driving (AD) are an important component of AD systems. HDMs accurately provide a priori information, including lane lines, and road signs, for AD systems. It is an important task to make a reasonable accuracy assessment of the HDM. The current methods for relative accuracy evaluation of general maps in the field of mapping are not fully applicable to HDMs. In this study, a method based on point set alignment and resampling is used to evaluate the relative accuracy of lane lines, and experiments are conducted based on relevant real HDM data. The results show that the relative accuracy of the lane lines is more detailed and relevant than the traditional method. This has implications for the quality control of HDM production.

AB  - The expansion of electric vehicles made the expansion of charging infrastructure rudimentary to keep up with this developing technology that helps people in a myriad of ways. The main drawback in electric vehicle charging, however, is the time consumed to charge a vehicle. The fast charging of electric vehicles solves this problem thus making it a lucrative technology for consumers. However, the fast charging technology is not without its limitations. In this paper we have identified the technology gaps in EV fast charging stations mostly focused on the extremely fast charging topology. It will help pave a path for researchers to direct their effort in a consolidated manner to contribute to the fast charging infrastructure. A thorough review of all aspects and limitations of existing extremely fast charging (XFC) stations have been identified and supporting data are provided. The importance of DC power network based on free fuel energy sources and silicon carbide-based power electronics are proposed to provide ultra-low cost and ultra-high speed XFC stations.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 14
IS  - 22
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In the transportation sector, electric battery bus (EBB) deployment is considered to be a potential solution to reduce global warming because no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are directly produced by EBBs. In addition to the required charging infrastructure, estimating the energy consumption of buses has become a crucial precondition for the deployment and planning of electric bus fleets. Policy and decision-makers may not have the specific tools needed to estimate the energy consumption of a particular bus network. Therefore, many state-of-the-art studies have proposed models to determine the energy demand of electric buses. However, these studies have not critically reviewed, classified and discussed the challenges of the approaches that are applied to estimate EBBs’ energy demands. Thus, this manuscript provides a detailed review of the forecasting models used to estimate the energy consumption of EBBs. Furthermore, this work fills the gap by classifying the models for estimating EBBs’ energy consumption into small-town depot and big-city depot networks. In brief, this review explains and discusses the models and formulations of networks associated with well-to-wheel (WTW) assessment, which can determine the total energy demand of a bus network. This work also reviews a survey of the most recent optimization methods that could be applied to achieve the optimal pattern parameters of EBB fleet systems, such as the bus battery capacity, charger rated power and the total number of installed chargers in the charging station. This paper highlights the issues and challenges, such as the impact of external factors, replicating real-world data, big data analytics, validity index, and bus routes’ topography, with recommendations on each issue. Also, the paper proposes a generic framework based on optimization algorithms, namely, artificial neural network (ANN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), which will be significant for future development in implementing new energy consumption estimation approaches. Finally, the main findings of this manuscript further our understanding of the determinants that contribute to managing the energy demand of EBBs networks.

TI  - A Multi-Objective Coverage Path Planning Algorithm for UAVs to Cover Spatially Distributed Regions in Urban Environments
T2  - Aerospace

PY  - 2021
VL  - 8
IS  - 11
SN  - 2226-4310

AB  - This paper presents a multi-objective coverage flight path planning algorithm that finds minimum length, collision-free, and flyable paths for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in three-dimensional (3D) urban environments inhabiting multiple obstacles for covering spatially distributed regions. In many practical applications, UAVs are often required to fully cover multiple spatially distributed regions located in the 3D urban environments while avoiding obstacles. This problem is relatively complex since it requires the optimization of both inter (e.g., traveling from one region/city to another) and intra-regional (e.g., within a region/city) paths. To solve this complex problem, we find the traversal order of each area of interest (AOI) in the form of a coarse tour (i.e., graph) with the help of an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm by formulating it as a traveling salesman problem (TSP) from the center of each AOI, which is subsequently optimized. The intra-regional path finding problem is solved with the integration of fitting sensors’ footprints sweeps (SFS) and sparse waypoint graphs (SWG) in the AOI. To find a path that covers all accessible points of an AOI, we fit fewer, longest, and smooth SFSs in such a way that most parts of an AOI can be covered with fewer sweeps. Furthermore, the low-cost traversal order of each SFS is computed, and SWG is constructed by connecting the SFSs while respecting the global and local constraints. It finds a global solution (i.e., inter + intra-regional path) without sacrificing the guarantees on computing time, number of turning maneuvers, perfect coverage, path overlapping, and path length. The results obtained from various representative scenarios show that proposed algorithm is able to compute low-cost coverage paths for UAV navigation in urban environments.

AB  - This paper presents an accurate and robust dense 3D reconstruction system for detail preserving surface modeling of large-scale scenes from multi-view images, which we named DP-MVS. Our system performs high-quality large-scale dense reconstruction, which preserves geometric details for thin structures, especially for linear objects. Our framework begins with a sparse reconstruction carried out by an incremental Structure-from-Motion. Based on the reconstructed sparse map, a novel detail preserving PatchMatch approach is applied for depth estimation of each image view. The estimated depth maps of multiple views are then fused to a dense point cloud in a memory-efficient way, followed by a detail-aware surface meshing method to extract the final surface mesh of the captured scene. Experiments on ETH3D benchmark show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on F1-score, with the running time more than 4 times faster. More experiments on large-scale photo collections demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for large-scale scene reconstruction in terms of accuracy, completeness, memory saving, and time efficiency.

AB  - Smart seaside cities can fully exploit the capabilities brought by Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of city services in traditional smart city applications: smart home, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart surveillance, smart environment, cyber security, etc. However, smart coastal cities are characterized by their specific application domain, namely, beach monitoring. Beach attendance prediction is a beach monitoring application of particular importance for coastal managers to successfully plan beach services in terms of security, rescue, health and environmental assistance. In this paper, an experimental study that uses IoT data and deep learning to predict the number of beach visitors at Castelldefels beach (Barcelona, Spain) was developed. Images of Castelldefels beach were captured by a video monitoring system. An image recognition software was used to estimate beach attendance. A deep learning algorithm (deep neural network) to predict beach attendance was developed. The experimental results prove the feasibility of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for beach attendance prediction. For each beach, a classification of occupancy was estimated, depending on the number of beach visitors. The proposed model outperforms other machine learning models (decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest) and can successfully classify seven beach occupancy levels with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of 0.03, 92.7%, 92.9%, 92.7%, and 92.7%, respectively.

AB  - Forests play a fundamental role in preserving the environment and fighting global warming. Unfortunately, they are continuously reduced by human interventions such as deforestation, fires, etc. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework for automatically detecting illegal tree-cutting activity in forests through audio event classification. We envisage ultra-low-power tiny devices, embedding edge-computing microcontrollers and long-range wireless communication to cover vast areas in the forest. To reduce the energy footprint and resource consumption for effective and pervasive detection of illegal tree cutting, an efficient and accurate audio classification solution based on convolutional neural networks is proposed, designed specifically for resource-constrained wireless edge devices. With respect to previous works, the proposed system allows for recognizing a wider range of threats related to deforestation through a distributed and pervasive edge-computing technique. Different pre-processing techniques have been evaluated, focusing on a trade-off between classification accuracy with respect to computational resources, memory, and energy footprint. Furthermore, experimental long-range communication tests have been conducted in real environments. Data obtained from the experimental results show that the proposed solution can detect and notify tree-cutting events for efficient and cost-effective forest monitoring through smart IoT, with an accuracy of 85%.

AB  - Medium-term electricity consumption and load forecasting in smart grids is an attractive topic of study, especially using innovative data analysis approaches for future energy consumption trends. Loss of electricity during generation and use is also a problem to be addressed. Both consumers and utilities can benefit from a predictive study of electricity demand and pricing. In this study, we used a new machine learning approach called AdaBoost to identify key features from an ISO-NE dataset that includes daily consumption data over eight years. Moreover, the DT classifier and RF are widely used to extract the best features from the dataset. Moreover, we predicted the electricity load and price using machine learning techniques including support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning techniques such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). Coronavirus herd immunity optimization (CHIO), a novel optimization approach, was used to modify the hyperparameters to increase efficiency, and it used classifiers to improve the performance of our classifier. By adding additional layers to the CNN and fine-tuning its parameters, the probability of overfitting the classifier was reduced. For method validation, we compared our proposed models with several benchmarks. MAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE, the f1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy were the measures used for performance evaluation. Moreover, seven different forms of statistical analysis were given to show why our proposed approaches are preferable. The proposed CNN-CHIO and SVM techniques had the lowest MAPE error rates of 6% and 8%, respectively, and the highest accuracy rates of 95% and 92%, respectively.

AB  - Price forecasting (PF) is the primary concern in distributed power generation. This paper presents a novel and improved technique to forecast electricity prices. The data of various power producers, Capacity Purchase Price (CPP), Power Purchase Price (PPP), Tariff rates, and load demand from National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) are considered for MAPE reduction in PF. Eight time-series and auto-regression algorithms are developed for data fetching and setting the objective function. The feed-forward ANFIS based on the ML approach and space vector regression (SVR) is introduced to PF by taking the input from time series and auto-regression (AR) algorithms. Best-feature selection is conducted by adopting the Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA)-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach that ultimately minimizes the complexity and computational time of the model. The proposed integration strategy computes the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the overall improvement percentage is 9.24%, which is valuable in price forecasting of the energy management system (EMS). In the end, EMS based on the Firefly algorithm (FA) has been presented, and by implementing FA, the cost of electricity has been reduced by 21%, 19%, and 20% for building 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

AB  - Link failures frequently occur in communication networks, which negatively impacts network services delivery. Compared to traditional distributed networks, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) provides numerous benefits for link robustness to avoid services unavailability. To cope with link failures, the existing SDN approaches compute multiple paths and install corresponding flow rules at network switches without considering the reliability value of the primary computed path. This increases computation time, traffic overhead and end-to-end packets delay. This paper proposes a new approach called Reliability Aware Multiple Path Flow Rule (RAF) that calculates links reliability and installs minimum flow rules for multiple paths based on the reliability value of the primary path. RAF has been simulated, evaluated and compared with the existing approaches. The simulation results show that RAF performs better than the existing approaches in terms of computation overhead at the controller and reduces end-to-end packet delay and traffic overhead for flow rules installation.

AB  - As the number of users increased over the years, pioneering technologies and solutions in given areas ceased to be sufficient even in terms of performance. Therefore, there was a need for their development or even redesign and redefinition. One of the issues that undoubtedly has a huge impact on the current shape of the global network and the way information is processed in it is the issue of traffic balancing, especially the one in the server infrastructure related to the WWW service, providing users with the possibility of efficient and reliable web browsing. The paper presents a comparative analysis of selected open-source solutions used for traffic balancing in server infrastructures providing WWW service based on selected criteria. The designed architecture of the test environment and the test results of selected tools implementing the traffic-balancing functionality are presented. Methodologies, test plans, and comparison criteria are proposed. A comparative analysis of results based on specific criteria was performed. The balance between network traffic optimization and load balancing distribution among servers is crucial for the development of energy-efficient data processing centers.

AB  - Despite the significance and growth of wind energy as a major source of renewable energy, research on the risks of wind turbines in the form of accidents and failures has attracted limited attention. Research that applies data analytics methodologically in this context is scarce. The research presented here, upon construction of a text corpus of 721 selected wind turbine accident and failure news reports, develops and applies a custom-developed data analytics framework that integrates tabular analysis, visualization, text mining, and machine learning. Topic modeling was applied for the first time to identify and classify recurring themes in wind turbine accident news, and association mining was applied to identify contextual terms associated with death and injury. The tabular and visual analyses relate accidents to location (offshore vs. onshore), wind turbine life cycle phases (transportation, construction, operation, and maintenance), and the incidence of death and injury. As one of the insights, more incidents were found to occur during operation and transportation. Through topic modeling, topics associated most with deaths and injuries were revealed. The results could benefit wind turbine manufacturers, service providers, energy companies, insurance companies, government bodies, non-profit organizations, researchers, and other stakeholders in the wind energy sector.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Wireless sensor networks are used to monitor the operating status of the microgrids, which can effectively improve the stability of power supplies. The topology control is a critical issue of wireless sensor networks, which affects monitoring data transmission reliability and lifetime of wireless sensor networks. Meanwhile, the data acquisition accuracy of wireless sensor networks has a great impact on the quality of monitoring. Therefore, this paper focuses on improving wireless sensor networks data acquisition satisfaction and energy efficiency. A joint acquisition time design and sensor association optimization algorithm is proposed to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks and enhance the stability of monitoring, which considers the cluster heads selection, data collection satisfaction and sensor association. First, a multi-constrained mixed-integer programming problem, which combines acquisition time design and sensor association, is formulated to maximize data acquisition satisfaction and minimize energy consumption. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent technology. In each iteration, the acquisition time is obtained by Lagrangian duality. After that, the sensor association is modeled as a 0–1 knapsack problem, and the three different methods are proposed to solve it. Finally, the simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm proposed in this paper.

AB  - To accurately predict the economic development of each industry in different types of regions, a deep convolutional neural network model was designed for predicting the annual GDP; GDP growth index; and primary, secondary and tertiary industry growth values of each. In the model, raw industrial data are preprocessed by a normalization operation and subsequently transformed by the BoxCox method to approach the normal distribution. Panel data of consecutive years are constructed and used as input to the deep convolutional neural network, and industrial data of year t + 1 are used as the output of the network. Simulation experiments were conducted to analyze 23 years of industrial economic data from 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. The experimental results show that R-squared value is larger than 0.91 for all 31 provinces and root mean squared log errors (RMSLE) of all regions are less than 0.1, which demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high prediction accuracy with generalization capability and can accurately predict the economic growth trends of different types of regions.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 22
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Available digital maps of indoor environments are limited to a description of the geometrical environment, despite there being an urgent need for more accurate information, particularly data about the electromagnetic (EM) properties of the materials used for walls. Such data would enable new possibilities in the design and optimization of wireless networks and the development of new radio services. In this paper, we introduce, formalize, and evaluate a framework for machine learning (ML) based wireless sensing of indoor surface materials in the form of EM properties. We apply the radio-environment (RE) signatures of the wireless link, which inherently contains environmental information due to the interaction of the radio waves with the environment. We specify the content of the RE signature suitable for surface-material classification as a set of multipath components given by the received power, delay, phase shift, and angle of arrival. The proposed framework applies an ML approach to construct a classification model using RE signatures labeled with the environmental information. The ML method exploits the data obtained from measurements or simulations. The performance of the framework in different scenarios is evaluated based on standard ML performance metrics, such as classification accuracy and F-score. The results of the elementary case prove that the proposed approach can be applied for the classification of the surface material for a plain environment, and can be further extended for the classification of wall materials in more complex indoor environments.

VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Recently, 5G networks have emerged as a new technology that can control the advancement of telecommunication networks and transportation systems. Furthermore, 5G networks provide better network performance while reducing network traffic and complexity compared to current networks. Machine-learning techniques (ML) will help symmetric IoT applications become a significant new data source in the future. Symmetry is a widely studied pattern in various research areas, especially in wireless network traffic. The study of symmetric and asymmetric faults and outliers (anomalies) in network traffic is an important topic. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is an advanced approach in challenging wireless networks such as network management and optimization, anomaly detection, predictive analysis, lifetime value prediction, etc. However, its performance depends on the efficiency of training samples. DL is designed to work with large datasets and uses complex algorithms to train the model. The occurrence of outliers in the raw data reduces the reliability of the training models. In this paper, the performance of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) traffic was estimated using the DL algorithm. A set of robust statistical estimators, called M-estimators, have been proposed as robust loss functions as an alternative to the traditional MSE loss function, to improve the training process and robustize DL in the presence of outliers. We demonstrate their robustness in the presence of outliers on V2X traffic datasets.

AB  - In an effort to reach accident-free milestones or drastically reduce/eliminate road fatalities rates and traffic congestion and to create disruptive, transformational mobility systems and services, different parties (e.g., automakers, universities, governments, and road traffic regulators) have collaborated to research, develop, and test connected vehicle (CV) technologies. CVs create new data-rich environments and are considered key enablers for many applications and services that will make our roads safer, less congested, and more eco-friendly. A deeper understanding of the CV technologies will pave the way to avoid setbacks and will help in developing more innovative applications and breakthroughs. In the CV paradigm, vehicles become smarter by communicating with nearby vehicles, connected infrastructure, and the surroundings. This connectivity will be substantial to support different features and systems, such as adaptive routing, real-time navigation, and slow and near real-time infrastructure. Further examples include environmental sensing, advanced driver-assistance systems, automated driving systems, mobility on demand, and mobility as a service. This article provides a comprehensive review on CV technologies including fundamental challenges, state-of-the-art enabling technologies, innovative applications, and potential opportunities that can benefit automakers, customers, and businesses. The current standardization efforts of the forefront enabling technologies, such as Wi-Fi 6 and 5G-cellular technologies are also reviewed. Different challenges in terms of cooperative computation, privacy/security, and over-the-air updates are discussed. Safety and non-safety applications are described and possible future opportunities that CV technology brings to our life are also highlighted.

VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the rapid growth and development of cities, Intelligent Traffic Management and Control (ITMC) is becoming a fundamental component to address the challenges of modern urban traffic management, where a wide range of daily problems need to be addressed in a prompt and expedited manner. Issues such as unpredictable traffic dynamics, resource constraints, and abnormal events pose difficulties to city managers. ITMC aims to increase the efficiency of traffic management by minimizing the odds of traffic problems, by providing real-time traffic state forecasts to better schedule the intersection signal controls. Reliable implementations of ITMC improve the safety of inhabitants and the quality of life, leading to economic growth. In recent years, researchers have proposed different solutions to address specific problems concerning traffic management, ranging from image-processing and deep-learning techniques to forecasting the traffic state and deriving policies to control intersection signals. This review article studies the primary public datasets helpful in developing models to address the identified problems, complemented with a deep analysis of the works related to traffic state forecast and intersection-signal-control models. Our analysis found that deep-learning-based approaches for short-term traffic state forecast and multi-intersection signal control showed reasonable results, but lacked robustness for unusual scenarios, particularly during oversaturated situations, which can be resolved by explicitly addressing these cases, potentially leading to significant improvements of the systems overall. However, there is arguably a long path until these models can be used safely and effectively in real-world scenarios.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 22
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - A reverse vending machine motivates citizens to bring recyclable waste by rewarding them, which is a viable solution to increase the recycling rate. Reverse vending machines generally use near-infrared sensors, barcode sensors, or cameras to classify recycling resources. However, sensor-based reverse vending machines suffer from a high configuration cost and the limited scope of target objects, and conventional single image-based reverse vending machines usually make erroneous predictions about intentional fraud objects. This paper proposes a dual image-based convolutional neural network ensemble model to address these problems. For this purpose, we first created a prototype reverse vending machine and constructed an image dataset containing two cross-sections of objects, top and front view. Then, we chose convolutional neural network models widely used in image classification as the candidates for building an accurate and lightweight ensemble model. Considering the size and classification performance of candidates, we constructed the best-fit ensemble combination and evaluated its classification performance. The final ensemble model showed a classification accuracy higher than 95% for all target classes, including fraud objects. This result proves that our approach achieves better robustness against intentional fraud objects than single image-based models and thus can broaden the scope for target resources. The measurement results on lightweight embedded platforms also demonstrated that our model provides a short inference time that is enough to facilitate the real-time execution of reverse vending machines based on low-cost edge artificial intelligence devices.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - The high level of energy consumption of buildings is significantly influencing occupant behavior changes towards improved energy efficiency. This paper introduces a systematic literature review with two objectives: to understand the more relevant factors affecting energy consumption of buildings and to find the best intelligent computing (IC) methods capable of classifying and predicting energy consumption of different types of buildings. Adopting the PRISMA method, the paper analyzed 822 manuscripts from 2013 to 2020 and focused on 106, based on title and abstract screening and on manuscripts with experiments. A text mining process and a bibliometric map tool (VOS viewer) were adopted to find the most used terms and their relationships, in the energy and IC domains. Our approach shows that the terms &ldquo;consumption,&rdquo; &ldquo;residential,&rdquo; and &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; are the more relevant terms in the energy domain, in terms of the ratio of important terms (TITs), whereas &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; is the more commonly used term in the IC domain. The paper also shows that there are strong relations between &ldquo;Residential Energy Consumption&rdquo; and &ldquo;Electricity Consumption,&rdquo; &ldquo;Heating&rdquo; and &ldquo;Climate. Finally, we checked and analyzed 41 manuscripts in detail, summarized their major contributions, and identified several research gaps that provide hints for further research.

AB  - Background: The increasing population of humans, changing food consumption behavior, as well as the recent developments in the awareness for food sustainability, lead to new challenges for the production of food. Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, including Machine Learning and data analytics, might help to account for these challenges. Scope and Approach: Several research perspectives, among them Precision Agriculture, Industrial IoT, Internet of Food, or Smart Health, already provide new opportunities through digitalization. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art of the mentioned concepts. An additional concept is Food Informatics, which so far is mostly recognized as a mainly data-driven approach to support the production of food. In this review paper, we propose and discuss a new perspective for the concept of Food Informatics as a supportive discipline that subsumes the incorporation of information technology, mainly IoT and AI, in order to support the variety of aspects tangent to the food production process and delineate it from other, existing research streams in the domain. Key Findings and Conclusions: Many different concepts related to the digitalization in food science overlap. Further, Food Informatics is vaguely defined. In this paper, we provide a clear definition of Food Informatics and delineate it from related concepts. We corroborate our new perspective on Food Informatics by presenting several case studies about how it can support the food production as well as the intermediate steps until its consumption, and further describe its integration with related concepts.

AB  - As a result of environmental pollution and the ever-growing demand for energy, there has been a shift from conventional vehicles towards electric vehicles (EVs). Public acceptance of EVs and their large-scale deployment raises requires a fully operational charging infrastructure. Charging infrastructure planning is an intricate process involving various activities, such as charging station placement, charging demand prediction, and charging scheduling. This planning process involves interactions between power distribution and the road network. The advent of machine learning has made data-driven approaches a viable means for solving charging infrastructure planning problems. Consequently, researchers have started using machine learning techniques to solve the aforementioned problems associated with charging infrastructure planning. This work aims to provide a comprehensive review of the machine learning applications used to solve charging infrastructure planning problems. Furthermore, three case studies on charging station placement and charging demand prediction are presented. This paper is an extension of: Deb, S. (2021, June).

A well-structured, comprehensive questionnaire was developed and data were collected from 203 respondents who were customers of six IFIs in Pakistan and had at least 2 years of experience in dealing confiorm this is correct with these IFIs. A total of 171 accurate responses were received from the respondents. Ten hypotheses were developed and statistically verified using regression and correlation analytical techniques. The results reveal that the quality of customer services and awareness of IFIs had a direct and positive relationship with customer loyalty, which in turn was mediated by customer satisfaction. Perceptions about IFIs had a direct positive relation with customer satisfaction. However, the relation of perceptions and quality of service with customer loyalty and satisfaction in financial institutions through technology integration was found to be insignificant, even in the presence of customer satisfaction as a mediator.

AB  - The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has led to the growth and expansion of various new opportunities in the new Industrial Transformation. There have been notable challenges regarding the security of data and challenges related to privacy when collecting real-time and automatic data while observing applications in the industry. This paper proposes an Federated Transfer Learning for Authentication and Privacy Preservation Using Novel Supportive Twin Delayed DDPG (S-TD3) Algorithm for IIoT. In FT-Block (Federated transfer learning blockchain), several blockchains are applied to preserve privacy and security for all types of industrial applications. Additionally, by introducing the authentication mechanism based on transfer learning, blockchains can enhance the preservation and security standards for industrial applications. Specifically, Novel Supportive Twin Delayed DDPG trains the user model to authenticate specific regions. As it is considered one of the most open and scalable interacting platforms of information, it successfully helps in the positive transfer of different kinds of data between devices in more significant and local operations of the industry. It is mainly due to a single authentication factor, and the poor adaptation to regular increases in the number of users and different requirements that make the current authentication mechanism suffer a lot in IIoT. As a result, it has been very clearly observed that the given solutions are very useful.

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - In this article, a systematic literature review of 419 articles on energy demand modeling, published between 2015 and 2020, is presented. This provides researchers with an exhaustive overview of the examined literature and classification of techniques for energy demand modeling. Unlike in existing literature reviews, in this comprehensive study all of the following aspects of energy demand models are analyzed: techniques, prediction accuracy, inputs, energy carrier, sector, temporal horizon, and spatial granularity. Readers benefit from easy access to a broad literature base and find decision support when choosing suitable data-model combinations for their projects. Results have been compiled in comprehensive figures and tables, providing a structured summary of the literature, and containing direct references to the analyzed articles. Drawbacks of techniques are discussed as well as countermeasures. The results show that among the articles, machine learning (ML) techniques are used the most, are mainly applied to short-term electricity forecasting on a regional level and rely on historic load as their main data source. Engineering-based models are less dependent on historic load data and cover appliance consumption on long temporal horizons. Metaheuristic and uncertainty techniques are often used in hybrid models. Statistical techniques are frequently used for energy demand modeling as well and often serve as benchmarks for other techniques. Among the articles, the accuracy measured by mean average percentage error (MAPE) proved to be on similar levels for all techniques. This review eases the reader into the subject matter by presenting the emphases that have been made in the current literature, suggesting future research directions, and providing the basis for quantitative testing of hypotheses regarding applicability and dominance of specific methods for sub-categories of demand modeling.

AB  - An increase in the number and strength of natural catastrophes experienced over the past few decades has accelerated the damage sustained by infrastructures. Drinking water and wastewater infrastructure systems are critical aspects of a healthy environment, and their ability to withstand disasters is vital for effective disaster response and recovery. Although numerous studies have been conducted to determine the challenges that natural disasters render to water infrastructures, few extensive examinations of these challenges have been conducted. The goal of this study, therefore, was to identify and categorize the challenges related to the resilience of drinking water and wastewater infrastructures, and to determine the strategies that most effectively minimize their unintended consequences. A comprehensive evaluation of the existing literature was conducted, and 537 publications were collected. After extensive screening, 222 publications were selected for rigorous evaluation and analysis based on the data collection methods and other criteria. A total of fifty-one (51) challenges were determined and classified, within the following five categories: environmental, technical and infrastructure, social, organizational, and financial and economic. The challenges were then ranked within each category according to their frequency of occurrence in previous research. The results reveal that climate change, aging infrastructure, lack of infrastructure capital, population growth, improper maintenance of water infrastructure, and rapid urbanization are the most frequently cited challenges. Next, 30 strategies and approaches were identified and categorized into either preventive or corrective actions, according to their implementation time. The findings of this study will help decision- and policymakers properly allocate their limited funding to enhance the robustness of their water infrastructures before, during, and after natural hazards.

AB  - The concept of Healthy Cities, introduced by the World Health Organization, demonstrates the value of health for the whole urban system. As one of the most important components of urban systems, transportation plays an important role in Healthy Cities. Many transportation evaluation systems focus on factors such as road networks, parking spaces, transportation speed, accessibility, convenience, and commuting time, while the vulnerability and resilience of urban transportation are rarely evaluated. This study presents the preliminary progress in the evaluation of traffic vulnerability and resilience during precipitation events in 39 Chinese cities. Traffic congestion index data, derived from the Baidu Map Smart Transportation Platform, and rainfall data, derived from NASA&rsquo;s global precipitation measurement, are utilized. Traffic vulnerability index, traffic resilience index, and the corresponding quantitative methods are proposed, and the analysis results are presented. This study is of value in improving the understanding of urban traffic vulnerability and resilience, and in enabling the quantitative evaluation of them in urban health assessment and the Healthy Cities program.

AB  - Nowadays, pavement management systems (PMS) are mainly based on monitoring processes that have been established for a long time, and strongly depend on acquired experience. However, with the emergence of smart technologies, such as internet of things and artificial intelligence, PMS could be improved by applying these new smart technologies to their decision support systems, not just by updating their data collection methodologies, but also their data analysis tools. The application of these smart technologies to the field of pavement monitoring and condition evaluation will undoubtedly contribute to more efficient, less costly, safer, and environmentally friendly methodologies. Thus, the main drive of the present work is to provide insight for the development of future decision support systems for smart pavement management by conducting a systematic literature review of the developed works that apply smart technologies to this field. The conclusions drawn from the analysis allowed for the identification of a series of future direction recommendations for researchers. In fact, future PMS should tend to be capable of collecting and analyzing data at different levels, both externally at the surface or inside the pavement, as well as to detect and predict all types of functional and structural flaws and defects.

AB  - Ukraine is an associate member of the European Union, and in the coming years, it is expected that all the data and services already used by European Union countries will become available for Ukraine. An important program, which is the basis for building European monitoring services for smart cities, is the Copernicus program. The two most important services of this program are the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). CLMS provides important information on land use in Europe. In the context of smart cities, the most valuable tool is the Urban Atlas service, which is related to local CLMS services and provides a detailed digital city plan in vector form, which is segmented into small functional areas classified by Coordinate Information on the Environment (CORINE) nomenclature. The Urban Atlas is a geospatial layer with high resolution, built for all European cities with a population of more than 100,000. It combines high-resolution satellite data, city segmentation by blocks and functional urban areas (FUAs), important city infrastructure, etc. This product is used as a basis for city planning and obtaining analytics on the most important indicators of city development, including air quality monitoring. For Ukraine, such geospatial products are not provided under the Copernicus program. In this article, FUAs are developed for Ukrainian cities using European technology. It is important to start work on this program&rsquo;s implementation as early as possible so that when the first city atlas appears, Ukraine will be ready to work with it together with the European community. This requires preparing the basis for national research and training national stakeholders and consumers to use this product. To make this happen, it is necessary to have a national geospatial product that can be used as an analogue of the city atlas. In this article, the authors analyzed the existing methods of air quality assessment and the Global Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 11.6.2, &ldquo;Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5 and PM10) in cities (population weighted)&rdquo;, achieved for European cities. Based on this, indicator 11.6.2 was then evaluated for the first time in Ukraine, considering the next 5 years. For the correct use of global products for Ukraine, CAMS global satellite data and population data (Global Human Settlement Layer and NASA population data) for Ukrainian cities were validated. These studies showed a statistically significant result and, therefore, demonstrated that global products can be used to monitor air quality both at the city level and for Ukraine as a whole. The obtained results were analyzed, and the values of indicator 11.6.2 for Ukraine were compared with those for other European countries.

AB  - Several cities have recently moved towards becoming smart cities for better services and quality of life for residents and visitors, with: optimized resource utilization; increased environmental protection; enhanced infrastructure operations and maintenance; and strong safety and security measures. Smart cities depend on deploying current and new technologies and different optimization methods to enhance services and performance in their different sectors. Some of the technologies assisting smart city applications are the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, and cloud computing. Integrating these three to serve one system (we will refer to it as integrated IoT-fog-cloud system (iIFC)) creates an advanced platform to develop and operate various types of smart city applications. This platform will allow applications to use the best features from the IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud services to deliver best capabilities and performance. Utilizing this powerful platform will provide many opportunities for enhancing and optimizing applications in energy, transportation, healthcare, and other areas. In this paper we survey various applications of iIFCs for smart cities. We identify different common issues associated with utilizing iIFCs for smart city applications. These issues arise due to the characteristics of iIFCs on the one side and the requirements of different smart city applications on the other. In addition, we outline the main requirements to effectively utilize iIFCs for smart city applications. These requirements are related to optimization, networking, and security.

AB  - This paper focuses on the consumer preferences for the so-called &ldquo;smart homes&rdquo; (also known as &ldquo;smart houses&rdquo;) which represent a novel addition and a product of the on-going digitalization and the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). The major scientific contribution of our study is the empirical model build on the data from the online questionnaire conducted with randomly selected respondents (N = 523) from four European Union (EU) countries and Russia. Even though our results are subject to limitations (no Southern of Northern European countries are included in the scope of this research, which might have yielded different results due to the differences in wealth of citizens and climate in comparison to the Central and Eastern European countries or Germany), they demonstrate that the users included in our sample generally feel inclined to the smart homes technologies and perceive them as a plausible means for improving the safety and security of their lives. On the other hand, some respondents from our sample expressed their concerns over the cybersecurity and technology dependence issues associated with smart homes. It is also apparent that younger respondents (aged 16&ndash;35) featured in our research are more worried about their personal data being monitored and analyzed (with a pending threat of leakages). All these results are original and constitute an important scientific value-added to the field of research in smart home technologies and their acceptance by the general public. We demonstrate that the further enhancement of smart homes, and the increase of their popularity and affordability among the customers both in the Central and Eastern European countries and beyond, might depend on the development of the smart grids which these smart homes are an integral part of. The reliability of the smart systems constitutes the key element for achieving the satisfaction of the smart homes residents, and hence needs to be achieved and secured in an effective way. This would ensure the right mix and balance of energy security and efficiency for all customers involved in this process.

AB  - The recent advance in information technology has created a new era named the Internet of Things (IoT). This new technology allows objects (things) to be connected to the Internet, such as smart TVs, printers, cameras, smartphones, smartwatches, etc. This trend provides new services and applications for many users and enhances their lifestyle. The rapid growth of the IoT makes the incorporation and connection of several devices a predominant procedure. Although there are many advantages of IoT devices, there are different challenges that come as network anomalies. In this research, the current studies in the use of deep learning (DL) in DDoS intrusion detection have been presented. This research aims to implement different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in WEKA tools to analyze the detection performance for DDoS attacks using the most recent CICDDoS2019 datasets. CICDDoS2019 was found to be the model with best results. This research has used six different types of ML algorithms which are K_Nearest_Neighbors (K-NN), super vector machine (SVM), na&iuml;ve bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR). The best accuracy result in the presented evaluation was achieved when utilizing the Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms, 99% and 99%, respectively. However, the DT is better than RF because it has a shorter computation time, 4.53 s and 84.2 s, respectively. Finally, open issues for further research in future work are presented.

TI  - Smart Homes as Enablers for Depression Pre-Diagnosis Using PHQ-9 on HMI through Fuzzy Logic Decision System
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Depression is a common mental illness characterized by sadness, lack of interest, or pleasure. According to the DSM-5, there are nine symptoms, from which an individual must present 4 or 5 in the last two weeks to fulfill the diagnosis criteria of depression. Nevertheless, the common methods that health care professionals use to assess and monitor depression symptoms are face-to-face questionnaires leading to time-consuming or expensive methods. On the other hand, smart homes can monitor householders&rsquo; health through smart devices such as smartphones, wearables, cameras, or voice assistants connected to the home. Although the depression disorders at smart homes are commonly oriented to the senior sector, depression affects all of us. Therefore, even though an expert needs to diagnose the depression disorder, questionnaires as the PHQ-9 help spot any depressive symptomatology as a pre-diagnosis. Thus, this paper proposes a three-step framework; the first step assesses the nine questions to the end-user through ALEXA or a gamified HMI. Then, a fuzzy logic decision system considers three actions based on the nine responses. Finally, the last step considers these three actions: continue monitoring through Alexa and the HMI, suggest specialist referral, and mandatory specialist referral.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - Currently, a smart city is an emerging field in urban cities to improve the quality of life through information and communication technology (ICT). In general, the traditional solid waste management (SWM) approach taken by municipal authorities for waste collection in urban areas must be enhanced to achieve the green and smart city goals. This article is primarily focused on the progress of ICT technologies in solid waste management. With that aim, a thorough analysis is carried out in the article, and from the analysis, we have identified distinct ICT technologies that have been implemented in SWM. The function, application, and limitations of each technology are presented in the article. From the review, it is concluded that the implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in minimizing the negative impact of waste on the environment. It is also identified that selection of the appropriate wireless communication protocol is critical during the implementation of IoT-based system because the sensor node at the bins is battery-powered. In addition, it is analysed that blockchain technology plays an essential role in realizing the waste&ndash;money model, as this model includes transactions between users and recyclers. Finally, in this article, we propose that the waste-to-money model, local network and gateway architecture, vision node, and customized prototype improve solid waste management system in terms of communication, energy consumption, and real-time monitoring.

AB  - The detection of buildings in the city is essential in several geospatial domains and for decision-making regarding intelligence for city planning, tax collection, project management, revenue generation, and smart cities, among other areas. In the past, the classical approach used for building detection was by using the imagery and it entailed human&ndash;computer interaction, which was a daunting proposition. To tackle this task, a novel network based on an end-to-end deep learning framework is proposed to detect and classify buildings features. The proposed CNN has three parallel stream channels: the first is the high-resolution aerial imagery, while the second stream is the digital surface model (DSM). The third was fixed on extracting deep features using the fusion of channel one and channel two, respectively. Furthermore, the channel has eight group convolution blocks of 2D convolution with three max-pooling layers. The proposed model&rsquo;s efficiency and dependability were tested on three different categories of complex urban building structures in the study area. Then, morphological operations were applied to the extracted building footprints to increase the uniformity of the building boundaries and produce improved building perimeters. Thus, our approach bridges a significant gap in detecting building objects in diverse environments; the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of the proposed method are greater than 80% and 0.605, respectively. The findings support the proposed framework and methodologies&rsquo; efficacy and effectiveness at extracting buildings from complex environments.

AB  - Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as an advancement over the traditional Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) towards achieving a more efficient intelligent transportation system that is capable of providing various intelligent services and supporting different applications for the drivers and passengers on roads. In order for the IoV and VANETs environments to be able to offer such beneficial road services, huge amounts of data are generated and exchanged among the different communicated entities in these vehicular networks wirelessly via open channels, which could attract the adversaries and threaten the network with several possible types of security attacks. In this survey, we target the authentication part of the security system while highlighting the efficiency of blockchains in the IoV and VANETs environments. First, a detailed background on IoV and blockchain is provided, followed by a wide range of security requirements, challenges, and possible attacks in vehicular networks. Then, a more focused review is provided on the recent blockchain-based authentication schemes in IoV and VANETs with a detailed comparative study in terms of techniques used, network models, evaluation tools, and attacks counteracted. Lastly, some future challenges for IoV security are discussed that are necessary to be addressed in the upcoming research.

AB  - The paper addresses the problem of insufficient knowledge on the impact of noise on the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model identification. The work offers a simulation-based solution to the analysis of the tolerance to noise of ARIMA models in electrical load forecasting. In the study, an idealized ARIMA model obtained from real load data of the Polish power system was disturbed by noise of different levels. The model was then re-identified, its parameters were estimated, and new forecasts were calculated. The experiment allowed us to evaluate the robustness of ARIMA models to noise in their ability to predict electrical load time series. It could be concluded that the reaction of the ARIMA model to random disturbances of the modeled time series was relatively weak. The limiting noise level at which the forecasting ability of the model collapsed was determined. The results highlight the key role of the data preprocessing stage in data mining and learning. They contribute to more accurate decision making in an uncertain environment, help to shape energy policy, and have implications for the sustainability and reliability of power systems.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Recently, remote sensing satellite image analysis has received significant attention from geo-information scientists. However, the current geo-information systems lack automatic detection of several building characteristics inside the high-resolution satellite images. The accurate extraction of buildings characteristics helps the decision-makers to optimize urban planning and achieve better decisions. Furthermore, Building orientation angle is a very critical parameter in the accuracy of automated building detection algorithms. However, the traditional computer vision techniques lack accuracy, scalability, and robustness for building orientation angle detection. This paper proposes two different approaches to deep building orientation angle estimation in the high-resolution satellite image. Firstly, we propose a transfer deep learning approach for our estimation task. Secondly, we propose a novel optimized DCRN network consisting of pre-processing, scaled gradient layer, deep convolutional units, dropout layers, and regression end layer. The early proposed gradient layer helps the DCRN network to extract more helpful information and increase its performance. We have collected a building benchmark dataset that consists of building images in Riyadh city. The images used in the experiments are 15,190 buildings images. In our experiments, we have compared our proposed approaches and the other approaches in the literature. The proposed system has achieved the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) value of 1.24, the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.16, and the highest adjusted R-squared value of 0.99 using the RMS optimizer. The cost of processing time of our proposed DCRN architecture is 0.0113 &plusmn; 0.0141 s. Our proposed approach has proven its stability with the input building image contrast variation for all orientation angles. Our experimental results are promising, and it is suggested to be utilized in other building characteristics estimation tasks in high-resolution satellite images.

AB  - Recently, more and more solutions have utilised artificial intelligence approaches in order to enhance or optimise processes to achieve greater sustainability. One of the most pressing issues is the emissions caused by cars; in this paper, the problem of optimising the route of delivery cars is tackled. In this paper, the applicability of the deep reinforcement learning algorithms with regards to the aforementioned problem is tested on a simulation game designed and implemented to pose various challenges such as constant change of delivery locations. The algorithms chosen for this task are Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) with and without Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). These novel and advanced reinforcement learning algorithms have yet not been utilised in similar scenarios. The differences in performance and learning process of those are visualised and discussed. It is demonstrated that both of those algorithms present a slow but steady learning curve, which is an expected effect of reinforcement learning algorithms, leading to a conclusion that the algorithms would discover an optimal policy with an adequately long learning process. Additionally, the benefits of the Proximal Policy Optimisation algorithm are proven by the enhanced learning curve with comparison to the Advantage Actor-Critic approach, as the learning process is characterised by faster growth with a significantly smaller variation. Finally, the applicability of such algorithms in the described scenarios is discussed, alongside the possible improvements and future work.

AB  - Object counting is an active research area that gained more attention in the past few years. In smart cities, vehicle counting plays a crucial role in urban planning and management of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to address this problem. However, the resulting detection accuracy is still not adequate. This paper proposes an efficient approach that uses deep learning concepts and correlation filters for multi-object counting and tracking. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using a dataset consisting of 16 videos with different features to examine the impact of object density, image quality, angle of view, and speed of motion towards system accuracy. Performance evaluation exhibits promising results in normal traffic scenarios and adverse weather conditions. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms the performance of two recent approaches from the literature.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 10

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Previous VideoGIS integration methods mostly used geographic homography mapping. However, the related processing techniques were mainly for independent cameras and the software architecture was C/S, resulting in large deviations in geographic video mapping for small scenes, a lack of multi-camera video fusion, and difficulty in accessing real-time information with WebGIS. Therefore, we propose real-time web map construction based on the object height and camera posture (RTWM-HP for short). We first consider the constraint of having a similar height for each object by constructing an auxiliary plane and establishing a high-precision homography matrix (HP-HM) between the plane and the map; thus, the accuracy of geographic video mapping can be improved. Then, we map the objects in the multi-camera video with overlapping areas to geographic space and perform the object selection with the multi-camera (OS-CDD) algorithm, which includes the confidence of the object, the distance, and the angle between the objects and the center of the cameras. Further, we use the WebSocket technology to design a hybrid C/S and B/S software framework that is suitable for WebGIS integration. Experiments were carried out based on multi-camera videos and high-precision geospatial data in an office and a parking lot. The case study&rsquo;s results show the following: (1) The HP-HM method can achieve the high-precision geographic mapping of objects (such as human heads and cars) with multiple cameras; (2) the OS-CDD algorithm can optimize and adjust the positions of the objects in the overlapping area and achieve a better map visualization effect; (3) RTWM-HP can publish real-time maps of objects with multiple cameras, which can be browsed in real time through point layers and hot-spot layers through WebGIS. The methods can be applied to some fields, such as person or car supervision and the flow analysis of customers or traffic passengers.

AB  - The Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is a network that does not have a fixed infrastructure. Migratory routes and related hosts that are connected via wireless networks self-configure it. Routers and hosts are free to wander, and nodes can change the topology fast and unexpectedly. In emergencies, such as natural/human disasters, armed conflicts, and emergencies, the lowest configuration will ensure ad hoc network applicability. Due to the rapidly rising cellular service requirements and deployment demands, mobile ad-hoc networks have been established in numerous places in recent decades. These applications include topics such as environmental surveillance and others. The underlying routing protocol in a given context has a significant impact on the ad hoc network deployment power. To satisfy the needs of the service level and efficiently meet the deployment requirements, developing a practical and secure MANET routing protocol is a critical task. However, owing to the intrinsic characteristics of ad hoc networks, such as frequent topology changes, open wireless media and limited resources, developing a safe routing protocol is difficult. Therefore, it is vital to develop stable and dependable routing protocols for MANET to provide a better packet delivery relationship, fewer delays, and lower overheads. Because the stability of nodes along this trail is variable, the route discovered cannot be trusted. This paper proposes an efficient Neighbour Feedback-based Trusted Multi Authenticated Node (NFbTMAN) Routing Model. The proposed model is compared to traditional models, and the findings reveal that the proposed model is superior in terms of data security.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has already gained the attention of the researchers involved in smart city (SC) initiatives, along with other advanced technologies such as IoT, big data, cloud computing, or analytics. In this context, researchers also realized that data can help in making the SC happen but also, the open data movement has encouraged more research works using machine learning. Based on this line of reasoning, the aim of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review to investigate open data-based machine learning applications in the six different areas of smart cities. The results of this research reveal that: (a) machine learning applications using open data came out in all the SC areas and specific ML techniques are discovered for each area, with deep learning and supervised learning being the first choices. (b) Open data platforms represent the most frequently used source of data. (c) The challenges associated with open data utilization vary from quality of data, to frequency of data collection, to consistency of data, and data format. Overall, the data synopsis as well as the in-depth analysis may be a valuable support and inspiration for the future smart city projects.

AB  - The role of energy is cardinal for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the enhancement and modernization of energy generation and management practices. The smart grid enables efficient communication between utilities and the end- users, and enhances the user experience by monitoring and controlling the energy transmission. The smart grid deals with an enormous amount of energy data, and the absence of proper techniques for data collection, processing, monitoring and decision-making ultimately makes the system ineffective. Big data analytics, in association with the smart grid, enable better grid visualization and contribute toward the attainment of sustainability. The current research work deals with the achievement of sustainability in the smart grid and efficient data management using big data analytics, that has social, economic, technical and political impacts. This study provides clear insights into energy data generated in the grid and the possibilities of energy theft affecting the sustainable future. The paper provides insights about the importance of big data analytics, with their effects on the smart grids&rsquo; performance towards the achievement of SDGs. The work highlights efficient real-time energy data management involving artificial intelligence and machine learning for a better future, to short out the effects of the conventional smart grid without big data analytics. Finally, the work discusses the challenges and future directions to improve smart grid technologies with big data analytics in action.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 7
IS  - 4
SN  - 2199-8531

AB  - This article analyses three recent shifts in what called the geography of &lsquo;Big Things&rsquo;, meaning the contemporary functions and adaptability of modern city centre architecture. We periodise the three styles conventionally into the fashionable &lsquo;Starchitecture&rsquo; of the 1990s, the repurposed &lsquo;Agritecture&rsquo; of the 2000s and the parodising &lsquo;Parkitecture&rsquo; of the 2010s. Starchitecture was the form of new architecture coinciding with the rise of neo-liberalism in its brief era of global urban competitiveness prevalent in the 1990s. After the Great Financial Crash of 2007&ndash;2008, the market for high-rise emblems of iconic, thrusting, skyscrapers and giant downtown and suburban shopping malls waned and online shopping and working from home destroyed the main rental values of the CBD. In some illustrious cases, &lsquo;Agritecture&rsquo; caused re-purposed office blocks and other CBD accompaniments to be re-purposed as settings for high-rise urban farming, especially aquaponics and hydroponic horticulture. Now, COVID-19 has further undermined traditional CBD property markets, causing some administrations to decide to bulldoze their &lsquo;deadmalls&rsquo; and replace them with urban prairie landscapes, inviting the designation &lsquo;Parkitecture&rsquo; for the bucolic results. This paper presents an account of these transitions with reference to questions raised by urban cultural scholars such as Jane M. Jacobs and Jean Gottmann to figure out answers in time and space to questions their work poses.

TI  - A Survey of Recent Indoor Localization Scenarios and Methodologies
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 23
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Recently, various novel scenarios have been studied for indoor localization. The trilateration is known as a classic theoretical model of geometric-based indoor localization, with uniform RSSI data that can be transferred directly into distance ranges. Then, a trilateration solution can be algebraically acquired from theses ranges, in order to fix user&rsquo;s actual location. However, the collected RSSI or other measurement data should be further processed and classified to lower the localization error rate, instead of using the raw data influenced by multi-path effect, multiple nonlinear interference and noises. In this survey, a large number of existing techniques are presented for different indoor network structures and channel conditions, divided as LOS (light-of-sight) and NLOS (non light-of-sight). Besides, the input measurement data such as RSSI (received signal strength indication), TDOA (time difference of arrival), DOA (distance of arrival), and RTT (round trip time) are studied towards different application scenarios. The key localization techniques like RSSI-based fingerprinting technique are presented using supervised machine learning methods, namely SVM (support vector machine), KNN (K nearest neighbors) and NN (neural network) methods, especially in an offline training phase. Other unsupervised methods as isolation forest, k-means, and expectation maximization methods are utilized to further improve the localization accuracy in online testing phase. For Bayesian filtering methods, apart from the basic linear Kalman filter (LKF) methods, nonlinear stochastic filters such as extended KF, cubature KF, unscented KF and particle filters are introduced. These nonlinear methods are more suitable for dynamic localization models. In addition to the localization accuracy, the other important performance features and evaluation aspects are presented in our paper: scalability, stability, reliability, and the complexity of proposed algorithms is compared in this survey. Our paper provides a comprehensive perspective to compare the existing techniques and related practical localization models, with the aim of improving localization accuracy and reducing the complexity of the system.

TI  - Use of AI Algorithms in Different Building Typologies for Energy Efficiency towards Smart Buildings
T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Buildings&rsquo; heating and cooling systems account for an important part of total energy consumption. The EU&rsquo;s directives and engagements motivate building owners and relevant stakeholders in the energy and construction sectors towards net zero energy buildings by maximizing the use of renewable energy sources, ICT, and automation systems. However, the high costs of investment for the renovation of buildings, in situ use of renewable energy production, and installation of expensive ICT infrastructure and automation systems in small&ndash;medium range buildings are the main obstacles for the wide adoption of EU building directives in small- and medium-range buildings. On the other hand, the concept of sharing computational and data storage resources among various buildings can be an alternative approach to achieving smart buildings and smart cities where the main control power resides on a server. Unlike other studies that focus on the implementation of AI techniques in a building or separated buildings with local processing resources and data storage, in this work a corporate server was employed to control the heating systems in three building typologies and to examine the potential benefits of controlling existing buildings in a unified energy-savings platform. The key finding of this work is that the AI algorithms incorporated into the proposed system achieved significant energy savings in the order of 20&ndash;40% regardless of building typology, building functionality, and type of heating system, despite the COVID-19 measures for frequent ventilation of the buildings, even in cases with older-type heating systems.

AB  - The streaming and recording of smartphone sensor signals is desirable for mHealth, telemedicine, environmental monitoring and other applications. Time series data gathered in these fields typically benefit from the time-synchronized integration of different sensor signals. However, solutions required for this synchronization are mostly available for stationary setups. We hope to contribute to the important emerging field of portable data acquisition by presenting open-source Android applications both for the synchronized streaming (Send-a) and recording (Record-a) of multiple sensor data streams. We validate the applications in terms of functionality, flexibility and precision in fully mobile setups and in hybrid setups combining mobile and desktop hardware. Our results show that the fully mobile solution is equivalent to well-established desktop versions. With the streaming application Send-a and the recording application Record-a, purely smartphone-based setups for mobile research and personal health settings can be realized on off-the-shelf Android devices.

TI  - Introduction of IoT-Based Surrogate Parameters in the Ex-Post Countermeasure of Industrial Sectors in Integrated Permit Policy
T2  - Sustainability

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13
IS  - 23
SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - New approaches and techniques are required for environmental management in workplaces that emit pollutants. The best available techniques (BATs) that are suggested by the integrated environmental permit system (IEPS) play a pivotal role in providing state-of-the-art approaches and techniques to workplaces. For the workplaces that install facilities with the BATs, it is necessary to perform real-time monitoring to determine whether pollutant emission facilities and treatment facilities are operating normally and whether such facilities can maintain the optimal condition during the emission of pollutants. The environmental management measures used before the IEPS had limitations for workplaces that are subjected to integrated environmental management because they consider the entire workplace as a single pollution source by combining all media. In addition, only the emission concentrations and amounts of pollutants were monitored because only the points at which most pollutants are discharged, i.e., stacks for air pollutant emission facilities and final effluent outlets for water pollutant emission facilities, are monitored. These monitoring approaches in a variety of facilities involve considerable costs, and most of them (95% for stacks in workplaces under IEPS, Korea) cannot perform real-time observation even though some of them are capable of it (5% for stacks managed by Tele Monitoring System, TMS). In this study, the applicability of a wireless sensor monitoring network was examined as a new approach for environmental management in workplaces. Based on the sensor monitoring network, surrogate parameters that can indirectly monitor the critical operating factors of pollutant emission and prevention facilities were developed and then measured in real time to examine the status of these facilities. Surrogate parameters can be used instead of directly measuring pollutants as the former has high efficiency, such as cost reduction, and can provide reliable data on the emission characteristics of pollutants. The wireless network is based on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform under real-time conditions in the emission and production facilities in a workplace. This study suggested that a wireless network using the IoT platform improves the BAT assessment methodology to understand the efficiency of environmental pollution reduction and the economic contribution to the workplace.

AB  - The demand for the digital monitoring of environmental ecosystems is high and growing rapidly as a means of protecting the public and managing the environment. However, before data, algorithms, and models can be mobilized at scale, there are considerable concerns associated with privacy and security that can negatively affect the adoption of technology within this domain. In this paper, we propose the advancement of electronic environmental monitoring through the capability provided by the blockchain. The blockchain&rsquo;s use of a distributed ledger as its underlying infrastructure is an attractive approach to counter these privacy and security issues, although its performance and ability to manage sensor data must be assessed. We focus on a new distributed ledger technology for the IoT, called IOTA, that is based on a directed acyclic graph. IOTA overcomes the current limitations of the blockchain and offers a data communication protocol called masked authenticated messaging for secure data sharing among Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We show how the application layer employing the data communication protocol, MAM, can support the secure transmission, storage, and retrieval of encrypted environmental sensor data by using an immutable distributed ledger such as that shown in IOTA. Finally, we evaluate, compare, and analyze the performance of the MAM protocol against a non-protocol approach.

AB  - The emergence of new technologies and the era of IoT which will be based on compute-intensive applications. These applications will increase the traffic volume of today&rsquo;s network infrastructure and will impact more on emerging Fifth Generation (5G) system. Research is going in many details, such as how to provide automation in managing and configuring data analysis tasks over cloud and edges, and to achieve minimum latency and bandwidth consumption with optimizing task allocation. The major challenge for researchers is to push the artificial intelligence to the edge to fully discover the potential of the fog computing paradigm. There are existing intelligence-based fog computing frameworks for IoT based applications, but research on Edge-Artificial Intelligence (Edge-AI) is still in its initial stage. Therefore, we chose to focus on data analytics and offloading in our proposed architecture. To address these problems, we have proposed a prototype of our architecture, which is a multi-layered architecture for data analysis between cloud and fog computing layers to perform latency- sensitive analysis with low latency. The main goal of this research is to use this multi-layer fog computing platform for enhancement of data analysis system based on IoT devices in real-time. Our research based on the policy of the OpenFog Consortium which will offer the good outcomes, but also surveillance and data analysis functionalities. We presented through case studies that our proposed prototype architecture outperformed the cloud-only environment in delay-time, network usage, and energy consumption.

AB  - Road extraction is important for road network renewal, intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. This paper proposes an effective method to improve road extraction accuracy and reconstruct the broken road lines caused by ground occlusion. Firstly, an attention mechanism-based convolution neural network is established to enhance feature extraction capability. By highlighting key areas and restraining interference features, the road extraction accuracy is improved. Secondly, for the common broken road problem in the extraction results, a heuristic method based on connected domain analysis is proposed to reconstruct the road. An experiment is carried out on a benchmark dataset to prove the effectiveness of this method, and the result is compared with that of several famous deep learning models including FCN8s, SegNet, U-Net and D-Linknet. The comparison shows that this model increases the IOU value and the F1 score by 3.35&ndash;12.8% and 2.41&ndash;9.8%, respectively. Additionally, the result proves the proposed method is effective at extracting roads from occluded areas.

AB  - Due to the increasing use of private cars for urbanization and urban transport, the travel time of urban transportation is increasing. People spend a lot of time in the streets, and the queue length of waiting increases accordingly; this has direct effects on fuel consumption too. Traffic flow forecasts and traffic light schedules were studied separately in the urban traffic system. This paper presents a new stable TS (Takagi&ndash;Sugeno) fuzzy controller for urban traffic. The state-space dynamics are utilized to formulate both the vehicle&rsquo;s average waiting time at an isolated intersection and the length of queues. A fuzzy intelligent controller is designed for light control based upon the length of the queue, and eventually, the system&rsquo;s stability is proved using the Lyapunov theorem. Moreover, the input variables are the length of queue and number of input or output vehicles from each lane. The simulation results describe the appearance of the proposed controller. An illustrative example is also given to show the proposed method&rsquo;s effectiveness; the suggested method is more efficient than both the conventional fuzzy traffic controllers and the fixed time controller.

AB  - The recent development in the area of IoT technologies is likely to be implemented extensively in the next decade. There is a great increase in the crime rate, and the handling officers are responsible for dealing with a broad range of cyber and Internet issues during investigation. IoT technologies are helpful in the identification of suspects, and few technologies are available that use IoT and deep learning together for face sketch synthesis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other constructs of deep learning have become major tools in recent approaches. A new-found architecture of the neural network is anticipated in this work. It is called Spiral-Net, which is a modified version of U-Net fto perform face sketch synthesis (the phase is known as the compiler network C here). Spiral-Net performs in combination with a pre-trained Vgg-19 network called the feature extractor F. It first identifies the top n matches from viewed sketches to a given photo. F is again used to formulate a feature map based on the cosine distance of a candidate sketch formed by C from the top n matches. A customized CNN configuration (called the discriminator D) then computes loss functions based on differences between the candidate sketch and the feature. Values of these loss functions alternately update C and F. The ensemble of these nets is trained and tested on selected datasets, including CUFS, CUFSF, and a part of the IIT photo&ndash;sketch dataset. Results of this modified U-Net are acquired by the legacy NLDA (1998) scheme of face recognition and its newer version, OpenBR (2013), which demonstrate an improvement of 5% compared with the current state of the art in its relevant domain.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 2073-4441

AB  - Twenty-three rainfall events were monitored to determine the characteristics of the stormwater runoff entering a rain garden facility and evaluate its performance in terms of pollutant removal and volume reduction. Data gathered during the five-year monitoring period were utilized to develop a deep learning-based model that can predict the concentrations of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Total Phosphorus (TP). Findings revealed that the rain garden was capable of effectively reducing solids, organics, nutrients, and heavy metals from stormwater runoff during the five-year period when hydrologic and climate conditions have changed. Volume reduction was also high but can decrease over time due to the accumulation of solids in the facility which reduced the infiltration capacity and increased ponding and overflows especially during heavy rainfalls. A preliminary development of a water quality prediction model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture was also developed to be able to potentially reduce the labor and costs associated with on-site monitoring in the future. The LSTM model predicted pollutant concentrations that are close to the actual values with a mean square error of 0.36 during calibration and a less than 10% difference from the measured values during validation. The study showed the potential of using deep learning architecture for the prediction of stormwater quality parameters entering rain gardens. While this study is still in the preliminary stage, it can potentially be improved for use in performance monitoring, decision-making regarding maintenance, and design of similar technologies in the future.

AB  - Since 2020, the world is still facing a global economic and health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. One approach to fighting this global crisis is to track COVID-19 cases by wireless technologies, which requires receiving reliable, efficient, and accurate data. Consequently, this article proposes a model based on Lagrange optimization and a distributed deep learning model to assure that all required data for tracking any suspected COVID-19 patient is received efficiently and reliably. Finding the optimum location of the Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) reader relevant to the base station results in the reliable transmission of data. The proposed deep learning model, developed using the one-dimensional convolutional neural network and a fully connected network, resulted in lower mean absolute squared errors when compared to state-of-the-art regression benchmarks. The proposed model based on Lagrange optimization and deep learning algorithms is evaluated when changing different network parameters, such as requiring signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio, reader transmission power, and the required system quality-of-service. The analysis of the obtained results, which indicates the appropriate transmission distance between an RFID reader and a base station, shows the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed approach, which leads to an easy and efficient tracking system.

AB  - The role of a service that is dedicated to road weather analysis is to issue forecasts and warnings to users regarding roadway conditions, thereby making it possible to anticipate dangerous traffic conditions, especially during the winter period. It is important to define pavement conditions at all times. In this paper, a new data acquisition approach is proposed that is based upon the analysis and combination of two sensors in real time by nanocomputer. The first sensor is a camera that records images and videos of the road network. The second sensor is a microphone that records the tire&ndash;pavement interaction, to characterize each surface&rsquo;s condition. The two low-cost sensors were fed to different deep learning architectures that are specialized in surface state analysis; the results were combined using an evidential theory-based data fusion approach. This study is a proof of concept, to test an evidential approach for improving classification with deep learning, applied to only two sensors; however, one could very well add more sensors and make the nanocomputers communicate together, to analyze a larger urban environment.

AB  - Vehicle Re-identification (re-id) over surveillance camera network with non-overlapping field of view is an exciting and challenging task in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Due to its versatile applicability in metropolitan cities, it gained significant attention. Vehicle re-id matches targeted vehicle over non-overlapping views in multiple camera network. However, it becomes more difficult due to inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, viewpoint changes, and spatio-temporal uncertainty. In order to draw a detailed picture of vehicle re-id research, this paper gives a comprehensive description of the various vehicle re-id technologies, applicability, datasets, and a brief comparison of different methodologies. Our paper specifically focuses on vision-based vehicle re-id approaches, including vehicle appearance, license plate, and spatio-temporal characteristics. In addition, we explore the main challenges as well as a variety of applications in different domains. Lastly, a detailed comparison of current state-of-the-art methods performances over VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets is summarized with future directions. We aim to facilitate future research by reviewing the work being done on vehicle re-id till to date.

AB  - With the advancement of different technologies such as 5G networks and IoT the use of different cloud computing technologies became essential. Cloud computing allowed intensive data processing and warehousing solution. Two different new cloud technologies that inherit some of the traditional cloud computing paradigm are fog computing and edge computing that is aims to simplify some of the complexity of cloud computing and leverage the computing capabilities within the local network in order to preform computation tasks rather than carrying it to the cloud. This makes this technology fits with the properties of IoT systems. However, using such technology introduces several new security and privacy challenges that could be huge obstacle against implementing these technologies. In this paper, we survey some of the main security and privacy challenges that faces fog and edge computing illustrating how these security issues could affect the work and implementation of edge and fog computing. Moreover, we present several countermeasures to mitigate the effect of these security issues.

TI  - Towards a Novel Air&ndash;Ground Intelligent Platform for Vehicular Networks: Technologies, Scenarios, and Challenges
T2  - Smart Cities

SN  - 2624-6511

AB  - Modern cities require a tighter integration with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for bringing new services to the citizens. The Smart City is the revolutionary paradigm aiming at integrating the ICT with the citizen life; among several urban services, transports are one of the most important in modern cities, introducing several challenges to the Smart City paradigm. In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of new vehicular applications and services, Edge Computing (EC) is one of the most promising technologies when integrated into the Vehicular Networks (VNs). EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units&mdash;RSUs, 5G Base Stations&mdash;5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage. In the recent past, several new aerial platforms with integrated EC facilities have been deployed for achieving global connectivity. Such air-based EC platforms can complement the ground-based EC facilities for creating a futuristic VN able to deploy several new applications and services. The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services. By exploiting most modern technologies, with particular attention towards network softwarization, vehicular edge computing, and machine learning, we propose here three possible layered air-ground EC-enabled VN scenarios. For each of the discussed scenarios, a list of the possible challenges is considered, as well possible solutions allowing to overcome all or some of the considered challenges. A proper comparison is also done, through the use of tables, where all the proposed scenarios, and the proposed solutions, are discussed.

TI  - Voxelisation Algorithms and Data Structures: A Review

VL  - 21
IS  - 24
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Voxel-based data structures, algorithms, frameworks, and interfaces have been used in computer graphics and many other applications for decades. There is a general necessity to seek adequate digital representations, such as voxels, that would secure unified data structures, multi-resolution options, robust validation procedures and flexible algorithms for different 3D tasks. In this review, we evaluate the most common properties and algorithms for voxelisation of 2D and 3D objects. Thus, many voxelisation algorithms and their characteristics are presented targeting points, lines, triangles, surfaces and solids as geometric primitives. For lines, we identify three groups of algorithms, where the first two achieve different voxelisation connectivity, while the third one presents voxelisation of curves. We can say that surface voxelisation is a more desired voxelisation type compared to solid voxelisation, as it can be achieved faster and requires less memory if voxels are stored in a sparse way. At the same time, we evaluate in the paper the available voxel data structures. We split all data structures into static and dynamic grids considering the frequency to update a data structure. Static grids are dominated by SVO-based data structures focusing on memory footprint reduction and attributes preservation, where SVDAG and SSVDAG are the most advanced methods. The state-of-the-art dynamic voxel data structure is NanoVDB which is superior to the rest in terms of speed as well as support for out-of-core processing and data management, which is the key to handling large dynamically changing scenes. Overall, we can say that this is the first review evaluating the available voxelisation algorithms for different geometric primitives as well as voxel data structures.

AB  - Through recent progress, the forms of modern supply chains have evolved into complex networks. The supply chain management systems face a variety of challenges. These include lack of visibility of the upstream party (Provider) to the downstream party (Client); lack of flexibility in the face of sudden variations in demand and control of operating costs; lack of reliance on safety stakeholders; ineffective management of supply chain risks. Blockchain (BC) is used in the supply chain to overcome the growing demands for items. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a profoundly encouraging innovation that can help companies observe, track, and monitor products, activities, and processes within their respective value chain networks. Research establishments and logical gatherings are ceaselessly attempting to answer IoT gadgets in supply chain management. This paper presents orderly writing on and reviewing of Blockchain-based IoT advances and their current usage. We discuss the smart devices used in this system and which device is the most appropriate in the supply chain. This paper also looks at future examination themes in blockchain-based IoT, referred to as the executive&rsquo;s framework production network. The essential deliberate writing audit has been consolidated by surveying research articles circulated in highly reputable publications between 2016 and 2021. Lastly, current issues and challenges are present to provide researchers with promising future directions in IoT supply chain management systems.

AB  - Automatic floor plan analysis has gained increased attention in recent research. However, numerous studies related to this area are mainly experiments conducted with a simplified floor plan dataset with low resolution and a small housing scale due to the suitability for a data-driven model. For practical use, it is necessary to focus more on large-scale complex buildings to utilize indoor structures, such as reconstructing multi-use buildings for indoor navigation. This study aimed to build a framework using CNN (Convolution Neural Networks) for analyzing a floor plan with various scales of complex buildings. By dividing a floor plan into a set of normalized patches, the framework enables the proposed CNN model to process varied scale or high-resolution inputs, which is a barrier for existing methods. The model detected building objects per patch and assembled them into one result by multiplying the corresponding translation matrix. Finally, the detected building objects were vectorized, considering their compatibility in 3D modeling. As a result, our framework exhibited similar performance in detection rate (87.77%) and recognition accuracy (85.53%) to that of existing studies, despite the complexity of the data used. Through our study, the practical aspects of automatic floor plan analysis can be expanded.

AB  - Statistical reports say that, from 2011 to 2021, more than 11,915 stray animals, such as cats, dogs, goats, cows, etc., and wild animals were wounded in road accidents. Most of the accidents occurred due to negligence and doziness of drivers. These issues can be handled brilliantly using stray and wild animals-vehicle interaction and the pedestrians&rsquo; awareness. This paper briefs a detailed forum on GPU-based embedded systems and ODT real-time applications. ML trains machines to recognize images more accurately than humans. This provides a unique and real-time solution using deep-learning real 3D motion-based YOLOv3 (DL-R-3D-YOLOv3) ODT of images on mobility. Besides, it discovers methods for multiple views of flexible objects using 3D reconstruction, especially for stray and wild animals. Computer vision-based IoT devices are also besieged by this DL-R-3D-YOLOv3 model. It seeks solutions by forecasting image filters to find object properties and semantics for object recognition methods leading to closed-loop ODT.

AB  - Maintaining a healthy cyber society is a great challenge due to the users&rsquo; freedom of expression and behavior. This can be solved by monitoring and analyzing the users&rsquo; behavior and taking proper actions. This research aims to present a platform that monitors the public content on Twitter by extracting tweet data. After maintaining the data, the users&rsquo; interactions are analyzed using graph analysis methods. Then, the users&rsquo; behavioral patterns are analyzed by applying metadata analysis, in which the timeline of each profile is obtained; also, the time-series behavioral features of users are investigated. Then, in the abnormal behavior detection and filtering component, the interesting profiles are selected for further examinations. Finally, in the contextual analysis component, the contents are analyzed using natural language processing techniques; a binary text classification model (SVM (Support Vector Machine) + TF-IDF (Term Frequency&mdash;Inverse Document Frequency) with 88.89% accuracy) is used to detect if a tweet is related to crime or not. Then, a sentiment analysis method is applied to the crime-related tweets to perform aspect-based sentiment analysis (DistilBERT + FFNN (Feed-Forward Neural Network) with 80% accuracy), because sharing positive opinions about a crime-related topic can threaten society. This platform aims to provide the end-user (the police) with suggestions to control hate speech or terrorist propaganda.

TI  - Blockchain Application in Internet of Vehicles: Challenges, Contributions and Current Limitations
T2  - Future Internet

PY  - 2021
VL  - 13

SN  - 1999-5903

AB  - Blockchain technology is highly coupled with cryptocurrencies; however, it provides several other potential use cases, related to energy and sustainability, Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, smart mobility and more. Blockchain can offer security for Electric Vehicle (EV) transactions in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) concept, allowing electricity trading to be performed in a decentralized, transparent and secure way. Additionally, blockchain provides the necessary functionalities for IoV decentralized application development, such as data exchange, personal digital identity, sharing economy and optimized charging pattern. Moreover, blockchain technology has the potential to significantly increase energy efficiency, decrease management costs and guarantee the effective use of the energy recourses. Therefore, its application in the IoV concept provides secure, autonomous and automated energy trading between EVs. While several studies on blockchain technology in smart grids have been conducted, insufficient attention has been given to conducting a detailed review and state-of-the-art analysis of blockchain application in the IoV domain. To this end, this work provides a systematic literature review of blockchain-based applications in the IoV domain. The aim is to investigate the current challenges of IoV and to highlight how blockchain characteristics can contribute to this emerging paradigm. In addition, limitations and future research directions related to the integration of blockchain technology within the IoV are discussed. To this end, this study incorporates the theoretical foundations of several research articles published in scientific publications over the previous five years, as a method of simplifying our assessment and capturing the ever-expanding blockchain area. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of blockchain-enabled applications in the IoV domain, such as privacy and security, data protection and management, vehicle management, charging optimization and P2P energy trading, based on a structured, systematic review and content analysis of the discovered literature, and we identify key trends and emerging areas for research. The contribution of this article is two-fold: (a) we highlight the limitations presented in the relevant literature, particularly the barriers of blockchain technology and how they influence its integration into the IoV and (b) we present a number of research gaps and suggest future exploratory areas.

AB  - Owing to the hasty growth of communication technologies in the Underwater Internet of Things (UIoT), many researchers and industries focus on enhancing the existing technologies of UIoT systems for developing numerous applications such as oceanography, diver networks monitoring, deep-sea exploration and early warning systems. In a constrained UIoT environment, communication media such as acoustic, infrared (IR), visible light, radiofrequency (RF) and magnet induction (MI) are generally used to transmit information via digitally linked underwater devices. However, each medium has its technical limitations: for example, the acoustic medium has challenges such as narrow-channel bandwidth, low data rate, high cost, etc., and optical medium has challenges such as high absorption, scattering, long-distance data transmission, etc. Moreover, the malicious node can steal the underwater data by employing blackhole attacks, routing attacks, Sybil attacks, etc. Furthermore, due to heavyweight, the existing privacy and security mechanism of the terrestrial internet of things (IoT) cannot be applied directly to UIoT environment. Hence, this paper aims to provide a systematic review of recent trends, applications, communication technologies, challenges, security threats and privacy issues of UIoT system. Additionally, this paper highlights the methods of preventing the technical challenges and security attacks of the UIoT environment. Finally, this systematic review contributes much to the profit of researchers to analyze and improve the performance of services in UIoT applications.

SN  - 2071-1050

AB  - The increasing role of emerging technologies, such as big data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive technologies, cloud computing, and mobile technologies, is essential to the business process manager profession&rsquo;s sustainable development. Nevertheless, these technologies could involve new challenges in labor markets. The era of intelligent business process management (BPM) has begun, but how does it look in real labor markets? This paper examines the hypothesis that the transformation of the business process manager profession has been caused by certain determinants that involve the need for an improvement in BPM skills. The main contribution is a model of the dimensions of the impact of digital technologies on business process management supplemented with skills that influence the business process manager profession. The paper fills the gap in research on perspectives of the impact of digital technologies on business process management, considering both a literature analysis and labor market research. The purpose of the literature review was to identify the core dimensions that drive the use of emerging technologies in business process management. The labor market study was conducted in order to analyze the current demand for core skills of business process managers in the Polish labor market with a particular emphasis on the intelligent BPM concept. Additionally, to study the determinants that slow down the iBPM concept&rsquo;s development, the digital intensity level of the enterprises and public administration units in Poland was studied. Finally, a fuzzy cognitive map presenting the core determinants of the business process manager profession&rsquo;s transformation is described.

TI  - A Hybrid Lightweight System for Early Attack Detection in the IoMT Fog

PY  - 2021
VL  - 21
IS  - 24
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Cyber-attack detection via on-gadget embedded models and cloud systems are widely used for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The former has a limited computation ability, whereas the latter has a long detection time. Fog-based attack detection is alternatively used to overcome these problems. However, the current fog-based systems cannot handle the ever-increasing IoMT&rsquo;s big data. Moreover, they are not lightweight and are designed for network attack detection only. In this work, a hybrid (for host and network) lightweight system is proposed for early attack detection in the IoMT fog. In an adaptive online setting, six different incremental classifiers were implemented, namely a novel Weighted Hoeffding Tree Ensemble (WHTE), Incremental K-Nearest Neighbors (IKNN), Incremental Na&iuml;ve Bayes (INB), Hoeffding Tree Majority Class (HTMC), Hoeffding Tree Na&iuml;ve Bayes (HTNB), and Hoeffding Tree Na&iuml;ve Bayes Adaptive (HTNBA). The system was benchmarked with seven heterogeneous sensors and a NetFlow data infected with nine types of recent attack. The results showed that the proposed system worked well on the lightweight fog devices with ~100% accuracy, a low detection time, and a low memory usage of less than 6 MiB. The single-criteria comparative analysis showed that the WHTE ensemble was more accurate and was less sensitive to the concept drift.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming integrated into a wide range of modern IoT applications. The growing number of networked IoT devices generates a large amount of data. However, processing and memorizing this massive volume of data at local nodes have been deemed critical challenges, especially when using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to extract and exploit valuable information. In this context, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a way to bring cloud computing (CC) processes within reach of users, to address computation-intensive offloading and latency issues. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the most relevant research works related to UAV technology applications in terms of enabled or assisted MEC architectures. It details the utility of UAV-enabled MEC architecture regarding emerging IoT applications and the role of both deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) in meeting various limitations related to latency, task offloading, energy demand, and security. Furthermore, throughout this article, the reader gains an insight into the future of UAV-enabled MEC, the advantages and the critical challenges to be tackled when using AI.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of a massive number of smart devices capable of data collection, storage, processing, and communication. The adoption of the IoT has brought about tremendous innovation opportunities in industries, homes, the environment, and businesses. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of the IoT have sparked concerns for wide adoption and applications. Unlike traditional information technology (I.T.) systems, the IoT environment is challenging to secure due to resource constraints, heterogeneity, and distributed nature of the smart devices. This makes it impossible to apply host-based prevention mechanisms such as anti-malware and anti-virus. These challenges and the nature of IoT applications call for a monitoring system such as anomaly detection both at device and network levels beyond the organisational boundary. This suggests an anomaly detection system is strongly positioned to secure IoT devices better than any other security mechanism. In this paper, we aim to provide an in-depth review of existing works in developing anomaly detection solutions using machine learning for protecting an IoT system. We also indicate that blockchain-based anomaly detection systems can collaboratively learn effective machine learning models to detect anomalies.

TI  - Developing a Scoring System to Evaluate the Level of Smartness in Commercial Buildings: A Case of Sri Lanka
T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2021
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Smart buildings (SBs) are developed in many different ways and are self-proclaimed smart. There are a great number of publications introducing smart systems using a wider range of tools and sensors. However, the level of smartness, functions of the smart system, and the usefulness of the system are not the same, which may give a wrong impression to clients or potential buyers of a building. Developing a scoring system that enables determining the overall smartness of a building is necessary. Despite the necessity, there is a dearth of studies in this area. Hence, the purpose of this study is to develop a scoring system to evaluate the level of smartness of Sri Lankan commercial buildings. Thus, initially, smart criteria were identified, defined, and categorized through a literature survey. Subsequently, 35 experts in the commercial building sector were interviewed. Finally, the relative importance of the smart criteria was derived through the AHP technique, and accordingly, a scoring system was developed. The study identified six main criteria to evaluate the smartness of buildings in the scoring system. The automation criterion with the highest relative weight was concluded to be the dominant criterion (45.59%) in the scoring system. Communication and data sharing were placed at second with a relative weight of 18.76% and indicates the importance given by the study findings in establishing the backbones of SBs. Occupants&rsquo; comfort, energy management, occupants&rsquo; health and safety, and sustainability criterion were ranked third, fourth, fifth, and sixth within the scoring system. This study is one of the first to investigate in detail the contribution of both soft and hard services of a facility in determining the overall smartness of a building. Property developers in the commercial building sector can benefit from this study by recognizing the necessary criteria to be embedded in their SB development projects in order to attract more tenants and customers.

AB  - Recently released research about deep learning applications related to perception for autonomous driving focuses heavily on the usage of LiDAR point cloud data as input for the neural networks, highlighting the importance of LiDAR technology in the field of Autonomous Driving (AD). In this sense, a great percentage of the vehicle platforms used to create the datasets released for the development of these neural networks, as well as some AD commercial solutions available on the market, heavily invest in an array of sensors, including a large number of sensors as well as several sensor modalities. However, these costs create a barrier to entry for low-cost solutions for the performance of critical perception tasks such as Object Detection and SLAM. This paper explores current vehicle platforms and proposes a low-cost, LiDAR-based test vehicle platform capable of running critical perception tasks (Object Detection and SLAM) in real time. Additionally, we propose the creation of a deep learning-based inference model for Object Detection deployed in a resource-constrained device, as well as a graph-based SLAM implementation, providing important considerations, explored while taking into account the real-time processing requirement and presenting relevant results demonstrating the usability of the developed work in the context of the proposed low-cost platform.

AB  - Advancement in network technology has vastly increased the usage of the Internet. Consequently, there has been a rise in traffic volume and data sharing. This has made securing a network from sophisticated intrusion attacks very important to preserve users&rsquo; information and privacy. Our research focuses on combating and detecting intrusion attacks and preserving the integrity of online systems. In our research we first create a benchmark model for detecting intrusions and then employ various combinations of feature selection techniques based upon ensemble machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of the intrusion detection system. The performance of our model was investigated using three evaluation metrics namely: elimination time, accuracy and F1-score. The results of the experiment indicated that the random forest feature selection technique had the minimum elimination time, whereas the support vector machine model had the best accuracy and F1-score. Therefore, conclusive evidence could be drawn that the combination of random forest and support vector machine is suitable for low latency and highly accurate intrusion detection systems.

AB  - Background: treating infectious diseases in elderly individuals is difficult; patient referral to emergency services often occurs, since the elderly tend to arrive at consultations with advanced, serious symptoms. Aim: it was hypothesized that anticipating an infectious disease diagnosis by a few days could significantly improve a patient&rsquo;s well-being and reduce the burden on emergency health system services. Methods: vital signs from residents were taken daily and transferred to a database in the cloud. Classifiers were used to recognize patterns in the spatial domain process of the collected data. Doctors reported their diagnoses when any disease presented. A flexible microservice architecture provided access and functionality to the system. Results: combining two different domains, health and technology, is not easy, but the results are encouraging. The classifiers reported good results; the system has been well accepted by medical personnel and is proving to be cost-effective and a good solution to service disadvantaged areas. In this context, this research found the importance of certain clinical variables in the identification of infectious diseases. Conclusions: this work explores how to apply mobile communications, cloud services, and machine learning technology, in order to provide efficient tools for medical staff in nursing homes. The scalable architecture can be extended to big data applications that may extract valuable knowledge patterns for medical research.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - This paper introduces an integrated IoT architecture to handle the problem of cyber attacks based on a developed deep neural network (DNN) with a rectified linear unit in order to provide reliable and secure online monitoring for automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The developed IoT architecture based on a DNN introduces a new approach for the online monitoring of AGVs against cyber attacks with a cheap and easy implementation instead of the traditional cyber attack detection schemes in the literature. The proposed DNN is trained based on experimental AGV data that represent the real state of the AGV and different types of cyber attacks including a random attack, ramp attack, pulse attack, and sinusoidal attack that is injected by the attacker into the internet network. The proposed DNN is compared with different deep learning and machine learning algorithms such as a one dimension convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a supported vector machine model (SVM), random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and a decision tree for greater validation. Furthermore, the proposed IoT architecture based on a DNN can provide an effective detection for the AGV status with an excellent accuracy of 96.77% that is significantly greater than the accuracy based on the traditional schemes. The AGV status based on the proposed IoT architecture with a DNN is visualized by an advanced IoT platform named CONTACT Elements for IoT. Different test scenarios with a practical setup of an AGV with IoT are carried out to emphasize the performance of the suggested IoT architecture based on a DNN. The results approve the usefulness of the proposed IoT to provide effective cybersecurity for data visualization and tracking of the AGV status that enhances decision-making and improves industrial productivity.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has changed the worldwide network of people, smart devices, intelligent things, data, and information as an emergent technology. IoT development is still in its early stages, and numerous interrelated challenges must be addressed. IoT is the unifying idea of embedding everything. The Internet of Things offers a huge opportunity to improve the world&rsquo;s accessibility, integrity, availability, scalability, confidentiality, and interoperability. However, securing the Internet of Things is a difficult issue. The IoT aims to connect almost everything within the framework of a common infrastructure. This helps in controlling devices and, will allow device status to be updated everywhere and at any time. To develop technology via IoT, several critical scientific studies and inquiries have been carried out. However, many obstacles and problems remain to be tackled in order to reach IoT&rsquo;s maximum potential. These problems and concerns must be taken into consideration in different areas of the IoT, such as implementation in remote areas, threats to the system, development support, social and environmental impacts, etc. This paper reviews the current state of the art in different IoT architectures, with a focus on current technologies, applications, challenges, IoT protocols, and opportunities. As a result, a detailed taxonomy of IoT is presented here which includes interoperability, scalability, security and energy efficiency, among other things. Moreover, the significance of blockchains and big data as well as their analysis in relation to IoT, is discussed. This article aims to help readers and researchers understand the IoT and its applicability to the real world.

AB  - Cloud computing provides the flexible architecture where data and resources are dispersed at various locations and are accessible from various industrial environments. Cloud computing has changed the using, storing, and sharing of resources such as data, services, and applications for industrial applications. During the last decade, industries have rapidly switched to cloud computing for having more comprehensive access, reduced cost, and increased performance. In addition, significant improvement has been observed in the internet of things (IoT) with the integration of cloud computing. However, this rapid transition into the cloud raised various security issues and concerns. Traditional security solutions are not directly applicable and sometimes ineffective for cloud-based systems. Cloud platforms&rsquo; challenges and security concerns have been addressed during the last three years, despite the successive use and proliferation of multifaceted cyber weapons. The rapid evolution of deep learning (DL) in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain has brought many benefits that can be utilized to address industrial security issues in the cloud. The findings of the proposed research include the following: we present a comprehensive survey of enabling cloud-based IoT architecture, services, configurations, and security models; the classification of cloud security concerns in IoT into four major categories (data, network and service, applications, and people-related security issues), which are discussed in detail; we identify and inspect the latest advancements in cloud-based IoT attacks; we identify, discuss, and analyze significant security issues in each category and present the limitations from a general, artificial intelligence and deep learning perspective; we provide the technological challenges identified in the literature and then identify significant research gaps in the IoT-based cloud infrastructure to highlight future research directions to blend cybersecurity in cloud.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The rapid development of industrialization and urbanization has had a substantial impact on the increasing air pollution in many populated cities around the globe. Intensive research has shown that ambient aerosols, especially the fine particulate matter PM2.5, are highly correlated with human respiratory diseases. It is critical to analyze, forecast, and mitigate PM2.5 concentrations. One of the typical meteorological phenomena seducing PM2.5 concentrations to accumulate is temperature inversion which forms a warm-air cap to blockade the surface pollutants from dissipating. This paper analyzes the meteorological patterns which coincide with temperature inversion and proposes two machine learning classifiers for temperature inversion classification. A separate multivariate regression model is trained for the class with or without manifesting temperature inversion phenomena, in order to improve PM2.5 forecasting performance. We chose Puli township as the studied site, which is a basin city easily trapping PM2.5 concentrations. The experimental results with the dataset spanning from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019 show that the proposed temperature inversion classifiers exhibit satisfactory performance in F1-Score, and the regression models trained from the classified datasets can significantly improve the PM2.5 concentration forecast as compared to the model using a single dataset without considering the temperature inversion factor.

TI  - Big Data and Energy Security: Impacts on Private Companies, National Economies and Societies
T2  - IoT

PY  - 2022
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SN  - 2624-831X

AB  - The importance of energy security for the successful functioning of private companies, national economies, and the overall society cannot be underestimated. Energy is a critical infrastructure for any modern society, and its reliable functioning is essential for all economic sectors and for the well-being of everybody. Uncertainty in terms of the availability of information, namely reliable data to make predictions and to plan for investment as well as for other actions of stakeholders in the energy markets is one of the factors with the highest influence on energy security. This uncertainty can be connected with many factors, such as the availability of reliable data or actions of stakeholders themselves. For example, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed negative impacts of uncertainty on decision-making processes and markets. At the time point when the market participants started to receive real-time information about the situation, the energy markets began to ease. This is one scenario where Big Data can be used to amplify information to various stakeholders to prevent panic and to ensure market stability and security of supply. Considering the novelty of this topic, our methodology is based on the meta-analysis of existing studies in the area of impacts of energy security on private companies, the national economy, and society. The results show that, in a fast-paced digital world characterized by technological advances, the use of Big Data technology provides a unique niche point to close this gap in information disparity by levering the use of unconventional data sources to integrate technologies, stakeholders, and markets to promote energy security and market stability. The potential of Big Data technology is yet to be fully utilized. Big Data can handle large data sets characterized by volume, variety, velocity, value, and complexity. Our conclusion is that the challenge for energy markets is to leverage this technology to mine available socioeconomic, political, geographic, and environmental data responsibly and to provide indicators that predict future global supply and demand. This information is crucial for energy security and ensuring global economic prosperity.

AB  - With the exponential growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing is in the limelight for its ability to quickly and efficiently process numerous data generated by IoT devices. EdgeX Foundry is a representative open-source-based IoT gateway platform, providing various IoT protocol services and interoperability between them. However, due to the absence of container orchestration technology, such as automated deployment and dynamic resource management for application services, EdgeX Foundry has fundamental limitations of a potential edge computing platform. In this paper, we propose EdgeX over Kubernetes, which enables remote service deployment and autoscaling to application services by running EdgeX Foundry over Kubernetes, which is a product-grade container orchestration tool. Experimental evaluation results prove that the proposed platform increases manageability through the remote deployment of application services and improves the throughput of the system and service quality with real-time monitoring and autoscaling.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PSO Enhanced ANFIS Model in Prediction of Traffic Flow of Vehicles on Freeways: Traffic Data Evidence from South Africa
T2  - Infrastructures

PY  - 2022
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
SN  - 2412-3811

AB  - In the last few years, there has been a significant rise in the number of private vehicles ownership, migration of people from rural areas to urban cities, and the rise in the number of under-maintained freeways; all these have added to the perennial problem of traffic congestion. Traffic flow prediction has been recognized as the solution in alleviating and reducing the problem of traffic congestion. In this research, we developed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system trained by particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO) by performing an evaluative performance of the model through traffic flow modelling of vehicles on five freeways (N1,N3,N12,N14&nbsp;and&nbsp;N17) using South Africa Transportation System as a case study. Six hundred and fifty (650) traffic data were collected using inductive loop detectors and video cameras from the five freeways. The traffic data used for developing these models comprises traffic volume, traffic density, speed of vehicles, time, and different types of vehicles. The traffic data were divided into 70% and 30% for the training and validation of the model. The model results show a positively correlated optimal performance between the inputs and the output with a regression value R2&nbsp; of 0.9978 and 0.9860 for the training and testing. The result of this research shows that the soft computing model ANFIS-PSO used in this research can model vehicular traffic flow on freeways. Furthermore, the evidence from this research suggests that the on-peak and off-peak hours are significant determinants of vehicular traffic flow on freeways. The modelling approach developed in this research will assist urban planners in developing practical ways to tackle traffic congestion and assist motorists and pedestrians in travel behaviour decision-making. Finally, the approach used in this study will assist transportation engineers in making constructive and safety dependent guidelines for drivers and pedestrians on freeways.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - A fire is an extraordinary event that can damage property and have a notable effect on people&rsquo;s lives. However, the early detection of smoke and fire has been identified as a challenge in many recent studies. Therefore, different solutions have been proposed to approach the timely detection of fire events and avoid human casualties. As a solution, we used an affordable visual detection system. This method is possibly effective because early fire detection is recognized. In most developed countries, CCTV surveillance systems are installed in almost every public location to take periodic images of a specific area. Notwithstanding, cameras are used under different types of ambient light, and they experience occlusions, distortions of view, and changes in the resulting images from different camera angles and the different seasons of the year, all of which affect the accuracy of currently established models. To address these problems, we developed an approach based on an attention feature map used in a capsule network designed to classify fire and smoke locations at different distances outdoors, given only an image of a single fire and smoke as input. The proposed model was designed to solve two main limitations of the base capsule network input and the analysis of large-sized images, as well as to compensate the absence of a deep network using an attention-based approach to improve the classification of the fire and smoke results. In term of practicality, our method is comparable with prior strategies based on machine learning and deep learning methods. We trained and tested the proposed model using our datasets collected from different sources. As the results indicate, a high classification accuracy in comparison with other modern architectures was achieved. Further, the results indicate that the proposed approach is robust and stable for the classification of images from outdoor CCTV cameras with different viewpoints given the presence of smoke and fire.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 8

SN  - 2311-7524

AB  - In order to realize the real-time and accurate detection of potted flowers on benches, in this paper we propose a method based on the ZED 2 stereo camera and the YOLO V4-Tiny deep learning algorithm for potted flower detection and location. First, an automatic detection model of flowers was established based on the YOLO V4-Tiny convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and the center points on the pixel plane of the flowers were obtained according to the prediction box. Then, the real-time 3D point cloud information obtained by the ZED 2 camera was used to calculate the actual position of the flowers. The test results showed that the mean average precision (MAP) and recall rate of the training model was 89.72% and 80%, respectively, and the real-time average detection frame rate of the model deployed under Jetson TX2 was 16 FPS. The results of the occlusion experiment showed that when the canopy overlap ratio between the two flowers is more than 10%, the recognition accuracy will be affected. The mean absolute error of the flower center location based on 3D point cloud information of the ZED 2 camera was 18.1 mm, and the maximum locating error of the flower center was 25.8 mm under different light radiation conditions. The method in this paper establishes the relationship between the detection target of flowers and the actual spatial location, which has reference significance for the machinery and automatic management of potted flowers on benches.

TI  - Inspecting Buildings Using Drones and Computer Vision: A Machine Learning Approach to Detect Cracks and Damages
T2  - Drones

PY  - 2022
VL  - 6
IS  - 1
SN  - 2504-446X

AB  - Manual inspection of infrastructure damages such as building cracks is difficult due to the objectivity and reliability of assessment and high demands of time and costs. This can be automated using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery of damages. Numerous computer vision-based approaches have been applied to address the limitations of crack detection but they have their limitations that can be overcome by using various hybrid approaches based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs), an application of the deep learning (DL) method, display remarkable potential for automatically detecting image features such as damages and are less sensitive to image noise. A modified deep hierarchical CNN architecture has been used in this study for crack detection and damage assessment in civil infrastructures. The proposed architecture is based on 16 convolution layers and a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). For this study, the crack images were collected using UAVs and open-source images of mid to high rise buildings (five stories and above) constructed during 2000 in Sydney, Australia. Conventionally, a CNN network only utilizes the last layer of convolution. However, our proposed network is based on the utility of multiple layers. Another important component of the proposed CNN architecture is the application of guided filtering (GF) and conditional random fields (CRFs) to refine the predicted outputs to get reliable results. Benchmarking data (600 images) of Sydney-based buildings damages was used to test the proposed architecture. The proposed deep hierarchical CNN architecture produced superior performance when evaluated using five methods: GF method, Baseline (BN) method, Deep-Crack BN, Deep-Crack GF, and SegNet. Overall, the GF method outperformed all other methods as indicated by the global accuracy (0.990), class average accuracy (0.939), mean intersection of the union overall classes (IoU) (0.879), precision (0.838), recall (0.879), and F-score (0.8581) values. Overall, the proposed CNN architecture provides the advantages of reduced noise, highly integrated supervision of features, adequate learning, and aggregation of both multi-scale and multilevel features during the training procedure along with the refinement of the overall output predictions.

TI  - Multilevel Central Trust Management Approach for Task Scheduling on IoT-Based Mobile Cloud Computing
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - With the increasing number of mobile devices and IoT devices across a wide range of real-life applications, our mobile cloud computing devices will not cope with this growing number of audiences soon, which implies and demands the need to shift to fog computing. Task scheduling is one of the most demanding scopes after the trust computation inside the trustable nodes. The mobile devices and IoT devices transfer the resource-intensive tasks towards mobile cloud computing. Some tasks are resource-intensive and not trustable to allocate to the mobile cloud computing resources. This consequently gives rise to trust evaluation and data sync-up of devices joining and leaving the network. The resources are more intensive for cloud computing and mobile cloud computing. Time, energy, and resources are wasted due to the nontrustable nodes. This research article proposes a multilevel trust enhancement approach for efficient task scheduling in mobile cloud environments. We first calculate the trustable tasks needed to offload towards the mobile cloud computing. Then, an efficient and dynamic scheduler is added to enhance the task scheduling after trust computation using social and environmental trust computation techniques. To improve the time and energy efficiency of IoT and mobile devices using the proposed technique, the energy computation and time request computation are compared with the existing methods from literature, which identified improvements in the results. Our proposed approach is centralized to tackle constant SyncUPs of incoming devices&rsquo; trust values with mobile cloud computing. With the benefits of mobile cloud computing, the centralized data distribution method is a positive approach.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 15

SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - With the implementation of the carbon neutral policy, the number of electric vehicles (EVs) is increasing. Thus, it is urgently needed to manage the charging and discharging behavior of EVs scientifically. In this paper, EVs are regarded as agents, and a multiagent cooperative optimization scheduling model based on Roth&ndash;Erev (RE) algorithm is proposed. The charging and discharging behaviors of EVs will influence each other. The charging and discharging strategy of one EV owner will affect the choice of others. Therefore, the RE algorithm is selected to obtain the optimal charging and discharging strategy of the EV group, with the utility function of the prospect theory proposed to describe EV owners&rsquo; different risk preferences. The utility function of the prospect theory has superior effectiveness in describing consumers&rsquo; utility. Finally, in the case of residential electricity, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. Compared with that of random charging, this method reduces the total EV group cost of EVs by 52.4%, with the load variance reduced by 26.4%.

AB  - Electricity loads are basic and important information for power generation facilities and traders, especially in terms of production plans, daily operations, unit commitments, and economic dispatches. Short-term load forecasting (STLF), which predicts power loads for a few days, plays a vital role in the reliable, safe, and efficient operation of a power system. Currently, two main challenges are faced by existing STLF prediction models. The first involves how to fuse multiscale electricity load data to obtain a high-performance model and remove data noise after integration. The second involves how to improve the local optimal solution despite the sample quality problem. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multiscale electricity load data fusion- and STLF-based short time series prediction model built on a sparse deep autoencoder and self-paced learning (SPL). A sparse deep autoencoder was used to solve the multiscale data fusion problem with data noise. Furthermore, SPL was utilized to solve the local optimal solution problem. The experimental results showed that our model was better than the existing STLF prediction models by more than 15.89% in terms of the mean squared error (MSE) indicator.

AB  - The rapid expansion of a country&rsquo;s economy is highly dependent on timely product distribution, which is hampered by terrible traffic congestion. Additional staff are also required to follow the delivery vehicle while it transports documents or records to another destination. This study proposes Delicar, a self-driving product delivery vehicle that can drive the vehicle on the road and report the current geographical location to the authority in real-time through a map. The equipped camera module captures the road image and transfers it to the computer via socket server programming. The raspberry pi sends the camera image and waits for the steering angle value. The image is fed to the pre-trained deep learning model that predicts the steering angle regarding that situation. Then the steering angle value is passed to the raspberry pi that directs the L298 motor driver which direction the wheel should follow. Based upon this direction, L298 decides either forward or left or right or backwards movement. The 3-cell 12V LiPo battery handles the power supply to the raspberry pi and L298 motor driver. A buck converter regulates a 5V 3A power supply to the raspberry pi to be working. Nvidia CNN architecture has been followed, containing nine layers including five convolution layers and three dense layers to develop the steering angle predictive model. Geoip2 (a python library) retrieves the longitude and latitude from the equipped system&rsquo;s IP address to report the live geographical position to the authorities. After that, Folium is used to depict the geographical location. Moreover, the system&rsquo;s infrastructure is far too low-cost and easy to install.

AB  - Today, critical infrastructure is more interconnected, which allows more vulnerabilities in the case of disasters. In addition, the effect of one infrastructure can lead to one or more cascading failures in another infrastructure due to the dependency complexity between them. This article introduces a holistic approach using network indicators and machine learning to better understand the geographical representation of critical infrastructure. Previous work on a similar model was based on a single measure; such as in fashion, this paper introduces four measures utilized to identify the most vital geographic zone in the city. The model aims to increase resilience, focusing on the preparedness phase by assessing the essential nodes of infrastructure, which allows more space to adopt risk mitigation strategies before any disturbance event. Holding in-depth knowledge of the vital zones of small scales and accordingly ranking them will positively improve the overall system resilience.

AB  - In the construction of new smart cities, traditional fire-detection systems can be replaced with vision-based systems to establish fire safety in society using emerging technologies, such as digital cameras, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. In this study, we developed a fire detector that accurately detects even small sparks and sounds an alarm within 8 s of a fire outbreak. A novel convolutional neural network was developed to detect fire regions using an enhanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4network. Based on the improved YOLOv4 algorithm, we adapted the network to operate on the Banana Pi M3 board using only three layers. Initially, we examined the originalYOLOv4 approach to determine the accuracy of predictions of candidate fire regions. However, the anticipated results were not observed after several experiments involving this approach to detect fire accidents. We improved the traditional YOLOv4 network by increasing the size of the training dataset based on data augmentation techniques for the real-time monitoring of fire disasters. By modifying the network structure through automatic color augmentation, reducing parameters, etc., the proposed method successfully detected and notified the incidence of disastrous fires with a high speed and accuracy in different weather environments&mdash;sunny or cloudy, day or night. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method can be used successfully for the protection of smart cities and in monitoring fires in urban areas. Finally, we compared the performance of our method with that of recently reported fire-detection approaches employing widely used performance matrices to test the fire classification results achieved.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal 3D Residual Correlation Network for Urban Traffic Status Prediction

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Accurate traffic status prediction is of great importance to improve the security and reliability of the intelligent transportation system. However, urban traffic status prediction is a very challenging task due to the tight symmetry among the Human&ndash;Vehicle&ndash;Environment (HVE). The recently proposed spatial&ndash;temporal 3D convolutional neural network (ST-3DNet) effectively extracts both spatial and temporal characteristics in HVE, but ignores the essential long-term temporal characteristics and the symmetry of historical data. Therefore, a novel spatial&ndash;temporal 3D residual correlation network (ST-3DRCN) is proposed for urban traffic status prediction in this paper. The ST-3DRCN firstly introduces the Pearson correlation coefficient method to extract a high correlation between traffic data. Then, a dynamic spatial feature extraction component is constructed by using 3D convolution combined with residual units to capture dynamic spatial features. After that, based on the idea of long short-term memory (LSTM), a novel architectural unit is proposed to extract dynamic temporal features. Finally, the spatial and temporal features are fused to obtain the final prediction results. Experiments have been performed using two datasets from Chengdu, China (TaxiCD) and California, USA (PEMS-BAY). Taking the root mean square error (RMSE) as the evaluation index, the prediction accuracy of ST-3DRCN on TaxiCD dataset is 21.4%, 21.3%, 11.7%, 10.8%, 4.7%, 3.6% and 2.3% higher than LSTM, convolutional neural network (CNN), 3D-CNN, spatial&ndash;temporal residual network (ST-ResNet), spatial&ndash;temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), dynamic global-local spatial&ndash;temporal network (DGLSTNet), and ST-3DNet, respectively.

TI  - Multidimensional Urban Vitality on Streets: Spatial Patterns and Influence Factor Identification Using Multisource Urban Data
T2  - ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information

PY  - 2022
VL  - 11

SN  - 2220-9964

AB  - Urban vitality is a key indicator for measuring urban development. This topic has been trending in urban planning and sustainable development, and significant progress has been made in measuring single indicators of urban vitality based on parcel or block units. With the continuous development of smart sensing technology, multisource urban data are becoming increasingly abundant. The application of such data to measure the multidimensional urban vitality of street space, reflecting multiple functions of an urban space, can significantly improve the accuracy of urban vitality analyses and promote the construction of people-oriented healthy cities. In this study, streets were taken as the analysis unit, and multisource data such as the trajectories of taxies and shared bicycles, user reviews and cultural facility points of interest (POIs) in Chengdu, a city in southwestern China, were used to identify spatial patterns of urban vitality on streets across social, economic and cultural dimensions. The correlation between the built environment factors and the multidimensional urban vitality on the street was analyzed using a multiple regression model. The spatial distribution of the different dimensions of urban vitality of the street space in Chengdu varies to a certain extent. It is common for areas with high social vitality to have production and life centers nearby. High economic vitality centers are typically found along busy streets with a high concentration of businesses. Areas with high cultural vitality centers tend to be concentrated on the city&rsquo;s central streets. Land use, transportation, external environment, population and employment are all closely linked to urban vitality on streets. The crowd counting and POI density have the greatest impact on multidimensional urban vitality. The crowd and the level of service facilities profoundly affect social interaction, trade activities and cultural communication. The goodness of fit (R2) of the regression models for social, economic and cultural vitality are 0.590, 0.423 and 0.409, respectively. Using multisource urban data, our findings can help stakeholders better understand the spatial patterns and influencing factors of multidimensional urban vitality on streets and provide sustainable urban planning and development strategies for the future.

TI  - An Aggregated Mutual Information Based Feature Selection with Machine Learning Methods for Enhancing IoT Botnet Attack Detection
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to the wide availability and usage of connected devices in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the number of attacks on these networks is continually increasing. A particularly serious and dangerous type of attack in the IoT environment is the botnet attack, where the attackers can control the IoT systems to generate enormous networks of &ldquo;bot&rdquo; devices for generating malicious activities. To detect this type of attack, several Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been proposed for IoT networks based on machine learning and deep learning methods. As the main characteristics of IoT systems include their limited battery power and processor capacity, maximizing the efficiency of intrusion detection systems for IoT networks is still a research challenge. It is important to provide efficient and effective methods that use lower computational time and have high detection rates. This paper proposes an aggregated mutual information-based feature selection approach with machine learning methods to enhance detection of IoT botnet attacks. In this study, the N-BaIoT benchmark dataset was used to detect botnet attack types using real traffic data gathered from nine commercial IoT devices. The dataset includes binary and multi-class classifications. The feature selection method incorporates Mutual Information (MI) technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and ANOVA f-test at finely-granulated detection level to select the relevant features for improving the performance of IoT Botnet classifiers. In the classification step, several ensemble and individual classifiers were used, including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), Gaussian Na&iuml;ve Bayes (GNB), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The experimental results showed the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperformed other techniques using various evaluation metrics.

SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Ground-level ozone is a pollutant that is harmful to urban populations, particularly in developing countries where it is present in significant quantities. It greatly increases the risk of heart and lung diseases and harms agricultural crops. This study hypothesized that, as a secondary pollutant, ground-level ozone is amenable to 24 h forecasting based on measurements of weather conditions and primary pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. We developed software to analyze hourly records of 12 air pollutants and 5 weather variables over the course of one year in Delhi, India. To determine the best predictive model, eight machine learning algorithms were tuned, trained, tested, and compared using cross-validation with hourly data for a full year. The algorithms, ranked by R2 values, were XGBoost (0.61), Random Forest (0.61), K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (0.55), Support Vector Regression (0.48), Decision Trees (0.43), AdaBoost (0.39), and linear regression (0.39). When trained by separate seasons across five years, the predictive capabilities of all models increased, with a maximum R2 of 0.75 during winter. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory was the least accurate model for annual training, but had some of the best predictions for seasonal training. Out of five air quality index categories, the XGBoost model was able to predict the correct category 24 h in advance 90% of the time when trained with full-year data. Separated by season, winter is considerably more predictable (97.3%), followed by post-monsoon (92.8%), monsoon (90.3%), and summer (88.9%). These results show the importance of training machine learning methods with season-specific data sets and comparing a large number of methods for specific applications.

AB  - Cloud computing has become integral lately due to the ever-expanding Internet-of-things (IoT) network. It still is and continues to be the best practice for implementing complex computational applications, emphasizing the massive processing of data. However, the cloud falls short due to the critical constraints of novel IoT applications generating vast data, which entails a swift response time with improved privacy. The newest drift is moving computational and storage resources to the edge of the network, involving a decentralized distributed architecture. The data processing and analytics perform at proximity to end-users, and overcome the bottleneck of cloud computing. The trend of deploying machine learning (ML) at the network edge to enhance computing applications and services has gained momentum lately, specifically to reduce latency and energy consumed while optimizing the security and management of resources. There is a need for rigorous research efforts oriented towards developing and implementing machine learning algorithms that deliver the best results in terms of speed, accuracy, storage, and security, with low power consumption. This extensive survey presented on the prominent computing paradigms in practice highlights the latest innovations resulting from the fusion between ML and the evolving computing paradigms and discusses the underlying open research challenges and future prospects.

AB  - This paper proposes enhanced prediction and control design methods for improving traffic flow with human-driven and automated vehicles. To achieve accurate prediction for the entire time horizon, data-driven and model-based prediction methods were integrated. The goal of the integration was to accurately predict the outflow of the traffic network, which was selected as the highway section in this paper. The proposed novel prediction method was used in the optimal design for calculating controlled inflows on highway ramps. The goal of the design was to reach the maximum outflow of the traffic network, even against disturbances on uncontrolled inflows of the network. The control design leads to an optimization problem based on the min&ndash;max principle, i.e., the traffic outflow is considered to be maximized by controlled inflows and to be minimized by uncontrolled inflows. The effectiveness of the prediction and the control methods through simulation examples are illustrated, i.e., traffic outflow can be maximized by the control system under various uncontrolled inflow values.

AB  - Particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is an effective metaheuristic that can determine Pareto-optimal solutions. We propose an extended PSO by introducing quantum gates in order to ensure the diversity of particle populations that are looking for efficient alternatives. The quality of solutions was verified in the issue of assignment of resources in the computing cloud to improve the live migration of virtual machines. We consider the multi-criteria optimization problem of deep learning-based models embedded into virtual machines. Computing clouds with deep learning agents can support several areas of education, smart city or economy. Because deep learning agents require lots of computer resources, seven criteria are studied such as electric power of hosts, reliability of cloud, CPU workload of the bottleneck host, communication capacity of the critical node, a free RAM capacity of the most loaded memory, a free disc memory capacity of the most busy storage, and overall computer costs. Quantum gates modify an accepted position for the current location of a particle. To verify the above concept, various simulations have been carried out on the laboratory cloud based on the OpenStack platform. Numerical experiments have confirmed that multi-objective quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization algorithm provides better solutions than the other metaheuristics.

AB  - Intelligent traffic management is an important issue for smart cities. City councils try to implement the newest techniques and performant technologies in order to avoid traffic congestion, to optimize the use of traffic lights, to efficiently use car parking, etc. To find the best solution to this problem, Birmingham City Council decided to allow open-source predictive traffic forecasting by making the real-time datasets available. This paper proposes a multi-agent system (MAS) approach for intelligent urban traffic management in Birmingham using forecasting and classification techniques. The designed agents have the following tasks: forecast the occupancy rates for traffic flow, road junctions and car parking; classify the faults; control and monitor the entire process. The experimental results show that k-nearest neighbor forecasts with high accuracy rates for the traffic data and decision trees build the most accurate model for classifying the faults for their detection and repair in the shortest possible time. The whole learning process is coordinated by a monitoring agent in order to automate Birmingham city&rsquo;s traffic management.

AB  - Seaports are genuine, intermodal hubs connecting seaways to inland transport links, such as roads and railways. Seaports are located at the focal point of institutional, industrial, and control activities in a jungle of interconnected information systems. System integration is setting considerable challenges when a group of independent providers are asked to implement complementary software functionalities. For this reason, seaports are the ideal playground where software is highly composite and tailored to a large variety of final users (from the so-called port communities). Although the target would be that of shaping the Port Authorities to be providers of (digital) innovation services, the state-of-the-art is still that of considering them as final users, or proxies of them. For this reason, we show how a canonical cloud, virtualizing a distributed architecture, can be structured to host different, possibly overlapped, tenants, slicing the information system at the infrastructure, platform, and software layers. Resources at the infrastructure and platform layers are shared so that a variety of independent applications can make use of the local calculus and access the data stored in a Data Lake. Such a cloud is adopted by the Port of Livorno as a rapid prototyping framework for the development and deployment of ICT innovation services. In order to demonstrate the versatility of this framework, three case studies relating to as many prototype ICT services (Navigation Safety, e-Freight, and Logistics) released within three industrial tenants are here presented and discussed.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The paper presents a new security aspect for a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET)-based IoT model using the concept of artificial intelligence. The Black Hole Attack (BHA) is considered one of the most affecting threats in the MANET in which the attacker node drops the entire data traffic and hence degrades the network performance. Therefore, it necessitates the designing of an algorithm that can protect the network from the BHA node. This article introduces Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), a new updated routing protocol that combines the advantages of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The combination of the SVM with ANN is the novelty of the proposed model that helps to identify the attackers within the discovered route using the AODV routing mechanism. Here, the model is trained using ANN but the selection of training data is performed using the ABC fitness function followed by SVM. The role of ABC is to provide a better route for data transmission between the source and the destination node. The optimized route, suggested by ABC, is then passed to the SVM model along with the node&rsquo;s properties. Based on those properties ANN decides whether the node is a normal or an attacker node. The simulation analysis performed in MATLAB shows that the proposed work exhibits an improvement in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), throughput, and delay. To validate the system efficiency, a comparative analysis is performed against the existing approaches such as Decision Tree and Random Forest that indicate that the utilization of the SVM with ANN is a beneficial step regarding the detection of BHA attackers in the MANET-based IoT networks.

AB  - Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and autonomous local stakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple participants linked by complicated interactions, impacting the production, processing, transportation, and delivery of food to end consumers. Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the hype and examine the technology&rsquo;s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally, we discussed the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed by a conclusion and future work.

AB  - Fifth-generation (5G) technology will play a vital role in future wireless networks. The breakthrough 5G technology will unleash a massive Internet of Everything (IoE), where billions of connected devices, people, and processes will be simultaneously served. The services provided by 5G include several use cases enabled by the enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication. Fifth-generation networks potentially merge multiple networks on a single platform, providing a landscape for seamless connectivity, particularly for high-mobility devices.

In this context, we provide a comprehensive survey on 5G technologies that emphasize machine learning-based solutions to cope with existing and future challenges. First, we discuss 5G network architecture and outline the key performance indicators compared to the previous and upcoming network generations. Second, we discuss next-generation wireless networks and their characteristics, applications, and use cases for fast connectivity to billions of devices. Then, we confer physical layer services, functions, and issues that decrease the signal quality. We also present studies on 5G network technologies, 5G propelling trends, and architectures that help to achieve the goals of 5G. Moreover, we discuss signaling techniques for 5G massive multiple-input and multiple-output and beam-forming techniques to enhance data rates with efficient spectrum sharing. Further, we review security and privacy concerns in 5G and standard bodies&rsquo; actionable recommendations for policy makers. Finally, we also discuss emerging challenges and future directions.

AB  - Forests are an enduring component of the natural world and perform a vital role in protecting the environment. Forests are valuable resources to control global warming and provide oxygen for the survival of human life, including wood for households. Forest fires have recently emerged as a major threat to biological processes and the ecosystem. Unfortunately, almost every year, fire damages millions of hectares of forest land due to late and inefficient detection of fire. However, it is important to identify the forest fire at the initial level before it spreads to vast areas and destroys natural resources. In this paper, a formal model of the Internet of Things (IoT) and drone-based forest fire detection and counteraction system is presented. The proposed system comprises network maintenance. Sensor deployment is on trees, the ground, and animals in the form of subnets to transmit sensed data to the control room. All subnets are connected to the control room through gateway nodes. Alarms are being used to alert human beings and animals to save their lives, which will help to initially protect them from fire. The embedded sensors collect the information and transfer it to the gateways. Drones are being used for real-time visualization of fire-affected areas and to perform actions to control fires because they play a vital role in disasters. Graph theory is used to construct an efficient model and to show the connectivity of the network. To identify failures and develop recovery procedures, the algorithm is designed through the graph-based model. The model is developed by the Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL), and the correctness of the model is ensured using various VDM-SL toolbox facilities.

AB  - With the advancement of artificial intelligence, deep learning technology is applied in many fields. The autonomous car system is one of the most important application areas of artificial intelligence. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is one of the most critical components of self-driving cars. LiDAR can quickly scan the environment to obtain a large amount of high-precision three-dimensional depth information. Self-driving cars use LiDAR to reconstruct the three-dimensional environment. The autonomous car system can identify various situations in the vicinity through the information provided by LiDAR and choose a safer route. This paper is based on Velodyne HDL-64 LiDAR to decode data packets of LiDAR. The decoder we designed converts the information of the original data packet into X, Y, and Z point cloud data so that the autonomous vehicle can use the decoded information to reconstruct the three-dimensional environment and perform object detection and object classification. In order to prove the performance of the proposed LiDAR decoder, we use the standard original packets used for the comparison of experimental data, which are all taken from the Map GMU (George Mason University). The average decoding time of a frame is 7.678 milliseconds. Compared to other methods, the proposed LiDAR decoder has higher decoding speed and efficiency.

AB  - Aluminum windows are crucial components of building envelopes since they connect the indoor space to the external environment. Various external causes degrade or harm the functioning of aluminum windows. In this regard, inspecting the performance of aluminum windows is a necessary task to keep buildings healthy. This review illustrates the deterioration mechanisms of aluminum windows under various environmental conditions with an intention to provide comprehensive information for developing damage protection and inspection technologies. The illustrations reveal that moisture and chloride ions have the most detrimental effect on deteriorating aluminum windows in the long run, while mechanical loads can damage aluminum windows in a sudden manner. In addition, multiple advanced inspection techniques potential to benefit assessing aluminum window health state are discussed in order to help tackle the efficiency problem of traditional visual inspection. The comparison among those techniques demonstrates that infrared thermography can help acquire a preliminary defect profile of inspected windows, whereas ultrasonic phased arrays technology demonstrates a high level of competency in analyzing comprehensive defect information. This review also discusses the challenges in the scarcity of nanoscale corrosion information for insightful understandings of aluminum window corrosion and reliable window inspection tools for lifespan prediction. In this regard, molecular dynamics simulation and artificial intelligence technology are recommended as promising tools for better revealing the deterioration mechanisms and advancing inspection techniques, respectively, for future directions. It is envisioned that this paper will help upgrade the aluminum window inspection scheme and contribute to driving the construction of intelligent and safe cities.

AB  - With the rise of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of agricultural and farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT, in particular, can improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes by eliminating human intervention through automation. The fast rise of Internet of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life sectors, including business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various obstacles. IoT aids in collecting data that is useful in the farming sector, such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility, amount of water required for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively use technology to monitor their forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors, including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor networks), are utilized for agricultural inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact output and utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from afar. The goal of this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates IoT applications, benefits, current obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart agricultural system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield and save time, such as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer management.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - In this paper, an encryption and trust evaluation model is proposed on the basis of a blockchain in which the identities of the Aggregator Nodes (ANs) and Sensor Nodes (SNs) are stored. The authentication of ANs and SNs is performed in public and private blockchains, respectively. However, inauthentic nodes utilize the network&rsquo;s resources and perform malicious activities. Moreover, the SNs have limited energy, transmission range and computational capabilities, and are attacked by malicious nodes. Afterwards, the malicious nodes transmit wrong information of the route and increase the number of retransmissions due to which the SNs&rsquo; energy is rapidly consumed. The lifespan of the wireless sensor network is reduced due to the rapid energy dissipation of the SNs. Furthermore, the throughput increases and packet loss increase with the presence of malicious nodes in the network. The trust values of SNs are computed to eradicate the malicious nodes from the network. Secure routing in the network is performed considering residual energy and trust values of the SNs. Moreover, the Rivest&ndash;Shamir&ndash;Adleman (RSA), a cryptosystem that provides asymmetric keys, is used for securing data transmission. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of high packet delivery ratio.

AB  - Social distancing is crucial to restrain the spread of diseases such as COVID-19, but complete adherence to safety guidelines is not guaranteed. Monitoring social distancing through mass surveillance is paramount to develop appropriate mitigation plans and exit strategies. Nevertheless, it is a labor-intensive task that is prone to human error and tainted with plausible breaches of privacy. This paper presents a privacy-preserving adaptive social distance estimation and crowd monitoring solution for camera surveillance systems. We develop a novel person localization strategy through pose estimation, build a privacy-preserving adaptive smoothing and tracking model to mitigate occlusions and noisy/missing measurements, compute inter-personal distances in the real-world coordinates, detect social distance infractions, and identify overcrowded regions in a scene. Performance evaluation is carried out by testing the system&rsquo;s ability in person detection, localization, density estimation, anomaly recognition, and high-risk areas identification. We compare the proposed system to the latest techniques and examine the performance gain delivered by the localization and smoothing/tracking algorithms. Experimental results indicate a considerable improvement, across different metrics, when utilizing the developed system. In addition, they show its potential and functionality for applications other than social distancing.

VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Marine hydrological elements are of vital importance in marine surveys. The evolution of these elements can have a profound effect on the relationship between human activities and marine hydrology. Therefore, the detection and explanation of the evolution laws of marine hydrological elements are urgently needed. In this paper, a novel method, named Evolution Trend Recognition (ETR), is proposed to recognize the trend of ocean fronts, being the most important information in the ocean dynamic process. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the task of ocean-front trend classification. A novel classification algorithm is first proposed for recognizing the ocean-front trend, in terms of the ocean-front scale and strength. Then, the GoogLeNet Inception network is trained to classify the ocean-front trend, i.e., enhancing or attenuating. The ocean-front trend is classified using the deep neural network, as well as a physics-informed classification algorithm. The two classification results are combined to make the final decision on the trend classification. Furthermore, two novel databases were created for this research, and their generation method is described, to foster research in this direction. These two databases are called the Ocean-Front Tracking Dataset (OFTraD) and the Ocean-Front Trend Dataset (OFTreD). Moreover, experiment results show that our proposed method on OFTreD achieves a higher classification accuracy, which is 97.5%, than state-of-the-art networks. This demonstrates that the proposed ETR algorithm is highly promising for trend classification.

TI  - Improved Mask R-CNN for Rural Building Roof Type Recognition from UAV High-Resolution Images: A Case Study in Hunan Province, China
T2  - Remote Sensing

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SN  - 2072-4292

AB  - Accurate roof information of buildings can be obtained from UAV high-resolution images. The large-scale accurate recognition of roof types (such as gabled, flat, hipped, complex and mono-pitched roofs) of rural buildings is crucial for rural planning and construction. At present, most UAV high-resolution optical images only have red, green and blue (RGB) band information, which aggravates the problems of inter-class similarity and intra-class variability of image features. Furthermore, the different roof types of rural buildings are complex, spatially scattered, and easily covered by vegetation, which in turn leads to the low accuracy of roof type identification by existing methods. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a method for identifying roof types of complex rural buildings based on visible high-resolution remote sensing images from UAVs. First, the fusion of deep learning networks with different visual features is investigated to analyze the effect of the different feature combinations of the visible difference vegetation index (VDVI) and Sobel edge detection features and UAV visible images on model recognition of rural building roof types. Secondly, an improved Mask R-CNN model is proposed to learn more complex features of different types of images of building roofs by using the ResNet152 feature extraction network with migration learning. After we obtained roof type recognition results in two test areas, we evaluated the accuracy of the results using the confusion matrix and obtained the following conclusions: (1) the model with RGB images incorporating Sobel edge detection features has the highest accuracy and enables the model to recognize more and more accurately the roof types of different morphological rural buildings, and the model recognition accuracy (Kappa coefficient (KC)) compared to that of RGB images is on average improved by 0.115; (2) compared with the original Mask R-CNN, U-Net, DeeplabV3 and PSPNet deep learning models, the improved Mask R-CNN model has the highest accuracy in recognizing the roof types of rural buildings, with F1-score, KC and OA averaging 0.777, 0.821 and 0.905, respectively. The method can obtain clear and accurate profiles and types of rural building roofs, and can be extended for green roof suitability evaluation, rooftop solar potential assessment, and other building roof surveys, management and planning.

AB  - The high data rates detail that internet-connected devices have been increasing exponentially. Cognitive radio (CR) is an auspicious technology used to address the resource shortage issue in wireless IoT networks. Resource optimization is considered a non-convex and nondeterministic polynomial (NP) complete problem within CR-based Internet of Things (IoT) networks (CR-IoT). Moreover, the combined optimization of conflicting objectives is a challenging issue in CR-IoT networks. In this paper, energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) are considered as conflicting optimization objectives. This research work proposed a hybrid tabu search-based stimulated algorithm (HTSA) in order to achieve Pareto optimality between EE and SE. In addition, the fuzzy-based decision is employed to achieve better Pareto optimality. The performance of the proposed HTSA approach is analyzed using different resource allocation parameters and validated through simulation results.

AB  - Analyzing data related to the conditions of city streets and avenues could help to make better decisions about public spending on mobility. Generally, streets and avenues are fixed as soon as they have a citizen report or when a major incident occurs. However, it is uncommon for cities to have real-time reactive systems that detect the different problems they have to fix on the pavement. This work proposes a solution to detect anomalies in streets through state analysis using sensors within the vehicles that travel daily and connecting them to a fog-computing architecture on a V2I network. The system detects and classifies the main road problems or abnormal conditions in streets and avenues using Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA), comparing roughness against a flat reference. An instrumented vehicle obtained the reference through accelerometry sensors and then sent the data through a mid-range communication system. With these data, the system compared an Artificial Neural Network (supervised MLA) and a K-Nearest Neighbor (Supervised MLA) to select the best option to handle the acquired data. This system makes it desirable to visualize the streets&rsquo; quality and map the areas with the most significant anomalies.

AB  - Following the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Space (IoS), we are now approaching IoP (Internet of People), or the Internet of Individuals, with the integration of chips inside people that link to other chips and the Internet. Low latency is required in order to achieve great service quality in these ambient assisted living facilities. Failures, on the other hand, are not tolerated, and assessing the performance of such systems in a real-world setting is difficult. Analytical models may be used to examine these types of systems even in the early phases of design. The performance of aged care monitoring systems is evaluated using an M/M/c/K queuing network. The model enables resource capacity, communication, and service delays to be calibrated. The proposed model was shown to be capable of predicting the system&rsquo;s MRT (mean response time) and calculating the quantity of resources required to satisfy certain user requirements. To analyze data from IoT solutions, the examined architecture incorporates cloud and fog resources. Different circumstances were analyzed as case studies, with four main characteristics taken into consideration. These case studies look into how cloud and fog resources differ. Simulations were also run to test various routing algorithms with the goal of improving performance metrics. As a result, our study can assist in the development of more sophisticated health monitoring systems without incurring additional costs.

AB  - Traffic accident detection is an important strategy governments can use to implement policies intended to reduce accidents. They usually use techniques such as image processing, RFID devices, among others. Social network mining has emerged as a low-cost alternative. However, social networks come with several challenges such as informal language and misspellings. This paper proposes a method to extract traffic accident data from Twitter in Spanish. The method consists of four phases. The first phase establishes the data collection mechanisms. The second consists of vectorially representing the messages and classifying them as accidents or non-accidents. The third phase uses named entity recognition techniques to detect the location. In the fourth phase, locations pass through a geocoder that returns their geographic coordinates. This method was applied to Bogota city and the data on Twitter were compared with the official traffic information source; comparisons showed some influence of Twitter on the commercial and industrial area of the city. The results reveal how effective the information on accidents reported on Twitter can be. It should therefore be considered as a source of information that may complement existing detection methods.

AB  - With the emergence of networked devices, from the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes and cellular phones to vehicles connected to the Internet, there has been an ever-growing expansion of attack surfaces in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In the past decade, there has been a rapid growth in the automotive industry as network-enabled and electronic devices are now integral parts of vehicular ecosystems. These include the development of automobile technologies, namely, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and electric vehicles. Attacks on IoV may lead to malfunctioning of Electronic Control Unit (ECU), brakes, control steering issues, and door lock issues that can be fatal in CAV. To mitigate these risks, there is need for a lightweight model to identify attacks on vehicular systems. In this article, an efficient model of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to detect anomalies in the vehicular system. The dataset used in this study is an In-Vehicle Network (IVN) communication protocol, i.e., Control Area Network (CAN) dataset generated in a real-time environment. The model classifies different types of attacks on vehicles into reconnaissance, Denial of Service (DoS), and fuzzing attacks. Experimentation with performance metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score are compared across a variety of classification models. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other classification models.

AB  - In recent years, technology has advanced to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), where the Internet of things (IoTs), fog computing, computer security, and cyberattacks have evolved exponentially on a large scale. The rapid development of IoT devices and networks in various forms generate enormous amounts of data which in turn demand careful authentication and security. Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the most promising methods for addressing cybersecurity threats and providing security. In this study, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) that categorize, map and survey the existing literature on AI methods used to detect cybersecurity attacks in the IoT environment. The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation on most AI trending techniques in cybersecurity and state-of-art solutions. A systematic search was performed on various electronic databases (SCOPUS, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI). Out of the identified records, 80 studies published between 2016 and 2021 were selected, surveyed and carefully assessed. This review has explored deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques used in IoT security, and their effectiveness in detecting attacks. However, several studies have proposed smart intrusion detection systems (IDS) with intelligent architectural frameworks using AI to overcome the existing security and privacy challenges. It is found that support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) are among the most used methods, due to high accuracy detection another reason may be efficient memory. In addition, other methods also provide better performance such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural networks (NN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). This analysis also provides an insight into the AI roadmap to detect threats based on attack categories. Finally, we present recommendations for potential future investigations.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that can be utilized throughout a construction project lifecycle. Transition to incorporate AI technologies in the construction industry has been delayed due to the lack of know-how and research. There is also a knowledge gap regarding how the public perceives AI technologies, their areas of application, prospects, and constraints in the construction industry. This study aims to explore AI technology adoption prospects and constraints in the Australian construction industry by analyzing social media data. This study adopted social media analytics, along with sentiment and content analyses of Twitter messages (n = 7906), as the methodological approach. The results revealed that: (a) robotics, internet-of-things, and machine learning are the most popular AI technologies in Australia; (b) Australian public sentiments toward AI are mostly positive, whilst some negative perceptions exist; (c) there are distinctive views on the opportunities and constraints of AI among the Australian states/territories; (d) timesaving, innovation, and digitalization are the most common AI prospects; and (e) project risk, security of data, and lack of capabilities are the most common AI constraints. This study is the first to explore AI technology adoption prospects and constraints in the Australian construction industry by analyzing social media data. The findings inform the construction industry on public perceptions and prospects and constraints of AI adoption. In addition, it advocates the search for finding the most efficient means to utilize AI technologies. The study helps public perceptions and prospects and constraints of AI adoption to be factored in construction industry technology adoption.

AB  - Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm such that client data are processed at the periphery of the network, as close as possible to the originating source. Since the 21st century has come to be known as the century of data due to the rapid increase in the quantity of exchanged data worldwide (especially in smart city applications such as autonomous vehicles), collecting and processing such data from sensors and Internet of Things devices operating in real time from remote locations and inhospitable operating environments almost anywhere in the world is a relevant emerging need. Indeed, edge computing is reshaping information technology and business computing. In this respect, the paper is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of what edge computing is as well as the most relevant edge use cases, tradeoffs, and implementation considerations. In particular, this review article is focused on highlighting (i) the most recent trends relative to edge computing emerging in the research field and (ii) the main businesses that are taking operations at the edge as well as the most used edge computing platforms (both proprietary and open source). First, the paper summarizes the concept of edge computing and compares it with cloud computing. After that, we discuss the challenges of optimal server placement, data security in edge networks, hybrid edge-cloud computing, simulation platforms for edge computing, and state-of-the-art improved edge networks. Finally, we explain the edge computing applications to 5G/6G networks and industrial internet of things. Several studies review a set of attractive edge features, system architectures, and edge application platforms that impact different industry sectors. The experimental results achieved in the cited works are reported in order to prove how edge computing improves the efficiency of Internet of Things networks. On the other hand, the work highlights possible vulnerabilities and open issues emerging in the context of edge computing architectures, thus proposing future directions to be investigated.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Manual work accounts for one of the largest workgroups in the European manufacturing sector, and improving the training capacity, quality, and speed brings significant competitive benefits to companies. In this context, this paper presents an informed tree search on top of a Markov chain that suggests possible next assembly steps as a key component of an innovative assembly training station for manual operations. The goal of the next step suggestions is to provide support to inexperienced workers or to assist experienced workers by providing choices for the next assembly step in an automated manner without the involvement of a human trainer on site. Data stemming from 179 experiment participants, 111 factory workers, and 68 students, were used to evaluate different prediction methods. From our analysis, Markov chains fail in new scenarios and, therefore, by using an informed tree search to predict the possible next assembly step in such situations, the prediction capability of the hybrid algorithm increases significantly while providing robust solutions to unseen scenarios. The proposed method proved to be the most efficient for next assembly step prediction among all the evaluated predictors and, thus, the most suitable method for an adaptive assembly support system such as for manual operations in industry.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems, and makes application of technologies and advanced data processing techniques in agricultural field possible. Digital farming aims to use available information from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges for addressing food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The digital approaches are expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making supports. Digital twin in agriculture is a virtual representation of a farm with great potential for enhancing productivity and efficiency while declining energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of digital twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural contexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation, robotics, farm machineries, and food post-harvest processing in agricultural field. Data recording, modeling including artificial intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed. Digital twin systems can support farmers as a next generation of digitalization paradigm by continuous and real-time monitoring of physical world (farm) and updating the state of virtual world.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 15
IS  - 2
SN  - 1996-1073

AB  - Accurate short-term load forecasting can ensure the safe operation of the grid. Decomposing load data into smooth components by decomposition algorithms is a common approach to address data volatility. However, each component of the decomposition must be modeled separately for prediction, which leads to overly complex models. To solve this problem, a VMD-WSLSTM load prediction model based on Shapley values is proposed in this paper. First, the Shapley value is used to select the optimal set of special features, and then the VMD decomposition method is used to decompose the original load into several smooth components. Finally, WSLSTM is used to predict each component. Unlike the traditional LSTM model, WSLSTM can simplify the prediction model and extract common features among the components by sharing the parameters among the components. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, several control groups were used for experiments. The results show that the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy and training speed compared with traditional prediction methods.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Homomorphic Secure Search-Able Encryption for Keyword Search in Blockchain Healthcare System: A Novel Approach to Cryptography
T2  - Sensors

PY  - 2022
VL  - 22
IS  - 2
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Due to the value and importance of patient health records (PHR), security is the most critical feature of encryption over the Internet. Users that perform keyword searches to gain access to the PHR stored in the database are more susceptible to security risks. Although a blockchain-based healthcare system can guarantee security, present schemes have several flaws. Existing techniques have concentrated exclusively on data storage and have utilized blockchain as a storage database. In this research, we developed a unique deep-learning-based secure search-able blockchain as a distributed database using homomorphic encryption to enable users to securely access data via search. Our suggested study will increasingly include secure key revocation and update policies. An IoT dataset was used in this research to evaluate our suggested access control strategies and compare them to benchmark models. The proposed algorithms are implemented using smart contracts in the hyperledger tool. The suggested strategy is evaluated in comparison to existing ones. Our suggested approach significantly improves security, anonymity, and monitoring of user behavior, resulting in a more efficient blockchain-based IoT system as compared to benchmark models.

SN  - 2224-2708

AB  - Big data analytics can be used by smart cities to improve their citizens&rsquo; liveability, health, and wellbeing. Social surveys and also social media can be employed to engage with their communities, and these can require sophisticated analysis techniques. This research was focused on carrying out a sentiment analysis from social surveys. Data analysis techniques using RStudio and Python were applied to several open-source datasets, which included the 2018 Social Indicators Survey dataset published by the City of Melbourne (CoM) and the Casey Next short survey 2016 dataset published by the City of Casey (CoC). The qualitative nature of the CoC dataset responses could produce rich insights using sentiment analysis, unlike the quantitative CoM dataset. RStudio analysis created word cloud visualizations and bar charts for sentiment values. These were then used to inform social media analysis via the Twitter application programming interface. The R codes were all integrated within a Shiny application to create a set of user-friendly interactive web apps that generate sentiment analysis both from the historic survey data and more immediately from the Twitter feeds. The web apps were embedded within a website that provides a customisable solution to estimate sentiment for key issues. Global sentiment was also compared between the social media approach and the 2016 survey dataset analysis and showed some correlation, although there are caveats on the use of social media for sentiment analysis. Further refinement of the methodology is required to improve the social media app and to calibrate it against analysis of recent survey data.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Networks Used to Date Photographs
T2  - Electronics

PY  - 2022
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Nowadays, the information provided by digital photographs is very complete and very relevant in different professional fields, such as scientific or forensic photography. Taking this into account, it is possible to determine the date when they were taken, as well as the type of device that they were taken with, and thus be able to locate the photograph in a specific context. This is not the case with analog photographs, which lack any information regarding the date they were taken. Extracting this information is a complicated task, so classifying each photograph according to the date it was taken is a laborious task for a human expert. Artificial intelligence techniques make it possible to determine the characteristics and classify the images automatically. Within the field of artificial intelligence, convolutional neural networks are one of the most widely used methods today. This article describes the application of convolutional neural networks to automatically classify photographs according to the year they were taken. To do this, only the photograph is used, without any additional information. The proposed method divides each photograph into several segments that are presented to the network so that it can estimate a year for each segment. Once all the segments of a photograph have been processed, a general year for the photograph is calculated from the values generated by the network for each of its segments. In this study, images taken between 1960 and 1999 were analyzed and classified using different architectures of a convolutional neural network. The computational results obtained indicate that 44% of the images were classified with an error of less than 5 years, 20.25% with a marginal error between 5 and 10 years, and 35.75% with a higher marginal error of more than 10 years. Due to the complexity of the problem, the results obtained are considered good since 64.25% of the photographs were classified with an error of less than 10 years. Another important result of the study carried out is that it was found that the color is a very important characteristic when classifying photographs by date. The results obtained show that the approach given in this study is an important starting point for this type of task and that it allows placing a photograph in a specific temporal context, thus facilitating the work of experts dedicated to scientific and forensic photography.

SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - The IoT refers to the interconnection of things to the physical network that is embedded with software, sensors, and other devices to exchange information from one device to the other. The interconnection of devices means there is the possibility of challenges such as security, trustworthiness, reliability, confidentiality, and so on. To address these issues, we have proposed a novel group theory (GT)-based binary spring search (BSS) algorithm which consists of a hybrid deep neural network approach. The proposed approach effectively detects the intrusion within the IoT network. Initially, the privacy-preserving technology was implemented using a blockchain-based methodology. Security of patient health records (PHR) is the most critical aspect of cryptography over the Internet due to its value and importance, preferably in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Search keywords access mechanism is one of the typical approaches used to access PHR from a database, but it is susceptible to various security vulnerabilities. Although blockchain-enabled healthcare systems provide security, it may lead to some loopholes in the existing state of the art. In literature, blockchain-enabled frameworks have been presented to resolve those issues. However, these methods have primarily focused on data storage and blockchain is used as a database. In this paper, blockchain as a distributed database is proposed with a homomorphic encryption technique to ensure a secure search and keywords-based access to the database. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a secure key revocation mechanism and updates various policies accordingly. As a result, a secure patient healthcare data access scheme is devised, which integrates blockchain and trust chain to fulfill the efficiency and security issues in the current schemes for sharing both types of digital healthcare data. Hence, our proposed approach provides more security, efficiency, and transparency with cost-effectiveness. We performed our simulations based on the blockchain-based tool Hyperledger Fabric and OrigionLab for analysis and evaluation. We compared our proposed results with the benchmark models, respectively. Our comparative analysis justifies that our proposed framework provides better security and searchable mechanism for the healthcare system.

AB  - This article reviews the use of wearable sensors for the monitoring of physical activity (PA) for different purposes, including assessment of gait and balance, prevention and/or detection of falls, recognition of various PAs, conduction and assessment of rehabilitation exercises and monitoring of neurological disease progression. The article provides in-depth information on the retrieved articles and discusses study shortcomings related to demographic factors, i.e., age, gender, healthy participants vs patients, and study conditions. It is well known that motion patterns change with age and the onset of illnesses, and that the risk of falling increases with age. Yet, studies including older persons are rare. Gender distribution was not even provided in several studies, and others included only, or a majority of, men. Another shortcoming is that none of the studies were conducted in real-life conditions. Hence, there is still important work to be done in order to increase the usefulness of wearable sensors in these areas. The article highlights flaws in how studies based on previously collected datasets report on study samples and the data collected, which makes the validity and generalizability of those studies low. Exceptions exist, such as the promising recently reported open dataset FallAllD, wherein a longitudinal study with older adults is ongoing.

AB  - Only one third of studies on the Industry 4.0&ndash;sustainability link have been conducted in manufacturing, despite its centrality to &ldquo;ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns&rdquo; (UN Sustainable Development Goal nr. 12). The European Ecodesign Directive singled out machine tools as key to the sustainability transition, not least due to their high energy usage and their increasingly becoming enmeshed in cyber-physical production systems. This paper aims to find out whether the digital transformation underway in machine tools is sustainable as well as to identify its central technological pathways. Externalities in machine tools are tracked over three decades (1990&ndash;2018) by means of a multi-method setting: (1) mapping the Technological Innovation System (TIS) of machine tools; (2) co-occurrence analysis of transnational patent families, in order to reduce geographical and market distortions (Questel&rsquo;s FAMPAT); and (3) analysis of the incidence of digital and sustainable technologies in machine tools patent applications (WIPO PATENTSCOPE). A smart sustainability transition is currently not hampered by a lack of smart technologies but rather by the sluggish introduction of sustainable machine tools. Cyber-physical and robot machine tools have been found to be central pathways to a smart sustainability transition. Implications for harnessing externalities reach beyond the machine tools industry.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the energy sector. The new behavior of industrial and non-commercial consumers changes the energy consumption model. In addition, the constraints associated with the coronavirus crisis have led to environmental effects from declining economic activity. The research is based on evidence from around the world showing significant reductions in emissions and improved air quality. This situation requires rethinking the energy development strategy, particularly the construction of smart grids as a leading direction of energy development. Evaluating the efficiency of smart grids is a vital tool for disseminating successful experience in improving their management. This paper proposes an approach to a comprehensive assessment of smart grids based on a comparative analysis of existing methods, taking into account the changes that need to be considered after the experience gained from the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach provides an accurate set of efficiency indicators for assessing smart grids to account for the direct and indirect effects of smart grids&rsquo; implementation. This evaluation approach can be helpful to policymakers in developing energy efficiency programs and implementing energy policy.

SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Data hiding is the technique of embedding data into video or audio media. With the development of deep neural networks (DNN), the quality of images generated by novel data hiding methods based on DNN is getting better. However, there is still room for the similarity between the original images and the images generated by the DNN models which were trained based on the existing hiding frameworks to improve, and it is hard for the receiver to distinguish whether the container image is from the real sender. We propose a framework by introducing a key_img for using the over-fitting characteristic of DNN and combined with difference image grafting symmetrically, named difference image grafting deep hiding (DIGDH). The key_img can be used to identify whether the container image is from the real sender easily. The experimental results show that without changing the structures of networks, the models trained based on the proposed framework can generate images with higher similarity to original cover and secret images. According to the analysis results of the steganalysis tool named StegExpose, the container images generated by the hiding model trained based on the proposed framework is closer to the random distribution.

AB  - Nowadays, there is tremendous growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications in our everyday lives. The proliferation of smart devices, sensors technology, and the Internet makes it possible to communicate between the digital and physical world seamlessly for distributed data collection, communication, and processing of several applications dynamically. However, it is a challenging task to monitor and track objects in real-time due to the distinct characteristics of the IoT system, e.g., scalability, mobility, and resource-limited nature of the devices. In this paper, we address the significant issue of IoT object tracking in real time. We propose a system called &lsquo;TrackInk&rsquo; to demonstrate our idea. TrackInk will be capable of pointing toward and taking pictures of visible satellites in the night sky, including but not limited to the International Space Station (ISS) or the moon. Data will be collected from sensors to determine the system&rsquo;s geographical location along with its 3D orientation, allowing for the system to be moved. Additionally, TrackInk will communicate with and send data to ThingSpeak for further cloud-based systems and data analysis. Our proposed system is lightweight, highly scalable, and performs efficiently in a resource-limited environment. We discuss a detailed system&rsquo;s architecture and show the performance results using a real-world hardware-based experimental setup.

SN  - 2079-9292

AB  - Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a new multiple access method that has been considered in 5G cellular communications in recent years, and can provide better throughput than traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) to save communication bandwidth. Device-to-device (D2D) communication, as a key technology of 5G, can reuse network resources to improve the spectrum utilization of the entire communication network. Combining NOMA technology with D2D is an effective solution to improve mobile edge computing (MEC) communication throughput and user access density. Considering the estimation error of channel, we investigate the power of the transmit nodes optimization problem of NOMA-based D2D networks under the rates outage probability (OP) constraints of all single users. Specifically, under the channel statistical error model, the total system transmit power is minimized with the rate OP constraint of a single device. Unfortunately, the problem presented is thorny and non-convex. After equivalent transformation of the rate OP constraints by the Bernstein inequality, an algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) can efficiently solve this challenging non-convex problem. Numerical results show that the channel estimation error increases the power consumption of the system. We also compare NOMA with the OMA mode, and the numerical results show that the D2D offloading systems based on NOMA are superior to OMA.

TI  - An Efficient Hyperparameter Control Method for a Network Intrusion Detection System Based on Proximal Policy Optimization
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - The complexity of network intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is increasing due to the continuous increases in network traffic, various attacks and the ever-changing network environment. In addition, network traffic is asymmetric with few attack data, but the attack data are so complex that it is difficult to detect one. Many studies on improving intrusion detection performance using feature engineering have been conducted. These studies work well in the dataset environment; however, it is challenging to cope with a changing network environment. This paper proposes an intrusion detection hyperparameter control system (IDHCS) that controls and trains a deep neural network (DNN) feature extractor and k-means clustering module as a reinforcement learning model based on proximal policy optimization (PPO). An IDHCS controls the DNN feature extractor to extract the most valuable features in the network environment, and identifies intrusion through k-means clustering. Through iterative learning using the PPO-based reinforcement learning model, the system is optimized to improve performance automatically according to the network environment, where the IDHCS is used. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the system performance using the CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets. In CICIDS2017, an F1-score of 0.96552 was achieved and UNSW-NB15 achieved an F1-score of 0.94268. An experiment was conducted by merging the two datasets to build a more extensive and complex test environment. By merging datasets, the attack types in the experiment became more diverse and their patterns became more complex. An F1-score of 0.93567 was achieved in the merged dataset, indicating 97% to 99% performance compared with CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15. The results reveal that the proposed IDHCS improved the performance of the IDS by automating learning new types of attacks by managing intrusion detection features regardless of the network environment changes through continuous learning.

AB  - Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has emerged in many aspects of life, such as transportation, healthcare, and even education. IoT technology incorporates several tasks to achieve the goals for which it was developed through smart services. These services are intelligent activities that allow devices to interact with the physical world to provide suitable services to users anytime and anywhere. However, the remarkable advancement of this technology has increased the number and the mechanisms of attacks. Attackers often take advantage of the IoTs&rsquo; heterogeneity to cause trust problems and manipulate the behavior to delude devices&rsquo; reliability and the service provided through it. Consequently, trust is one of the security challenges that threatens IoT smart services. Trust management techniques have been widely used to identify untrusted behavior and isolate untrusted objects over the past few years. However, these techniques still have many limitations like ineffectiveness when dealing with a large amount of data and continuously changing behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for trust management in IoT devices and services based on the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The SMART is used for calculating the trust value, while LSTM is used for identifying changes in the behavior based on the trust threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using accuracy, loss rate, precision, recall, and F-measure on different data samples with different sizes. Comparisons with existing deep learning and machine learning models show superior performance with a different number of iterations. With 100 iterations, the proposed model achieved 99.87% and 99.76% of accuracy and F-measure, respectively.

AB  - The Internet is an essential part of daily life with the expansion of businesses for maximizing profits. This technology has intensely altered the traditional shopping style in online shopping. Convenience, quick price comparison, saving traveling time, and avoiding crowds are the reasons behind the abrupt adoption of online shopping. However, in many situations, the product provided does not meet the quality, which is the primary concern of every customer. To ensure quality product provision, the whole food supply chain should be examined and managed properly. In food traceability systems, sensors are used to gather product information, which is forwarded to fog computing. However, the product information forwarded by the sensors may not be similar, as it can be modified by intruders/hackers. Moreover, consumers are interested in the product location, as well as its status, i.e., manufacturing date, expiry date, etc. Therefore, in this paper, data and account security techniques were introduced to efficiently secure product information through the Twofish algorithm and dual attestation for account verification. To improve the overall working, the proposed mechanism integrates fog computing with novel modules to efficiently monitor the product, along with increasing the efficiency of the whole working process. To validate the performance of the proposed system, a comparative simulation was performed with existing approaches in which Twofish showed notably better results in terms of encryption time, computational cost, and the identification of modification attacks.

AB  - Long-term prediction of hour-concentration of PM2.5 (particles in atmospheric suspension with effective dimensions equal or lower than 2.5 microns) is of great significance for environmental protection and people&rsquo;s health. At present, the prediction of hour-concentration of PM2.5 is mostly single-step prediction, which is to predict PM2.5 concentration at a future time point based on a period of historical data. In this paper, a model based on multi-time scale fusion is proposed to study single-step prediction and multi-step prediction, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed model is better than stacked LSTM and CNN-LSTM in predicting PM2.5 hour-concentration.

AB  - Behavior modeling has multiple applications in the intelligent environment domain. It has been used in different tasks, such as the stratification of different pathologies, prediction of the user actions and activities, or modeling the energy usage. Specifically, behavior prediction can be used to forecast the future evolution of the users and to identify those behaviors that deviate from the expected conduct. In this paper, we propose the use of embeddings to represent the user actions, and study and compare several behavior prediction approaches. We test multiple model (LSTM, CNNs, GCNs, and transformers) architectures to ascertain the best approach to using embeddings for behavior modeling and also evaluate multiple embedding retrofitting approaches. To do so, we use the Kasteren dataset for intelligent environments, which is one of the most widely used datasets in the areas of activity recognition and behavior modeling.

SN  - 2076-3417

AB  - The increasing need for food in recent years means that environmental protection and sustainable agriculture are necessary. For this, smart agricultural systems and autonomous robots have become widespread. One of the most significant and persistent problems related to robots is 3D path planning, which is an NP-hard problem, for mobile robots. In this paper, efficient methods are proposed by two metaheuristic algorithms (Incremental Gray Wolf Optimization (I-GWO) and Expanded Gray Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). The proposed methods try to find collision-free optimal paths between two points for robots without human intervention in an acceptable time with the lowest process costs and efficient use of resources in large-scale and crowded farmlands. Thanks to the methods proposed in this study, various tasks such as tracking crops can be performed efficiently by autonomous robots. The simulations are carried out using three methods, and the obtained results are compared with each other and analyzed. The relevant results show that in the proposed methods, the mobile robots avoid the obstacles successfully and obtain the optimal path cost from source to destination. According to the simulation results, the proposed method based on the Ex-GWO algorithm has a better success rate of 55.56% in optimal path cost.

AB  - Saffron, one of the most expensive crops on earth, having a vast domain of applications, has the potential to boost the economy of India. The cultivation of saffron has been immensely affected in the past few years due to the changing climate. Despite the use of different artificial methods for cultivation, hydroponic approaches using the IoT prove to give the best results. The presented study consists of potential artificial approaches used for cultivation and the selection of hydroponics as the best approach out of these based on different parameters. This paper also provides a comparative analysis of six present hydroponic approaches. The research work on different factors of saffron, such as the parameters responsible for growth, reasons for the decline in growth, and different agronomical variables, has been shown graphically. A smart hydroponic system for saffron cultivation has been proposed using the NFT (nutrient film technique) and renewable sources of energy.

AB  - Ever since the introduction of fifth generation (5G) mobile communications, the mobile telecommunications industry has been debating whether 5G is an &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; or &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; from the previous legacy mobile networks, but now that 5G has been commercially available for the past few years, the research direction has recently shifted towards the upcoming generation of mobile communication system, known as the sixth generation (6G), which is expected to drastically provide significant and evolutionary, if not revolutionary, improvements in mobile networks. The promise of extremely high data rates (in terabits), artificial intelligence (AI), ultra-low latency, near-zero/low energy, and immense connected devices is expected to enhance the connectivity, sustainability, and trustworthiness and provide some new services, such as truly immersive &ldquo;extended reality&rdquo; (XR), high-fidelity mobile hologram, and a new generation of entertainment. Sixth generation and its vision are still under research and open for developers and researchers to establish and develop their directions to realize future 6G technology, which is expected to be ready as early as 2028. This paper reviews 6G mobile technology, including its vision, requirements, enabling technologies, and challenges. Meanwhile, a total of 11 communication technologies, including terahertz (THz) communication, visible light communication (VLC), multiple access, coding, cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) zero-energy interface, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), and infusion of AI/machine learning (ML) in wireless transmission techniques, are presented. Moreover, this paper compares 5G and 6G in terms of services, key technologies, and enabling communications techniques. Finally, it discusses the crucial future directions and technology developments in 6G.

AB  - The growing importance and widespread adoption of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies have helped the enhancement of smart environments in numerous sectors such as manufacturing, smart cities, transportation and Internet of Things by providing pervasive real-time applications. In this survey, we analyze the existing research trends with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in WSN and the possible use of these methods for WSN enhancement. The main goal of data collection, aggregation and dissemination algorithms is to gather and aggregate data in an energy efficient manner so that network lifetime is enhanced. In this paper, we highlight data collection, aggregation and dissemination challenges in WSN and present a comprehensive discussion on the recent studies that utilized various AI methods to meet specific objectives of WSN, during the span of 2010 to 2021. We compare and contrast different algorithms on the basis of optimization criteria, simulation/real deployment, centralized/distributed kind, mobility and performance parameters. We conclude with possible future research directions. This would guide the reader towards an understanding of up-to-date applications of AI methods with respect to data collection, aggregation and dissemination challenges in WSN. Then, we provide a general evaluation and comparison of different AI methods used in WSNs, which will be a guide for the research community in identifying the mostly adapted methods and the benefits of using various AI methods for solving the challenges related to WSNs. Finally, we conclude the paper stating the open research issues and new possibilities for future studies.

TI  - Applying Federated Learning in Software-Defined Networks: A Survey
T2  - Symmetry

PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SN  - 2073-8994

AB  - Federated learning (FL) is a type of distributed machine learning approacs that trains global models through the collaboration of participants. It protects data privacy as participants only contribute local models instead of sharing private local data. However, the performance of FL highly relies on the number of participants and their contributions. When applying FL over conventional computer networks, attracting more participants, encouraging participants to contribute more local resources, and enabling efficient and effective collaboration among participants become very challenging. As software-defined networks (SDNs) enable open and flexible networking architecture with separate control and data planes, SDNs provide standardized protocols and specifications to enable fine-grained collaborations among devices. Applying FL approaches over SDNs can take use such advantages to address challenges. A SDN control plane can have multiple controllers organized in layers; the controllers in the lower layer can be placed in the network edge to deal with the asymmetries in the attached switches and hosts, and the controller in the upper layer can supervise the whole network centrally and globally. Applying FL in SDNs with a layered-distributed control plane may be able to protect the data privacy of each participant while improving collaboration among participants to produce higher-quality models over asymmetric networks. Accordingly, this paper aims to make a comprehensive survey on the related mechanisms and solutions that enable FL in SDNs. It highlights three major challenges, an incentive mechanism, privacy and security, and model aggregation, which affect the quality and quantity of participants, the security and privacy in model transferring, and the performance of the global model, respectively. The state of the art in mechanisms and solutions that can be applied to address such challenges in the current literature are categorized based on the challenges they face, followed by suggestions of future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first effort in surveying the state of the art in combining FL with SDNs.

TI  - Interpolation-Based Fusion of Sentinel-5P, SRTM, and Regulatory-Grade Ground Stations Data for Producing Spatially Continuous Maps of PM2.5 Concentrations Nationwide over Thailand
T2  - Atmosphere

PY  - 2022
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
SN  - 2073-4433

AB  - Atmospheric pollution has recently drawn significant attention due to its proven adverse effects on public health and the environment. This concern has been aggravated specifically in Southeast Asia due to increasing vehicular use, industrial activity, and agricultural burning practices. Consequently, elevated PM2.5 concentrations have become a matter of intervention for national authorities who have addressed the needs of monitoring air pollution by operating ground stations. However, their spatial coverage is limited and the installation and maintenance are costly. Therefore, alternative approaches are necessary at national and regional scales. In the current paper, we investigated interpolation models to fuse PM2.5 measurements from ground stations and satellite data in an attempt to produce spatially continuous maps of PM2.5 nationwide over Thailand. Four approaches are compared, namely the inverse distance weighted (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), random forest (RF), and random forest combined with OK (RFK) leveraging on the NO2, SO2, CO, HCHO, AI, and O3 products from the Sentinel-5P satellite, regulatory-grade ground PM2.5 measurements, and topographic parameters. The results suggest that RFK is the most robust, especially when the pollution levels are moderate or extreme, achieving an RMSE value of 7.11 &mu;g/m3 and an R2 value of 0.77 during a 10-day long period in February, and an RMSE of 10.77 &mu;g/m3 and R2 and 0.91 during the entire month of March. The proposed approach can be adopted operationally and expanded by leveraging regulatory-grade stations, low-cost sensors, as well as upcoming satellite missions such as the GEMS and the Sentinel-5.

VL  - 8

SN  - 2313-433X

AB  - The proper inspection of a cracks pattern over time is a critical diagnosis step to provide a thorough knowledge of the health state of a structure. When monitoring cracks propagating on a planar surface, adopting a single-image-based approach is a more convenient (costly and logistically) solution compared to subjective operators-based solutions. Machine learning (ML)- based monitoring solutions offer the advantage of automation in crack detection; however, complex and time-consuming training must be carried out. This study presents a simple and automated ML-based crack monitoring approach implemented in open sources software that only requires a single image for training. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed conducting work in controlled and real case study sites. For both sites, the generated outputs are significant in terms of accuracy (~1 mm), repeatability (sub-mm) and precision (sub-pixel). The presented results highlight that the successful detection of cracks is achievable with only a straightforward ML-based training procedure conducted on only a single image of the multi-temporal sequence. Furthermore, the use of an innovative camera kit allowed exploiting automated acquisition and transmission fundamental for Internet of Things (IoTs) for structural health monitoring and to reduce user-based operations and increase safety.

AB  - In order to meet the requirements of high-tech enterprises for high power quality, high-quality operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) in smart distribution networks (SDN) is becoming increasingly important. As a significant element in enhancing the high-quality O&amp;M of SDN, situation awareness (SA) began to excite the significant interest of scholars and managers, especially after the integration of intermittent renewable energy into SDN. Specific to high-quality O&amp;M, the paper decomposes SA into three stages: detection, comprehension, and projection. In this paper, the state-of-the-art knowledge of SND SA is discussed, a review of critical technologies is presented, and a five-layer visualization framework of the SDN SA is constructed. SA detection aims to improve the SDN observability, SA comprehension is associated with the SDN operating status, and SA projection pertains to the analysis of the future SDN situation. The paper can provide researchers and utility engineers with insights into the technical achievements, barriers, and future research directions of SDN SA.

VL  - 22
IS  - 3
SN  - 1424-8220

AB  - Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a sensing paradigm that allows ordinary citizens to use mobile and wearable technologies and become active observers of their surroundings. MCS services generate a massive amount of data due to the vast number of devices engaging in MCS tasks, and the intrinsic mobility of users can quickly make information obsolete, requiring efficient data processing. Our previous work shows that the Bloom filter (BF) is a promising technique to reduce the quantity of redundant data in a hierarchical edge-based MCS ecosystem, allowing users engaging in MCS tasks to make autonomous informed decisions on whether or not to transmit data. This paper extends the proposed BF algorithm to accept multiple data readings of the same type at an exact location if the MCS task requires such functionality. In addition, we thoroughly evaluate the overall behavior of our approach by taking into account the overhead generated in communication between edge servers and end-user devices on a real-world dataset. Our results indicate that using the proposed algorithm makes it possible to significantly reduce the amount of transmitted data and achieve energy savings up to 62% compared to a baseline approach.

T2  - Buildings

PY  - 2022
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SN  - 2075-5309

AB  - Digital twin (DT) is gaining increasing attention due to its ability to present digital replicas of existing assets, processes and systems. DT can integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create real-time simulation models. These models learn and update from multiple data sources to predict their physical counterparts&rsquo; current and future conditions. This has promoted its relevance in various industries, including the construction industry (CI). However, recognising the existence of a distinct set of factors driving its adoption has not been established. Therefore, this study aims to identify the drivers and integrate them into a classification framework to enhance its understanding. Utilising popular databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, a systematic literature review of 58 relevant DT adoptions in the CI research was conducted. From the review, the drivers for DT adoption in the CI were identified and classified. The results show that developed countries such as the UK, US, Australia, and Italy have been the top countries in advancing DT adoption in the CI, while developing countries have made commendable contributions. A conceptual framework has been developed to enhance the successful adoption of DT in the CI based on 50 identified drivers. The major categories of the framework include concept-oriented drivers, production-driven drivers, operational success drivers, and preservation-driven drivers. The developed framework serves as a guide to propel DT adoption in the CI. Furthermore, this study contributes to the body of knowledge about DT adoption drivers, which is essential for DT promotion in the CI.

AB  - Electrical load forecasting study is required in electric power systems for different applications with respect to the specific time horizon, such as optimal operations, grid stability, Demand Side Management (DSM) and long-term strategic planning. In this context, machine learning and data analytics models represent a valuable tool to cope with the intrinsic complexity and especially design future demand-side advanced services. The main novelty in this paper is that the combination of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques is proposed to improve the forecasting capability of the hourly load on an electric power substation. A historical dataset of measured loads related to a 33/11 kV MV substation is considered in India as a case study, in order to properly validate the designed method. Based on the presented numerical results, the proposed approach proved itself to accurately predict loads with a reduced dimensionality of input data, thus minimizing the overall computational effort.
