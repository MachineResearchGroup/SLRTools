abstract = {With the advancement of high speed wireless communication in the smart Internet of Things (IoT) based network promises several benefits to users, e.g., scalability, stability, and analytics. The most prominent challenge in IoT driven network is the transmission of the huge amount of data that is generated from the sensor devices which will jeopardize the longevity of the node due to excessive consumption of communication power. The research community is constantly trying to understand and resolve its challenges to obtain the best version of this technology. Therefore, providing solutions for network based crisis concerning energy conservation, reliable routing, congestion avoidance, network heterogeneity, security, and quality of service has become a paramount importance. Recent studies are primarily focusing on the energy utilization of the sensor node to boost the life-time of sensors. This paper provides an exhaustive survey on various energy-efficient protocols and mechanisms, e.g., IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), Energy Harvesting, Bio-Inspired routings, Fuzzy Logic based approaches and Sustainable Computing.}

These technologies facilitate the simplification of processes and provide secure management of recorded data, guaranteeing the transmission and public transparency of information. Based on the combination of a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform and G-Cloud solutions, our proposal consists of the design of an e-Participation model that uses a tokenizable system of the actions and processes undertaken by citizens in participatory processes providing incentives to promote greater participation in public affairs. In order to develop a sustainable, scalable and resilient e-Participation system, a new blockchain concept, which organizes the blocks as a neural system, is combined with the implementation of a virtual token to reward participants. Furthermore, this virtual token is deployed through a smart contract that the block itself produces, containing information about the transaction and all the documents involved in the process. Finally, our Neural Distributed Ledger (NDL) framework facilitates the interconnection of blockchain networks in a transparent, certified, secure, auditable, scalable and traceable way.}

This survey paper presents a review of the security challenges of emerging IoT networks and discusses some of the attacks and their countermeasures based on different domains in IoT networks. Most conventional solutions for IoT networks are adopted from communication networks while noting the particular characteristics of IoT networks such as the nodes quantity, heterogeneity, and the limited resources of the nodes, these conventional security methods are not adequate. One challenge towards utilizing common secret key-based cryptographic methods in large-scale IoTs is the problem of secret key generation, distribution, and storage and protecting these secret keys from physical attacks. Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) can be utilized as a possible hardware remedy for identification and authentication in IoTs. Since PUFs extract the unique hardware characteristics, they potentially offer an affordable and practical solution for secret key generation. However, several barriers limit the PUFs’ applications for key generation purposes. We discuss the advantages of PUF-based key generation methods, and we present a survey of state-of-the-art techniques in this domain. We also present a proof-of-concept PUF-based solution for secret key generation using resistive random-access memories (ReRAM) embedded in IoTs.}

abstract = {Multi-task learning is a promising machine learning branch, which aims to improve the generalization of the prediction models by sharing knowledge among tasks. Most of the existing multi-task learning methods rely on predefined task relationships and guide the learning process of models by linear regularization terms. On the one hand, improper setting of task relationships may result in negative knowledge transfer; on the other hand, these methods also suffer from the insufficiency of representation ability. To overcome these problems, this paper focuses on attention-based deep multi-task learning method, and provides a novel deep multi-task learning method, namely, Deep Multi-task Learning with Relational Attention (DMLRA). In particular, we first provide a task-specific attention module to specify features for different learning tasks, because different prediction tasks may rely on different parts of the shared feature set. Then, we design a relational attention module to learn relationships among multiple tasks automatically, and transfer positive and negative knowledge among multiple tasks accordingly. Moreover, we provide a joint deep multi-task learning framework to combine task-specific module and relational attention module. Finally, we apply our method on a multi-criteria business success assessment problem, both classical and the state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods are employed to provide baseline performance. The experiments are conducted on real-world datasets, results demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing methods.}

abstract = {The smart applications dominating the planet in the present day and age, have innovatively progressed to deploy Internet of Things (IoT) based systems and related infrastructures in all spectrums of life. Since, variety of applications are being developed using this IoT paradigm, there is an immense necessity for storing data, processing them to get meaningful information and render suitable services to the end-users. The “thing” in this decade is not only a smart sensor or a device; it can be any physical or household object, a smart device or a mobile. With the ever increasing rise in population and smart device usage in every sphere of life, when all of such “thing”s generates data, there is a chance of huge data traffic in the internet. This could be handled only by integrating “Internet of Everything (IoE)” paradigm with a completely diversified technology — Cloud Computing. In order to handle this heavy flow of data traffic and process the same to generate meaningful information, various services in the global environment are utilized. Hence the primary focus revolves in integrating these two diversified paradigm shifts to develop intelligent information processing systems. Energy Efficient Cloud Based Internet of Everything (EECloudIoE) architecture is proposed in this study, which acts as an initial step in integrating these two wide areas thereby providing valuable services to the end users. The utilization of energy is optimized by clustering the various IoT network using Wind Driven Optimization Algorithm. Next, an optimized Cluster Head (CH) is chosen for each cluster, using Firefly Algorithm resulting in reduced data traffic in comparison to other non-clustering schemes. The proposed clustering of IoE is further compared with the widely used state of the art techniques like Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Adaptive Gravitational Search algorithm (AGSA). The results justify the superiority of the proposed methodology outperforming the existing approaches with an increased life-time and reduction in traffic.}

abstract = {In the recent years, a rapid growth of IoT devices has been observed, which in turn results in a huge amount of data produced from multiple sources towards the most disparate cloud platforms or the Internet in general. In a typical cloud-centric approach, the data produced by these devices is simply transmitted over the Internet, for consumption and/or storage. However, with the exponential growth in data production rates, the available network resources are becoming the actual bottleneck of this huge data flowing. Therefore, several challenges are appearing in the coming years, which are mainly related to data transmission, processing, and storage along the so-called cloud-to-thing continuum. In fact, one of the most critical requirements of several IoT applications is low latency, which often hinders raw data consumption to happen at the opposite endpoint with respect to its production. In the context of IoT data stream analytics, for instance, the detection of anomalies or rare-events is one of the most demanding tasks, as it needs prompt detection to increase its significance. In this respect, Fog and Edge Computing seem to be the correct paradigms to alleviate these stringent demands in terms of latency and bandwidth as, by leveraging on re-configurable IoT gateways and smart devices able to support the distribution of the overall computational task, they envisage to liquefy data processing along the way from the sensing device to a cloud endpoint. In this paper, we will present IRESE, that is a rare-event detection system able to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques on the incoming data, directly on affordable gateways located in the IoT edge. Notwithstanding the proposed approach enjoys the benefits of a fully unsupervised learning approach, such as the ability to learn from unlabeled data, it has been tested against various audio rare-event categories, such as gunshot, glass break, scream, and siren, achieving precision and recall measures above 90% in detecting such events.}

As indicated by the large majority of noise complaints registered with the NYC 311 information/complaints line, the urban sound environment has a profound effect on the quality of life of the city’s inhabitants. To monitor and ultimately understand these sonic environments, a process of long-term acoustic measurement and analysis is required. The traditional method of environmental acoustic monitoring utilizes short term measurement periods using expensive equipment, setup and operated by experienced and costly personnel. In this paper a different approach is proposed to this application which implements a smart, low-cost, static, acoustic sensing device based around consumer hardware. These devices can be deployed in numerous and varied urban locations for long periods of time, allowing for the collection of longitudinal urban acoustic data. The varied environmental conditions of urban settings make for a challenge in gathering calibrated sound pressure level data for prospective stakeholders. This paper details the sensors’ design, development and potential future applications, with a focus on the calibration of the devices’ Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microphone in order to generate reliable decibel levels at the type/class 2 level.}

abstract = {Due to the complexity of spatial and structural patterns of remote sensing images, land cover classification is still an active, ongoing problem in the field of image classification. The limited spectrum and texture features can be used often lead to low accuracy in remote sensing image classifications. Spatial structure information, which is commonly regarded as very useful information for improving land cover classifications, characterizes a composite of several types of objects or land covers. However, it is rarely used because it is difficult to describe and calculate. Generally, images contain the relationships of spatial adjacency, spatial direction and spatial distance among multiple objects. This study selects spatial adjacency relationships as an example, mines the features of spatial adjacency, and uses to improve classification. Therefore, this paper (1) presents a modeling method of remote sensing images based on complex networks to express the spatial structure information and make it computable firstly; (2) gives network expression and calculation methods of spectrum, texture and object features in images; (3) discusses a discovery method of spatial adjacency feature based on network. Finally, this paper gives a strategy to improve the classification for high-resolution image by using the spatial adjacency features. Two kinds of data in coastal zones and city areas are used to verify the method. The results show that the proposed approach, which considers the features of spatial adjacencies, improves the classification accuracy by at least 4% compared with the approaches that do not consider spatial adjacencies. Comparing with the results of deep learning method, our method has higher overall accuracy when the numbers of samples are small.}

Related literature on energy efficiency in sensor enabled wireless network environments focuses on one aspect either energy oriented path selection or energy oriented message scheduling. The definition of path also varies in literature without considering links towards energy efficiency. In this context, this paper proposes an energy oriented path selection and message scheduling framework for sensor enabled wireless network environments. The technical novelty focuses on effective cooperation between path selection and message scheduling considering links on path, location of message sender, and number of processor in sensor towards energy efficiency. Specifically, a path selection strategy is developed based on shortest path and less number of links on path (SPLL). The location of message sender, and number of processor in specific sensor are utilized for developing a longer hops (LH) message scheduling approach. A system model is presented based on M/M/1 queuing analysis to showcase the effective cooperation of SPLL and LH towards energy efficiency. Simulation oriented comparative performance evaluation attest the energy efficiency of the proposed framework as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques considering number of energy oriented metrics.}

Devices such as blood-pressure monitors, glucose meters, heart monitoring implants, Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and Electromyography (EMG) wearable devices allow health providers to collect the patient health information locally and make a real-time decision based on the Patient Health Data (PHD). Hospitals have been adopting the IoT for many years and now they have healthcare IoT devices in patients’ rooms and their bodies. However, the medical agencies, hospitals, and companies do not consider the security risk of healthcare IoT devices connected to a Local Area Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN). The IoT devices can be easily hacked and may lead to several potentially life-threatening risks due to poor authentication and encryption practices. Existing machine learning algorithms and blockchain approach working in the cloud computing environment are unable to meet the Quality of Service (QoS) like reliability, authentication, identification, and security requirements of healthcare IoT devices. Most of the traditional machine learning algorithms and techniques for healthcare IoT lacks the real-world implementation for secure data transmission. Therefore, blockchain is introduced for secure and reliable transaction in healthcare IoT. Whereas Fog Computing (FC) is introduced to extend the services of the cloud at the edge of networks. Integration of FC with blockchain can overcome the issue of healthcare IoT device identification, authentication, and verification for scalable frequent data transmission in a decentralized environment. Hence, a novel solution for the abovementioned problem is proposed using FC and blockchain. It includes an FC-based three-tier architecture, an analytical model, a mathematical framework, and an Advanced Signature-Based Encryption (ASE) algorithm for healthcare IoT device identification, verification, and Patient Health Data (PHD) authentication. The aim is to extend secure data transmission for healthcare IoT and end-users availing the real-time services. The proposed model and algorithm will be able to provide services for transaction and transmission near the edge in a secure manner. By analyzing the generated results from the proposed novel ASE algorithm for throughput, packet error, reliability, and malicious node detection accuracy; it is observed that the ASE algorithm in the FC environment easily outperforms the cloud and the other existing state of the art techniques such as FogBus, Femto cloud, Blockchain Fog-based Architecture Network (BFAN), and BeeKeeper. The malicious node detection accuracy of the ASE algorithm in the FC environment is 91% and in the cloud is 83%. Whereas the reliability percentage of the ASE algorithm in FC is 95% and in the cloud is 87%. The proposed approach is tested on simulators iFogSim (Net-Beans) and SimBlock.}

This paper presents fog nodes collaborative scheme to share the load of the overloaded fog node to ensure timely service. The proposed load-sharing scheme also takes care of the security aspect by developing a trust-based load-offloading method. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated via a simulation study to show its effectiveness over the existing methods with latency and service response rate as performance metrics.}

Although in recent years, deep learning has brought about major breakthroughs in the six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) pose estimation of objects from monocular images, accurate estimation of the geographic 6-DoF poses of vehicles using images from traffic surveillance cameras remains challenging. We present an architecture that computes continuous global 6-DoF poses throughout joint 2D landmark estimation and 3D pose reconstruction. The architecture infers the 6-DoF pose of a vehicle from the appearance of the image of the vehicle and 3D information. The architecture, which does not rely on intrinsic camera parameters, can be applied to all surveillance cameras by a pre-trained model. Also, with the help of 3D information from the point clouds and the 3D model itself, the architecture can predict landmarks with few and/or blurred textures. Moreover, because of the lack of public training datasets, we release a large-scale dataset, ADFSC, that contains 120 K groups of data with random viewing angles. Regarding both 2D and 3D metrics, our architecture outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in vehicle 6-DoF estimation.}

abstract = {The trend of the Internet of Everything is deepening, and the amount of data that needs to be processed in the network is growing. Using the edge cloud technology can process data at the edge of the network, lowering the burden on the data center. When the load of the edge cloud is large, it is necessary to apply for more resources to the cloud service provider, and the resource billing granularity affects the cost. When the load is small, releasing the idle node resources to the cloud service provider can lower the service expenditure. To this end, an on-demand resource provision model based on service expenditure is proposed. The demand for resources needs to be estimated in advance. To this end, a load estimation model based on ARIMA model and BP neural network is proposed. The model can estimate the load according to historical data and reduce the estimation error. Before releasing the node resources, the user data on the node need to be migrated to other working nodes to ensure that the user data will not be lost. In this paper, when selecting the migration target, the three metrics of load balancing, migration time consumption and migration cost of the cluster are considered. A data migration model based on load balancing is proposed. Through the comparison of experimental results, the proposed methods can effectively reduce service expenditure and make the cluster in a state of load balancing.}

Machine learning allows to automate the building of ontologies from texts. In particular, clustering techniques have a promising ability on the concept formation task by identifying the cluster of semantically closed terms as a concept. However, current works encounter issues in learning relevant domain-specific clusters or in identifying the relevant concept labels for each cluster. To solve these issues, we propose both to use core concepts from a domain ontology as prior knowledge, and to adapt term clustering with seed knowledge-based LDA models in order to take these core concepts into account. First, each topic is associated with a set of seed terms of a single core concept, then the learning is guided by these seeds to gather in the same topic the terms that refer to its core concept. We evaluate our proposal on two textual corpora and compare it to the baselines (LDA, K-means, and SMBM). The results show that our approach performs significantly better than other methods on the class-balanced dataset and works well on the class-imbalanced dataset with a proper number of topics for each core concept.}

Smart grid is one of the key component for enabling smart cities and obviously, any city with more smart amenities will ultimately attract visitors to come and visit rich heritage. In smart grid, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCDA) system is responsible for keeping the underlying communication secure between substations and corresponding control center. While communication between customers and substations needs more enhancements as the existing protocols do not meet the comprehensive security requirements of smart grid. Due to the complex nature of smart grid and diverse security requirements, designing a suitable authentication scheme is a challenging task. For delay sensitive networks like smart grid, an ideal authentication scheme should withstand against all known security attacks, involving lightweight operations with trivial computations. ECC provides same security level with much less key sizes as compared with other security techniques such as RSA, DSA and DH. Keeping in mind the complex and delay sensitive nature of smart grid, a lightweight ECC based authentication scheme is proposed here. The proposed scheme not only provides mutual authentication with low computation and communication cost but also withstand against all known security attacks.}

In our approach we use data from two simple sensors, passive infrared sensor (PIR) which monitors presence and hall effect sensor which monitors whether the door is opened or closed. This installation is non-intrusive and quite simple because the sensor node to which sensors are connected is battery powered, and no additional work to ensure power supply needs to be performed.

With this goal in mind, this paper examines research related to AI as applied to the public sector. A review of the literature covering articles available in five research databases was completed using the PRISMA protocol for literature reviews. The search process yielded 59 articles within the scope of the study out of a total of 1682 studies. Results show a growing trend of interest in AI in the public sector, with India and the US as the most active countries. General public service, economic affairs, and environmental protection are the functions of government with the most studies related to AI. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) technique is the most recurrent in the investigated studies and was pointed out as a technique that provides positive results in several areas of its application. A research framework for AI solutions for the public sector is presented, where it is demonstrated that policies and ethical implications of the use of AI permeate all layers of application of this technology and the solutions can generate value for functions of government. However, for this, a prior debate with society about the use of AI in the public sector is recommended.}

These advances hold out the promise of allowing the automatic detection of the critical aspects (mode of transport, purpose, etc.) of people’s trips. Until now, efforts have concentrated on one aspect of trips (e.g. mode) at a time. Such methods have typically been developed on small data sets, often with data collected by researchers themselves and not in large-scale real-world data collection initiatives. This research develops a machine learning-based framework to identify complete trip information based on smartphone location data as well as online data from GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) and Foursquare data. The framework has the potential to be integrated with smartphone travel surveys to produce all trip characteristics traditionally collected through household travel surveys. We use data from a recent, large-scale smartphone travel survey in Montréal, Canada. The collected smartphone data, augmented with GTFS and Foursquare data are used to train and validate three random forest models to predict mode of transport, transit itinerary as well as trip purpose (activity). According to cross-validation analysis, the random forest models show prediction accuracies of 87%, 81% and 71% for mode, transit itinerary and activity, respectively. The results compare favorably with previous studies, especially when taking the large, real-world nature of the dataset into account. Furthermore, the cross validation results show that the machine learning-based framework is an effective and automated tool to support trip information extraction for large-scale smartphone travel surveys, which have the potential to be a reliable and efficient (in terms of cost and human resources) data collection technique.}

The insecure nature of the Internet and wireless sensor networks, that are the main components of IoT, make IoT vulnerable to different attacks, especially routing attacks (as insider attacks). A novel real-time hybrid intrusion detection framework is proposed in this study that consists of anomaly-based and specification-based intrusion detection modules for detecting two well-known routing attacks in IoT called sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks. For this purpose, the specification-based intrusion detection agents, that are located in the router nodes, analyze the behavior of their host nodes and send their local results to the root node through normal data packets. In addition, an anomaly-based intrusion detection agent, that is located in the root node, employs the unsupervised optimum-path forest algorithm for projecting clustering models by using incoming data packets. This agent, which is based on the MapReduce architecture, can work in a distributed platform for projecting clustering models and consequently parallel detecting of anomalies as a global detection approach. The proposed method makes decision about suspicious behavior by using a voting mechanism. Notably, the proposed method is also extended to detect wormhole attack. The deployment of the hybrid proposed model is investigated in a smart-city scenario by an existing platform, as well. The free network's scale and the ability to identify malicious nodes are two key features of the proposed framework that are evaluated through different experiments in this study. The experimental results of simulated scenarios showed that the proposed hybrid method can achieve true positive rate of 76.19% and false positive rate of 5.92% when both sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks were launched simultaneously. These rates in detecting wormhole attack are 96.02% and 2.08%, respectively.}

It may draw a penetrative path to mitigate the environmental effects that utilize the natural resource to manage the intelligent infrastructure and services. Moreover, the sustainable development process plays a crucial role to catalyze IoT and big-data application that connects the economic growth with the quality of smart cities. The IoT-enabled big-data applications choose a suitable thematic analysis to direct the use of recommendation systems. It supports users in the irresistible task of examination through large quantities of data in order to select appropriate information or items. Traditional recommender systems rely on similar neighbors irrespective of their preferences/choices when computing the prediction and assuming the users to be autonomous and indistinguishable to disregard the social events between the social users which are highly not reliable. Based on this intuition in this framework, the architecture of community-based trust aware recommender systems (CB-TARS) is proposed. Users’ preferences are expressed by incorporating trusted neighbors within the community of the target user are merged in order to find similar preferences. In addition, the worth of merged ratings is measured by the confidence considering the number of ratings inside the community and the percentage of clashes between negative and positive views. Further, rating confidence is incorporated into the computation of user similarity. The prediction for an unrated item is computed by aggregating the ratings of similar users within the community. Experimental results on real-world data set validate that the proposed method surpasses other complements in terms of accuracy.}

This ability, in practice, can be represented by a single elaboration process integrated in the final user application, or by a middleware platform aimed at implementing different context processing and reasoning to support third-party applications. However, the lack of public datasets that take into account the complexity of the user context in the mobile environment strongly limits the advance of the research in this field. In this paper, we present MyDigitalFootprint, a novel large-scale dataset composed of smartphone embedded sensors data, physical proximity information, and Online Social Networks interactions aimed at supporting multimodal context-recognition and social relationships modeling. The dataset includes two months of measurements and information collected from the personal mobile devices of 31 volunteer users, in their natural environment, without limiting their usual behavior. Existing public datasets generally consist of a limited set of context data, aimed at optimizing specific application domains (human activity recognition is the most common example). On the contrary, our dataset contains a comprehensive set of information describing the user context in the mobile environment. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed dataset, we present three context-aware applications based on different machine learning tasks: (i) a social link prediction algorithm based on physical proximity data, (ii) the recognition of daily-life activities based on smartphone-embedded sensors data, and (iii) a pervasive context-aware recommender system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale dataset containing such heterogeneity of information, representing an invaluable source of data to validate new research in mobile and edge computing.}

This paper modified the technology acceptance model to find out factors influencing customers' intention to use AV such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, and facilitating condition, and the moderating effects of demographic variables (gender, age, family size, income, education level, and marital status) on the relationship between predictors and intention to use AV. Online questionnaires were distributed to 318 participants in South Korea and the data was analyzed through multiple regression and integration moderation test. The findings show that social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived usefulness are three important variables of AV usage intention. In addition, demographic variables (age, marital status, family size, and educational level) can moderate effect of PU and SI on intention to use AV. Strategic directions are suggested to managers to increase the possibility of customers’ acceptance of AV.}

Many of these boards may be linked together, to create small, low-cost clusters that replicate some features of large data center clusters. The Raspberry Pi Foundation produces a series of SBCs with a price/performance ratio that makes SBC clusters viable, perhaps even expendable. These clusters are an enabler for Edge/Fog Compute, where processing is pushed out towards data sources, reducing bandwidth requirements and decentralizing the architecture. In this paper we investigate use cases driving the growth of SBC clusters, we examine the trends in future hardware developments, and discuss the potential of SBC clusters as a disruptive technology. Compared to traditional clusters, SBC clusters have a reduced footprint, are low-cost, and have low power requirements. This enables different models of deployment—particularly outside traditional data center environments. We discuss the applicability of existing software and management infrastructure to support exotic deployment scenarios and anticipate the next generation of SBC. We conclude that the SBC cluster is a new and distinct computational deployment paradigm, which is applicable to a wider range of scenarios than current clusters. It facilitates Internet of Things and Smart City systems and is potentially a game changer in pushing application logic out towards the network edge.}

abstract = {The increasing popularity and widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies have produced a significant need for the integration of cloud and edge computing with distributed detection solutions to handle the growing volume of distributed security threats. While deep learning-based approaches have been used to detect anomalous behaviors in complex data patterns, the heterogeneity in IoT networks still poses paramount challenges to update synchronization across learning nodes in distributed training. Particularly, the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data patterns over remote nodes significantly affect the performance of model training provisioned on cloud and edge computing servers, and most existing works have assumed a homogeneous setting. The heterogeneity brings the gradient delay problem, causing the gradient inconsistency in the barrier-free asynchronous mode. In this paper, we propose a Delay Compensated Adam (DC-Adam) approach, an asynchronous federated learning-based detection approach, for IoT devices with limited resources. To overcome the notorious gradient delay problem, we develop a Taylor Expansion-based scheme to compensate for the inconsistency caused by asynchronous communication. Moreover, a pre-shared data training strategy for non-IID data is developed to avoid the convergence divergence under the non-IID patterns. After the collaborative model training procedure, we append an additional local training process at each client to fit respective patterns. Via a combination of theoretical analysis of convergence and practical experimental results, we validate the efficacy of our proposed approach compared to the other state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with benchmark approaches, we demonstrate that our proposed method can converge stably, and that it outperforms the barrier-free asynchronous federated learning by 12.8% (accuracy), 14% (precision). 8.71% (recall), and 11.16% (F1 score) on average.}

To this end, GPS-less vehicle localization in a public transportation network by vehicular crowd-sensing and machine intelligence is considered as a potential use case. Our proposed architecture aims to mimic the functionality of GPS through built-in sensors in smart devices (e.g. smartphones and tablets). Sensor readings acquired from the participants recruited by the platform are fed into an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, the performance of which is a function of the trustworthiness of participants and reliability of sensor readings acquired through participants. Therefore, we study the impact of reliability-aware participant recruitment policies over a reliability-unaware participant recruitment policy. We devised two reliability-aware recruitment policies: Reliability-driven naive recruitment (RDNR) and Reliability-driven exclusive recruitment (RDER) and both of them assess the trustworthiness of individual participants and eliminates the sensor readings if their reliability is under a threshold. On the other hand, our reliability-unaware recruitment policy, Non-restricted recruitment (NRR), accepts all sensor readings from the participants. Our simulation results lead to approximately 98% accuracy for GPS-less localization of public transportation vehicles with RDER policy when compared to the NRR policy, which yields approximately 93% accuracy. Furthermore, sustainability study of our framework shows that participant comfort can be ensured by reducing the battery drain of GPS sensor by 38%–46%.}

Recently, automatic methods are presented to assist the annotation process of vertebral landmarks. However, previous methods expect a fixed number of landmark outputs regardless of the occlusion and diversity in the X-ray images, which may result in inaccurate predictions in practical cases. The use of dense layers and fractional numbers with respect to image dimensions as landmark outputs also limited the accuracy of the prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on fully convolutional architecture and non-directional part affinity fields to label arbitrary number of vertebral landmarks and keep track of the connection relations between them to compute the Cobb angles. Comparing with conventional methods which predict each landmark by dense layers directly, our method use image segmentation to predict the landmarks and their connection relationships with seven heatmap channels: four for corner landmarks and two for vertical center landmarks of each vertebra, and one for non-directional part affinity fields to express the pairing relations between left and right center landmarks. This design allows arbitrary number of landmarks as output, and reduces the impact of occluded landmark and malformed vertebrae on Cobb angles prediction. To evaluate our methods, mean squared error for landmarks and absolute percentage error for Cobb angles are tested. The results show that our method outperforms other methods on both metrics.}

In such a heterogeneous environment, new applications arise to meet ever-increasing needs and these are an important challenge to the processing capabilities of devices. For example, automatic driving systems, manufacturing environments, smart city management, etc. To meet the requirements of said application contexts, the system can create computing processes to distribute the workload over the network and/or a cloud computing server. Multiple options arise in relation to what network nodes should support the execution of the processes. This paper focuses on this problem by introducing a distributed computational model to dynamically share these tasks among the computing nodes and considering the inherent variability of the context in these environments. Our novel approach promotes the integration of the computing resources, with externally supplied cloud services, to fulfill modern application requirements. A prototype implementation for the proposed model has been built and an application example has been designed to validate the proposal in a real working environment.}

Specifically, the aim is to understand whether this branch of computer science can influence production and consumption patterns to achieve sustainable resource management according to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the UN 2030 Agenda. Moreover, the paper aims to highlight the role of Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) in the cultural drift toward the spread of AI for SBMs. Despite the importance of the topic, there is no comprehensive review of the AI and SBM literature in light of SDGs. Based on a database containing 73 publications in English with publication dates from 1990 to 2019, a bibliometric analysis is conducted. The findings show that the innovation challenge involves ethical, social, economic, and legal aspects. Thus, considering that the development potential of AI is linked to the UN 2030 Agenda for SD, especially to SDG#12, our results also outline the framework of the existing literature on AI and SDGs, especially SDG#12, including AI’s association with the cultural drift (CD) in the SBMs. The paper highlights the key contributions, which are: i) a comprehensive review of the key underlying relationship between AI and SBMs, offering a holistic view as needed, ii) identifying a research gap regarding KMS through AI, and iii) the implications of AI concerning SDG#12. Academic and managerial implications are also discussed regarding KMS in the SBMs, where the AI can represent the vehicle to meet the SDGs allowing for the identification of the cultural change required by enterprises to achieve sustainable goals. Thus, business companies, academic research practitioners, and state policy should focus on the further development of the use of AI in SBMs.}

The GPS information of vehicles, especially taxis, in a city gives reliable information about the traffic pattern of a city. With the help of this information smart models can be created to use when making routing decisions. In this paper, a smart geocasting protocol, GeoAKOM, is introduced and implemented by using the GPS data of taxis in Bursa city, Turkey. In GeoAKOM, the mobility pattern of city is analized in two levels as in GeoMobCon introduced earlier. In the macroscopic level analysis, the city is segmented into clusters using k-means clustering and optimal paths for a message is generated using these clusters. In the microscopic level, mobility based likelihood value is used to make routing decision. The message is transmitted if the encountered vehicle has a larger mobility based likelihood or contact history based likelihood value than the carrying vehicle as in GeoMobCon. Moreover, in GeoAKOM, the next cluster of a vehicle is predicted with the help of all k-order Markov model (AKOM) by using GPS records of all vehicles. Mobility based likelihood calculations are performed by using this prediction. With these features, GeoAKOM provides a robust solution for the vehicles which do not have large GPS record history and which are relatively new in the system. Simulations on real world taxi GPS data are compared for various number of clusters in terms of delivery ratio, average delay, and hop count by using the ONE simulator. Simulation results show that, GeoAKOM provides promising results when compared with GeoMobCon and the First Contact routing algorithms.}

The primary objective of this work is to address the way the latency in location data acquisition, referred to also as timeliness, can be dealt with. We propose a hybrid method combining machine learning models such as multilayer perceptrons trained in batch mode and online learning methods to perform short-term prediction of vehicle delay data. In this way, stream instances that have not arrived yet from the sensors can be temporarily replaced with predicted values. The method we propose successfully integrates stream mining methods developed for stationary and non-stationary conditions i.e. also the methods developed for concept drifting data streams. For all examined reference data sets and hybridised stream methods, the method reduced prediction error and addressed the risk of using static prediction models not matching or no longer matching the evolving process for which the prediction is performed.}

However, it is challenging to simultaneously achieve accurate and fine-grained recognition of UVs from remote sensing images in high-density cities, due to the problem of low discrimination of remote sensing features showed in UVs. To address this issue, in this paper, we have proposed a hierarchical recognition framework which can integrate remote and social sensing data to recognize fine-grained UVs. The hierarchical framework follows the human cognition processes and has explicit geographical meaning for each step, which ensures its interpretability. Besides, remote and social sensing data can be fused easily in this framework so that the abstract concept of UV can be sufficiently characterized in both coarse and fine scales. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive experiments in Shenzhen, a typical high-density megacity in China with complicated UVs, have been conducted and a fine-grained map with spatial resolution of 2.5 m was obtained. The results show that the proposed approach achieved an impressive performance, with overall accuracy and Kappa of 96.23% and 0.920 respectively. Furthermore, comparative assessments and ablation studies were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical recognition framework as well as the fusion of remote and social sensing data.}

abstract = {Clamping quality is one of the main factors that will affect the deformation of thin-walled parts during their processing, which can then directly affect parts’ performance. However, traditional clamping force settings are based on manual experience, which is a random and inaccurate manner. In addition, dynamic clamping force adjustment according to clamping deformation is rarely considered in clamping force control process, which easily causes large clamping deformation and low machining accuracy. To address these issues, this study proposes a digital twin-driven clamping force control approach to improve the machining accuracy of thin-walled parts. The total factor information model of clamping system is built to integrate the dynamic information of the clamping process. The virtual space model is constructed based on finite element simulation and deep neural network algorithm. To ensure bidirectional mapping of physical-virtual space, the workflow of clamping force control and interoperability method between digital twin models are elaborated. Finally, a case study is used to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.}

Despite extensive research efforts laid on the task for decades from the perspective of prediction models, this paper explores boost the prediction performance with model-independent, low-dispersion clusters. The intuition is that appropriately splitting training data could lower the prediction uncertainty, resulting in better accuracy. In the proposed multi-horizon time series prediction framework (TSP-LDC), autoencoders generate contextual embeddings that capture variables’ nonlinearity and temporal dynamics. A discriminative clustering process on the contextual embeddings produces homogeneous clusters, intending to bring better performance of prediction models. Each cluster has a corresponding prediction model responsible for making inferences for subsequences belonging to that cluster, where the discriminative probabilities of the subsequence indicate its membership. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSP-LDC improves the performance of popular approaches of time series prediction on various datasets, proving the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.}

The present study proposes a comprehensive assessment method that incorporates both conventional data, such as individual socio-demographic information and loan application information, and data for the applicant's dynamic transaction behavior. Our method is based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which extracts features from a person's transaction behavior history. Five real-world datasets from two large commercial banks in China are used to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The experimental results show that our method remarkably improves the prediction performance by using the most commonly used model evaluation criteria.}

Though the spread of carsharing may bring significative benefits to (smart) cities, its penetration can be obstructed by non-up-to-date regulations, which can be still tied to a non-smart vision of mobility. In this study, we provide an overview of remarkable city regulations for carsharing, particularly highlighting the importance that parking policies can have in favouring the diffusion and use of carsharing services. Given such importance, we characterize the optimization problem of a local government that wants to analytically choose the best subset of parking slots to rent to carsharing companies, in order to improve urban mobility. To model and solve the problem we propose a new Binary Linear Programming problem and genetic-based matheuristic. Finally, we present results from computational tests referring to realistic data of the Italian city of Rome, showing that our optimization approach can return a fair territorial distribution of the parking slots, satisfying various families of constraints limiting the distribution.}

Indeed, the amount of data to process, to transfer by network and to treat in the cloud have call into question classical data storage and processing architectures. Also, the large amount of data generated at the edge has increased the speed of data transportation that is becoming the bottleneck for the cloud-based computing paradigms.

To keep up with the high volume of daily produced data, these applications need to dynamically scale their execution on multiple computing nodes, so to process the incoming data flow in parallel. In this paper, we present a hierarchical distributed architecture for the autonomous control of elastic DSP applications. It consists of a two-layered hierarchical solution, where a centralized per-application component coordinates the run-time adaptation of subordinated distributed components, which, in turn, locally control the adaptation of single DSP operators. Thanks to its features, the proposed solution can efficiently run in large-scale Fog computing environments. Exploiting this framework, we design several distributed self-adaptation policies, including a popular threshold-based approach and two reinforcement learning solutions. We integrate the hierarchical architecture and the devised self-adaptation policies in Apache Storm, a popular open-source DSP framework. Relying on the DEBS 2015 Grand Challenge as a benchmark application, we show the benefits of the presented self-adaptation policies, and discuss the strengths of reinforcement learning based approaches, which autonomously learn from experience how to optimize the application performance.}

The SCIPS platform is designed to run different scenarios, such as examples in financial forecasting and business infrastructures, with an initial scenario developed in collaboration with industrial partners focusing on an electricity generation plant. Focus groups from these sources were conducted to identify design and developmental considerations for the platform. As an extension from the COFELET framework, we propose an intelligence scaffolding practice as a guidance mechanic taking the form of an agent within the scenario.

Mobile edge computing (MEC) is close to data source and users, so terminals can execute tasks at the edge of network. In this way, the heavy load on core network can be relieved and tasks can be executed effectively. However, the demands of users vary from each other and users move all the time. It is difficult for the existing way of service supply to meet demands of all users. Cognitive Agent (CA) is put forward in this paper to help users cache and execute tasks on MEC in advance. In detail, CA is used to build personalized model combined with users’ behavior data. At the same time, it uses Long short-term memory neural network to forecast the moving trajectory of terminal equipment and the service types to be requested, uses the prediction result to generate caching strategy, cache business and shorten the delay of task execution. Besides, to further reduce the stress on MEC, we propose the collaboration of computing, communicating and caching resource with neighboring users’ equipment. To verify the effectiveness of CA, we build a model that assesses the performance of the system. Finally, we design a simulation experiment to execute resource request and resource collaboration. The result of the experiments show that CA can improve the efficiency of communication network, relieve the stress on network and improve the quality of services to users.}

A common application of wearable devices is Human Activity Recognition (HAR), i.e., the ability of using the sensing capabilities of these devices to monitor and infer human activities. However, Animal Activity Recognition (AAR) has received significantly less attention, and most works on AAR are generally based on invasive specialized devices carried by or implanted on animals. Conversely, in this work we exploit the potential of portable and unobtrusive devices, namely smartwatches, for AAR and specifically for horse gaits recognition. This application finds natural use in horse riding, to improve the structure and balance of the horse work and training. We develop a framework that can be used in a fog computing system composed by a smartphone and a smartwatch for the recognition of horse gaits. The framework performs classification by means of a machine learning approach trained on ad-hoc features based on accelerometer data. The framework allows an offline and an online modes of operation. In the offline mode, the smartwatch is used to collect the accelerometer data and transfer it to the smartphone at the end of the riding session. The feature extraction and classification can be processed directly on the smartphone or offloaded to the cloud. Conversely, in the online mode, the smartwatch is responsible to collect and process the data, thus being able to provide real-time feedback to the rider. This modality also allows to reduce computation, storage, and energy burden on the smartwatch through an adaptive setting of the sampling frequency. We implement our approach on a system composed by a Fitbit Ionic smartwatch and a Samsung Galaxy S10. We use two horses to evaluate the performance, versus recently proposed AAR approaches. Results show that our framework achieves significantly higher classification accuracy. Furthermore, the online scheme enables flexible real-time feedback, at the expense of a small loss in the classification accuracy.}

The emergence and the rise of AMP necessitate a precise object-level understanding of the environment, which directly impacts the functioning like decision making, speed control, and direction of the autonomous driving vehicles. Obstacle detection and object classification are the key issues in the AMP. The autonomous vehicle is designed to move in the city roads and it should be bolstered with high-quality object detection/segmentation mechanisms since inaccurate movements and speed limits can prove to be fatal. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, in this paper, we present ϑinspect (velocity-inspect), an AI-based 5G enabled object segmentation and speed limit identification scheme for self-driving cars on the city roads. In ϑinspect, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based semantic image segmentation is carried out to segment the objects as interpreted from the Cityscapes dataset. Then, object clustering is done using the K-Means approach based on the number of unique objects. The semantic segmentation is done over 12 classes and the model outshines concerning state-of-the-art approaches for various parameters like latency, high accuracy of 82.2%, and others. Further, K-Means clustering based Speed Range Analyser (SRA) is proposed to determine the acceptable and safe speed range for the vehicle, which is computed based on the object density of every object in the environment. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms compared to traditional schemes in terms of latency and accuracy.}

Within the social web, social media encompasses deep emotional expressions that reflect a multitude of personalities and behaviors. Existing research in this space is heavily focused on supervised sentiment analysis and emotion detection, with limited work on modeling these deep emotions, mixed emotions and variations of emotional behaviors from unlabeled and unstructured social media conversations. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework based on the principles of self-structuring artificial intelligence for emotion modeling and analysis that systematically integrates the modeling capabilities at a granular level on unstructured, unlabeled social media data. The research contributions of this framework are the detection, analysis and synthesis of deep emotion intensity, emotion transitions, emotion latent representations, and profile-based emotion classification. The self-structuring artificial intelligence framework amalgamates an ensemble of novel algorithms to eventuate these contributions. These algorithms extend the current state-of-the-art of natural language processing techniques, word embedding, Markov chains and growing self-organizing maps, specifically for deep emotions modeling and analysis. The framework is empirically evaluated on anonymized conversations from online mental health support forums. The outcomes identify profile-based emotion characteristics, emotion intensities, transitions and an overall latent representation across three distinct mental health groups in these forums. These outcomes are comprehensive in comparison to existing work which singularly focuses on sentiment analysis or emotion detection. The validity and effectiveness of its application on a real-world social media setting further establish the methodological novelty of this ensemble of self-structuring artificial intelligence for deep emotions.}

abstract = {Cities can be observed through a broad set of sensing technologies, spanning from physical sensors in the streets, to socio-economic reports, to other kinds of sources that are able to represent the behaviour of the citizens and visitors, such as mobile phone records, social media posts, and other digital traces. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for putting at use this variety of Big Data sources, with a unified approach that applies spatial and temporal analysis over heterogeneous streams of data. We define spatial analysis based on conceptual grids (made of cells) over the city space, and then we study: the time series of signals both at grid and cell level; the correlation across signals and across cells; the prediction of city dynamics based on multiple signals; and the identifications of anomalies based on the difference between the observed dynamics and their prediction. To implement this model we propose a general architectural framework that uses Big Data technologies (such as HDFS, YARN, HIVE, PIG, Cascalog, Spark, Spark SQL, Spark Streaming and SparkR) and can be deployed in different configurations based on different needs. By taking an inherent data science approach to the problem we are able to address at scale: technical problems such as heterogeneous time and space granularity of the data, as well as appropriate interpretation of the results through tools that enable intuitive and immediate visual perception of emerging patterns and dynamics. We demonstrate feasibility, generality and effectiveness of our Urban Data Science at scale approach through multiple use cases and examples taken from real-world requirements collected in various cities and accounting for diverse business and city needs.}

As a significant type of multimedia data, images are being processed frequently using such technique. It is worth noting that finding neighbors is an integral part of graph embedding algorithms in dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we present an effective and efficient metric function, named local similarity preserving (LSP), which can preserve the similarity information of each sample to its homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors. The proposed LSP function is helpful to enhance the discriminative capability of subsequent feature extractors. Based on LSP function, we also propose two novel algorithms, local similarity preserving discriminant (LSPD) algorithm, which can preserve the local similarity information and LSPD+ algorithm, which can preserve the local similarity and geometric structure information, respectively. The experimental results on digit visualization and face recognition demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.}

For these reasons, imputation approaches have been used to avoid information loss due to downsampling or sensor malfunction. This paper introduces an imputation approach for IAQ data via variational autoencoders (VAE) coupled with convolutional layers (VAE-CNN). Two scenarios were introduced: first, the IAQ dataset was corrupted by removing data intervals at different missing rates (i.e., 20%, 50%, and 80%), and second, a point-to-point removal of three sensors was conducted. The performance of the proposed method was compared with different techniques, showing that the VAE-CNN was superior to other methods even for massive amounts of missing data. Finally, the effects of missing and imputed data on the IAQ system in the D-subway station were evaluated in terms of ventilation energy demand, CO2 emissions, and IAQ level. The IAQ management with the imputed data could decrease by approximately 20% of CO2 emissions by reducing the energy demand, while the IAQ level increased by 3% in another scenario.}

The model of the system is created by means of a neural network autoregressive model with an exogenous input, whilst the model error is identified using a linear autoregressive model with an exogenous input. The maximal performance of the method is achieved through an evolutionary optimization of the behavioural (relevant) parameters of the elementary blocks of the leak detection scheme.

Nevertheless, only recently researchers have started developing technical solutions for effective fusion of BSN data. To the best of our knowledge, the community is currently lacking a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques on multi-sensor fusion in the area of BSN. This survey discusses clear motivations and advantages of multi-sensor data fusion and particularly focuses on physical activity recognition, aiming at providing a systematic categorization and common comparison framework of the literature, by identifying distinctive properties and parameters affecting data fusion design choices at different levels (data, feature, and decision).

abstract = {In the densely populated Internet of Things (IoT) applications, sensing range of the nodes might overlap frequently. In these applications, the nodes gather highly correlated and redundant data in their vicinity. Processing these data depletes the energy of nodes and their upstream transmission towards remote datacentres, in the fog infrastructure, may result in an unbalanced load at the network gateways and edge servers. Due to heterogeneity of edge servers, few of them might be overwhelmed while others may remain less-utilized. As a result, time-critical and delay-sensitive applications may experience excessive delays, packet loss, and degradation in their Quality of Service (QoS). To ensure QoS of IoT applications, in this paper, we eliminate correlation in the gathered data via a lightweight data fusion approach. The buffer of each node is partitioned into strata that broadcast only non-correlated data to edge servers via the network gateways. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic service migration technique to reconfigure the load across various edge servers. We assume this as an optimization problem and use two meta-heuristic algorithms, along with a migration approach, to maintain an optimal Gateway-Edge configuration in the network. These algorithms monitor the load at each server, and once it surpasses a threshold value (which is dynamically computed with a simple machine learning method), an exhaustive search is performed for an optimal and balanced periodic reconfiguration. The experimental results of our approach justify its efficiency for large-scale and densely populated IoT applications.}

This study showed that growth of Brassica chinensis under different wavelengths of light source has influenced plant growth performance and phytochemicals characteristics. Four different light treatments were experimented using pulse treatment (1 h light and 1 h dark), continuous light (CL), high intensity and artificial light control of 12 h light and 12 h dark. Data such as the leaves count, height, dry weight and chlorophyll a & b of plants were analyzed. The results showed high mean value of plants’ fresh weight (FW) of 410.77 g under pulse treatment compared to other light treatments. The percentage of moisture content (MC) was recorded higher on average under normal light (99.15%), value of leaf area (LA) was recorded higher under artificial sunlight with an average value of 976.84 cm2. Even though the results of LA were better under artificial sunlight, CL with low intensity gave higher stem height (SH) and number of leaves (NOL). In order to capture real-time data and monitor the environmental parameters of the plant experiment, an intelligent embedded system was developed to automate the LED control and manipulation. The results showed that the system is stable and has significant referential in the area of plant factory or indoor farming.}

Therefore we propose and demonstrate a hierarchical model that selectively combines topics at varying levels of generality.

Each topic and branch are examined individually through a detailed examination of terms and keywords. Representative works and authors in each of the branches are also identified. The method enables the examination of the complex structure of knowledge in a scientific journal in a succinct representation.

The identification of patients at high risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD via earlier close monitoring, targeted investigations, and appropriate management is crucial. Recently, several machine learning (ML) algorithms have been used for AD progression detection. Most of these studies only utilized neuroimaging data from baseline visits. However, AD is a complex chronic disease, and usually, a medical expert will analyze the patient’s whole history when making a progression diagnosis. Furthermore, neuroimaging data are always either limited or not available, especially in developing countries, due to their cost. In this paper, we compare the performance of five widely used ML algorithms, namely, the support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and decision tree to predict AD progression with a prediction horizon of 2.5 years. We use 1029 subjects from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database. In contrast to previous literature, our models are optimized using a collection of cost-effective time-series features including patient’s comorbidities, cognitive scores, medication history, and demographics. Medication and comorbidity text data are semantically prepared. Drug terms are collected and cleaned before encoding using the therapeutic chemical classification (ATC) ontology, and then semantically aggregated to the appropriate level of granularity using ATC to ensure a less sparse dataset. Our experiments assert that the early fusion of comorbidity and medication features with other features reveals significant predictive power with all models. The random forest model achieves the most accurate performance compared to other models. This study is the first of its kind to investigate the role of such multimodal time-series data on AD prediction.}

The proposed framework uses a ten-state Markov chain to generate stochastic solar irradiation as well as a forecast correction method based on recursive least-squares updated every hours in order to efficiently take part in hour-ahead power bidding process. Numerical results highlight benefits obtained by combining proposed forecast correction method and storage in a practical example of Saint-Nazaire, a city located in peninsula of Guérande, France. Besides, a sensitivity analysis regarding impact of storage size and aggregator penalty on operation cost and commitment indices is investigated. Obtained results demonstrates better accuracy in delivering power to the grid and will lead residential microgrids dealing with strong climatic variations to decrease their operation cost and increase power balance for all grid stakeholders.}

abstract = {With the development of wireless communications, Mobile Networks have become an important part of our daily life and fueled the growth of many attractive technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things (IoT) and even Smart City. As a main bearer of current Mobile Networks, LTE/LTE-A carries massive and important business data but is facing more and more serious attack situations, which makes the Security Measurement over it become necessary and important. However, current methods are usually designed from specific malicious detections, which cannot provide the user with a synthetic view of security evaluation. Meanwhile, as the massive amount and poor quality of networking data are considered, the efficiency and accuracy of the current security measurement methods are usually not good. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation basis (the collecting data) of security measurement over LTE/LTE-A networks, and propose an Adaptive Security Data Collection and Composition Recognition (ASDCCR) method for it. We design heuristic algorithms and processing framework in ASDCCR to make the data collection adaptive and synthetic attack recognition become possible. We also verified the proposed method in simulated LTE environment of NS3 to verify the usability and accuracy of the proposed methods.}

This study investigated the spatial distributions of PM2.5 concentration due to road traffic emissions and put forward a spatial distribution model for the estimation of PM2.5 concentration (SDC) based on Machine Learning. Meanwhile, based on the SDC model, the decrease in life expectancy (DLE) of residents was assessed. On-site monitoring of PM2.5 concentration was conducted on different floors of a typical residential building situated by the roadside. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was conducted for the spatial distribution analysis of PM2.5 concentration, which was verified by measurements. The findings show the PM2.5 concentration decreased from 74μg/m3 to 43μg/m3 within 0 to 120 m distance from the road, and decreased from 73 μg/m3 to 42 μg/m3 within 0 to 60 m height; these locations had a maximum DLE of 5.11 years. The concentration of PM2.5 was stabilized within 40 to 45μg/m3 when the height was above 60 m (roughly the 17th floor from the ground) and the distance was 120 m away from the road. The DLE in these locations was stabilized within 0.62 years to 0.91 years. The SDC model was established to efficiently predict the DLE of residents and PM2.5 concentration along roadside. These findings would facilitate the development of precaution guidelines for urban pollution as well as the future planning of urban health and safety buildings.}

An environmental sound classification(ESC) dataset was collected from a multi-storey hospital, and an automated ESC model is presented.

The problem is seriously ill-conditioned and many existing algorithms based on kernel estimation require heuristic parameter adjustments and high computational cost, and cannot perform well on non-uniform motion blurs. To address this issue, image deblurring is viewed as an image translation problem in this paper. The authors solve it based on a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN), where the sharp image is restored by an end-to-end trainable neural network. Different from the generative network in basic conditional GAN, the proposed generator is based on dense blocks and residual network (DenseResNet), aiming to mitigate the problems of overfitting and vanishing gradient, and strengthen the blur feature propagation. To generate clear structure, the basic conditional GAN formulation is further revised by introducing joint VGG features and L1-based gradient loss. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.}

Dealing with uncertainties requires adopting appropriate methods, which then allow for making the right decisions and carrying out the right actions based on imperfect information. However, CPS design is difficult and requires attention to many variables during the design process. For instance, choosing and incorporating methods for dealing with uncertainties into CPS design requires identifying the kinds of uncertainties at hand as well as knowledge of suitable methods and their application. While inspiration can be found in other CPS designs, the details of dealing with uncertainties in other CPSs can be confounded by domain-specific terminology, context, and requirements. To make this aspect of CPS design less daunting, we aim at providing an overview of approaches dealing with uncertainties in the design of CPS targeting collective behavior. To this end, we present a systematic review of relevant scientific projects with industrial leadership and synthesis of relations between system features, the kinds of uncertainties, and methods used to deal with them. The results provide an overview of uncertainties and challenges across different domains, and reason about a guide for designing uncertainty-aware self-adaptive components in CPS.}

To eliminate the redundancy of the traffic video, the magnitude of motion detection based on spatio-temporal interest points (STIP) and the multi-modal linear features combination are presented which splits a video into super frame segments of interests. After that, we select the key frames from these interesting segments of the long videos with the design and detection of the prominent region.

Unfortunately, the IoT devices have limited resources to handle the performance of big data feature learning with machine learning techniques. IoT devices often compromise the privacy of users and make them vulnerable to numerous cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving authentication protocol based on blockchain technology and the secret computational model of physically unclonable function (denoted by PUF model). The proposed protocol guarantees the users privacy with a decentralized smart contract blockchain with the PUF model. In practice, the proposed protocol guarantees that IoT devices and the miner are authenticated in a faster authentication process compared to current blockchain techniques. In addition, Blockchain and PUF combine to ensure data provenance and data transparency in IoT networks. Blockchain-based smart contracts provide decentralized digital ledgers that are able to withstand data tampering attacks. This ensures the security and privacy of outsourced big data in IoT environments. We also investigated the privacy implications of using IoT devices with various security analysis, and avenues for research to extenuate the privacy concerns in IoT environments.}

We have been witnessing the convergence of OT/IT networks, combined with massively distributed metering and control scenarios such as smart grids. Larger and geographically widespread attack surfaces, and inherently more data to analyse, will become the norm. Despite several advances in recent years, domain-specific security tools have been facing the challenges of trying to catch up with all the existing security flaws from the past, while also accounting for the specific needs of the next-generation of IACS. Moreover, the aggregation of multiple techniques and sources of information into a comprehensive approach has not been explored in depth. Such a holistic perspective is paramount since it enables a global and enhanced analysis enabled by the usage, combination and aggregation of the outputs from multiple sources and techniques. This paper starts by providing a review of the more recent anomaly detection techniques for SCADA systems, focused on both theoretical machine learning approaches and complete frameworks. Afterwards, it proposes a complete framework for an Intrusion and Anomaly Detection System (IADS) composed of specific detection probes, an event processing layer and a core anomaly detection component, amongst others. Finally, the paper presents an evaluation of the framework within a large-scale hybrid testbed, and a comparison of different anomaly detection scenarios based on various machine learning techniques.}

There is an urgent need for research on the disease’s origins and spread. The Internet of Things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence all provide real-time processing for a variety of applications in the healthcare sector.

To identify thyroid patients, a novel ensemble-based classifier is proposed. The thyroid dataset is obtained from the UCI library and the simulation is carried out utilizing Python programming. To increase the framework’s security, encryption and decryption methods are suggested. The suggested framework’s performance is assessed in terms of latency, network use, RAM utilization, and energy consumption. On the other side, the suggested classifier’s accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and F1 score are all assessed. The result demonstrates that the suggested framework and classifier perform consistently better than conventional frameworks and classifiers.}

In this work, we use the position and orientation of the ground camera image to synthesize a corresponding rendered image from the outdoor large-scale 3D image-based point cloud. To achieve the virtual-real registration, we indirectly establish the spatial relationship between 2D and 3D space by matching the above two kinds (2D/3D space) of cross-domain images. However, matching cross-domain images goes beyond the capability of handcrafted descriptors and existing deep neural networks. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end network, Y-Net, to learn Domain Robust Feature Representations (DRFRs) for the cross-domain images. Besides, we introduce a cross-domain-constrained loss function that balances the loss in image content and cross-domain consistency of the feature representations. Experimental results show that the DRFRs simultaneously preserve the representation of image content and suppress the influence of independent domains. Furthermore, Y-Net outperforms the existing algorithms on extracting feature representations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain image retrieval. Finally, we validate the Y-Net-based registration approach on campus to demonstrate its possible applicability.}

Six urban morphology variables (e.g. BDG, PAVE, WALL, HBDG, SVF, GnPR) were extracted from geographical information system (GIS) maps, three dimensional (3D) model and field surveys. This study compares the predictive power between ordinary least squares linear regression (LR) and machine learning (e.g. random forest (RF)). By using RF as a regression model, the air temperature has a greater RMSE reduction than LR, ranging from 10 % to 33 %. The relationship between outdoor air temperature and urban morphology variables based on non-parametric regression is presented. On average, lower SVF space can reduce the heat on campus. As the WALL increases, the temperature rises, but the changes in day and night are different. Greenery reduces daytime temperature due to the shading of solar radiation, although the shading from trees blocks the release of long-wave radiation from artificial materials at night. The observation indicates nighttime temperature can be reduced by planting low height greenery while keeping SVF unchanged.}

Its accurate detection retains as an open problem, mainly due to the difficulties of low-resolution and arbitrary viewing angles, as well as the limitation of collecting sufficient amount of training samples. Such difficulties have been significantly challenged the design of effective handcraft features as well as robust detectors. In this paper, we tackle these problems by proposing a learn-based feature design and classifier training paradigm. More particularly, a modified LeNet, termed MLeNet, is presented, which modifies the number of units in output layer of LeNet to suit for a specific classification. Meanwhile, MLeNet further increases the number of feature maps with smaller filter size. To further reduce overfitting and improve the performance with a small quantity of training samples, we firstly increase the training dataset by horizontal reflection and then learn MLeNet via combining both pre-training and fine-tuning. We evaluate the proposed model on a real-world masked face detection dataset. Quantitative evaluations over several state-of-the-arts and alternative solution have demonstrated the accuracy and robustness of the proposed model.}

A three current sensor setting with Fourier-MLP is the most suitable approach, achieving 81.20% of accuracy, 0% of false positive rate (FPR) and 0.08% of false negative rate (FNR), also detecting generator’s normal conditions 100% of the time. For a single sensor configuration, current sensor is the most suitable method for detecting fault or non-fault conditions, being 16 times more robust to false negatives than using an axial flux sensor. Comparing the processing time, the system embedded in a NVIDIA Xavier predicts a fault condition 37% faster than in a Raspberry Pi 3, with Fourier-MLP and using a single current sensor, thus being the most suitable configuration in fault detection.}

abstract = {With the development of industry and technology, the development of the environment and cities has drawn lots of attention. Time series prediction plays a vital role in protecting the environment and improving the level of intelligence and technology in cities, for example prediction of air pollution, water levels, palm oil prices, financial data and grid security. We describe a new algorithm, “Error-output Recurrent Two-layer Extreme Learning Machine” or ERT-ELM: it applied a new recurrent technique, that not only removed the restriction of the prediction horizon problem, but it also used a mean squared error of the current step to update the output weights for the next step. This technique avoided error accumulation in the original recurrent algorithm for multi-step time series prediction. Moreover, the new two-layer structure network improved forecasting compared to conventional single-layer or two-layer ELM models. Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization was used to find suitable ERT-ELM parameters. The ability of our model was assessed on ten data sets—two artificial and eight real-world data sets and performed significantly better than the baselines. Especially for the synthetic data sets, in 1–18 prediction periods, our model achieved mean square errors of 2.64 ×10−3 on the Mackey-Glass data set and 1.49 × 10−4 on the Lorenz data sets.}
