abstract = {With the improvement of information development level, the development speed of big data is also very fast, more and more fields are using big data to manage. Different departments and enterprises get more information from data, and big data is used more and more frequently. However, it is more and more contradictory to the demand for big data that the traditional data technology platform and system can not meet the increasing demand of big data. These traditional data systems and data platforms usually have the disadvantages of slow response, small data memory and certain uncertainty of recorded content. Therefore, big data is developed and studied to increase the volume and accuracy of data systems and platforms. This paper studies the development and utilization of big data by analyzing neural network. The main purpose is to make the big data system and platform more perfect. Some technical requirements and program requirements in big data also gradually adapt to the consistency of data platform and data system. The improvement of people's living standard also promotes the rapid development of tourism. The inclusion of tourism in the Internet of things has become a new technological requirement. Intelligent tourism has been recognized and used by more and more people. Because the Internet of things has a very powerful amount of information, more and more people, especially young people, prefer to travel intelligently through the Internet of things. This paper points out that tourists choose to use machine classification through the Internet of things. This classification can help tourists make better choices. The accuracy of this method is verified by experiments.}

For example, mining micro-blogs content to unveil latent information about people sentiment and opinions is drawing more and more attention, since it can improve the understanding of complex phenomena and paves the way to the development of new innovative and intelligent services. In this paper we present CrowdPulse, a domain-agnostic framework for text analytics of social streams. The framework extracts textual data from social networks and implements algorithms for semantic processing, sentiment analysis and classification of gathered data. The framework has been deployed in two real-world scenarios in order to identify the most at-risk areas of the Italian territory according to the content posted on social networks and to monitor the recovering state of the social capital of L׳Aquila׳s city after the dreadful earthquake of April 200911http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_L'Aquila_earthquake, respectively. In both scenarios, the framework showed its effectiveness and confirmed the insight that the combination of technologies specifically designed for Big Data processing with state-of-the-art methodologies for semantic analysis of textual content can provide very interesting findings and permits the analysis of such phenomena in a totally new way.}

In order to deal with the accompanied massive databases, large numbers of Raman spectra require to be handled and identified in an effective and automatic manner. This paper proposes an algorithm of material auto-identification, which makes use of machine learning methods to analyze Raman spectra. Firstly, a universal method of spectral feature extraction is designed to automatically process Raman spectra after the background subtraction. Secondly, the extracted feature vectors are used to classify and identify target materials by Adaptive Hypergraph (AH), an efficient classifier in the field of machine learning, in a manner of automation with an accuracy rate of ~99%. Compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), two typical methods of classification, the AH classifier provides better performance free of tuning any parameter facing different targets. Thirdly, Cubic Spline Interpolation is introduced to enhance the universal of the proposed algorithm between different databases from different Raman spectrometers with variant vendors. The identification accuracy rate is up to 98% using the high frequency sampling spectra as the learning and the low frequency sampling ones as the testing, respectively.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence-enabled applications on edge devices have the potential to revolutionize disease detection and monitoring with smart health (sHealth) applications. The major challenges are user-friendly and flexible sensors for seamless collection of physiological data for long hours, online and on-device processing of sensitive medical data to facilitate privacy protection, reliable extraction of disease-related biomarkers, and implementation of lightweight artificially intelligent algorithms for inference at the edge without degrading the system performance. In this pilot project, we conducted a yearlong field study with 9 participants conducting 480 data collection sessions in the “living lab” environment. We used smartphones as the edge computing device and implemented pre-trained machine learning algorithms in the smartphone app for computing disease-related Events-of-Interest (EoI). We considered real-time data processing on the smartphone itself without sharing raw data with the cloud or any other computing facility to minimize privacy concerns, and network bandwidth requirements. We used a commercial smart band and a custom-designed zero-power inkjet-printed sensor for physiological sensing and capturing health biomarkers such as heart rate variability (HRV) and core body temperature. The extracted HRV feature values are within the 95% confidence interval of normative values. On top of that, the extracted HRV shows some informative trends i.e. hammock pattern for healthy subjects which may be helpful in subsequent research studies. Moreover, we used core body temperature with user-reported outcomes for estimating flu-related symptoms severity and visualizing the spatiotemporal trend in a cloud-server to facilitate personalized as well as community-wide health monitoring. Inference at the edge provided a data reduction of 3 order while the runtime latency, power consumption, memory requirement, and storage size of the smartphone app were 500 ms, 51.90 mAH, 9.4 MB, and 2.4 MB, respectively. Our developed framework of sHealth enables automated community-wide monitoring of symptoms severity in addition to personalized monitoring which paves the way for early monitoring of a disease outbreak for a smart and connected community.}

abstract = {The enabling technology of vehicular networks for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), smart cities and autonomous driving, offers promising on-board services such as road-safety, easy navigation, comfort driving and infotainment. These services can co-exist simultaneously in the system. One challenging issue is to provide the different quality of service (QoS) requirements adequate to each service. This may not be an easy task because of the constrained factors characterizing these networks (e.g., growing number of connected vehicular devices, wireless communications, etc.). In this paper, we investigate the radio resources allocation problem to match different QoS requirements in terms of data rate whilst reducing the interference ratio. We first proposed a radio allocation model that aims to maximize the data rate and minimize the transmission power for all users. However, since not all vehicles use services that require high data rates, it will be more efficient to consider different required data rate for each user. Hence, we develop an efficient model for transmission power allocation that aims to reduce the interference ratio while providing the data rate required by each user. The proposed model is based on Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) game where the users compete to acquire the radio resources. We proposed also two water-filling algorithms to solve the spectrum allocation game during Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication over multiple channels. The extensive simulations have shown that our model can satisfy the users regarding different.}

The information is extracted from geolocated tweets (n=1.48×106). Furthermore, this activity affects how people move in a city. The path a user follows is calculated using the geolocation of the tweets that he or she publishes along the day. Several models are evaluated and compared using the Hausdorf’s distance (dH). The combination of gravitational potential with attraction to the destination points provides the best results, with dH=1176 against the Manhattan (dH=1203) or the geodesic (dH=1417) alternatives. Finally, the analysis is repeated with the data segmented by gender (n=2,826 paths, men=1,910, women=916). The results validate (p=0.000334) the studies that affirm that men travel longer distances (dM=4.73 km, αM=26.1°) with rectilinear trajectories, whereas women have shorter and more angled paths (dW=4.5 km, αW=32.2°), obtaining p values in path lengths and p=0.006 in the angles.}

Meanwhile, the contrast energy and frequency domain information are regarded as auxiliary information to interpret the finger vein. The distance between the features of the registration image and the test image is used to recognize the finger vein image, so as to realize identity authentication.

Therefore, designing a smart data distribution and transmission mechanism can not only improve people's quality of life but also pave the way for reducing environmental pollution. Optical networks have been widely used in the core network due to high-capacity characteristics. However, in inter-data-center (Inter-DC) optical networks, the coexisted heterogeneous optical devices and multi-granularity network resources bring new challenges to network management and traffic scheduling. Recently, software-defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) have been introduced to enable the unified control for improving network agility and automation. Thus for software-defined multi-granularity Inter-DC optical networks, we propose a list of online service provisioning strategies. Moreover, in terms of the network controller, the novel routing applications are also developed by extended OpenFlow protocol. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the overall feasibility of proposed solutions in a semi-practical platform. Numerical simulations conducted to quantitatively evaluate the algorithm efficiency also verify the superiorities of improving spectrum efficiency and reducing service blocking probability.}

abstract = {The deep convolutional neural networks have achieved significant improvements in terms of effectiveness and efficiency for single image super-resolution. However, as the depth of neural network grows, the information flow is weakened. On the other hand, most of the models adopt a single-stream structure with which integrating complementary information under different receptive fields is difficult. To improve information flow and capture sufficient knowledge for reconstructing high-frequency details, we propose a multi-scale information cross-fusion network (MSICF) in which a sequence of subnetworks is cascaded to infer high resolution features in a coarse-to-fine manner. In each cascaded subnetwork, we stack multiple multi-scale cross (MSC) modules to fuse multi-scale complementary information in an efficient way as well as to improve information flow across the layers. Meanwhile, by introducing residual-feature learning in each stage, the relative information between features at different levels is fully utilized to further boost reconstruction performance. We train the proposed network with cascaded-supervision and then assemble the intermediate predictions of the cascade to achieve high quality image. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets illustrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art super-resolution methods.}

However, although great efforts have recently been made to identify misogyny, it is still difficult to distinguish as it can sometimes be very subtle and deep, signifying that the use of statistical approaches is not sufficient. Moreover, as Spanish is spoken worldwide, context and cultural differences can complicate this identification. Our contribution to the detection of misogyny in Spanish is two-fold. On the one hand, we apply Sentiment Analysis and Social Computing technologies for detecting misogynous messages in Twitter. On the other, we have compiled the Spanish MisoCorpus-2020, a balanced corpus regarding misogyny in Spanish, and classified it into three subsets concerning (1) violence towards relevant women, (2) messages harassing women in Spanish from Spain and Spanish from Latin America, and (3) general traits related to misogyny. Our proposal combines a classification based on average word embeddings and linguistic features in order to understand which linguistic phenomena principally contribute to the identification of misogyny. We have evaluated our proposal with three machine-learning classifiers, achieving the best accuracy of 85.175%. Finally the proposed approach is also validated with existing corpora for misogyny and aggressiveness detection such as AMI and HatEval obtaining good results}

abstract = {Background and Objective
Glaucoma, a worldwide eye disease, may cause irreversible vision damage. If not treated properly at an early stage, glaucoma eventually deteriorates into blindness. Various glaucoma screening methods, e.g. Ultrasound Biomicroscopy (UBM), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), and Heidelberg Retinal Scanner (HRT), are available. However, retinal fundus image photography examination, because of its low cost, is one of the most common solutions used to diagnose glaucoma. Clinically, the cup-to-disk ratio is an important indicator in glaucoma diagnosis. Therefore, precise fundus image segmentation to calculate the cup-to-disk ratio is the basis for screening glaucoma.
Methods
In this paper, we propose a deep neural network that uses anatomical knowledge to guide the segmentation of fundus images, which accurately segments the optic cup and the optic disc in a fundus image to accurately calculate the cup-to-disk ratio. Optic disc and optic cup segmentation are typical small target segmentation problems in biomedical images. We propose to use an attention-based cascade network to effectively accelerate the convergence of small target segmentation during training and accurately reserve detailed contours of small targets.
Results
Our method, which was validated in the MICCAI REFUGE fundus image segmentation competition, achieves 93.31% dice score in optic disc segmentation and 88.04% dice score in optic cup segmentation. Moreover, we win a high CDR evaluation score, which is useful for glaucoma screening.
Conclusions
The proposed method successfully introduce anatomical knowledge into segmentation task, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in fundus image segmentation. It also can be used for both automatic segmentation and semiautomatic segmentation with human interaction.}

abstract = {In this paper we describe an intelligent taxi dispatch system that has the goal of reducing the waiting time of the passengers and the idle driving distance of the taxis. The system relies on two separate models that predict the probability distributions of the taxi demand and destinations respectively. The models are learned from historical data and use a combination of long short term memory cells and mixture density networks. Using these predictors, taxi dispatch is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. We validate the performance of the predictors and the overall system on a real world dataset of taxi trips in New York City.}

abstract = {Micro-mobility is increasingly recognised as a promising mode of urban transport, particularly for its potential to reduce private vehicle use for short-distance travel. Despite valuable research contributions that represent fundamental knowledge on this topic, today’s body of research appears quite fragmented in relation to the role of micro-mobility as a transformative solution for meeting sustainability outcomes in urban environments. This paper consolidates knowledge on the topic, analyses past and on-going research developments, and provides future research directions by using a rigorous and auditable systematic literature review methodology. To achieve these objectives, the paper analysed 328 journal publications from the Scopus database covering the period between 2000 and 2020. A bibliographic analysis was used to identify relevant publications and explore the changing landscape of micro-mobility research. The study constructed and visualised the literature’s bibliometric networks through citations and co-citations analyses for authors, articles, journals and countries. The findings showed a consistent spike in recent research outputs covering the sustainability aspects of micro-mobility reflecting its importance as a low-carbon and transformative mode of urban transport. The co-citation analysis, in particular, helped to categorise the literature into four main research themes that address benefits, technology, policy and behavioural mode-choice categories where the majority of research has been focused during the analysis period. For each cluster, inductive reasoning is used to discuss the emerging trends, barriers as well as pathways to overcome challenges to wide-scale deployment. This article provides a balanced and objective summary of research evidence on the topic and serves as a reference point for further research on micro-mobility for sustainable cities.}

abstract = {With the rapid development and popularization of mobile and wireless communication technologies, ridesourcing companies have been able to leverage internet-based platforms to operate e-hailing services in many cities around the world. These companies connect passengers and drivers in real time and are disruptively changing the transportation industry. As pioneers in a general sharing economy context, ridesourcing shared transportation platforms consist of a typical two-sided market. On the demand side, passengers are sensitive to the price and quality of the service. On the supply side, drivers, as freelancers, make working decisions flexibly based on their income from the platform and many other factors. Diverse variables and factors in the system are strongly endogenous and interactively dependent. How to design and operate ridesourcing systems is vital—and challenging—for all stakeholders: passengers/users, drivers/service providers, platforms, policy makers, and the general public. In this paper, we propose a general framework to describe ridesourcing systems. This framework can aid understanding of the interactions between endogenous and exogenous variables, their changes in response to platforms’ operational strategies and decisions, multiple system objectives, and market equilibria in a dynamic manner. Under the proposed general framework, we summarize important research problems and the corresponding methodologies that have been and are being developed and implemented to address these problems. We conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on these problems in different areas from diverse perspectives, including (1) demand and pricing, (2) supply and incentives, (3) platform operations, and (4) competition, impacts, and regulations. The proposed framework and the review also suggest many avenues requiring future research.}

We tested our Junction Manager in 4 different test topologies using the SUMO traffic simulator, and with different traffic loads. The junction manager seeks to optimize the average waiting times for all the cars crossing the junction, while at the same time being able to provide preference to special cars (police cars or firefighters), called Smart Cars, and equipped with special devices that grant them special treatment during the phase allocation policies provided by the architecture. Simulation results provide evidence for an enhanced behavior while compared to fixed-time policies.}

However, it is still problematic for private operators to share data with the public due to risks to competitive advantages. A privacy control algorithm is proposed to overcome this key obstacle for private operators sharing complex network-oriented data objects. The algorithm is based on information-theoretic k-anonymity and, using tour data as an example, where an operator’s data is used in conjunction with performance measure accuracy controls to synthesize a set of alternative tours with diffused probabilities for sampling during a query. The algorithm is proven to converge sublinearly toward a constrained maximum entropy under certain asymptotic conditions with measurable gap. Computational experiments verify the applicability to multi-vehicle fleet tour data; they confirm that reverse engineered parameters from the diffused data result in controllable sampling error; and tests conducted on a set of realistic routing records from travel data in Long Island, NY, demonstrate the use of the methodology from both the adversary and user perspectives.}

The existing old buildings generally consume more energy than the new buildings because of their unavoidable stagnations in physical performances. Distribution side load management of buildings play a vital role in the field of energy management. And 30% of this distribution side loads are Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) loads. So the accurate estimation of heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL) of HVAC system in a building is very much important. It has been studied that the building design parameters optimization approach alone can provide up to 62.1% electrical energy consumption reduction compared to buildings that are not designed for efficient energy usage. Recent research has demonstrated that a combination of existing HVAC technologies can offer effective solutions for energy conservation and thermal comfort. So in this study various energy saving strategies for HVAC systems are investigated and different measures on further energy and cost savings in buildings are discussed.}

In spite of the existence of various machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches and their implementation in built-in libraries and components, the lack of initial geospatial data (such as origin/destination points) thwarts the progress. This situation will be changed if the data even generated synthetically is provided for intelligent algorithm implementation.

They are: “scatter” for generating geospatial data, “clustering” for reducing the number of geo points based on their density, “0-network” for initial public network generation and “routing” to modify the public network modification based on quality criteria.

The use of backend cloud data centers is no longer a viable solution due to incurred latency. Thus, to support such applications, computing devices are placed at edge locations to reduce communication delay improving the quality of service. However, in a congested environment, these locations become overloaded due to a large number of computing requests resulting in degradation of the overall system performance. In this paper, we present a computing framework addressing this problem by introducing the concept of resource allocation and provisioning in the form of flying fog units. The lease period for the allocated resources is defined based on preemptive resource provisioning model.

This paper presents SPEC, a scalable and distributed predictor of fine grain energy consumption in buildings. SPEC exploits a data stream methodology analysis over a sliding time window to train a prediction model tailored to each building. The building model is then exploited to predict the upcoming energy consumption at a time instant in the near future. SPEC currently integrates the artificial neural networks technique and the random forest regression algorithm. The SPEC methodology exploits the computational advantages of distributed computing frameworks as the current implementation runs on Spark. As a case study, real data of thermal energy consumption collected in a major city have been exploited to preliminarily assess the SPEC accuracy. The initial results are promising and represent a first step towards predicting fine grain energy consumption over a sliding time window.}

The method presented in this work aims to reduce this gap with near-zero-failure advanced diagnostics (AD) for smart management, which is exploitable in any context of Society 5.0, thus reducing the risk factors at all management levels and ensuring quality and sustainability. We have also developed innovative applications for a human-centered management system to support scheduling in the maintenance of operative processes, for reducing training costs, for improving production yield, and for creating a human–machine cyberspace for smart infrastructure design. The results obtained in 12 international companies demonstrate a possible global standardization of operative processes, leading to the design of a near-zero-failure intelligent system that is able to learn and upgrade itself.

This paper proposes a novel method, named Point Non-Local Means (PointNLM) network, which incorporates the supervoxel-based and point-wise for automatic semantic segmentation of vegetation from large scale complex scene point clouds. PointNLM captures the long-range relationship between groups of points via a non-local branch cascaded three times to describe sharp geometric features. Simultaneously, a local branch processes the position of scattered feature points and captures the low and high level features. Finally, we proposed a fusion layer of neighborhood max-pooling method to concatenate the long-range features, low level features and high level features for segmenting the trees. The proposed architecture was evaluated on three datasets, including two open access datasets of Semantic3D and Paris-Lille-3D, and an in-house dataset acquired by a commercial mobile LiDAR system. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method provides an efficient and robust result for vegetation segmentation, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 94.4%, F1-score of 92.7% and overall accuracy of 96.3%, respectively.}

To this we leverage the Social IoT (SIoT) Lysis environment to create virtual entities of the real world objects involved in the SP system for on-street parking areas. The usage of the social virtual entities allows for addressing the interoperability issues among different types of IoT devices used by separate solutions deployed in adjacent areas. Magnetometer sensors are used to automatically detect the presence of a vehicle in each parking spot and the sensors data are collected through concentrators that cover the whole parking areas through low-energy Wi-Fi. Additionally, a control dashboard has been designed and developed to manage the monitored parking areas and provide responsive data analytics regarding the occupancy of parking areas in the city, which can be accessed through an Android App. Finally, a smart payment service allows the users to automatically pay for the used services making use of Bluetooth beacons. Experiments have been performed with the developed test-bed to show the performance of the system to timely detect the presence of a vehicle and identify the owner ID to trigger the payment procedure.}

abstract = {Urban land-use planning, especially in the peripheral region, has become an issue in contemporary urban studies. Simultaneously, urban resilience is very indispensable for future urban land use planning and management. Therefore, consistent urban proliferation can be coped through Prediction-Adaptation-Resilience (PAR), to accomplish future urban land use and sustainable development of any growing up urban areas worldwide. Therefore, different dynamic simulation models, e.g. Cellular automata-Markov model, artificial neural network, are used to project and predict any urban areas' spatial growth. Then, the adaptation strategies are taken to assess the urban land use transformation in the past and present context. Those strategies help to strengthen urban land use planning using an integrated supply and demand chain. Finally, this study checks the resilience of how much it will be threatened or saved for future sustainable urban developmental goals and urban resilience. Therefore, it is important to establish a conceptual framework to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) based on principles of the PAR approach. Advocating the on-going adaptation of sustainability, resilience, and rapid urban transformation in the developing cities requires clear and explicit definitions that are embedded with the recent and particular context. Thus, government and policy makers should draw their attention to make proper urban landscape planning and adaptation strategies for the future urban expansion in a holistic way by maintaining appropriate urban resilience.}

Because this policy has effected physical change on the environment, it requires quantification to determine its driving factors, and to formulate solutions to its problems. In doing so, this research used remote sensing and machine learning techniques. Satellite data from Sentinel-2A were acquired for the years 2015 and 2019 for LULC model, and Landsat 8 OLI for industrial growth model in coastal area. The data were processed using QGIS 3.8 software with machine learning techniques, the Random Forest algorithm, and sci-kit learn library from Dzetsaka tools. The results showed that changes in land use and land cover areas significantly contributed to the loss of blue carbon storage of more than 20%. This finding confirms that the industrialization policy on the coastal area needs to be reviewed, and land use monitoring must be more strictly regulated.}

Due to the regeneration, prediction is based on a daily modeling using a vector autoregressive model that combines linearly the past observations of the day. Due to the high-dimension, the learning algorithm follows from an ℓ1-penalization of the regression coefficients. Excess risk bounds are established under the high-dimensional framework in which the number of road sections goes to infinity with the number of observed days. Considering floating car data observed in an urban area, the approach is compared to state-of-the-art methods including neural networks. In addition of being highly competitive in terms of prediction, it enables the identification of the most determinant sections of the road network.}

Furthermore, one of the most important challenges in this field is to find a set of highly discriminative image features for reaching a good performance in image classification. In this work we propose to use weighted ensembles as a method for feature combination. First, a set of binary classifiers are trained with a set of features and then, the scores are weighted with distances obtained from another set of feature vectors. We present two different approaches to weight the score vector: (1) directly multiplying each score by the weights and (2) fusing the scores values and the distances through a Neural Network. The experiments have shown that the proposed methodology improves classification accuracy of simple ensembles and even more it obtains similar classification accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, but using much less parameters.}

However, extracting mobility information such as transport modes from these data is very challenging, due to their low spatial accuracy and infrequent/irregular temporal characteristics. Existing studies relying on mobile phone network data mostly employed simple rule-based methods with geographic data, and focused on easy-to-detect transport modes (e.g., train and subway) or coarse-grained modes (e.g., public versus private transport). Meanwhile, due to the lack of ground truth data, evaluation of these methods was not reported, or only for aggregate data, and it is thus unclear how well the existing methods can detect modes of individual trips. This article proposes two supervised methods - one combining rule-based heuristics (RBH) with random forest (RF), and the other combining RBH with a fuzzy logic system - and a third, unsupervised method with RBH and k-medoids clustering, to detect fine-grained transport modes from CSD, particularly subway, train, tram, bike, car, and walk. Evaluation with a labeled ground truth dataset shows that the best performing method is the hybrid one with RBH and RF, where a classification accuracy of 73% is achieved when differentiating these modes. To our knowledge, this is the first study that distinguishes fine-grained transport modes in CSD and validates results with ground truth data. This study may thus inform future CSD-based applications in areas such as intelligent transport systems, urban/transport planning, and smart cities.}

Unfortunately, there are not many robust examples or standardised approaches available in the literature for delivering effective low-carbon urban energy planning. In particular, there is a lack of appropriate frameworks or systems which allow an effective and reliable assessment of energy use in the built environment at district-urban scale. This paper illustrates the development of a geospatial bottom-up statistical model to estimate the energy consumption of a large number of residential building stocks for heating space, considering a wide range of variables. The proposed methodology is based on a 2D/3D- Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), which provides location-based information for each single dwelling to identify correlations and assess the demand-side consumption at the urban scale. This framework was tested on a medium-sized Italian city, including around 3600 residential buildings. The results provided by the model are validated using residual analysis and cross-validation. Moreover, the spatial results provided by this study represent a useful tool to aid decision-makers in the urban planning process. These results can help to create future energy transition strategies, implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in the context of sustainable cities. This work is part of a national Smart City & Communities project, named “EEB- Zero Energy Buildings in Smart Urban Districts”; nonetheless, the methodology illustrated in this paper can be generalised and applied to other European urban contexts.}

Emerging Geospatial Big Data (GBD) are considered as the supplement to RS data, and help to contribute to our understanding of urban lands from physical aspects (i.e., urban land cover) to socioeconomic aspects (i.e., urban land use). Integrating RS and GBD could be an effective way to combine physical and socioeconomic aspects with great potential for high-quality urban land use classification. In this study, we reviewed the existing literature and focused on the state-of-the-art and perspective of the urban land use categorization by integrating RS and GBD. Specifically, the commonly used RS features (e.g., spectral, textural, temporal, and spatial features) and GBD features (e.g., spatial, temporal, semantic, and sequence features) were identified and analyzed in urban land use classification. The integration strategies for RS and GBD features were categorized into feature-level integration (FI) and decision-level integration (DI). To be more specific, the FI method integrates the RS and GBD features and classifies urban land use types using the integrated feature sets; the DI method processes RS and GBD independently and then merges the classification results based on decision rules. We also discussed other critical issues, including analysis unit setting, parcel segmentation, parcel labeling of land use types, and data integration. Our findings provide a retrospect of different features from RS and GBD, strategies of RS and GBD integration, and their pros and cons, which could help to define the framework for future urban land use mapping and better support urban planning, urban environment assessment, urban disaster monitoring and urban traffic analysis.}

These dimensions call for the notion of resilience, to be used as a staging area for modelling system performance. While a large number of documents deal with this kind of problem for systems including CPSs, a comprehensive review on the topic is still lacking. The scope of this paper is to survey available literature for understanding to which extent CPSs contribute to system resilience, and to synthetize the approaches developed in this domain. More than 500 documents were reviewed through a protocol based on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) review technique. This survey identifies main models and methods categorizing them on the basis of the hazards of interest and their effects on security, privacy, safety and business continuity. It also summarizes main conceptual frameworks and metrics used to assess and compare the resilience capabilities of a system including also CPSs. This cross-domain survey highlights the dominant techno-centric unit of analysis for available literature, still highlighting emerging trends towards more systemic representations of system threats, even socio-technically oriented, and respective modern investigation approaches.}

However, accurate forecasting is very challenging, because it is difficult to extract the dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies from high-dimensional nonlinear data. This paper proposes a regional traffic demand forecasting framework (RTDFF) to predict the boarding and alighting demand of online car-hailing. The RTDFF can learn robust representations of traffic patterns with multi-resolution spatial dependencies. It uses a 3D deconvolution component to enhance the spatial resolution of intra-regions and a 2D residual component to connect the large-scale spatial dependence. This model investigates the effect of the 3D convolution in capturing the long-term temporal dependence. Hybrid modeling is conducted with multi-granularity temporal segmentation and fusion. The experiments were carried out using real-world datasets. The results verify that RTDFF is accurate and stable, and that it has slower deterioration than baseline models, with the raise of prediction steps.}

This paper presents results from a simulation-based study which aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of using agent-based simulation tools to model the impacts of shared autonomous vehicles. First, the paper outlines a research framework for the development and evaluation of low carbon mobility solutions driven by two disruptive forces which are changing the mobility landscape and providing consumers with more choices to meet their transport needs: automated self-driving and on-demand shared mobility services. The focus of this paper is on development of rigorous models for understanding the demand for travel in the age of connected mobility, and assessing their impacts particularly under scenarios of autonomous or self-driving on-demand shared mobility. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, the paper provides initial results from a pilot study on a small road network in Melbourne, Australia. A base case scenario representing the current situation of using traditional privately owned vehicles, and two autonomous mobility on-demand (AMoD) scenarios were simulated on a real transport network. In the first scenario (AMoD1), it was assumed that the on-demand vehicles were immediately available to passengers (maximum waiting times is zero). This constraint was relaxed in the second scenario (AMoD2) by increasing the allowable passenger waiting times up to a maximum of 5 minutes. The results showed that using the AMoD system resulted in a significant reduction in both the number of vehicles required to meet the transport needs of the community (reduction of 43% in AMoD1, and 88% in AMoD2), and the required on-street parking space (reduction of 58% in AMoD1 and 83% in AMoD2). However, the simulation also showed that this was achieved at the expense of a less significant increase in the total VKT (increase of 29% in AMoD1 and 10% in AMoD2). The paper concludes by describing how the model is being extended, the remaining challenges that need to be overcome in this research, and outlines the next steps to achieve the desired outcomes.}

Sometimes, the products are extremely limited in the social communication between products to consumers and products to products, and the primary communication system is the interface, but typically, this interface is not designed as a social element. As a result, social communication is minimal. Thus, a basic design methodology that allows product designers to incorporate social factors between products to consumers and products to products is presented in this paper. Also, the term social communication PCPP (Product-Consumer and Product-Product) is coined as a part of the product design methodology that allows defining the social features as primary elements in the process of designing products. Besides, a conceptual method for smart thermostats is proposed for a social communication PCPP to demonstrate how this conceptual proposal could be implemented using the sensing, smart and sustainable (S3) features.}

However, designing a vehicular recruitment scheme to enhance a security-based DNS is challenging since it is hard to judge trustworthiness values of vehicular sensors. Therefore, in this paper, a novel vehicular trust evaluation scheme is proposed to analyze and supervise the data collected by vehicular sensors with a trust and low-cost style. To obtain vehicular trusts, the proposed scheme that considers time factor and gap between sensed data and real data is designed to calculate trustworthiness of vehicles. Moreover, sensing data in the vehicle sparse regions has more contributions because of its rareness. Thus, to inspire vehicles to sense data in the vehicle sparse regions, a trustworthiness-based gradient pricing method is designed to pay rewards for the vehicular sensors. Finally, with real vehicular GPS datasets, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve accuracy rate of data sensing by 37.72% and can improve data quality by 76.95%. By incentive pricing method, coverage ratio of data sensing is improved by 13.1%. In general, performances of the proposed scheme can be improved by 19. 39% to 22.32% approximately. Future works focus on improving information security by advanced machine learning methods in the dynamic DNS.}

Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared-access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (PBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time. The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry.}

Populations are segmented into meaningful groups that share similar attitudes and preferences. This segmentation provides valuable information about how policy options, such as pricing measures or advertising campaigns, should be designed and promoted in order to successfully target different user groups. In this paper, we aim to bridge between psychological, social marketing and ICT research in the field of transportation. We explore how attitude based segments are reflected in high resolution mobility behaviour data, crowdsourced via mobile phones. We use support vector machines to map eight attitudinal segments, as defined under the European project SEGMENT, to the n dimensional space defined by crowdsourced data. The success rate of the proposed approach is 98.9%. This demonstrates the applicability of the method as a way to automatically map attitudinal segments to a wider population based on observed mobility data instead of using explicit attitudinal surveys. In addition, the proposed approach can facilitate the delivery of personalised target messages to individuals (e.g. via smartphones) or at target locations where users, belonging to specific segment, are located at specific time windows since the data includes the time-space indications.}

The re-design of square in cities is important to make the urban squares livable especially for cities with high population density. Innovative solutions about green space design, computer vision and environmental sensing have been implemented, observing experimentally the influence of the public space on people’s behaviour. Furthermore, the platform processes data about weather condition, objects detected by image processing algorithms, environmental pollution and occupancy patterns to perform correlation analysis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to predict people occupancy over time, basing on a weather dataset. The platform implements a Decision Support System (DSS) aimed to read the data, and provide guidelines for urban square design optimization. The DSS is constructed by data modeling, data mining and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) tools tailored on the specific case of study. Experimental observations provide insights for a self-adaptive urban square design. Multiple correspondence analysis best fits qualitative and quantitative data obtained from sensors, and highlights people’s behaviour in the urban square in correlation with different variables. After a complete overview of factors which can influence the livability of a square and economical/social models are presented different results about citizen behaviour interpretation in function of weather data and attitudes. The proposed framework can be potentially applied for a generic urban square.}

This fact increasingly highlights the importance of designing real-time and intelligent CPSs that are capable of decision making. In this paper, an Intelligent Architecture model for CPS management (IA-CPS) based on online processing is proposed for this purpose. Specifically, it can manage simple and complex events based on a service-oriented architecture and directed by an event-driven architecture, using event processing technology as Complex Event Processing (CEP). The novelty of our approach relies on the fact that the proposed architecture is service-oriented, which models the functionalities of the event-driven system. This gives us the possibility to offer a flexible service catalog, allowing us to connect to the system on any kind of device and interact in different scenarios. The model has been applied to two use cases: processing images from video surveillance cameras, and processing of consumption data captured by water and energy sensors installed in end-user environments.}

Two important classes of LBSs are Nearest Neighbor (NN) queries and range queries that provide user information about the locations of point of interests (POIs) such as hospitals or restaurants. Answers of these queries are more reliable and satisfiable if they come from trustworthy crowd instead of traditional location service providers (LSPs). We introduce an approach to evaluate NN and range queries with crowdsourced data and computation that eliminates the role of an LSP. In our crowdsourced approach, a user evaluates LBSs in a group. It may happen that group members do not have knowledge of all POIs in a certain area. We present efficient algorithms to evaluate queries with accuracy guarantee in incomplete databases. Experiments show that our approach is scalable and incurs less computational overhead.}

abstract = {Aerial images’ clustering is of great significance in many domains of the last-generation computer systems, such as intelligent navigation, geological analysis, and disaster prediction. Conventional methods exploit only the global visual information and unimodal visual feature to characterize each aerial image, which is simple and self-descriptive in some cases. However, it cannot adequately simulate tiny and fine-grained visual patterns within each aerial image, such as automobiles of the “intersection” category and houses of the “residence” category. Moreover, the unimodal feature cannot effectively capture each aerial image. Other visual channels, such as the light spectrum, should also be encoded into the aerial image modeling system. We propose a novel aerial image clustering system, with a seamless fusion of spectrum and local features in this work. The multispectral visual clue is characterized by color plus texture channels from aerial images of each spectral channel. Simultaneously, locally distributed and very small objects combined with their spatial configurations are described by a set of graphlets. That is, each edge connects a pair of small objects, which are spatially neighboring. Subsequently, a multi-view learning algorithm is formulated to fuse the above channels to characterize each aerial image optimally. The importance of multiple spectral channels is flexibly tuned. A graph-based clustering algorithm is adopted to categorize the massive-scale aerial images into multiple types based on each aerial image’s fused feature description. Extensive comparative results on a million-level real-world aerial photograph set prove our method’s advantage over available state-of-the-art ones. Besides, visualization results imply that our clustering algorithm can optimally discriminate aerial images from different categories.}

A fast, economical, and comparative methodology is presented for evaluating the heating values resulted from burning municipal solid waste (MSW) based on prior knowledge, specialist experience, and data-mining methods. Development of models for estimating higher heating values (HHVs) of 252 MSW samples based on the ultimate analysis is conducted by simultaneously utilising five nonlinear models including Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network in conjunction with Genetic Algorithm (GA), namely GA-RBF, genetic programming (GP), multivariate nonlinear regression (MNR), particle swarm optimisation adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (PSO-ANFIS) and committee machine intelligent system (CMIS) models to increase the accuracy of each model. Eight different equations based on MNR are developed to estimate energy recovery capacity from different MSW groups (e.g., textiles, plastics, papers, rubbers, mixtures, woods, sewage sludge and other waste). A detailed investigation is conducted to analyse the accuracy of the models. It is indicated that the CMIS model has the best performance comparing the results obtained from different models. The R2 values of the test dataset for GA-RBF are 0.888, for GP 0.979, for MNR 0.978, for PSO-ANFIS 0.965, and for CMIS 0.985. The developed models with an acceptable accuracy would be followed by a better estimation of HHV and providing reliable heating value for an automatic combustion control system. The results obtained from this study are beneficial to design and optimise sustainable thermal waste-to-energy (WTF) processes to accelerate city transition into a circular economy.}

The variance of individual loss parameters and their impact on quality performance are quantified and mapped into the virtual space. The nature of their distributions and correlations provide great insights about quality loss mechanisms in process monitoring, helping to prioritize efforts for optimizing the control of the SSCPL in the physical space. Additionally, the parameters can be tied back to the physical space, allowing the data to be used directly for the control in the manufacturing. The data-loop of “Autonomous perception of process parameters - Dynamic behaver mapping - Online monitoring - Online data analysis - Parameters configuration & control” can be obtained in the model.

The novelty of the research consists in combining the algorithms of the Analytical Network Process (ANP) with those of the Zero-One Goal Programming (ZOGP), where the ANP makes it possible to clarify the interdependence relations between the criteria, as well as between criteria and projects, while the ZOGP allows considering requirements and constraints of the reference system.

Through rainfall level definitions, the rainfall observation task can be transformed into an audio classification task. Three 2-D baseline convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were proposed as the classifiers. In view of the classifier training and testing, a new dataset named Rainfall Audio_XZ (RA_XZ) was generated based on the surveillance audio data. Because of the significant impact of the input features on the classification performance, 16 kinds of feature aggregation schemes were constructed and investigated to find the best representation of rainfall. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CNN (7-stack CNN) achieves 81.67% accuracy in rainfall level classification in the RA_XZ dataset and 93.38% accuracy in environmental sound classification in the UrbanSound8k dataset, which is optimal performance compared to that of some existing relevant algorithms. Furthermore, audio aggregation strategies that facilitate the representation and classification of rainfall events are investigated, which has important implications for audio and speech classification systems.

By providing a long term view, it benefits the decision making in related applications, such as public safety, traffic management, etc. However, performing Ms-SLCFP is challenging as complicated spatiotemporal correlations are formed among stations due to the flowing crowd. Besides, the crowd flow at a single station fluctuates a lot though the regularity is obvious at the regional level. To tackle such issues, we propose a deep neural networks-based model with spatiotemporal hierarchical attention mechanisms, called ST-HAttn for short, for Ms-SLCFP. The notable contributions are that ST-HAttn performs attention mechanisms (AM) in two ways: 1) implementing AM at both station level and regional level; 2) implementing AM to explicitly model the pairwise correlations of station-region instead of station-station. The intuition is to alleviate the negative impact on Ms-SLCFP due to the fluctuation of the crowd flow at the station level. Verified on three real-world datasets, ST-HAttn outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of Ms-SLCFP.}

This paper demonstrates a comparative study of four data-driven methods used in online building energy predictions involving large-scale data extracted from several types of buildings. The characteristics of building electricity use and data reliability were addressed through the data pre-treatment process including visualization, cleaning, parsing and filtering. Mathematical algorithms and their applications in previous studies were summarized and compared, and evaluation methods were developed. The performance and suitable application scenarios of the proposed algorithms were conducted via the comparison of monitoring data and predicted results. The study indicates that the most complex method which requires the highest computation ability, i.e., the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), does not lead to the highest accuracy, while as the fastest computation method, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) usually has the results with the lowest accuracy. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) methods usually perform better in the case scenarios studied. All the prediction accuracies can meet the requirements of RMSE <30% and NMBE <10% proposed by ASHRAE, and the computation time varies from less than 1 s to 22 s per prediction. All these methods/algorithms worked well for buildings with stable energy use patterns. For buildings with complex and unstable occupancy schedules and energy use patterns, MLR and SVM methods have the ability to achieve a high accuracy with fast computation speed.}

In this article, we present a free intelligent software system called BIN-CT (BIN for the CiTy), based on computational learning algorithms, which plans the best routes for waste collection supported by past (historical) and future (predictions) data. The objective of the system is to reduction the cost of the waste collection service minimizing the distance traveled by a truck to collect the waste from a container, thereby reducing the fuel consumption. At the same time the quality of service for the citizen is increased, avoiding the annoying overflows of containers thanks to the accurate fill-level predictions given by BIN-CT. In this article we show the features of our software system, illustrating its operation with a real case study of a Spanish city. We conclude that the use of BIN-CT avoids unnecessary trips to containers, reduces the distance traveled to collect a container by 20%, and generates routes 33.2% shorter than the routes used by the company. Therefore it enables a considerable reduction of total costs and harmful emissions thrown up into the atmosphere.}

SWC is a crosscutting issue that can be directly or indirectly linked to 10 of the 17 United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs). This study aims to develop an SWC route optimisation model to improve collection efficiency, save collection costs and reduce emissions by considering fixed routing optimisation (FRO) with static data and variable routing optimisation (VRO) with real-time data. To realise the optimisation, a mixed-integer linear programming model utilising FRO and VRO was developed. Results show that VRO improved the collection efficiency by 26.08 % when the minimum filled-up level for collection was 70 %. Moreover, VRO achieved 44.44 % cost savings and 17.60 % carbon emission reduction at 70 % filled level. The proposed system achieved the targeted goals and demonstrated the feasibility of an optimisation model for the waste management sector to build a sustainable smart city. The findings of this study can be used to strengthen efforts towards the achievement of the SDGs related to solid waste collection and management.}

However, unsupervised training may lead to poor execution quality, resulting in ineffective training, or even injuries in worst cases. Automatic tracking and quantification of exercise efforts by means of wearables could be a way to monitor the execution correctness. As a positive side effect, these devices help in motivating people, increasing the quantity of physical exercises of users and thus improving health conditions as well. Unfortunately, despite the availability of some commercial devices, their performance and effectiveness are not documented. This work proposes a new solution that exploits machine learning (ML) techniques (in particular Linear Discriminant Analysis, LDA) for analyzing data coming from wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). Efforts have been done in reducing the computational requirements, in order to be compatible with constraints in perspective of embedded implementation. The experimental campaign carried out to measure the performance showed an average accuracy, recall and precision on the order of 97%, 93% and 90%, respectively.}

Several studies revealed that the amount of energy spent on transmitting data from IoT devices to a cloud server is considerably high and resulted in rapid energy depletion. In this view, this paper presents an Energy Efficient Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based Clustering (EEPSOC) technique for the effective selection of cluster heads (CHs) among diverse IoT devices. The IoT devices used for sensing healthcare data are grouped into a form of clusters and a CH will be elected by the use of EEPSOC. The elected CH will forward the data to the cloud server. Then, the CH is responsible for transmitting data of the IoT devices to the cloud server through fog devices. Next to that, an artificial neural network (ANN) based classification model is applied to diagnose the healthcare data in the cloud server to identify the severity of the diseases. For experimentation, a systematic student perspective healthcare data is produced utilizing UCI dataset and medicinal gadgets to foresee the diverse student levels of disease severity. A detailed comparative analysis is carried out and the simulation outcome ensured the goodness of the EEPSOC-ANN model over the compared methods under various aspects.}

A pipe-like path consisting of closely coupled links (forming a bundle) is more suitable to big data transmissions. The queuing model for such a coupled routing pipe is important to network congestion diagnosis and avoidance. Particularly, the queuing analysis between neighboring hops can help to analyze the pipe traffic accumulation dynamics. Our pioneering work presented here first develops a queuing model for a single node of the pipe. We design a full Markov-Chain-based queuing model for bulk arrival, bulk service queues with multiple vacations. We then extend such a single node queuing model to the pipe-based queuing scenarios, and deduce the closed-form equations for the typical queue statistics such as the service delay. The numerical results can serve as the guidelines for big data transmission protocols. Comprehensive, accurate simulations have been conducted to verify the correctness of our proposed pipe queuing models.}

These new services, built on the convergence of several distinct technologies, need to fulfil time-sensitive functions, provide variable levels of integration with their environment, and incorporate data storage, computation, communications, sensing, and control. There are, however, significant problems to be solved before such systems can be considered fit for purpose. The high heterogeneity, complexity, and dynamics of these resource-constrained systems bring new challenges to their robust and reliable operation, which implies the need for integral resilience management strategies. This paper surveys the state of the art in the relevant fields, and discusses the research issues and future trends that are emerging. We envisage future applications that have very stringent requirements, notably high-precision latency and synchronization between a large set of flows, where FCSs are key to supporting them. Thus, we hope to provide new insights into the design and management of resilient FCSs that are formed by IoT devices, edge computer servers and wireless sensor networks; these systems can be modelled using Game Theory, and flexibly programmed with the latest software and virtualization platforms.}

In the interim, the impact of the digitization era is more apparent than ever, as algorithms and data availability and quality have significantly improved. This study aspires to bridge the gap in energy efficiency financing with the development of a data-driven methodology that labels energy efficiency investments based on their expected utility in terms of renovation cost and energy savings. Various machine learning classification methods are deployed and combined through a meta-learning model with the objective to improve overall classification performance and determine the funding that each investment should receive according to its particular characteristics. The proposed methodology is evaluated using a set of 312 projects that have been completed in Latvia. Our results indicate that the meta-learner outperforms all baseline classifiers, effectively identifying projects of high and medium potential and successfully distinguishing low from high potential ones.}

In this study, we used historical hourly data recorded at 9 sites across the Sydney metropolitan area to test the performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) forecasting architectures in predicting 5 urban pollutants based on different combinations of meteorological inputs and considering standard, bushfire, and pandemic lockdown conditions. We demonstrate that, in most cases and even in a fast-growing city, there is no significant benefit achieved by including extra predictors to temperature and humidity, when adequate forecasting techniques capable of learning long-term dependencies are used. Further, in agreement with previous studies, we provide evidence of ozone's higher responsiveness to all weather parameters and thus enhanced predictability and PM10's lower predictability as compared to all other considered urban pollutants. The prediction accuracy tends to be comparable between standard conditions and bushfire events. However, the predictability significantly declines under anomalies in anthropogenic patterns and urban metabolic rates as those recorded during the pandemic. The inclusion of local emission sources and anthropogenic factors in the input dataset is considered necessary for NO and PM10 to properly predict urban air quality, especially under human-related extreme conditions.}

In this article, I use traditional statistical correlation and regression techniques along with newer natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze the corpus of datasets hosted on government ODPs (total: 49,066) to extract patterns that relate scales of governance and political liberalism/conservatism to the priorities and meaning attached to environmental issues. I find that state-level and municipal-level ODPs host different categories of environmental datasets, with municipal-level ODPs generally hosting more datasets pertaining to services and amenities and state-level ODPs hosting more datasets pertaining to resource protection and extraction. Stronger trends were observed for the influences of political conservatism/liberalism among state-level ODPs than for municipal-level ODPs.}

Although Cloud computing is a promising paradigm for IoT in data processing, due to the high latency limitation of the Cloud, it is unable to satisfy the requirements for time-sensitive applications. Resource allocation and provisioning in the Fog-Cloud environment, considering dynamic changes in user requirements and limited available resources in Fog devices, is a challenging task. Among dynamic changes in the parameters of user requirements, the deadline is the most important challenge in the Fog computing environment. Current works on Fog computing address the resource provisioning without considering the dynamic changes in users’ requirements. To address the problem of satisfying deadline-based dynamic user requirements, we propose resource allocation and provisioning algorithms by using resource ranking and provision of resources in a hybrid and hierarchical fashion. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a simulation environment by extending the CloudSim toolkit to simulate a realistic Fog environment. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithms is better compared with existing algorithms in terms of overall data processing time, instance cost and network delay, with the increasing number of application submissions. The average processing time and cost are decreased by 12% and 15% respectively, compared with existing solutions.}

However, this new reality generates significant cybersecurity risks due to the heterogeneous and insecure nature of SG. In particular, SG relies on legacy communication protocols that have not been implemented having cybersecurity in mind. Moreover, the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) creates severe cybersecurity challenges. The Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems constitute an emerging technology in the cybersecurity area, having the capability to detect, normalise and correlate a vast amount of security events. They can orchestrate the entire security of a smart ecosystem, such as SG. Nevertheless, the current SIEM systems do not take into account the unique SG peculiarities and characteristics like the legacy communication protocols. In this paper, we present the Secure and PrivatE smArt gRid (SPEAR) SIEM, which focuses on SG. The main contribution of our work is the design and implementation of a SIEM system capable of detecting, normalising and correlating cyberattacks and anomalies against a plethora of SG application-layer protocols. It is noteworthy that the detection performance of the SPEAR SIEM is demonstrated with real data originating from four real SG use case (a) hydropower plant, (b) substation, (c) power plant and (d) smart home.}

abstract = {The study of Natural Language Generation (NLG), especially how human beings narrate the world, assists in understanding of the visual world for surveillance. Our research proposes an effective technique to axiomatically develop multi-line textual description of visual data by exploiting deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). Textual description of visual data aids in providing textual tags for visual information. A human can retrieve elected videos from a repository based on visual tags. Videos contain more complex and detailed information than images and provide more language data. The proposed feats-rich model encodes the visual contents to visual and facial features using CNN architecture. Encoded features are passed to two layer LSTM units with attention mechanism, reducing the number of parameters by encompassing relevant details. Experimental results on Trecvid 2016 and UET-Surveillance dataset depict that model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by scoring BLEU score of 0.35 and 0.52, respectively.}

abstract = {Electricity theft menace has attracted various research efforts with most proposed detection algorithms relying on analysing customers' consumption profile to determine fraudulent electricity consumers (FEC). This necessitates the need for on-site inspections before penalties are sanctioned despite the manpower, cost, energy, time, and stress associated with such tedious routine. Moreover, the penalty-imposed fines are bogusly determined and uncoordinated, and losses in revenue are burdened on the honest consumers. Fortunately, the advent of advanced metering infrastructure offers a flexible and efficient platform which can be leveraged to provide additional functionality of curbing these complicated procedures. In this work, a cost estimation-based model deploying a forced corrective measure for a real-time enforcement of penalties on FEC in a smart utility network is proposed. It relies on the results of commonly applied intelligent algorithms for electricity theft detection to obtain the amount and cost of energy consumed by reported FEC while also providing efficient monitoring till imposed fines are cleared. The results of the developed model give proportionate sanctions and enhances the functions of the system manager's monitoring of the operational status to ensure compliance and is suitable for deployment in a smart utility network.}

This offloading scheme need to consider the mobility of IoT devices and helps to intelligently select the optimal server for offloading. An efficient offloading scheme need to take in consideration important factors such as mobility of the IoT user device, speed and direction of the IoT user device as well as the computational capabilities of the user mobile device and the load of nearby servers. Unbalanced load of data or task offloading lead to high latency and poor services. An optimal selection of offloading server will clearly improve latency and QoS. Some new architecture of cellular network suggest the deployment of small-cell base stations (SBS) [1], [2] with a certain computing capabilities which can help offloading task of IoT mobile device or of their nearby SBS. In smart city environment, the mobile IoT device user needs to choose an SBS from several available SBSs within the its communication proximity. In this paper, we propose a Smart Ranking based Task Offloading approach for selecting an SBS and to improve the Quality of Service. This approach uses Q-Learning for SBS selection which will be modelled in Software Defined Network controller to deal with the problem of choosing the SBS in an intelligent way for Task offloading.}

This paper proposes a new method for categorizing scene videos into different classes, namely, Animation, Outlet, Sports, e-Learning, Medical, Weather, Defense, Economics, Animal Planet and Technology, for the performance improvement of text detection and recognition, which is an effective approach for scene image or video understanding. For this purpose, at first, we present a new combination of rough and fuzzy concept to study irregular shapes of edge components in input scene videos, which helps to classify edge components into several groups. Next, the proposed method explores gradient direction information of each pixel in each edge component group to extract stroke based features by dividing each group into several intra and inter planes. We further extract correlation and covariance features to encode semantic features located inside planes or between planes. Features of intra and inter planes of groups are then concatenated to get a feature matrix. Finally, the feature matrix is verified with temporal frames and fed to a neural network for categorization. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, at the same time, the performances of text detection and recognition methods are also improved significantly due to categorization.}

These changes impact on the management and regulation of future energy systems and question how they will support a socially equitable, acceptable, net-zero transition. This paper couples a meta-narrative literature review with expert interviews to explore how socio-technical regimes associated with centralised systems of provision (i.e. the prevailing paradigm in many countries around the world) differ to those of smart local energy systems (SLES). Findings show how SLES regimes incorporate niche technologies, business models and governance structures to enable new forms of localised operation and optimisation (e.g. automated network management across energy vectors), smarter decision making and planning, by new actors (e.g. local authorities, other local stakeholders), and engaging users in new ways. Through this they are expected to deliver on a wide range of outcomes, both within the SLES boundary and to the wider system. However, there may be trade-offs between outcomes due to pressures for change originating from competing actors (e.g. landscape vs. incumbents in the regime); understanding the mapping between different outcomes, SLES elements and their interconnections will be key to unlocking wider benefits.}

Nonetheless, there are limited empirical investigations and understanding on public perceptions concerning AI for disaster management. Bridging this knowledge gap is the justification for this paper. The methodological approach adopted involved: Initially, collecting data through an online survey from residents (n = 605) of three major Australian cities; Then, analysis of the data using statistical modelling. The analysis results revealed that: (a) Younger generations have a greater appreciation of opportunities created by AI-driven applications for disaster management; (b) People with tertiary education have a greater understanding of the benefits of AI in managing the pre- and post-disaster phases, and; (c) Public sector administrative and safety workers, who play a vital role in managing disasters, place a greater value on the contributions by AI in disaster management.

A mixture of Blockchain and the IoT appears hopeful, even though blockchain requires real-time data application, and IoT describes processes to store and manage information overloads safely and proficiently. The technology is significant to the manufacturing business, experiencing a digital revolution by incorporating equipment, developments, and data, leading to the Industrial IoT (IIoT). Such a combination of IIoT and blockchain is termed Blockchain for Industrial Internet of Things (BIIoT). The paper gives a detailed survey on BIIoT and discusses all relevant aspects of this novel concept. Firstly, IoT as a concept has been explored briefly, and relevant threats to IoT has been investigated. Furthermore, the domain of IIoT and the relevant challenges to IIoT is discussed. Additionally, an overview of blockchain technology is presented. Subsequently, a combination of IIoT and blockchain is explored, and the BIIoT structural design proposal is submitted. Finally, issues related to the use of IIoT with blockchain for industrial applications of BIIoT is explored. Thus, all relevant open research directions in Blockchain and IIoT are summarized in this paper. This survey shows that the proposed BIIoT is used to develop a redundant, traceable, and secure complex interconnected IIoT environment. Furthermore, the BIIoT system enables us to communicate with each other without the need for a trusted intermediary in a decentralized, unreliable, peer-to-peer network.}

All of these visions have one thing in common, i.e., delay sensitivity and instant response. Various new technologies designed to work at the edge of the network, such as fog computing, cloudlets, mobile edge computing, and micro data centers have emerged in the near past. We use the name ``edge computing'' for this set of emerging technologies. Edge computing is a promising paradigm to offer the required computation and storage resources with minimal delays because of ``being near'' to the users or terminal devices. Edge computing aims to bring cloud resources and services at the edge of the network, as a middle layer between end user and cloud data centers, to offer prompt service response with minimal delay. Two major aims of edge computing can be denoted as: (a) minimize response delay by servicing the users’ request at the network edge instead of servicing it at far located cloud data centers, and (b) minimize downward and upward traffic volumes in the network core. Minimization of network core traffic inherently brings energy efficiency and data cost reductions. Downward network traffic can be minimized by servicing set of users at network edge instead of service provider's data centers (e.g., multimedia and shared data) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and upward traffic can be minimized by processing and filtering raw data (e.g., sensors monitored data) and uploading the processed information to cloud. This survey presents a detailed overview of potentials, trends, and challenges of edge computing. The survey illustrates a list of most significant applications and potentials in the area of edge computing.

Concerning demand side factors the paper demonstrates how potential market size and existing technology trajectory work in favor of IoT diffusion. As a related demand side factor the paper argues that, in terms of the technological trajectory, China has started farther from the frontier than most industrialized countries. The degree of incremental benefit from the IoT is thus higher in the country. As to the supply side factors, the article promotes an understanding of how Chinese technology companies have capitalized on a huge user base to develop IoT-based applications. It also suggests that technologies and expertise provided by foreign multinationals have also played crucial roles. Regarding formal institutions, the government's proactive policies have been a major factor in the IoT's evolution. It is also in the Chinese government's interest to develop IoT products to make censorship and surveillance more effective. Regarding informal institutions, Chinese consumers are less concerned than Westerners about being tracked and monitored, which provides a favorable condition for the adoption of IoT-enabled devices. Nonetheless, this condition is changing due to increasing abuse of consumer privacy. China and the U.S. are compared in terms of diffusion, key determinants, performance indicators and impacts of the IoT in order to understand the areas that China outperforms—and underperforms—the U.S. Some indicators are proposed to gauge the IoT-related performance and the impacts of the IoT.}
