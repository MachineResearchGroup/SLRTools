RACER provides rate control capabilities to the Kafka’s consumer API which allows us to effectively meet the requirements of the end-services without interference among them. Our experimental evaluation using smart city data, illustrates the benefits of our approach.},

The growing significance of these algorithmic systems in the shaping of public and private lives of the citizens make them a timely and important site of research and advocacy. This paper presents examples of practices and projects that work with the paradoxes of automation and participation as a site where the different actors collide and form what we describe as algorithmic creatures. We map the different modes of reflection about/through/with technologies of automation to argue for a PD with algorithmic creatures focused on pluralism, justice, equity, and care.},

abstract = {In the last few years, distributed stream processing engines have been on the rise due to their crucial impacts on real-time data processing with guaranteed low latency in several application domains such as financial markets, surveillance systems, manufacturing, smart cities, etc. Stream processing engines are run-time libraries to process data streams without knowing the lower level streaming mechanics. Apache Storm, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Kafka Streams and Hazelcast Jet are some of the popular stream processing engines. Nowadays, critical systems like energy systems, are interconnected and automated. As a result, these systems are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In real-world applications, the sensing values come from sensor devices contains missing values, redundant data, data outliers, manipulated data, data failures, etc. Therefore, our system must be resilient to these conditions. In this paper, we present an approach to check if there is any above mentioned conditions by pre-processing data streams using a stream processing engine like Apache Flink which will be updated as a library in future. Then, the pre-processed streams are forwarded to other stream processing engines like Apache Kafka for real stream processing. As a result, data validation, data consistency and integrity for a resilient system can be accomplished before initiating the actual stream processing.},

The smart networks are characterized with heterogeneity, structural complexity, and dynamic topology that are causing the new security threats. For them, the conventional methods of intrusion detection take a poor effect. Our study sets a comprehensive approach that aggregates the artificial intelligence (AI) based protection erecting a multimodal intrusion prevention approach. It combines the advanced artificial neural networks for effective classification of the security intrusions on the big datasets, the bioinformatics algorithms for the similarity matching of the operational sequences, and the swarm intelligence for the higher trustiness of the interhost communications. Our solution has shown the higher effectiveness than a traditional technique of the intensive data processing.},

abstract = {Gathering and processing data is essential as it concerns (road) traffic surveillance and management. Nevertheless, most of the current solutions concerning this are either insufficiently aligned with the corresponding real-life business processes, or are too expensive, or are not enough "interdisciplinary". We propose an approach that is claimed to be not only easy-to-implement but also not expensive to facilitate. The approach allows for clustering the "observed" moving vehicles and the data gathering is essentially based on a Forward Scattering (FS) radar. Such a solution offers a number of features such as: relatively simple hardware, an enhanced target radar cross section (compared to traditional radar), a long coherent interval of the receiving signal, robustness to stealth technology, and possible operation using non-cooperative transmitters. Further, a FS-based vehicle detection would not pollute the radio distribution with additional radio signals. Finally, the presence of GPS signals anywhere allows for a worldwide use. The data-analytics-related tasks (that are essentially driven by Machine Learning) are realized using tools, such as IBM SPSS Statistics and K-Means Cluster Analysis. The strengths of the proposed approach are partially justified by experimental data that is however only limited to the approach itself. Said otherwise, broader validation studies have not yet been conducted, such that the proposed approach is "compared" to other existing solutions. This is planned as future research. Still, the initial results obtained inspire us already to expect that the proposed signal processing of GPS signal shadows combined with Machine Learning can be successfully applied in practice for clustering moving objects in general, and in particular - for clustering vehicles in the context of road traffic.},

abstract = {Recent emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning have been promising enormous economic and societal benefits. While it is desirable to deploy these technologies to Internet-of-Things (IoT) infrastructures in many applications such as medical, energy, transportation, and industrial automation systems, such deployments present daunting challenges in performance, efficiency, and dependability of scaling-up IoT infrastructure, due to the ever-increasing number of edge devices, ever-increasing levels of device and system heterogeneity, and more stringent requirements of reliability, robustness, and security in mission-critical settings. This position paper elaborates the needs for a cross-layer and full hardware/software stack solution for the design and deployment of scalable, secure, and smart mission-critical IoT systems from four different perspectives and research fields. We present a review of recent studies on such issues and identify the potential challenges and gaps, based on which we highlight some important research directions and future works that can be conducted to tackle such challenges.},

abstract = {Edge computing is rapidly changing the IoT-Cloud landscape. Various testbeds are now able to run multiple Docker-like containers developed and deployed by end-users on edge devices. However, this capability may allow an attacker to deploy a malicious container on the host and compromise it. This paper presents a dataset based on the Linux Auditing System, which contains malicious and benign container activity. We developed two malicious scenarios, a denial of service and a privilege escalation attack, where an adversary uses a container to compromise the edge device. Furthermore, we deployed benign user containers to run in parallel with the malicious containers. Container activity can be captured through the host system via system calls. Our time series auditd dataset contains partial labels for the benign and malicious related system calls. Generating the dataset is largely automated using a provided AutoCES framework. We also present a semi-supervised machine learning use case with the collected data to demonstrate its utility. The dataset and framework code are open-source and publicly available.},

abstract = {Existing parking recommendation solutions mainly focus on finding and suggesting parking spaces based on the unoccupied options only. However, there are other factors associated with parking spaces that can influence someone’s choice of parking such as fare, parking rule, walking distance to destination, travel time, likelihood to be unoccupied at a given time. More importantly, these factors may change over time and conflict with each other which makes the recommendations produced by current parking recommender systems ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel problem called multi-objective parking recommendation. We present a solution by designing a multi-objective parking recommendation engine called MoParkeR that considers various conflicting factors together. Specifically, we utilise a non-dominated sorting technique to calculate a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, consisting of recommended trade-off parking spots. We conduct extensive experiments using two real-world datasets to show the applicability of our multi-objective recommendation methodology. },

Therefore, adopting new approaches for minimizing energy consumption seems to be the relevant solution. Renewable energy sources, such as geothermal energy is a promising technique that could be integrated together with the HVAC systems in order to save energy. In this paper, we propose a new approach towards an integrated system using Earth to Air Heat exchanger together with active HVAC systems operated and controlled by IoT and Big Data technologies.

Although data lake is well adopted in the computer science industry, its acceptance by the research community is still in its infancy stage. This paper sheds light on existing works for performing analysis and predictions on data placed in data lakes.

The management of data in an ultra-scale network which is continuously expanding leads to concerns in data analytics and management. The researchers have examined the challenge of interoperability of applications and services among IoT applications to address them. The common problems of interoperability come from different levels, from syntactic to semantic.

MacroBase provides a set of highly-optimized, modular operators for streaming feature transformation, classification, and explanation. Users can leverage these optimized operators to construct efficient pipelines tailored for their use case.

abstract = {Anomaly detection in the city scenario is a fundamental computer vision task and plays a critical role in city management and public safety. Although it has attracted intense attention in recent years, it remains a very challenging problem due to the complexity of the city environment, the serious imbalance between normal and abnormal samples, and the ambiguity of the concept of abnormal behavior. In this paper, we propose a modularized framework to perform general and specific anomaly detection. A video segment extraction module is first employed to obtain the candidate video segments. Then an anomaly classification network is introduced to predict the abnormal score for each category. A category-sensitive abnormal filter is concatenated after the classification model to filter the abnormal event from the candidate video clips. It is helpful to alleviate the impact of the imbalance of abnormal categories in the test phase and obtain more accurate localization results. The experimental results reveal that our framework obtains a 66.41 MF1 in the test set of the CitySCENE Challenge 2020, which ranks first in the specific anomaly detection task.},

ROIs are defined in this work as faces, with the application of a face detection algorithm. Background Images (BGI) are also detected with the aim of reducing bitrate in coding blocks belonging to these areas. Finally, the proposed scheme also applies an early decision method intending to reduce coding time. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is capable of improving the image quality in 0.99 dB in ROIs, reaching an improvement of 1.16 dB in the best case. Also, the scheme achieves an encoding time reduction of up to 55% (about 5.5%, on average) with unexpressive variations in the required bitrate.},

In this context, smart water management can facilitate activities within the smart home. User privacy protection is vital in this environment to provide adaptive data collection and usage. In this paper, we introduce our vision towards user privacy protection in this setting by specifying and considering user privacy preferences, and we present our ongoing work and its initial results. The current work is being conducted in the framework of the TAMIT research project.

First-hand accounts from drivers witnessing an incident is an invaluable source of information for traffic managers. Nowadays, drivers increasingly contact control rooms through social media to report on journey times, accidents or road weather conditions. These new interactions allow traffic controllers to engage users, and in particular to query them for information rather than passively collecting it. Querying participants presents the challenge of which users to probe for updates about a specific situation. In order to maximise the probability of a user responding and the accuracy of the information, we propose a strategy which takes into account the engagement levels of the user, the mobility profile and the reputation of the user. We provide an analysis of a real-world user corpus of Twitter users contributing updates to LiveDrive, a Dublin based traffic radio station.},

Due to the complicated decentralization and heterogeneous environment present in IoT, the security and privacy of the data becomes a challenging job for the developers. The current methods are not suitable for these scenarios where a decentralized and heterogeneous system exists. This paper provides a new method for access control in IoT based on the booming technology "Block Chain," which helps the user in accessing or controlling their data. The contribution consists of a description of the model used to show how a blockchain is used for creating access control methods. To implement the method, the blockchain is taken as the decentralized access manager. The proposed method is validated with respect to the previous related work. Finally, the limitations and future work of the paper are discussed. Access Control Systems are proved to provide access control to critical resources. The right to access the resources is defined by the access control policies that are executed during the access request time.},

However, today's GIS are not designed for such big data demands and require new methodologies to effectively model uncertainty and generate meaningful knowledge. As a consequence, we introduce BigGIS, a predictive and prescriptive spatio-temporal analytics platform, that symbiotically combines big data analytics, semantic web technologies and visual analytics methodologies.

abstract = {In recent years there has been significant development in the area of distributed stream processing systems (DSPS) such as Apache Storm, Spark, and Flink. These systems allow complex queries on streaming data to be distributed across multiple worker nodes in a cluster.DSPS often provide the tools to add/remove resources and take advantage of cloud infrastructure to scale their operation. However, the decisions behind this are generally left to the administrators of these systems. There have been several studies focused on finding optimal operator deployments of DSPS operators across a cluster. However, these systems often do not optimise with regard to a given Service Level Agreement (SLA) and where they do, they do not take incoming workload into account. To our knowledge there has been little or no work based around proactively scaling the DSPS with regard to incoming workload in order to maintain SLAs.This PhD will focus on predicting incoming workloads using time series analysis. In order to assess whether a given predicted workload will breach a SLA the response of a DSPS work flow to incoming workload will be modelled using a queuing theory approach. The intention is to build a system that can tune the parameters of this queuing theoretic model, using output metrics such as end-to-end latency and throughput, as the DSPS is running. The end result will be a system that can identify potential SLA breaches before they happen, and initiate a proactive scaling response.Initially, Apache Storm will be used as the test DSPS, however it is anticipated that the system developed during this PhD will be applicable to other DSPS that use a graph-based description of the streaming work flow e.g. Apache Spark and Flink.},

abstract = {Smart home equipped with sensors and electronic devices as a Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) offers great research perspective to explore communication, computation and controlling of physical devices by using real-time processing and analytics. Since CPS like smart home involves the integration of several types of sensors and equipment, therefore reliability, maintainability, security, data storage and cost-effectiveness are some of the critical issues to be addressed. In addition, interactivity and dynamic feedback, context correlation with respect to streaming events and uncertainties in event composition are also identified as major challenging issues. In the present research, a model for CPS is proposed which is a voice-controlled smart home. Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays an important role in dialog system for identifying semantic components in user utterance. The research work includes stream processing, data collection, identification of actions from voice utterance and event-based real-time decision making. The study includes deployment of various sensors and actuators for performing various actions based on voice commands. Raspberry Pi [19] is used as a central node to which various sensors and equipment are connected. It receives voice command from android device and identifies the various intents and slots from the input utterance.},

abstract = { This paper proposes a method for multi-query optimization for distributed RDF stream processing systems. Due to the recent advances of IoT (internet of things) and CPS (cyber-physical systems), the edge computing environment becomes rich in computational resources, and the popularity of RDF stream has been increasing due to its high expressivity. To deal with massive RDF streams on the server-side, distributed RDF stream systems have been intensively studied, where many user queries are processed simultaneously using multiple computing nodes. For making query processing more efficient, it is important to cope with the changes of RDF streams in data rate and data distribution. However, the state-of-the-art methods cannot cope with it. To this problem, we propose a cost model for distributed RDF query processing and a dynamic load-balancing method based on the model. The experimental study shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing method even when the data rate and data distribution of RDF stream changes.},

abstract = {Supply chain management is critical in industrial efforts to reduce costs and time, stabilize product supply, and improve profitability. Surveillance cameras play a significant role in supply chain management, as they can record work activities to achieve appropriate monitoring of company operations. A solution for ensuring the reliability of the video taken by a surveillance camera is to achieve data integrity using a cryptographic algorithm. Another important solution is the identification of a surveillance camera to ensure the traceability of video. This paper proposes a novel approach for video-based fingerprint extraction and key generation, that can be used for camera PUF construction. Our experiment shows that a 256-bit key can be extracted from 50 frames of a normal video with a resolution of 800 X 600 pixels, and we theoretically prove that our methodology satisfies the randomness, uniqueness, steadiness, and unpredictability requirements. Our PUF construction can thus be used to identify a surveillance camera from a video.},
