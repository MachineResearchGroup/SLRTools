abstract = {Thanks to recent progresses in mobile payment, IoT, electric motors, batteries and location-based services, Dockless E-scooter Sharing (DES) has become a popular means of last-mile commute for a growing number of (smart) cities. As e-scooters are getting deployed dynamically and flexibly across city regions that expand and/or shrink, with subsequent social, commercial and environmental evaluation, accurate prediction of the distribution of e-scooters given reconfigured regions becomes essential for the city planners and service providers. To meet this need, we propose GCScoot, a novel dynamic flow distribution prediction for reconfiguring urban DES systems. Based on the real-world datasets with reconfiguration, we analyze the mobility features of the e-scooter distribution and flow dynamics for the data-driven designs. To adapt to dynamic reconfiguration of DES deployment, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph capsule neural network within GCScoot to predict the future dockless e-scooter flows given the reconfigured regions. GCScoot preprocesses the historical spatial e-scooter distributions into flow graph structures, where discretized city regions are considered as nodes and their mutual flows as edges. Given data-driven designs regarding distance, ride flows and region connectivity, the dynamic region-to-region correlations embedded within the temporal flow graphs are captured through the graph capsule neural network which accurately predicts the DES flows. We have conducted extensive empirical studies upon three different e-scooter datasets (&gt;2.8 million rides in total) in populous US cities including Austin TX, Louisville KY and Minneapolis MN. The evaluation results have corroborated the accuracy and effectiveness of GCScoot in predicting dynamic distribution of dockless e-scooters’ mobility.},

abstract = {Spatial-temporal prediction is a fundamental problem for constructing smart city, which is useful for tasks such as traffic control, taxi dispatching, and environment policy making. Due to data collection mechanism, it is common to see data collection with unbalanced spatial distributions. For example, some cities may release taxi data for multiple years while others only release a few days of data; some regions may have constant water quality data monitored by sensors whereas some regions only have a small collection of water samples. In this paper, we tackle the problem of spatial-temporal prediction for the cities with only a short period of data collection. We aim to utilize the long-period data from other cities via transfer learning. Different from previous studies that transfer knowledge from one single source city to a target city, we are the first to leverage information from multiple cities to increase the stability of transfer. Specifically, our proposed model is designed as a spatial-temporal network with a meta-learning paradigm. The meta-learning paradigm learns a well-generalized initialization of the spatial-temporal network, which can be effectively adapted to target cities. In addition, a pattern-based spatial-temporal memory is designed to distill long-term temporal information (i.e., periodicity). We conduct extensive experiments on two tasks: traffic (taxi and bike) prediction and water quality prediction. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model over several competitive baseline models.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of big data, smart city and artificial intelligence, anomaly detection technology for data streams has been widely used in big data detection, video surveillance, network intrusion detection, intelligent security analysis and so on. Among them, the distance-based data streams anomaly detection algorithm is well received by researchers because it can adapt well to the infinite growth of data streams. However, the existing distance-based detection algorithm needs to manually estimate the specific value of the detection threshold parameter according to the historical data, which seriously affects the detection efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, this paper introduces the extreme value theory and proposes a data streams anomaly detection algorithm based on self-set threshold with extreme value theory (ESOD).The algorithm can not only automatically set the detection threshold, but also update the threshold in real time according to the detection data to adapt to the data streams environment of concept drift. After theoretical analysis and experimental verification, ESOD algorithm has good usability and high efficiency.},

abstract = {Event detection is gaining increasing attention in smart cities research. Large-scale mobility data serves as an important tool to uncover the dynamics of urban transportation systems, and more often than not the dataset is incomplete. In this article, we develop a method to detect extreme events in large traffic datasets, and to impute missing data during regular conditions. Specifically, we propose a robust tensor recovery problem to recover low-rank tensors under fiber-sparse corruptions with partial observations, and use it to identify events, and impute missing data under typical conditions. Our approach is scalable to large urban areas, taking full advantage of the spatio-temporal correlations in traffic patterns. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve the tensor recovery problem based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Compared with existing l1 norm regularized tensor decomposition methods, our algorithm can exactly recover the values of uncorrupted fibers of a low-rank tensor and find the positions of corrupted fibers under mild conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate that our algorithm can achieve exact recovery and outlier detection even with missing data rates as high as 40% under 5% gross corruption, depending on the tensor size and the Tucker rank of the low rank tensor. Finally, we apply our method on a real traffic dataset corresponding to downtown Nashville, TN and successfully detect the events like severe car crashes, construction lane closures, and other large events that cause significant traffic disruptions.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach for automation of interpretable feature selection for Internet Of Things Analytics (IoTA) using machine learning (ML) techniques. Authors have conducted a survey over different people involved in different IoTA based application development tasks. The survey reveals that feature selection is the most time consuming and niche skill demanding part of the entire workflow. This paper shows how feature selection is successfully automated without sacrificing the decision making accuracy and thereby reducing the project completion time and cost of hiring expensive resources. Several pattern recognition principles and state of art (SoA) ML techniques are followed to design the overall approach for the proposed automation. Three data sets are considered to establish the proof-of-concept. Experimental results show that the proposed automation is able to reduce the time for feature selection to 2 days instead of 4 -- 6 months which would have been required in absence of the automation. This reduction in time is achieved without any sacrifice in the accuracy of the decision making process. Proposed method is also compared against Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model as most of the state of the art works on IoTA uses MLP based Deep Learning. Moreover the feature selection method is compared against SoA feature reduction technique namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its variants. The results obtained show that the proposed method is effective.},

As a crucial step in event extraction, event trigger identification, assigning words with suitable trigger category, has recently attracted substantial attention. As triggers are scattered in large corpus, traditional linguistic parsers are hard to generate syntactic features from them. Thereby, trigger sparsity problem restricts the model's learning process and becomes one of the main hinder in trigger identification. In this paper, we employ Noise Contrastive Estimation with Multi-Layer Perceptron model for solving triggers’ sparsity problem. Meanwhile, in the light of recent advance in word distributed representation, word-embedding feature generated by language model is utilized for semantic and syntactic information extraction. Finally, experimental study on commonly used MLEE dataset against baseline methods has demonstrated its promising result.},

abstract = {Real estate appraisal refers to the process of developing an unbiased opinion for real property's market value, which plays a vital role in decision-making for various players in the marketplace (e.g., real estate agents, appraisers, lenders, and buyers). However, it is a non-trivial task for accurate real estate appraisal because of three major challenges: (1) The complicated influencing factors for property value; (2) The asynchronously spatiotemporal dependencies among real estate transactions; (3) The diversified correlations between residential communities. To this end, we propose a Multi-Task Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning (MugRep) framework for accurate real estate appraisal. Specifically, by acquiring and integrating multi-source urban data, we first construct a rich feature set to profile the real estate from multiple perspectives~(e.g., geographical distribution, human mobility distribution, and resident demographics distribution). Then, an evolving real estate transaction graph and a corresponding event graph convolution module are proposed to incorporate asynchronously spatiotemporal dependencies among real estate transactions. Moreover, to further incorporate valuable knowledge from the view of residential communities, we devise a hierarchical heterogeneous community graph convolution module to capture diversified correlations between residential communities. Finally, an urban district partitioned multi-task learning module is introduced to generate differently distributed value opinions for real estate. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MugRep and its components and features.},

abstract = {Identifying hot spots of moving vehicles in an urban area is essential to many smart city applications. The practical research on hot spots in smart city presents many unique features, such as highly mobile environments, supremely limited size of sample objects, and the non-uniform, biased samples. All these features have raised new challenges that make the traditional density-based clustering algorithms fail to capture the real clustering property of objects, making the results less meaningful. In this paper we propose a novel, non-density-based approach called mobility-based clustering. The key idea is that sample objects are employed as "sensors" to perceive the vehicle crowdedness in nearby areas using their instant mobility, rather than the "object representatives". As such the mobility of samples is naturally incorporated. Several key factors beyond the vehicle crowdedness have been identified and techniques to compensate these effects are proposed. We evaluate the performance of mobility-based clustering based on real traffic situations. Experimental results show that using 0.3% of vehicles as the samples, mobility-based clustering can accurately identify hot spots which can hardly be obtained by the latest representative algorithm UMicro.},

In smart spaces, one fundamental service that needs to be provided is accurate and unobtrusive user identification. In this work, to address this challenge, we propose a Gait Recognition as a Service (GRaaS) model, which is an instantiation of the traditional Sensing as a Service (S2aaS) model, and is specially deigned for user identification using gait in smart spaces. To illustrate the idea, a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-based gait recognition service is designed and implemented following the GRaaS concept. Novel tag selection algorithms and attention-based Long Short-term Memory (At-LSTM) models are designed to realize the device layer and edge layer, achieving a robust recognition with 96.3% accuracy. Extensive evaluations are provided, which show that the proposed service has accurate and robust performance and has great potential to support future smart space applications.},

Since its inception in 2000, the DDDAS concept has been successfully applied to a host of application areas. New technologies are emerging such as big data, the Internet of Things, and cloud/edge computing. With these trends DDDAS is poised to have large-scale impacts in areas such as smart cities, manufacturing, health care, and security, to name a few.

abstract = {In the future smart living spaces the users will face more and more misunderstanding situations. In this paper we present an original scenario showing three aspects: the misunderstanding situations, the purpose requests and the causality requests. Autonomic computing is an approach to overcome the massive development of the Internet and the growing complexity of resources and services management in the IT domain. We state that since the smart-home has to self-managed they need to be autonomic. As a contribution we introduce a model that extends the autonomic architecture in order to manage misunderstanding situations and facilitate the sensemaking processes in the Autonomic Smart-Home. We name this extension IHMUNE which stands for Intelligent Home Manager for Understandable Novel Experiences. Then we discuss about the different kinds of collaborations that will arise in the smart-cities, the privacy concerns and the sensemaking.},

abstract = {Because of the powerful computing and storage capability in cloud computing, machine learning as a service (MLaaS) has recently been valued by the organizations for machine learning training over some related representative datasets. When these datasets are collected from different organizations and have different distributions, multi-task learning (MTL) is usually used to improve the generalization performance by scheduling the related training tasks into the virtual machines in MLaaS and transferring the related knowledge between those tasks. However, because of concerns about privacy breaches (e.g., property inference attack and model inverse attack), organizations cannot directly outsource their training data to MLaaS or share their extracted knowledge in plaintext, especially the organizations in sensitive domains. In this article, we propose a novel privacy-preserving mechanism for distributed MTL, namely NOInfer, to allow several task nodes to train the model locally and transfer their shared knowledge privately. Specifically, we construct a single-server architecture to achieve the private MTL, which protects task nodes’ local data even if  n-1  out of  n  nodes colluded. Then, a new protocol for the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is designed to perform the privacy-preserving model training, which resists the inference attack through the intermediate results and ensures that the training efficiency is independent of the number of training samples. When releasing the trained model, we also design a differentially private model releasing mechanism to resist the membership inference attack. Furthermore, we analyze the privacy preservation and efficiency of NOInfer in theory. Finally, we evaluate our NOInfer over two testing datasets and evaluation results demonstrate that NOInfer efficiently and effectively achieves the distributed MTL.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing fast and is gaining significant adoption in areas such as smart cities and manufacturing. The variety and low-cost of IoT devices with excellent audio/visual sensors is fueling the growth of multimedia IoT applications, many of which are bandwidth-hungry and time-sensitive (i.e., must produce their results within an application specific time-sensitive requirement). While a large body of related work has studied distribution of such Time Sensitive Multimedia IoT (TS-MIoT) applications in simulated environments, there is lack of a platform that can be used to experiment with techniques for meeting their time-sensitive and computing resource requirements on real-world IoT infrastructure, i.e., a combination of IoT devices, close by computers and a cloud data centre connected by a variety of networks. This paper proposes APOLLO, a platform for experimental analysis of TS-MIoT applications. APOLLO provides mechanisms to load TS-MIoT application execution plans and execute the plans on available IoT infrastructure. We describe a proof-of-concept implementation using Orleans and present experimental evaluations to validate APOLLO's ability to support the experimental analysis of TS-MIoT applications.},

abstract = {Open government is definitely not a new concept. For almost a decade, countries around the world have been implementing open government initiatives as a way to increase transparency, improved accountability, fight corruption, or foster economic development. However, there is still no consensus about the constitutive dimensions of open government and how they are perceived by public managers in different contexts. Based on a systematic literature review and a survey administered to Spanish local governments, this paper discusses the concept of Open Government (OG) and its dimensions. According to our results, public managers working on OG initiatives perceive OG through three different lenses: a) democratic values of co-responsibility, b) technological innovation, and c) availability and access to information. This new categorization of OG perspectives provides a valuable contribution to the scientific debate about what OG is and how this new public management strategy is perceived by local government managers.},

abstract = {Clustering is a fundamental task in Knowledge Discovery and Data mining. It aims to discover the unknown nature of data by grouping together data objects that are more similar. While hundreds of clustering algorithms have been proposed, many are complex and do not scale well as more data become available, making then inadequate to analyze very large datasets. In addition, many clustering algorithms are sequential, thus inherently difficult to parallelize. We propose PatchWork, a novel clustering algorithm to address those issues. PatchWork is a distributed density clustering algorithm with linear computational complexity and linear horizontal scalability. It presents several desirable characteristics in knowledge discovery, in particular, it does not require a priori the number of clusters to identify, and offers a natural protection against outliers and noise. In addition, PatchWork makes it possible to discover spatially large clusters instead of dense clusters only. PatchWork relies on the map/reduce paradigm to parallelize computations and was implemented using Apache Spark, the distributed computation framework. As a result, PatchWork can cluster a billion points in a few minutes only, a 40x improvement over the distributed implementation of k-means in Spark MLLib.},

abstract = {Age of information has been recently proposed to quantify the freshness of information, e.g., in cyber-physical systems, where it is of critical importance. Motivated by wireless camera networks where multi-view image processing is required, in this paper we propose to extend the concept of age of information to capture packets carrying correlated data. We consider a system consisting of wireless camera nodes with overlapping fields of view and a set of processing nodes, and address the problem of the joint optimization of processing node assignment and camera transmission scheduling, so as to minimize the maximum peak age of information from all sources. We formulate the multi-view age minimization MVAM problem, and prove its NP-hardness under the two widely used interference models as well as with given candidate transmitting groups. We provide fundamental results including tractable cases and optimality conditions of the MVAM problem for two baseline scenarios. To solve MVAM efficiently, we develop an optimization algorithm based on a decomposition approach. Numerical results show that by employing our approach the maximum peak age is significantly reduced in comparison to a traditional centralized solution with minimum-time scheduling.},

Securing the data shared by the nodes is essential to ensure the integrity and reliable communication.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work focused on revealing the relationship between visual patterns of satellite images as well as streetscapes and commercial activeness. We propose to make use of bag of features (BoF) in the context of computer vision and sparse representation in the sense of machine learning to predict commercial activeness of urban commercial districts. After obtaining the urban commercial districts via clustering, we predict the commercial activeness degrees of them using four image features, namely, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Autoencoder, GIST, and multifractal spectra for satellite images and street view images, respectively. The performance evaluation with four large-scale datasets demonstrates that the presented computational framework can not only predict the commercial activeness with satisfactory precision compared with that based on Point of Interest (POI) data but also discover the visual patterns related.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought great progress to computer vision (CV) technology. As the number of layers in the neural network model continues to deepen, the accuracy of the model is constantly improving, but the computational complexity of the model becomes larger and larger, and the model needs to be trained on GPU or even TPU. The huge amount of com- putation limits the many techniques of deep learning that can only be moved to the cloud and cannot be applied on mobile devices. In order to alleviate this problem, many scholars have proposed a variety of model compression and acceleration algorithms, mod- el pruning is one of the classic algorithms. As a common model compression and acceleration algorithms, model pruning can re- duce network complexity and computation effectively. However, the pruning algorithm generally has a long training time, and the accuracy of the model decreases too fast when the complex task is pruned. In view of this, this paper proposes two improved schemes, which can effectively alleviate the problem that the accuracy of model degradation is too fast, and greatly shorten the training time. When experimenting on a complex task such as the image caption model, the accuracy of the model can remain unchanged basically when the computational complexity of the model is reduced by half.},

These systems have to deal with device-related problems, such as heterogeneity, fault-tolerance, privacy and security. This paper addresses some patterns about some recurring problems when designing and implementing Internet of Things systems. More concretely, the patterns address how to deal with highly-changeable, error-prone and failing devices and their networks. Device Registry demonstrates how to deal with devices that can change over time. Device Raw Data Collector explains how to check the health of heterogeneous devices by a constant collection of raw device data. Device Error Data Supervisor shows how to leverage the continuous data-flow coming from devices to enable error detection and, consequently, processing and handling those errors.

In this work, we exploit for the first time a real and large-scale dataset representing the records of mobile application usage of 5,342 users during 2014. The data was collected by a software agent, installed at the users’ smartphones, which monitors detailed usage of applications. First, we look for general patterns of how users access some of the most popular mobile applications in terms of frequency, duration, diversity, and data traffic. Next, we mine the dataset looking for temporal patterns in terms of when and how often accesses occur. Finally, we exploit the location of each access to detect users’ points of interest and location-based communities. Based on the results, we derive a model to generate synthetic datasets of mobile application usage and evaluate solutions to predict the next application to be launched. We also discuss a series of implications of the findings regarding telecommunication services, mobile advertisements, and smart cities. This is the first time this dataset is used, and we also make it publicly available for other researchers.},

ECC has the potential to provide the cognition of users and network environmental information, and further to provide elastic cognitive computing services to achieve a higher energy efficiency and a higher Quality of Experience (QoE) compared to edge computing. This article first introduces our architecture of the ECC and then describes its design issues in detail. Moreover, we propose an ECC-based dynamic service migration mechanism to provide insight into how cognitive computing is combined with edge computing. In order to evaluate the proposed mechanism, a practical platform for dynamic service migration is built up, where the services are migrated based on the behavioral cognition of a mobile user. The experimental results show that the proposed ECC architecture has ultra-low latency and a high user experience, while providing better service to the user, saving computing resources, and achieving a high energy efficiency.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are providing remarkable technological innovations on fish farming. In this research, we present an automated IoT and AI-based system to improve fish farming. The proposed system uses multiple sensors to measure in real-time water quality chemical parameters such as: temperature, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, etc., from the fish pond and send them on a cloud database to allow fish farmers to access them in realtime with their devices (mobile phone, PC, tablets). The system contains three web applications which fish farmers can use. The first web application enables farmers with realtime visualizations of sensors data, issues alerts and remote pumps controls. Fish farmers can use the second web application for fish disease detection and to receive suggestions for diseases' care. This would help to classify two fish diseases which are: Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome(EUS), and Ichthyophthirus(Ich). The third web application is a digital community platform for knowledge sharing, capacity building, market opportunities and collaboration among fish farmers. Our system can help reduce human efforts, reinforce capacity building, increase fish production and market opportunities for fish farmers.},

abstract = {I am currently the chair of NEOACM (North-east Ohio ACM), a professional chapter of the ACM, located in the state of Ohio in the U.S. founded in 2008. NEOACM is quickly coming up on its 10th anniversary. Our chapter, like most, is dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of information technology, serving both professional and public interests. We accomplish much of our mission by hosting workshops, speakers, and panel discussions that are open to the public. In my capacity as chair, I have had the opportunity to influence the direction of some of the workshops and panel discussions that we host. I've always had a predilection for most things AI and I'm particularly interested in how the descriptions of embedded AI technologies are worded when those technologies are integral to goods and services targeted toward the average citizen or general public. Sure as insiders we throw around phrases like computational linguistics, particle swarm optimization, machine learning, domain ontologies, agent-oriented architectures, etc. all the time because its normal vernacular. But we know in most instances our techno-speak will need to be translated into terminology that's more consumer-oriented once commercial applications start to be generated. It's the gap that I worry about. The translation from artificial intelligence, computer science, and mathematics specific terminology into descriptions that the average citizen will end up trying to grapple with. For instance:},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of deriving recommended resilient and predictive actions for an IoT network in the presence of faulty components and malicious agents. The IoT, combining physical and cyber devices, is formulated as a directed graph with a known topology whose objective is to maintain a constant and resilient flow between a source node and a destination node. The optimal route through this network is evaluated via a predictive and resilient Q-learning algorithm which takes into account historical data about irregular operation, including faults and attacks. To showcase the efficacy of our approach, we utilize anonymized data from Arlington County, Virginia to obtain predictive and resilient scheduling policies for a smart water supply system while avoiding neighborhoods with leaks and other faults.},

abstract = {AI-driven Internet of Things (IoT) use AI inference to characterize data harvested from IoT sensors. Together, AI inference and IoT support smart buildings, smart cities and autonomous vehicles. However, AI inference consumes precious energy, drains batteries and shortens IoT lifetimes. Deep sleep modes on IoT processors can save energy during long, uninterrupted idle periods. When AI software is updated frequently, scheduling policies must choose between interrupting deep sleep and degrading AI inference by delaying updates. Scheduling is challenging because of the stochastic nature of update arrivals, processing needs and updates cannot be delayed indefinitely. This paper studies scheduling policies when (1) updates (tasks) arrive frequently, (2) updates must be processed within staleness limits and (3) energy footprint is the metric of merit. We define a scheduling policy as a sequence of choices that decide when updates are applied. We use random walks to explore the space of scheduling policies and 2K r design of experiments to quantify primary effects and interactions between factors. We conducted 6 2K r tests with 5X replication each. Each test executes 1,000,000 random walks and computes their energy footprint. We simulated multiple IoT, e.g., varying the number of AI inference components from 5--500. The best random-walk policy uses much less energy than 99th and 95th percentiles. First-come-first-serve and shortest-job-first policies use 7X more energy than the best policy.},

In order to solve this problem, we propose an improved algorithm for the Bert model, which shares the first 11 layers' parameters.

It plays an important role in data gathering regardless of time and environment. Amazon Dash button is one of the smart outcomes of IoT technology that started to show in US market in April 2015 to enable users to shop for their frequently requested items by a press of a Wi-Fi connected button. In this paper, we present a survey about Amazon Dash button in terms of the operation itself and its marketing value in Gulf Cooperation council (GCC) countries. We highlight the limitations of its usage to enhance and automate the goods ordering cycle within the same area such as ordering without a prior notice of item price change and other technical or item delivery issues. In addition, we compare Amazon Dash buttons to the common shopping trends available in GCC. This comparison contributes in involving customers' experience while improving a tool to serve their needs. In order to build our work on actual recent data, we have conducted an internet survey that was completed by 144 internet users. We aim to understand how people can perceive these buttons and how we can improve them with extra automation enhancements to help the consumers order their items by a single click or maybe without it. This means that there is a chance to improve the buttons in the future by eliminating the button press and making it completely smart. We can also modify the architecture of the button by adding a GSM connection feature instead of Wi-Fi.},

Differential privacy is widely used in privacy protection due to its excellent privacy quantification properties, but differential privacy as a lossy protection will reduce the accuracy of the machine learning model. This paper proposes a federated learning algorithm based on Gaussian differential privacy, Noisy-FL, which can more accurately track the changes in privacy loss during model training. Noisy-FL can achieve user-level privacy protection while increasing the number of communication rounds compared to the previous algorithm. Experimental results show that the new algorithm can increase the number of communication rounds by 3 times, and when the total number of clients is small, the model accuracy of the Noisy-FL algorithm is increased by 10% compared to the previous algorithm.},

We build an end-to-end system that starts with a news article and parses it to obtain statements made by people in the article; on these statements, we apply a Recursive Neural Network based model to detect whether the statements express an ideological bias or not. The system then classifies the stance of the non-neutral statements. For economic policies, we determine if the statements express a pro or anti slant about the policy, and for technology policies, we determine if the statements are positive or skeptical about technology. The proposed research method can be applied to other domains as well and can serve as a basis to contrast social media self-expression by prominent people with how the mass media portrays them.},

However, the reliance of these devices on energy harvesting presents tight constraints in the quantity of energy that can be stored and used, as well as limited, energy-dependent availability. In this work, we develop Camaroptera, the first batteryless, energy-harvesting image sensing platform to support active, long-range communication. Camaroptera reduces the high latency and energy cost of communication by using near-sensor processing pipelines to identify interesting images and transmit them to a far-away base station, while discarding uninteresting images. Camaroptera also dynamically adapts its processing pipeline to maximize system availability and responsiveness to interesting events in different harvesting conditions. We fully prototype the Camaroptera hardware platform in a compact, 2cm x 3cm x 5cm volume, composed of three adjoined circuit boards. We evaluate Camaroptera demonstrating the viability of a batteryless remote sensing platform in a small package. We show that compared to a system that transmits all image data, Camaroptera's processing pipelines and adaptive processing scheme captures and sends 2-5X more images of interest to an application.},

However, it is impossible to achieve that when a data lake does not have a metadata governance system that progressively capitalizes on all the performed analysis experiments. The objective of this paper is to have an easily accessible, reusable data lake that capitalizes on all user experiences. To meet this need, we propose an analysis-oriented metadata model for data lakes. This model includes the descriptive information of datasets and their attributes, as well as all metadata related to the machine learning analyzes performed on these datasets. To illustrate our metadata solution, we implemented a web application of data lake metadata management. This application allows users to find and use existing data, processes and analyses by searching relevant metadata stored in a NoSQL data store within the data lake. To demonstrate how to easily discover metadata with the application, we present two use cases, with real data, including datasets similarity detection and machine learning guidance.},

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been widely used for prototyping data centers. Evolving it to high-fidelity digital twin is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration by iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using sensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is offloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate design to improve its learning efficiency. With about five hours computation on a 32-core processor, Kalibre achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.81°C and 0.75°C in calibrating two CFD models for two production data halls hosting thousands of servers each while requires fewer CFD solving processes than existing baseline approaches.},

In this paper, we propose an attention-mechanism-based multi-resolution network, which adds an attention mechanism to the High-Resolution Network (HRNet) to enhance the feature representation of the network. It improves the ability of networks with different resolutions to extract key features from images, and causes the output to contain more effective multi-resolution representation information, so that the corresponding point positions of human joints can be estimated more accurately. Experiments on the MPII and COCO datasets, and verification on the MPII datasets, obtained an average accuracy of 90.3% under the PCKh@0.5 evaluation standard, and good results were also achieved on the COCO dataset (with an AP of 76.5). The experimental results show that our network model is effective in improving the accuracy of key point estimation in the human pose estimation task.},

abstract = {The frequency and intensity of natural disasters has increased significantly in recent decades, and this trend is expected to continue. Hence, understanding and predicting human evacuation behavior and mobility will play a vital role in planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. However, existing models are shallow models, and it is difficult to apply them for understanding the “deep knowledge” of human mobility. Therefore, in this study, we collect big and heterogeneous data (e.g., GPS records of 1.6 million users over 3 years, data on earthquakes that have occurred in Japan over 4 years, news report data, and transportation network data), and we build an intelligent system, namely, DeepMob, for understanding and predicting human evacuation behavior and mobility following different types of natural disasters. The key component of DeepMob is based on a deep learning architecture that aims to understand the basic laws that govern human behavior and mobility following natural disasters, from big and heterogeneous data. Furthermore, based on the deep learning model, DeepMob can accurately predict or simulate a person’s future evacuation behaviors or evacuation routes under different disaster conditions. Experimental results and validations demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of our system, and suggest that human mobility following disasters may be predicted and simulated more easily than previously thought.},
