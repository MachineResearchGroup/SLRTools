Since a given VHR RS scene contains several local features, the traditional single-label classification frameworks do not convey the true semantics of the scene. The multi-label classification approaches, on the other hand, is expected to aid in better characterization of the area under consideration. Under the multi-label setup, we find it intuitive to represent a given image as a region adjacency graph (RAG) of the respective local regions. In order to extract discriminative features from such irregular structures for enhanced classification, we model the subsequent supervised learning problem in terms of a novel multi-label deep GCN. We validate the efficacy of the proposed technique on the popular UC-Merced dataset where our framework outperforms with respect to the literature.}

abstract = {The multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) is a widespread phenomenon in real-life scenarios, and in fact it has been addressed from multiple perspectives in recent decades. However, mTSP in dynamic circumstances entails a greater complexity that recent approaches are still trying to grasp. Beyond time windows, capacity and other parameters that characterize the dynamics of each scenario, moving targets is one of the underdeveloped issues in the field of mTSP. The approach of this paper harnesses a simple prediction method to prove that integrating forecasting within a metaheuristic evolutionary-based method, such as genetic algorithms, can yield better results in a dynamic scenario than their simple non-predictive version. Real data is used from the retrieval of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) by tuna vessels in the Indian Ocean. Based on historical data registered by the GPS system of the buoys attached to the devices, their trajectory is firstly forecast to feed subsequently the functioning of a genetic algorithm that searches for the optimal route of tuna vessels in terms of total distance traveled. Thus, although valid for static cases and for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the main contribution of this method over existing literature lies in its application as a global search method to solve the multiple TSP with moving targets in many dynamic real-life optimization problems.}

Enhancement approaches generally use certain filters which generate artifacts or are unable to recover all the objects details in images. Typically, the contrast of an image quantifies a unique ratio between the amounts of black and white through a single pixel. However, contrast is better represented by a group of pixels. We have proposed a novel image enhancement scheme based on intuitionistic hesitant fuzzy sets (IHFSs) for drone images (dronogram) to facilitate better interpretations of target objects. First, a given dronogram is divided into foreground and background areas based on an estimated threshold from which the proposed model measures the amount of black/white intensity levels. Next, we fuzzify both of them and determine the hesitant score indicated by the distance between the two areas for each point in the fuzzy plane. Finally, a hyperbolic operator is adopted for each membership grade to improve the photographic quality leading to enhanced results via defuzzification. The proposed method is tested on a large drone image database. Results demonstrate better contrast enhancement, improved visual quality, and better recognition compared to the state-of-the-art methods.}

Most earlier studies focused on improving accurately of short rang traffic signs detection in manned driving assistance system, while little attention has been paid to distant range traffic signs recognition in the unmanned vehicle. At the same time, it is difficult to detect long-distance traffic signs due to their small size. This paper is oriented to the 5G driven unmanned vehicle scene, proposes a novel framework of Deconvolution Feature Fusion based on the backbone of YOLOv3 (DFF-YOLOv3) to enhance the accuracy of distant traffic signs recognition in a wide visual range for unmanned driving. The proposed framework has combined the deep and shallow feature maps to form a fusion module with a wider range and higher accuracy of distant information in a fixed monocular camera. Specifically, the deep feature map is up-sampled by deconvolution and then merged with the shallow feature map. The convolution module is used to learn the feature, and then through the dimensionality reduction of the convolutional layer to form a deconvolution feature fusion module, which finally replaces the original prediction layer to detect the target. Experimental results are provided to validate the framework, which can improve the recognition accuracy of distant traffic signs without reducing the entire visual range in unmanned vehicles. The result shows that the mean accuracy prediction (mAP) of the proposed DFF-YOLOv3 on distant traffic signs is 74.8%, which is higher than other classic detection algorithms.}

Remote sensing technologies have made great contributions to the analysis of UGSs. However, a comprehensive review of the current status, challenges and potential in this area is lacking. In this paper, we scrutinize major trends in remote sensing approaches for characterising UGSs and evaluate the effectiveness of different remote sensing systems and analytical techniques. The results suggest that the number of studies focusing on mapping UGSs and classifying species within UGSs have increased rapidly over recent decades. However, there are fewer examples of non-tree species mapping, change detection, biomass and carbon mapping and vegetation health assessment within UGSs. Most studies have focused on UGSs (mainly trees) which cover large areal extents, with fewer studies of smaller patches such as street trees, urban gardens, recreational spaces and public parks, even though collectively such patches can cover substantial areas. Hence, we encourage future investigations to focus on a wider variety of different UGSs, particularly small-scale UGSs. We also recommend that research focuses on developing more effective image time series analysis techniques, methods to capture the complexity of UGSs and the use of SAR in studies of UGSs. At the same time, further research is needed to fully exploit remote sensing data within thematic applications such as monitoring changes in UGSs over time, quantifying biomass and carbon mapping and assessing vegetation health.}

Different from pedestrians in upright poses, human bodies at the disaster scenes may appear in images under different planar rotations and hence rotation-invariant detection is necessary. This paper focuses on the computer vision and proposes a new visual feature, i.e. Sector-ring HOG (SRHOG), to facilitate the rotated human detection. The new feature is achieved by modifying the gradient binning and spatial binning based on the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and can express the rotation of image patch into the cyclic shift of final descriptor. Employing it in rotated human detection can avoid the interpolation approximation existing in image rotation and increase the detection performance. Experimentally, we first confirm the sufficient discrimination power of SRHOG in a public pedestrian dataset and further demonstrate the feasibility of bigger detection windows in an extension of this pedestrian dataset. Finally, the high performance of SRHOG for rotated human bodies is demonstrated on a victim dataset which has varied backgrounds, body postures and shear changes.}

The multi-AUV system under consideration has directed topology, heterogeneous uncertain dynamics and system constraints. To achieve the leaders’ formation and followers’ containment, a two-layer control framework is adopted to decouple the FC problem into two subproblems: reference trajectory generation and trajectory tracking. In the upper layer, a distributed estimator is designed for each AUV to generate a reference trajectory in accordance with the FC objective. Subsequently, a model-free trajectory tracking strategy is developed in the lower layer, where adaptive neural networks combined with an auxiliary compensator are involved not only to approximate the heterogeneous system dynamics, but also to preserve the velocity and input constraints simultaneously. Input-to-state stability is employed to analyze the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Finally, comparative simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed two-layer control protocol.}

abstract = {The emerging discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has changed attitudes towards the intellect, which was long considered to be a feature exclusively belonging to biological beings, i.e. homo sapiens. In 1956, when the concept of Artificial Intelligence emerged, discussions began about whether the intellect may be more than an inherent feature of a biological being, i.e. whether it can be artificially created. AI can be defined on the basis of the factor of a thinking human being and in terms of a rational behavior: (i) systems that think and act like a human being; (ii) systems that think and act rationally. These factors demonstrate that AI is different from conventional computer algorithms. These are systems that are able to train themselves (store their personal experience). This unique feature enables AI to act differently in the same situations, depending on the actions previously performed. The ability to accumulate experience and learn from it, as well as the ability to act independently and make individual decisions, creates preconditions for damage. Factors leading to the occurrence of damage identified in the article confirm that the operation of AI is based on the pursuit of goals. This means that with its actions AI may cause damage for one reason or another; and thus issues of compensation will have to be addressed in accordance with the existing legal provisions. The main issue is that neither national nor international law recognizes AI as a subject of law, which means that AI cannot be held personally liable for the damage it causes. In view of the foregoing, a question naturally arises: who is responsible for the damage caused by the actions of Artificial Intelligence? In the absence of direct legal regulation of AI, we can apply article 12 of United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts, which states that a person (whether a natural person or a legal entity) on whose behalf a computer was programmed should ultimately be responsible for any message generated by the machine. Such an interpretation complies with a general rule that the principal of a tool is responsible for the results obtained by the use of that tool since the tool has no independent volition of its own. So the concept of AI-as-Tool arises in the context of AI liability issues, which means that in some cases vicarious and strict liability is applicable for AI actions.}

The optimal number of observations in the geodetic network depended on the observation system's increase in information. During the research, it was noticed that the application of the hybrid approach allowed the selection of only those observations with the highest information content.

These tools have been typically underused in ecological and management studies, among other reasons, because they are highly data demanding. However, our availability to access, register, and store environmental, biotic and socio-economic records has largely improved over the latest decades. Here I discuss the utility of some underused statistical tools to unfold ecosystem responses to environmental change, such as statistics of extremes, multilayer networks, or tools to advert early warning signals. In doing so, I provide a list of R packages suitable to perform these analyses along with a comprehensive list of sites to access to environmental, biotic, and socio-economic records useful to a wide range of ecologists and practitioners. The application of these underused statistical tools, among others, and the full and integrated exploitation of large data sets is a timing task for ecologists and managers if we are to understand ecosystems’ responses to environmental change and to provide evidence-based guidelines to preserve biodiversity while securing the provision of ecosystem services that sustain human welfare.}

Through the proposed PSO, it is possible to obtain safe and efficient routes, avoiding energy waste and maintaining system integrity in several possible applications. The parameters of the proposed algorithm were tuned using the benchmarking functions. The same functions were used to compare the algorithm with those already established in the literature. Once the proposed algorithm showed promising results, it was simulated in four environments, each with different complexities, presenting dangerous regions and terrains unsuitable for robot navigation, and a large number of obstacles or even moving objects. Further, the algorithms used for comparison were also simulated and the EDPSO presented satisfactory results. Through simulations it was possible to notice that the proposed approach resulted in collision-free and planned routes, and the algorithm presented increased exploration features owing to the diversity peaks that occur during the optimization.}

Researchers are constantly working to practically realize this vision, keeping in mind the potential benefits of the integration of technologies like argumentation, logical reasoning and artificial intelligence into IoT. Moving along the same lines, this paper investigates the emerging concept of speaking objects and proposes novel reference architecture for argumentation enabled Social IoT systems. The proposed framework lays out a theoretical foundation for development of future applications in the said domain. Further, to overcome the challenges of conflict resolution in argumentation-based decision making, a game theoretic weighted voting scheme is deployed. To ascertain the validity the proposed model, a smart home assisted living use-case scenario is simulated in MATLAB. The simulations are conducted for both weighted and non-weighted voting schemes in a 4-player cooperative game and their performance is evaluated. Experimental results revealed that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing non-weighted voting schemes in terms of throughput which is improved by 35% for quota, q = 0.5. For higher quota values, a minimum improvement of at least 15% is observed. Therefore, the proposed approach confirms to be an effective scheme for decision making in argumentation enabled Social IoT systems.}

Although multiple studies have used satellite imagery, aerial imagery, and field data individually for some animal species surveys, several technical issues still need to be addressed before full standardization of remote sensing methods for modeling animal population dynamics over large areas. This study is the first to model the population dynamics of livestock in the Longbao Wetland National Nature Reserve, China by utilizing yak estimations from Worldview-2 satellite imagery (0.5 m) collected in 2010 and yaks counted in a ground-based survey conducted in 2011 in combination with the animal population structure precisely extracted from UAS imagery captured in 2016. As a consequence, 5501, 5357, and 5510 yaks were estimated to appear in the reserve in 2010, 2011 and 2016, respectively. In total, 1092, 1062 and 1092 sheep were estimated to appear in the reserve in 2010, 2011 and 2016, respectively. The uncertainty of the presented method is also discussed. Primary experiments show that both the satellite imagery and UAS imagery are promising for use in yak censuses, but no sheep were observed in the satellite imagery because of the low resolution. Compared to the ground-based survey conducted in 2011, the UAS image estimate and satellite imagery count deviated in yak quantity by 2.69% and 2.86%, respectively. UASs are a reliable and low-budget alternative to animal surveys. No discernable changes in animal behaviors and animal distributions were observed as the UAS passed at a height of 700 m, and the accuracy of UAS imagery counts were not significantly affected by the short-distance animal movement and image mosaicking errors. The experimental results illustrate the advantages of the combination of satellite and UAS imagery in modeling animal population dynamics.}

These methods often fail to capture the true scenario beneath the surface of the water if the water is turbid or the satellite image is masked by cloud cover which makes it impossible to see beneath them. As a second line of defense, researchers have used under water videos (obtained either with scuba,snorkel or other visual observations) to assess the ground truth. Lots of man-hours are spent browsing through many hours of video data manually by an expert and assessing the status (presence/absence) which is a very common practice. Here we propose two methods for detection of eelgrass (presence/absence) from under water videos obtained from Roskilde Fjord in Denmark. We extend these methods to show that it can be used as a proxy to estimate coverage of eelgrass in a given area which match well with an expert's estimation. The benefit of using this method is that it is objective, less biased, cost efficient, robust to noisy environment, does not require pixel-level annotated ground truth images and can be used on existing video transects. This method can also detect rare errors from domain expert's visual estimation.}

abstract = {Aiming at the position and attitude tracking of coaxial rotor aircraft (CRA), this paper proposes a combinatorial control method of sliding mode control (SMC) coupled with proportional-integral-derivative control (PIDC). Considering the complete description of flight dynamics, aerodynamics and airflow interference, the dynamical model of CRA is established. The dynamical model is simplified according to the actual flight, then the simplified dynamical model is divided into two subsystems: a fully-actuated subsystem and an under-actuated subsystem. The controller of the fully-actuated subsystem consists of a SMC controller coupled with a rate bounded PIDC controller, while the controller of the under-actuated subsystem is composed of a SMC controller. The sliding manifold is defined by combining the position and velocity tracking errors of the state variables for each subsystem. Lyapunov stability theory is used to verify the stability of the sliding mode controller, which ensures that all state trajectories of the system can reach and stay on the sliding mode surface, the uncertainty and external interference of the model are compensated. Simulation and experiment compared with the conventional PIDC are carried out, the results demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed control method of this paper.}

This is because of substantial illumination variation and geometric distortions (GD), high accuracies and robust matching of multi-module hyperspectral images is a difficult task. Along with, the ground surface variation challenges feature point set identification in quantity and quality, which is a general problem posed by feature set based IR methods. For addressing the problem existing IR model are designed using SIFT and CNN. However, under extreme appearance difference, identified feature point sets extracted by existing IR method might contain higher ratio of outliers, whereas inlier might be insufficient and unequally dispersed. For overcoming research problem, this paper presented a novel and efficient automatic IR method for hyperspectral image. Feature extraction is done using SURF and SIFT descriptors initially then, using K-Nearest neighbour (KNN) graph the mismatch point is eliminated. Further, the positional accuracy is improved using least square sum method. Multi-quadric transformation method is used for attaining better IR quality at the end. The proposed IR method attain significant performance when compared with existing IR method.}

abstract = {The most commonly used method for measuring vegetation cover is visual estimation, which is highly subjective, potentially leading to measurement errors. This poses serious implications to the assessment and continued management of plant species cover, for example in the control of invasive plant species. Morphological analysis of digital imagery has, to date, been primarily applied in the classification of landscape features. Our novel application of morphological image analysis provides an objective method for detection and accurate cover assessment of an invasive alien plant species (IAS), giving reduced measurement errors when compared to visual estimation. Importantly, this method is entirely based on free software. Guidos Toolbox is a collection of generic raster image processing routines, including Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA), which classifies and quantifies features according to shape. MSPA was employed in this study to detect and quantify cover of invasive Petasites pyrenaicus (Winter heliotrope) in digital images of 1 m × 1 m plots. Its efficacy was compared to that of two other methods- GIS Digitisation (used as an accurate baseline) and Visual Estimation (standard method). We tested the limit of MSPA usability on images of varying complexity, i.e. “simple”, intermediate” or “complex”, depending on presence/absence of other vascular plant species and the species richness of plot. Our results show good agreement between all three methods. MSPA measurement of P. pyrenaicus cover was most closely aligned with the GIS Digitisation (concordance correlation coefficients of 0.966). Visual Estimation was less closely aligned with GIS Digitisation (concordance correlation coefficients of 0.888). However, image complexity resulted in differing levels of agreement; with the closest agreement being achieved between MSPA and GIS Digitisation when used on images of lower and higher complexity. MSPA consistently provides higher accuracy and precision for P. pyrenaicus cover measurement than the standard Visual Estimation method. Our methodology is applicable to a range of focal vegetation species, both herbaceous and graminoid. Future application of MSPA for larger-scale surveying and monitoring via remote sensing is discussed, potentially reducing resource demands and increasing cover measurement consistency and accuracy. We recommend this method forms part of vegetation management toolkits for not only environmental managers, but for anyone concerned with plant cover assessment, from agricultural systems to sustainable resource use.}

However, for failure prediction of many complex systems whose dynamic state evolution models involve time-varying parameters, the traditional PF-based prognosis framework will probably generate serious deviations in results since it implements prediction through iterative calculation using the state models. To address the problem, this paper develops a novel integrated PF-LSSVR framework based on PF and least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) for nonlinear system failure prognosis. This approach employs LSSVR for long-term observation series prediction and applies PF-based dual estimation to collaboratively estimate the values of system states and parameters of the corresponding future time instances. Meantime, the propagation of prediction uncertainty is emphatically taken into account. Therefore, PF-LSSVR avoids over-dependency on system state models in prediction phase. With a two-sided failure definition, the probability distribution of system remaining useful life (RUL) is accessed and the corresponding methods of calculating performance evaluation metrics are put forward. The PF-LSSVR framework is applied to a three-vessel water tank system failure prognosis and it has much higher prediction accuracy and confidence level than traditional PF-based framework.}

The time-varying leader node only gives commands to a small portion of the followers. By using backstepping technique and neural networks method, adaptive distributed controllers for each follower node are constructed, which only require relative state information between themselves and their neighbors. The proposed controllers and adaptive laws guarantee that the tracking errors between all followers and the leader convergence to a small neighborhood of the origin. Moreover, by employing the maximum norm of the unknown neural network weight vectors as the estimated parameter, the algorithm proposed in this paper contains only N(N represents the number of the followers) adaptive parameters that need to be updated online. The number of online learning parameters is independent of the number of the neural networks׳ nodes, which reduces the computation burden significantly.

First, the model of the quadrotor is decomposed into cascaded control structure (CCS) with inner attitude control loop and outer position control loop. Second, the saturated control is deployed to confine the thrust force of the quadrotor in the outer position control loop. Then, the inner attitude reference signals can be generated with the outer position control loop through the cascaded control mode. Third, to alleviate the difficulty of the parameter adjustment, HCLPSO algorithm is applied in the control parameter optimization for the quadrotor. The optimization results of the HCLPSO are compared with that of particle swarm optimization (PSO), comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and differential evolution (DE). At last, simulation results certify that the spatial trajectory tracking control of the quadrotor can be successfully achieved with the proposed method.}

In order to guarantee the safety of AUV obstacle avoidance in complex marine environment, it requires an effective guidance law to plan a safe path and a robust control method to force the AUV to follow safe path to avoid obstacles. Based on the dynamical virtual ship principle, an improved guidance law is developed with the dynamic virtual AUV (DVA) principle. This guidance law generates real-time commands for AUV to follow reference path and avoid obstacle. Furthermore, by combining adaptive laws and barrier Lyapunov function, an effective robust control algorithm is proposed to drive the AUV to follow the DVA. The adaptive law is used to approximate the dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances. The barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is employed to guarantee the tracking errors within the preset bounds and thus ensure the safety of the AUV during the obstacle avoidance process. Finally, simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy.}

However, in engineering environmental loads, it is difficult to determine which external load is mentioned above. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved iFEM based on isogeometric analysis (IGA), which can achieve a unified description of the displacement fields under the effect of concentrated load, distributed load, or concentrated-distributed-hybrid load. Initially, B-spline functions of order two are employed to reconstruct the strain fields. Then, the shape function order of translations and rotations are deduced based on the section strain theory. Next, these deduced displacement shape functions are further used to reconstruct the deformation field using strain measurement. Finally, a wing structure is subjected to concentrated and distributed loads in simulation analysis and experimental tests. The result shows that improved iFEM is more accurate and effective than standard iFEM in displacement reconstruction.}

abstract = {Visual attention has recently achieved great success and wide application in deep neural networks. Existing methods based on Siamese network have achieved a good accuracy–efficiency trade-off in visual tracking. However, the training time of Siamese trackers becomes longer for the deeper network and larger training data. Further, Siamese trackers cannot predict the target location well in fast motion, full occlusion, camera motion, and similar object scenarios. Due to these difficulties, we develop an end-to-end Siamese attention network for visual tracking. Our approach is to introduce an attention branch in the region proposal network that contains a classification branch and a regression branch. We perform foreground–background classification by combining the scores of the classification branch and the attention branch. The regression branch predicts the bounding boxes of the candidate regions based on the classification results. Furthermore, the proposed tracker achieves the experimental results comparable to the state-of-the-art tracker on six tracking benchmarks. In particular, the proposed method achieves an AUC score of 0.503 on LaSOT, while running at 40 frames per second (FPS).}

abstract = {The eastern Helan Mountains are one of the most important plantings and production bases for high-quality grapes in China. In winter, grape root is prone to freezing damage owing to natural phenomenon such as early and late frost, and methods to assess disaster risk at the grape parcel level is one of the current research hotspots. However, there are two problems at present; first is the lack of grape parcel maps and second is that scale of disaster risk assessment is limited to the level of administrative divisions and grid systems. Therefore, according to the perennial characteristics of the grapes and clear texture of the open-air grape parcels based on public data sets (Sentinel-2A/B) and high-quality winery address information, combined with Google Earth engine (GEE) platform, Google Earth, and Ovitalmap, this study designs a collection scheme of open-air grape parcel samples and non-grape parcel samples, analyzes the environmental characteristics of the distribution of high-quality wineries, constructs a classification feature database in three aspects (time, terrain, and vegetation), uses the random forest classification method to classify open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains in 2019, and conducts a late frost disaster risk assessment of the open-air grape parcel. The results show that: (1) The high-quality wineries are mainly distributed in the elevation of 1106–1240 m, with the average slope of 0.82°, the organic matter content of 10.79–14.27 g/kg, the P content of 24.87–37.58 mg/kg, the K content of 116–166 mg/kg, the pH 8.38–8.55, N content of 0.65–0.98 g/kg, annual average active accumulated temperature ≥10 °C of 3490–3590 °C, annual average rainfall of 189–201 mm, the annual average sunshine duration of 7.3–7.6 h, annual average air temperature of 8.8–9.4 °C, annual average temperature difference of 12.7–13.2 °C, annual average frost-free period at 263–270 d and annual average relative air Humidity of 50–54%. (2) The overall classification accuracy of open-air grape parcels reached 98.96% and the verification accuracy of ground truth parcel samples reached 87.89%. The open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains are mainly distributed in Helan County, Xixia District, Yongning County, and Qingtongxia City. (3) The highest risk of late frost was found in Xixia District and the lowest risk in Yongning County. Helan County was higher than Qingtongxia City in the medium risk of late frost. The typical small area high risk includes Liangtian Town, the experimental field of Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences in Zhenbeibao Town, Yuhuang Winery in Ganchengzi Village, and the State-run Warm Spring Farm in Helan County. Thus, the sample collection and augmentation scheme are feasible, the open-air grape classification accuracy is high and its result is consistent with field investigation, which can provide accurate parcel-level disaster risk assessment and provide decision support for agricultural departments and farmers.}

abstract = {The environment-induced multi-phase trajectory optimization problem is studied in this paper, and the underwater target tracking task is focused on. The task is finished by an aerial-aquatic coaxial eight-rotor vehicle and is divided into two phases, i.e., the diving phase and the underwater navigation phase. The dynamic model and constraints on angular velocity of rotor in each phase are established to understand the motion characteristic. Then the model of navigation information and terrain matching are contained in the trajectory optimization model to reflect the influence of underwater navigation error on the quality of trajectory. Correspondingly, the forms of collision detection and cost function are changed to adapt to the inaccurate navigation information. To obtain the trajectory with the minimum terminal position error, an improved teach & learn-based optimization (ITLBO) algorithm is developed to strengthen the influence of individual historical optimal solution. Besides, Chebyshev collocation points are applied to determine the locations of control variables. Simulation results demonstrate that the established navigation error-based trajectory optimization model can reflect the real situation of multi-phase task. Especially, it is able to calculate the collision probability between the vehicle and the obstacle when GPS is unavailable underwater, thus ensuring the safety of underwater navigation. Compare to other common effective algorithms, the proposed ITLBO algorithm is in general more suitable for solving this problem because it is swarm-based and can obtain good solution without worrying about the inappropriate values of user-defined parameters.}

Smart Farming uses a large amount of connected technologies producing also a huge amount of data in order to maximize productions by reducing: human efforts, environment impact and wasting natural resources. In this paper, We develop a new data analytic architecture dedicated to Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) to improve in particular the livestock animals production, animals’ welfare, and farming processes. We present a new data processing architecture for a knowledge-base management system (KBMS) allowing to ease decision support and monitoring operations that can help farmers and stakeholders to better exploit data and have a long-term view of the evolution of the knowledge it contains. Our main contribution in the present paper is a new architecture specifically developed for the precision livestock farming integrating a periodical data reevaluation which address the problematic of data conservation and the decrease in data value over time.}

abstract = {The strengthening of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions meant that manufacturing scheduling had to acquire a green approach. The need to reduce energy consumption becomes necessary for companies to achieve sustainable development. Therefore, a new challenge for the scientific community was foreseen, researching new algorithms or knowledge hubs to achieve green scheduling. Green scheduling may be considered one of the principles of green manufacturing, aimed at minimizing environmental damage and energy waste. A review of the literature shows that there are no research works that analyze the scientific development carried out in “green scheduling” through methodologies based on bibliometric analysis, thus the need and the novelty of this research. Based on a dataset formed by 420 scientific documents published from 2006 to 2020 a bibliometric and network analysis is carried out to find the scientific trends, the main relationships according to collaborations and intermediaries, and the research hubs that help to establish the research agenda. The results show that “green scheduling” is a growing research area in the scientific community and in recent years the number of new research topics has experienced considerable growth. This research is developed in Asia, Europe and America, but China stands out as the most productive, collaborative, intermediary, influential and active country at present, through its organizations which are mainly universities, such as Huanzhong University of Science and Technology and Tongji University. However, research development related to green scheduling is carried out in a collaborative environment between institutions located in different countries, allowing countries that are not scientific powerhouses to develop research in the area. The network analysis makes it possible to define the research framework through the clustering of the dataset's research keywords, highlighting that the main areas of research focus on the development of new methods through algorithms aimed at improving energy efficiency in production environments, in areas of computational development such as cloud computing, and in transportation. The most cited research papers, considered the main drivers of knowledge, are published in high-quality research journals, and are mainly developments in scheduling algorithms for different work environments with a green approach. Research findings can provide the academic community with relevant information about green scheduling to make appropriate decisions and become a research agenda for future research.}

Here, in this paper, we propose a path planning with predetermined waypoints method using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. This method computes shortest possible path given the predetermined waypoints from initial position to final position. By using predetermined waypoints which is a collection of coordinates along the pedestrian walkaway, a resulting accessible pedestrian path could be offered to the visually impaired. The system consists of a destination selection process and path planning process. For the destination selection process, a list of available places is given and the user will select the places that they want to visit from the list. The path planning process calculates path length between all nodes which includes predetermined waypoints, start point and final destination using Euclidean distance formula. The PSO algorithm will optimise possible shortest route by minimizing the total cost for path length. The simulation analyses of the proposed method have shown promising results of optimal route for different destinations. Results from this paper will be used further to explore the potential development of path guidance system for the visually impaired people by allowing them to travel independently in an unfamiliar environment.}

The vehicle’s continuous dynamics model is formulated based on the Newton-Euler equation considering time-varying environmental disturbances. Then, a predictive and sliding mode cascade control is developed and applied for motion control of the vehicle to perform cross-domain transitions, especially compensating for the effect of buoyancy variance with feedforward control. Finally, the feasibility and robustness of the proposed control scheme are verified by comparative simulation results with the PID controller.}

At the learning stage, the environment is represented by a cloud of points (3D points) before navigation, each 3D point is associated with a vector of 32 bytes describes the keypoint using ORB descriptor. At the navigation stage, a matching 2D/3D is made between the keypoints extracted from the 2D query image and the cloud of 3D points to estimate the position and orientation of the camera. A new classification for methods using vision-based navigation is presented and an algorithm based on Structure from Motion (SFM) method to estimate location of camera is proposed. This algorithm uses FAST detector to extract keypoints and uses binary local feature ORB descriptor to describe keypoints. These descriptors are compared using hamming distance for matching between corresponding points, so this algorithm is suitable for real time application. With practical implementation in indoor environment, the obtained position error is less than 5cm, whereas the angle error is less than 1.5 degrees.}

abstract = {Although pedometric approaches were taken as early as 1925, the post-WWII development of information technology radically transformed the possibilities for applying mathematical methods to soil science. The most significant development is the digital computer and associated developments in computer science. These allowed statistical inference on large pedometric datasets, e.g., numerical taxonomy of soils from the early 1960s and geostatistics from the mid-1970s, as well as simulation models of soil processes. By the time of the first Pedometrics conference in 1992 sufficient computing power was available for stochastic simulation and complex geostatistical procedures such as disjunctive kriging. In the intervening 25 years computing power has grown to almost magical proportions, allowing individual scientists to carry out complex procedures. A second development is the growth of networking. This facilitates collaboration among pedometricians, rapid communication with journals, collaborative programming and publication, and easy access to resources. A third development is the availability of on-line storage of large datasets, especially of open data, including GIS coverages and remotely-sensed images. This allows pedometricians working on geographic problems to integrate sources from multiple disciplines, most notably in digital soil mapping using a wide variety of covariates related to soil genesis. It also promotes the an open-source movement of collaborative development of computer programs useful for pedometrics. A fourth development is the wide range of digital sensors which provide data for pedometrics; sensors include spectroscopy, electromagnetic induction, and γ-ray detectors., connected to each other and to central data stores. A fifth development is wireless technology, including mobile computing and telephony, again greatly facilitating rapid and extensive data collection – in pedometrics, the more dense the data, the greater the analytical possibilities and the lower the uncertainty. A final development is a global navigation satellite system (e.g., GPS), making accurate georeference of field data a routine part of data collection, and thereby assuring the highest possible accuracy in maps made by predictive pedometric methods. As computer power increases, models can be correspondingly detailed. As sensor networks and remote sensing provide ever more abundant and spatiotemporally fine-resolution measurements, the challenge is to manage this information and maintain the link with pedologic and soil-landscape knowledge, within the context of societal needs for the results of pedometric analysis.}

The linear model of each robot with nonlinear dynamics is found through feedback linearization, while MPC is subsequently applied to the linear model of each robot to perform the formation control. When actuator faults occur in one of the robots of the team, the faulty robot is not able to complete its assigned task anymore due to the fault, and the faulty robot has to get out from the formation mission. An FTCC strategy is designed with the tasks of the WMRs team are re-assigned to the remaining healthy vehicles to still complete the mission but with graceful performance degradation. Formation operation of the robot team is based on a leader-follower approach, while the control algorithm is implemented in a decentralized manner. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the designed algorithm in several fault scenarios.}

Yet, it is worth highlighting the fact that AI as a tool for education has its main roots in the way AI is taught to students, leading to the development of many educational models, seeking to accelerate the learning curve of fuzzy logic concepts and their suitability for control systems. Nevertheless, most of those methodologies are mainly focused on theoretical concepts, without improving disciplinary and transversal competences that are developed through experimental challenges; consequently, knowledge acquisition is incomplete, and the industrial requirements are not fulfilled. Henceforth, this work proposes a model inspired by the Systems Development V-Model, which allows students to understand the entire fuzzy logic controllers design process through an experimental product development process that improves lifelong learning features in students. Besides, this model supports the Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) in students, encouraging new skills development and experience gain for fuzzy logic controllers designs. Moreover, the proposed methodology in this paper, covers the adapted V-model for education to understand the designing process for fuzzy logic controllers, through a Quadcopter case study, selected due to the complexity of the system, which (as supported from the results) also leads to improve the background skills in engineering students. Therefore, results show that this model enhances student’s capacity to develop functional prototypes and promotes technological products development. Then, as validated through an expert review committee within the engineering technical field, this proposal could be easily suited into several engineering topics; such as, Electronic circuits design, Power electronics and so on.}

As such, it is often subject to management practices that aim to influence its ecological, hydraulic or hydrological functions. Remote sensing has the potential to improve knowledge and management of riparian vegetation by providing cost-effective and spatially continuous data over wide extents. The objectives of this review were twofold: to provide an overview of the use of remote sensing in riparian vegetation studies and to discuss the transferability of remote sensing tools from scientists to managers. We systematically reviewed the scientific literature (428 articles) to identify the objectives and remote sensing data used to characterize riparian vegetation. Overall, results highlight a strong relationship between the tools used, the features of riparian vegetation extracted and the mapping extent. Very high-resolution data are rarely used for rivers longer than 100 km, especially when mapping species composition. Multi-temporality is central in remote sensing riparian studies, but authors use only aerial photographs and relatively coarse resolution satellite images for diachronic analyses. Some remote sensing approaches have reached an operational level and are now used for management purposes. Overall, new opportunities will arise with the increased availability of very high-resolution data in understudied or data-scarce regions, for large extents and as time series. To transfer remote sensing approaches to riparian managers, we suggest mutualizing achievements by producting open-access and robust tools. These tools will then have to be adapted to each specific project, in collaboration with managers.}

abstract = {In this paper, we derive an analytical expression for the bit error probability of a multi-threshold (MTh) detector in the downlink three-user non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based vehicular communication system with unknown noise. The MTh detector directly detects the signal of vehicle user with the highest channel gain without detecting the signals of weaker users and removing their effects. It is shown that the bit error probability performance of the MTh detector is superior to that of the successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector in a special case. Then, we propose a blind empirical characteristic function (ECF) based method to estimate the signal levels of vehicle users, required to implement the MTh detector, in unknown noise. Next, we derive an analytical expression for the variance of the proposed ECF-based estimator which is validated via computer simulations. It is shown that the ECF-based estimator is asymptotically unbiased and consistent. Furthermore, we obtain the normalized Cramér-Rao lower bound (NCRLB) for the estimators of signal levels which shows that the ECF-based estimator is almost efficient in small generalized signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) values. Numerical results show that the ECF-based MTh detector outperforms the absolute median-based SIC detector in the mixture of Gaussian and α-stable noise.}

The position and orientation of the adapter ring can be figured out in real-time as well as the unknown radius. Neither additional sensors nor prior knowledge is required, and the orientation-duality problem has been solved. It works well on the partial ellipses and is robust to outliers, noise and occlusions.

abstract = {The topic of this paper evolves on the discourse of digital modeling in landscape design. Current design methods stagger to address physical forms and dynamics present in the environment. This status quo limits possibilities to integrate scientific evidence when developing spatial and aesthetic configurations in urban landscapes. Remote sensing technology such as laser scanning measures physical forms to reproduce them as geo-specific digital 3D models, while dynamic simulation is widely used to predict how scenarios will perform under given conditions. However, there is still a need for a holistic design process that is capable of integrating both the measured physical forms and physical dynamics. This paper presents a novel framework using point cloud modeling to shape design scenarios that are iteratively evaluated for their performance. The proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study in Singapore. New spatial configurations are tested for the site through an iterative and comparative analysis of the design performance. The case study exposes (1) a site-specific design approach by iteratively modeling a laser-scanned point cloud model, (2) a workflow to convert the geometric data from the point cloud models into voxels and meshes, (3) an integration of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation during design development as per-point attributes, and (4) a comparison of the configurations to identify best performing scenarios. This design framework can support city managers, planners, urban and landscape designers to better inform their decision-making process by relying on accurate scientific feedback. By guiding the design process with the consideration of the built environment as a complex adaptive system, it will be possible to improve how open spaces and ecosystem services perform in cities, and to design landscapes that can mitigate dynamic events such as urban heat islands.}

An alternative using still-frame cameras was recently introduced with the Spectral Optical Flow Imaging (SOFI) method. In this research, the SOFI method is extended to multiview measurements of spatial operating deflection shapes. This is achieved by utilizing harmonically controlled illumination to perform an analogue Fourier transform on image-intensity data in multiple camera views. The obtained multiview displacement spectra are combined with geometrical data to perform frequency-domain triangulation and reconstruct spatial deflection shapes. By introducing additional camera views into the image-based measurement, its field of view is extended and the signal-to-noise ratio of the final result is increased. For linear, time-invariant mechanical structures under stationary excitation, full-field 3D measurements of high-frequency vibrations can be performed using a single still-frame monochrome camera. The proposed method identifies displacements in the frequency domain directly on the camera sensor, resulting in orders-of-magnitude smaller data sizes and post-processing times compared with conventional multiview image-based methods.}

abstract = {Safety assessment of road sections and networks have historically relied on police-reported crash data. These data have several noteworthy and significant shortcomings, including under-reporting, subjectivism, post hoc assessment of crash causes and contributing factors, limited behavioural information, and omitted potential important crash-related factors resulting in an omitted variable bias. Moreover, crashes are relatively rare events and require long observation periods to justify expenditures. The rarity of crashes leads to a moral dilemma—we must wait for sufficient crashes to accrue at a site—some involving injuries and even death—to then justify improvements to prevent crashes. The more quickly the profession can end its reliance on crashes to assess road safety, the better. Surrogate safety assessment methodologies, in contrast, are proactive in design, do not rely on crashes, and require shorter observation timeframes in which to formulate reliable safety assessments. Although surrogate safety assessment methodologies have been developed and assessed over the past 50 years, an overarching and unifying framework does not exist to date. A unifying framework will help to contextualize the role of various methodological developments and begin a productive discussion in the literature about how the various pieces do or should fit together to understand road user risk better. This paper aims to fill this gap by thoroughly mapping traffic conflicts and surrogate safety methodologies. A total of 549 studies were meticulously reviewed to achieve this aim of developing a unifying framework. The resulting framework provides a consolidated and up-to-date summary of surrogate safety assessment methodologies and conflict measures and metrics. Further work is needed to advance surrogate safety methodologies. Critical research needs to include identifying a comprehensive and reliable set of surrogate measures for risk assessment, establishing rigorous relationships between conflicts and crashes, developing ways to capture road user behaviours into surrogate-based safety assessment, and integrating crash severity measures into risk estimation.}

In urban areas, noise sources are multiple and tree arrangements are rarely dense. There is a lack of data on the association between the urban tree canopy characteristics and noise in complex urban settings. Our aim was to investigate the spatial variation of urban tree canopy characteristics, indices of vegetation abundance, and environmental noise levels. Using Light Detection and Ranging point cloud data for 2015, we extracted the characteristics of 1,272,069 public and private trees across the island of Montreal, Canada. We distinguished needle-leaf from broadleaf trees, and calculated the percentage of broadleaf trees, the total area of the crown footprint, the mean crown centroid height, and the mean volume of crowns of trees that were located within 100m, 250m, 500m, and 1000m buffers around 87 in situ noise measurement sites. A random forest model incorporating tree characteristics, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, and the distances to major urban noise sources (highways, railways and roads) was employed to estimate variation in noise among measurement locations. We found decreasing trends in noise levels with increases in total area of the crown footprint and mean crown centroid height. The percentages of increased mean squared error of the regression models indicated that in 500m buffers the total area of the crown footprint (29.2%) and the mean crown centroid height (12.6%) had a stronger influence than NDVI (3.2%) in modeling noise levels; similar patterns of influence were observed using other buffers. Our findings suggest that municipal initiatives designed to reduce urban noise should account for tree features, and not just the number of trees or the overall amount of vegetation.}

To achieve superior speed and great discriminative power, correlation filter based trackers are equipped with circulant matrix and fast Fourier transform (FFT), which implicitly use a large amount of samples to efficiently train the correlation filters and contribute significantly to model complexity. However, the number of training samples is significantly reduced when a target's size is small. Consequently, the performance of the resulting correlation filter based trackers may be inhibited. Moreover, how to cope with the scale variations and the tracker drift is still an open problem. In this paper, to address the above problems, we propose a coarse-to-fine tracker which integrates a kernelized correlation filter (KCF) based tracker with detection proposal and a multi-expert based tracker via a simple yet effective Peak to Sidelobe Ratio (PSR) and scale driven schema. Specifically, in the coarse level, the KCF based tracker with detection proposal is used to estimate a target's state in each frame. Then, the PSR and scale variations are analyzed according to the tracking results obtained by the simple KCF based tracker with detection proposal. In the fine level, the complicated multi-expert based tracker will be started for tracking when PSR or scale is lower than a threshold. Based on the simple yet effective PSR and scale driven expert-switching scheme, the proposed coarse-to-fine tracker can select the most reliable tracker in the tracking process. Extensive experimental results on the OTB-50 benchmark demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed tracking method.}

Even though additive manufacturing (AM) technologies possess the capability to personalize final products, they cannot be used for mass production of the 3D printed job on a large scale. Their inability to perform production processes for large-sized objects adds to the disadvantages. Consequently, the industries are hesitant regarding the idea of AM techniques to carry out commercial productions. Therefore, this research-based study aims to efficiently identify and utilize Industry 4.0 technologies to improve AM processes' reliability and mass 3D print smart materials for manufacturers globally. We explore the requirement for Industry 4.0 technologies for AM processes and study the advantages of the application of information technologies (IT) in AM. Further, we analyze how the Internet of Things (IoT) additive manufacturing integrated techniques will benefit the industries and material manufacturers. However, the paperwork is confined to theoretical work. Since automation in AM is a fledgling concept, the available material for research-based study is limited. We conclude that IoT application in AM improves production processes' efficiency followed by reduced manufacturing waste and fulfilled customer specifications. AM has become an essential industrial technique for product innovation and development, therefore, it is necessary to bring reforms to make this technology customer-friendly.}

Due to this structural feature of the high-order systems, adding a power integrator technique is employed in controller design to overcome the obstacle caused by high power of virtual and real control items. Meanwhile, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks are used to approximate the uncertain nonlinearities. An adaptive tracking strategy is proposed for this type of multi-agent systems. It is shown that the suggested control scheme can guarantee the boundedness of all the closed-loop signals and ensure that all outputs of follower agents track the leader signal synchronously. Since high-order non-strict feedback nonlinear multi-agent systems include some existing nonlinear multi-agent systems as the special case, our result can be used to control more general nonlinear multi-agent systems. Finally, a numerical example is presented to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

Specifically, the input video sequences are captured by moving hand cameras which can be any type of consumer-level camera. To mitigate the affections from rolling shutters in videos, a novel video stabilization method is introduced to filter the unstable camera's path, then resulting in a stabilized video for panorama construction. Additionally, a deep local feature-based feature tracking method is proposed to produce feature correspondences between consecutive video frames for camera motion estimation used in both video stabilization and image stitching.

This is a challenging but vital problem as accurate estimation of OD flows is required for several network management tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model for the network traffic matrix estimation problem which maps high-dimension OD flows to low-dimension latent flows with the following three constraints: (1) nonnegativity constraint on the estimated OD flows, (2) autoregression constraint that enables the proposed model to effectively capture temporal patterns of the OD flows, and (3) orthogonality constraint that ensures the mapping between low-dimensional latent flows and the corresponding link flows to be distance preserving. The parameters of the proposed model are estimated with a training algorithm based on Nesterov accelerated gradient and generally shows fast convergence. We validate the proposed traffic flow estimation model on two real backbone IP network datasets, namely Internet2 and GÉANT. Empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models not only in terms of tracking the individual OD flows but also in terms of standard performance metrics. The proposed model is also found to be highly scalable compared to the existing state-of-the-art approaches.}

An annual Sentinel-2 time-series was compared respectively to single-date and single-band datasets derived from this time-series for mapping grassland plant communities in a temperate floodplain located near Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, which is included in the long-term ecological research network “ZA Armorique” (France). At this 475 ha site, 123 vegetation relevés were collected and assigned to seven plant communities to calibrate and validate the Sentinel-2 data. Satellite images were classified using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. Results show that the SVM classifier performs slightly better than the RF classifier (overall accuracy 0.78 and 0.71, respectively). They highlight that accuracy is lower when using single-date (0.67) or single-band images (0.70). The results also reveal that discrimination of plant communities is more sensitive to temporal resolution (Δ = 0.34 in overall accuracy) than spectral resolution (Δ = 0.12 in overall accuracy).}

abstract = {The ability to locate a radio transmitter can be useful in many contexts, and a range of localization methods have been proposed. In the context of cellular networks, the position of the base station is known to the operator and regulator, but often this knowledge is not publicly available. For the problem of base station localization, several approaches have been examined in the literature, and several public services exists which estimate the position of cellular infrastructure based on measurement data collected from cellular users. In this work we present sector fitting, a new approach for locating sectorized transmitters based only on observations of the positions and sector identifiers as reported by the cellular UEs. Sector fitting defines a sectorization model which is applied over a search grid to obtain a cost matrix, which is then merged over multiple frequencies to arrive at the best base station location estimate. An extensive evaluation of sector fitting is carried out, using a large data set of observations from train-mounted LTE modems. The results show that sector fitting outperforms the other applicable localization methods. Furthermore, an iterative grid search approach is examined and demonstrated to achieve the same localization accuracy as a full search while drastically reducing the computational cost. Finally, three downsampling methods are evaluated with the results showing that a trade-off can be made to further reduce computational cost, but with slightly worse localization accuracy in most cases.}

Thus, increasing the automation of the road extraction approaches from remote sensing images has been the subject of extensive research. In this paper, we propose an object based road extraction approach from very high resolution satellite images. Based on the object based image analysis, our approach incorporates various spatial, spectral, and textural objects’ descriptors, the capabilities of the fuzzy logic system for handling the uncertainties in road modelling, and the effectiveness and suitability of ant colony algorithm for optimization of network related problems. Four VHR optical satellite images which are acquired by Worldview-2 and IKONOS satellites are used in order to evaluate the proposed approach. Evaluation of the extracted road networks shows that the average completeness, correctness, and quality of the results can reach 89%, 93% and 83% respectively, indicating that the proposed approach is applicable for urban road extraction. We also analyzed the sensitivity of our algorithm to different ant colony optimization parameter values. Comparison of the achieved results with the results of four state-of-the-art algorithms and quantifying the robustness of the fuzzy rule set demonstrate that the proposed approach is both efficient and transferable to other comparable images.}

Rather than just relying on feedback from the crowd, active learning can intentionally request informative instances to be annotated in surveillance applications. Previous work that combines crowdsourcing with active learning focuses on the scenario with the expert being responsible for the most matching task in common communication surveillance. Compared with similar methods, we propose an innovative approach based on the active cross-query learning scheme, allowing each ordinary worker instead of domain experts to label part of the selected query samples, especially in the networks of smart surveillance. By using the balanced incomplete block design (BIBD), each labeling task is repeated several times to complete the cross-query learning. The generated consensus labels are iteratively added to the existing labeled datasets for training the classifier. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets with our algorithms demonstrate that our method ensures model accuracy and label quality in terms of text classification compared with the several state-of-the art algorithms.}

abstract = {Scene segmentation is a very challenging task where convolutional neural networks are used in this field and have achieved very good results. Current scene segmentation methods often ignore the internal consistency of the target object, and lack to make full use of global and local context information which leads to the situation of object misclassification. In addition, most of the previous work focused on the segmentation of the main part of the object, however, there are few researches on the quality of the object edge segmentation. In this article, based on the use of flow information to maintain body consistency, the context feature extraction module is designed to fully consider the global and local body context information of the target object, refining the rough feature map in the intermediate stage. So, the misclassification of the target object is reduced. Besides, in the proposed edge attention module, the low-level feature map guided by the global feature and the edge feature map with semantic information obtained by intermediate process are connected to obtain more accurate edge detail information. Finally, the segmentation quality that contains the body part of the noise and the edge details can be improved. This paper not only conducts experiments on the classic FCN, PSPNet, and DeepLabv3+ several mainstream network architectures, but also on the real-time SFNet network structure proposed last year, and the value of mIoU in object and boundary is improved to verify the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper. Moreover, in order to prove the robustness of the experiment, we conduct experiments on three complex scene segmentation data sets of Cityscapes, CamVid, and KiTTi, and obtained mIoU values of 80.52% on the Cityscapes validation data set, and 71.4%, 56.53% on the Camvid and KITTI test data set, which shows better results when compared with most of the state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {Timely and accurate estimation of crop yield before harvest to allow crop yields management decision-making at a regional scale is crucial for national food policy and security assessments. Modeling dynamic change of crop growth is of great help because it allows researchers to determine crop management strategies for maximizing crop yield. Remote sensing is often used to provide information about important canopy state variables for crop models of large regions. Crop models and remote sensing techniques have been combined and applied in crop yield estimation on a regional scale or worldwide based on the simultaneous development of crop models and remote sensing. Many studies have proposed models for estimating canopy state variables and soil properties based on remote sensing data and assimilating these estimated canopy state variables into crop models. This paper, firstly, summarizes recent developments of crop models, remote sensing technology, and data assimilation methods. Secondly, it compares the advantages and disadvantages of different data assimilation methods (calibration method, forcing method, and updating method) for assimilating remote sensing data into crop models and analyzes the impacts of different error sources on the different parts of the data assimilation chain in detail. Finally, it provides some methods that can be used to reduce the different errors of data assimilation and presents further opportunities and development direction of data assimilation for future studies. This paper presents a detailed overview of the comparative introduction, latest developments and applications of crop models, remote sensing techniques, and data assimilation methods in the growth status monitoring and yield estimation of crops. In particular, it discusses the impacts of different error sources on the different portions of the data assimilation chain in detail and analyzes how to reduce the different errors of data assimilation chain. The literature shows that many new satellite sensors and valuable methods have been developed for the retrieval of canopy state variables and soil properties from remote sensing data for assimilating the retrieved variables into crop models. Additionally, new proposed or modified crop models have been reported for improving the simulated canopy state variables and soil properties of crop models. In short, the data assimilation of remote sensing and crop models have the potential to improve the estimation accuracy of canopy state variables, soil properties and yield based on these new technologies and methods in the future.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a generic framework for globally consistent alignment of images captured from approximately planar scenes via topology analysis, capable of resisting the perspective distortion meanwhile preserving the local alignment accuracy. Firstly, to estimate the topological relations of images efficiently, we search for a main chain connecting all images over a fast built similarity table of image pairs (mainly for the unordered image sequence), along which the potential overlapping pairs are incrementally detected according to the gradually recovered geometric positions and orientations. Secondly, all the sequential images are organized as a spanning tree through applying a graph algorithm on the topological graph, so as to find the optimal reference image which minimizes the total number of error propagation. Thirdly, the global alignment under topology analysis is performed in the strategy that images are initially aligned by groups via the affine model, followed by the homography refinement under the anti-perspective constraint, which manages to keep the optimal balance between aligning precision and global consistency. Finally, experimental results on two challenging aerial image sets illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach.}

Because of this characteristic, controlling continuum manipulators is more complicated and difficult based on only traditional control theory. Soft computing techniques are solid alternative for improving the control performance of such kinds of robots. In this paper, we employ two types of neural dynamic approaches, i.e., gradient neural dynamics and zeroing neural dynamics, to solve the real-time Jacobian matrix pseudo-inversion problem, thereby achieving model-based kinematic control of multi-section continuum manipulators. Different kinds of neural dynamic models are investigated and their performances in terms of tracking accuracy are shown with and without noise disturbances. Simulation validations with a two-section and a three-section continuum manipulator demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed models.}

This paper aims at scheduling security-critical tasks, which require data encryption and thus incur extra runtime and energy costs, in a MEC system consisting of multiple resource-limited MEC servers. The scheduling objective is to minimize task completion time as well as the mobile device’s energy consumption. We propose two slow-movement particle swarm optimization algorithms to solve the resultant NP-hard problem. Specifically, we develop a position-based mapping scheme to map particles onto scheduling solutions. The mapping method relies on the current best solution and a position-based probability model to generate high-quality solutions that can inherit the good schemata from the current best solution. To prevent the significant change in particles’ positions, we further propose a novel particle updating strategy to slow down particles’ movements, in order to explore more high-quality solutions under the guide of personal best particle and global best particle. Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the conventional particle swarm optimization algorithm in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Performance of the mapping method and the particle updating strategy are also investigated.}

Such practice is relatively time-consuming and expensive due to the challenge from considerable amount of cabling work and installation of data acquisition logger. Two measurement methods based on digital image techniques, digital image processing (DIP) and digital image correlation (DIC), are adopted in this study to identify the cable force with capturing single and multiple points images by camera. To verify the reliability of the methods, the results are compared with accelerometer, and the relative deviations between the two methods and the accelerometers are within 5%. The multi-point vibration mode of stay cable using the digital image techniques was compared to numerical simulation for exploring the role of mode difference in cable force measurement. Experimental results show that the application of the digital image techniques in stay cable bridge is sustainable and advantageous and the differences between various digital image techniques are shown clearly.}

The atmospheric boundary layer is one of the regions where aircraft operation and coordination are critical and therefore atmospheric model performance is also vital. This paper presents conventional and innovative techniques to improve the accuracy in the forecasting of winds in the lower atmospheric layer, proposing mechanisms to develop better models including deterministic and stochastic simulations. Accuracy is improved by optimizing the grid, assimilating observations in cycling simulations and managing a number of ensemble members. An operation-driven post-processing stage helps to incorporate detailed terrain definitions and real-time observations without re-running the model. The improvements are checked against mesoscale weather simulations at different scales and a dedicated flight campaign. The results show good performance of the model without sensitively increasing the required throughput.}

New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.}

The involving impulsive effects, called partial mixed impulses, can be regarded as local and time-varying impulses, which means that impulses are not only injected into a fraction of nodes in networks but also contain synchronizing and desynchronizing impulses at the same time. In order to handle this case, several mathematical techniques are proposed to tackle mixed impulsive effects in discrete-time dynamical systems. Based on the variation of parameters formula, several sufficient criteria are derived to ensure that synchronization of the addressed networks can be achieved in mean square. The obtained criteria not only rely on the strengths of mixed impulses and the impulsive intervals, but also can reduce conservativeness. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of our results for neural networks.}

This data is relayed to the Cloud for processing and analysis due to its large-scale infrastructural capabilities. However, the key goal of the drone deployment in smart city scenarios or urban environments is to provide timely and quick response alongside providing an energy-efficient service delivery. Thus, we need a sustainable solution that can be deployed locally (closer to the data source) in a smart city, to process or analyze the data (generated from smart city sources) and provide timely decision making for smart city applications. Edge computing, popularly known as the “cloud close to the ground”, can provide computational and processing facilities at edge of the network in a smart city. Hence, Edge computing act as an effective alternative solution to process and analyze the data closer to the point of it’s generation. Looking into the above discussion, We propose a novel drone-edge coalesce that provides an energy-aware data processing mechanism for sustainable service delivery in the multi-drone smart city networks. In this model, the edge computing layer is deployed to process and store the data sensed and collected by drones in a smart city. In this context, an adaptive edge node selection mechanism has been designed on the basis of decision tree approach. In this coalesce, we have to deal with the conventional problems related to the collision and congestion while providing low-latency and sustainable data transmission in a smart city. So, We have designed an energy-aware multi-purpose algorithm that avoids collisions and provides a congestion free data transmission. The proposed coalesce is validated in a simulated environment on the basis of several performance metrics such as, throughput, end-to-end delay and energy consumption.}

abstract = {Off-site construction (OSC) is an innovative and sustainable construction method. One of its critical success factors is the proper management of its supply chain (SC). Recently, significant research attention has been focused on the modelling of OSC-SC to improve its performance and sustainability. However, the literature still lacks a comprehensive review of the modelling studies on off-site construction -supply chain management (OSC-SCM). Therefore, this research contributes by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date mapping and clustering of 309 journal articles on the modelling of OSC-SC to identify its trends and gaps, and hence, highlight future research opportunities. To achieve these objectives, a mixed review method, consisting of scientometric and systematic reviews, is used. The scientometric review identifies the most prolific journals, researchers, co-occurrence network of keywords, and their citation bursts. On the other hand, the systematic review classifies the articles based on OSC type and supply chain (SC) stage. At each SC stage, the articles are further classified based on problem settings and solution methods. The results show that production problems have received the most attention (i.e., by 28% of the included articles), followed by on-site construction (19%), design (13%), and logistics (7%) problems. However, researchers are more inclined to address problems at multiple SC stages (33%) due to the interrelationship between these stages. Besides, the systematic analysis shows that OSC-SC problems have been solved frequently by a variety of solution methods such as optimization (25%), simulation (13%) and building information modelling (BIM) (9.5%). However, researchers tend more to integrate multiple solution methods (35%) to address the complexities of OSC-SC problems. Finally, the included studies are classified based on the three sustainability dimensions. The results show that economic, environmental, and social sustainability dimensions have been considered in previous studies by 72%, 24%, and 4%, respectively. Therefore, the study identifies research gaps at each SC stage of each OSC type to incentivize future studies to consider more environmental and social sustainability factors in OSC-SC models. Since modular integrated construction (MiC) has the highest prefabrication level, this study provides future research directions for sustainable supply chain management (SCM) in MiC. The present research is an important reference guide that helps researchers and practitioners to understand different problem settings and their solution methods in OSC-SCM.}

abstract = {Cyber operations are relatively a new phenomenon of the last two decades. During that period, they have increased in number, complexity, and agility, while their design and development have been processes well kept under secrecy. As a consequence, limited data(sets) regarding these incidents are available. Although various academic and practitioner public communities addressed some of the key points and dilemmas that surround cyber operations (such as attack, target identification and selection, and collateral damage), still methodologies and models are needed in order to plan, execute, and assess them in a responsibly and legally compliant way. Based on these facts, it is the aim of this article to propose a model that i)) estimates and classifies the effects of cyber operations, and ii) assesses proportionality in order to support targeting decisions in cyber operations. In order to do that, a multi-layered fuzzy model was designed and implemented by analysing real and virtual realistic cyber operations combined with interviews and focus groups with technical – military experts. The proposed model was evaluated on two cyber operations use cases in a focus group with four technical – military experts. Both the design and the results of the evaluation are revealed in this article.}

abstract = {Accurate estimation of leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) is critical to characterize ecosystem and plant physiological processes for example in carbon fixation. Remote sensing can capture LNC, while interrelated traits and spectral diversity across plant species prevent development of transferable LNC assessment models based on leaf reflectance. Here, we developed a new transfer learning method by coupling transfer component analysis with the support vector regression, namely TCA-SVR, to transfer LNC assessment models across different plant species. We benchmarked the performance of TCA-SVR against a well-established partial least squares regression (PLSR) model with five remote sensing datasets on 60 plant species measured from three spectroradiometers with varied spectral resolutions and illumination and viewing angles. The result showed that leaf reflectance presented the high spectral diversity in different spectral regions, plant species, and growth stages. The combination of visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance (e.g. 550–2300 nm) achieved the optimal LNC assessment across all datasets. Results on the testing datasets showed that the transferability of the PLSR models highly depended on the LNC distribution and spectral features, which were associated with the differences in plant species, spectral measurements, and growth conditions between datasets. These differences led to the large variations in LNC and leaf reflectance, which thus produced the overestimations and underestimations of LNC. Compared to the PLSR model, TCA-SVR greatly improved the transferability of the LNC assessment model by reducing the average root mean square error by 36.76%. Further, the implementation of modeling updating can help TCA-SVR learn the features related to the difference in plant species and LNC ranges by transferring samples from the target dataset to the source dataset. Our model updating approach improved the performance of TCA-SVR and only needed 5% of the off-site samples to supplement the source dataset to achieve an effective assessment of LNC. Refining the proposed method with new remote sensing datasets will aid rapid monitoring of plant nitrogen status and may improve carbon‑nitrogen interactions in existing ecosystem models.}

Aerial images were processed using Structure from Motion software to develop ortho-mosaicked imagery for the study sites.

Model fit estimates has ranged from R2 = 0.6403–0.7584 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 6.34 cm–5.20 cm (relative RMSE (rRMSE) = 17.83–13.44%).

This study suggests the potential for accurately surveying forest attributes through UAS remote sensing, which has important implications for forest monitoring and management.}

Major efforts are being made to implement soil and water conservation measures that counteract soil erosion and help secure vital ecosystem services. However, where and to what extent such measures have been implemented is often not well documented. Knowledge about this could help to identify areas where soil and water conservation measures are successfully supporting sustainable land management, as well as areas requiring urgent rehabilitation of conservation structures such as terraces and bunds. This study explores the potential of the latest satellite-based remote sensing technology for use in assessing and monitoring the extent of existing soil and water conservation structures. We used a set of very high resolution stereo Geoeye-1 satellite data, from which we derived a detailed digital surface model as well as a set of other spectral, terrain, texture, and filtered information layers. We developed and applied an object-based classification approach, working on two segmentation levels. On the coarser level, the aim was to delimit certain landscape zones. Information about these landscape zones is useful in distinguishing different types of soil and water conservation structures, as each zone contains certain specific types of structures. On the finer level, the goal was to extract and identify different types of linear soil and water conservation structures. The classification rules were based mainly on spectral, textural, shape, and topographic properties, and included object relationships. This approach enabled us to identify and separate from other classes the majority (78.5%) of terraces and bunds, as well as most hillside terraces (81.25%). Omission and commission errors are similar to those obtained by the few existing studies focusing on the same research objective but using different types of remotely sensed data. Based on our results, we estimate that the construction of the conservation structures in our study area in Eritrea required over 300,000 person-days of work, which underlines the huge efforts involved in soil and water conservation.}

OBIA is intended to replicate human perception by using a protocol of (semi)automated image segmentation and classification. However, the lack of a theoretical background adapted to the specificities of the archaeological discipline is still preventing researchers from finding a shared language and a common protocol of investigation necessary to allow the comparability of the results. This article discusses a series of crucial theoretical issues linked to the incompleteness and the equi-/multi-finality of the archaeological record and introduces the core concept of Diachronic Semantic Models (DhSM) as a means to integrate the long-term evolution of the archaeological landscape in the conceptual, digital and real-world frameworks of the object-based approach. We also present an assessment of the limits and potential of this method, built from a set of case studies from published and unpublished research. Finally, we propose a general workflow of an Archaeological Object-Based Image Analysis (ArchaeOBIA) project, designed for stimulating the development of an operational routine for object-based applications in archaeology.}

In recent years, Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology achieves rapid development and Micro Electro Mechanical Systems and Inertial Measurement Unit (MEMS-IMU) has aroused wide concern due to its excellent properties in some cases. However, the observations from MEMS-IMU are easy to be influenced by motion state and location environment because of its manufacturing process. It is not easy to judge whether gross errors are in the state model or the observation model by the widely adopted robust filter based on innovation. In this contribution, we present an improved robust filter with a double state model on the basis of the chi-square distribution of the square of the Mahalanobis distance. The vehicle motion model acts as the external constraint information and can be adopted to construct robust statistic with the results from INS mechanization. And then a robust factor was determined to adjust the observation noise covariance matrix. To evaluate the performance of this method, the simulation test and the field test based on locomotive platform of Nottingham Geospatial Institute (NGI) were carried out. According to the results, in the simulation test, the position improvements are 33%, 30% in the north and east directions; in the real test, the loosely and tightly coupled was adopted and the position accuracy can be improved by about 50–60% in the horizontal direction and the improvement of the pitch and the roll accuracy was lower than the azimuth accuracy due to poor observability and experimental scene which is of the characteristics of small elevation change. Therefore, the proposed robust filter could diminish the effect of the gross error from MEMS-IMU and enhance the integrated system.}

To mitigate these challenges, the accurate estimation of states especially the height above the ground, and its rate of change is vital. Moreover, the error of ground effect model can also be estimated and compensated during landing. In this paper, the recently developed continuous ant colony filter is implemented for integrated estimation of states and parameters. The estimated states are used in height control loop. To investigate the closed loop performance of the filter, two control strategies, a classical proportional-integral-derivative controller and a sliding mode controller are utilized and their performance are compared in the presence of ground effect compensation and without it. Also, the error of ground effect model is estimated and compensated in landing algorithm. Finally, a landing procedure is proposed including a ground effect estimation phase before the touchdown. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the landing performance when the ground effect is properly compensated. Moreover, small estimation errors, obtained from the simulations, prove the good performance of the new filter in states and parameters estimation.}

Our research combines, in an original way, the BELBIC methodology with a flocking control strategy, in order to perform real-time coordination of multiple Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The characteristics of BELBIC fit well in this scenario, since almost always the dynamics of the autonomous agents are not fully known, and furthermore, since they operate in close proximity, they are subjected to aggressive external disturbances. Numerical and experimental results based on the coordination of multiple quad rotorcraft UAS platforms demonstrate the applicability and satisfactory performance of the proposed method.}

Its dynamical behaviors are studied through effective tools such as phase diagrams, time histories, Lyapunov exponent, 0-1 test and bifurcation diagram. And its equivalent analog circuits producing regular behaviors as well as complex ones are constructed to further reveal nonlinear dynamics especially chaotic oscillations. In the controller design, the Fourier series and the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) are utilized to reconstruct imprecise reference trajectories, and unknown functions are approximated through the IT2FLS with adaptive laws. The speed function is constructed to improve the transient response performance of the FO MEMS gyroscope, and a tracking differentiator (TD) is introduced to solve the problem of ‘explosion of complexity’. Then, an accelerated adaptive backstepping controller integrating the IT2FLS, speed function and TD into the technical framework of backstepping is proposed here. The stability analysis proves that all signals of the closed-loop FO MEMS gyroscope are asymptotically uniformly bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by abundant results.}

In addition, open loop dynamic responses with different morphing rates are simulated, and a small morphing rate leads to big magnitudes of velocity and altitude variations. During morphing process, both aerodynamic parameters and mass distribution change dramatically, and it causes a difficulty in modeling the morphing aircraft precisely. Therefore, an adaptive super twisting algorithm sliding mode controller is proposed to track reference trajectory after input/output linearization of the longitudinal model. Simulation results show the designed controller works better with good tracking performance and smaller chattering compared with normal sliding mode controller, and the robustness of the designed controller is verified by simulations at the presence of aerodynamic perturbations.}

Different from object detection in natural images, the orientation of objects in aerial images is arbitrary. The axis-aligned bounding box detection, which is always used in traditional object detection methods, will cover a lot of redundant information and deteriorate the detection results when it is used to locate the object in aerial images. Therefore, traditional object detection methods are no longer applicable for aerial images. In order to promote the object detection performance in aerial images, we propose a novel orientation robust object detection model based on rotated non-maximum suppression (R-NMS). In addition, we adjust the anchor setting according to the diversity shapes of the aerial objects to enhance the performance of the model. Our model is tested on the public DOTA dataset, and the mAP is 16.31% higher than the baseline, indicating that our method is very effective and competitive in the object detection of aerial image.}

Sustainable and local production in regions with marginal climates requires cold-adapted varieties that create high yield and protein content in a short vegetation period. Drone-based high-throughput field phenotyping methods allow monitoring the success and the developmental speed of genotypes in such target environments. This study exemplifies that such frequent and precise analyses of remotely sensed canopy growth traits can be used to derive the optimal genotype, a so-called ideotype, for a given mega-environment. For the case example of Switzerland, a country with a temperate oceanic climate, the results indicate that image-derived traits allow predicting yield and protein content from the dynamics of vegetative growth. Genotypes with early canopy cover produce high yield, whereas genotypes that show a prolonged duration until they have reached their final maximum of leaf area index are characterized by a high protein content. Analyses of early performance trial stage material indicate that there are genotypes that combine both features of growth dynamics. Whether these genotypes are then indeed successful in breeding programs remains to be investigated, since this also depends on disease resistance and other traits of those genotypes. Yet, overall, this study provides strong indications of the high value of high-throughput field phenotyping in the context of physiological and breeding-related analyses of crops.}

Change detection (CD) or time-series data analysis in 3D has gained great attention due to its capability of providing volumetric dynamics to facilitate more applications and provide more accurate results. The state-of-the-art CD reviews aim to provide a comprehensive synthesis and to simplify the taxonomy of the traditional remote sensing CD techniques, which mainly sit within the boundary of 2D image/spectrum analysis, largely ignoring the particularities of 3D aspects of the data. The inclusion of 3D data for change detection (termed 3D CD), not only provides a source with different modality for analysis, but also transcends the border of traditional top-view 2D pixel/object-based analysis to highly detailed, oblique view or voxel-based geometric analysis. This paper reviews the recent developments and applications of 3D CD using remote sensing and close-range data, in support of both academia and industry researchers who seek for solutions in detecting and analyzing 3D dynamics of various objects of interest. We first describe the general considerations of 3D CD problems in different processing stages and identify CD types based on the information used, being the geometric comparison and geometric-spectral analysis. We then summarize relevant works and practices in urban, environment, ecology and civil applications, etc. Given the broad spectrum of applications and different types of 3D data, we discuss important issues in 3D CD methods. Finally, we present concluding remarks in algorithmic aspects of 3D CD.}

abstract = {This paper investigates optimal coordination tracking control for nonlinear multi-agent systems (NMASs) with unknown internal states by using an adaptive dynamic programing (ADP) method. Actually, the optimal coordination control for MASs depends on the solutions to the coupled Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations which are almost impossible to be solved analytically. And what’s worse is that the accurate system models are either infeasible or difficult to obtain in practical applications. To surmount these deficiencies, a neural network (NN) based observer is designed for each agent to reconstruct its internal states by utilizing the measurable input–output data rather than accurate system models. Based on the observed states and Bellman optimality principle, we derive optimal coordination control policies from the coupled HJB equations. In order to implement the proposed ADP method, a critic network framework is proposed for each agent to approximate its value function and help calculate the optimal coordination control policy. Then we prove the local coordination tracking errors and weight estimation errors are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) while the approximated control policies converge to their target values. Finally, two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed ADP method.}
