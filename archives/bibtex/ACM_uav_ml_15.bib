abstract = {At the 22nd ACM SIGKDD conference on Knowledge and Data Discovery (KDD), a workshop on Data Science for Food, Energy andWater (DSFEW) was held to foster an interdisciplinary community intersecting data science and societally important domains of food, energy and water. The workshop included keynotes, panel discussion, presentations and posters, and introduced the emerging area of DSFEW to ACM SIGKDD audience, and triggered interdisciplinary idea-sharing in DSFEW research.
