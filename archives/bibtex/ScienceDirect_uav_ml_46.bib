abstract = {A path planning in the space of multinominals integrated into a model predictive control mechanism for driving formations of autonomous mobile robots is presented in this paper. The proposed approach is designed to stabilize the formations in desired shapes, and to navigate the group into a final position in a partly known environment with dynamic obstacles. In addition, the system provides inter-vehicle coordination and collision avoidance in the event of failure of a team member. The method is aimed at reaching the final position of the formation in the desired shape, but it enables to change temporarily this shape if it is enforced by the environment (in narrow corridors, on response to an impending collision with obstacles and faulty team members, etc.). This autonomous emergent behaviour increases the robustness of the system and its usability. It enables a proper compromise to be found between the formation driving requirement and the effort to fulfil the mission objective, i.e., to move the group from the current state into the required position. In this paper, the convergence of the method and the requirements for stability are shown on the basis of the results of the Lyapunov theorems of stability. These theoretical achievements imply constraints on the applicability of the system, which are verified in numerical simulations and in various tests with real autonomous robots. The performances of the entire system and of independent sub-systems in various formation driving scenarios are also shown in these tests.}

We consider a situation in which the number of available weapons is smaller than the number of targets, the targets are assigned to the weapons already, and targets may move and hence the probability that a target is destroyed by a firing attack decreases as time passes. We present a branch and bound algorithm for the FSP with the objective of minimizing total threat of the targets, which is expressed as a function of the destruction probabilities of the targets. Results of computational tests show that the suggested algorithm solves problems of a medium size in a reasonable amount of computation time.}

By getting rid of a conservation condition of in-degree balance which widely exists in relevant results, necessary and/or sufficient conditions are established for group consensus control of discrete-time HMASs. Finally, simulations are demonstrated that, under the proposed theoretical results, the performance of discrete-time HMASs with time delays is similar to that without delays.}

Depending on the desired trajectory or on the terrain, wheel motors may be demanded to work beyond their limits.

Although control allocation has been mainly employed in overactuated systems to enhance the control distribution, it can be also utilized for underactuated systems as well to grant performance. For this purpose, three different control allocation strategies, along with Lyapunov-based time-varying feedback controller, are applied to a differential drive mobile robot subject to input saturation. Experimental results illustrate the performance of the proposed strategies.}

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is the de-facto standard for robotics software. However, ROS-based systems are getting larger and more complex and could benefit from good software architecture practices.
Goal:
We aim at (i) unveiling the state-of-the-practice in terms of targeted quality attributes and architecture documentation in ROS-based systems, and (ii) providing empirically-grounded guidance to roboticists about how to properly architect ROS-based systems.
Methods:
We designed and conducted an observational study where we (i) built a dataset of 335 GitHub repositories containing real open-source ROS-based systems, and (ii) mined the repositories to extract and synthesize quantitative and qualitative findings about how roboticists are architecting ROS-based systems.
Results:
First, we extracted an empirically-grounded overview of the state of the practice for architecting and documenting ROS-based systems. Second, we synthesized a catalog of 47 architecting guidelines for ROS-based systems. Third, the extracted guidelines were validated by 119 roboticists working on real-world open-source ROS-based systems.
Conclusion:
Roboticists can use our architecting guidelines for applying good design principles to develop robots that meet quality requirements, and researchers can use our results as evidence-based indications about how real-world ROS systems are architected today, thus inspiring future research contributions.}

However, due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart sensors in WSN, a single localization technique that affects the overall performance is not sufficient for all applications. Thus, there have been many significant advances on localization techniques in WSNs in the past few years. The main goal in this paper is to present the state-of-the-art research results and approaches proposed for localization in WSNs. Specifically, we present the recent advances on localization techniques in WSNs by considering a wide variety of factors and categorizing them in terms of data processing (centralized vs. distributed), transmission range (range free vs. range based), mobility (static vs. mobile), operating environments (indoor vs. outdoor), node density (sparse vs. dense), routing, algorithms, etc. The recent localization techniques in WSNs are also summarized in the form of tables. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of localization in sensor networks, as well as research trends and future research directions in this area.}

We evaluate our method and compare it to the state of the art movement generation methods in both simulations and real robot experiments. We show that the new method is very compact in its representation and can reproduce reference trajectories with zero error. Moreover, it has most of the features of the state of the art movement generation methods such as robustness to perturbations and generalization to new position and velocity boundary conditions. We believe that, due to these features, our method may have potential for robotic applications where high accuracy is required paired with flexibility, for example, in modern industrial robotic applications, where more flexibility will be demanded as well as in medical robotics.}

abstract = {One main application of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is the non-invasive detection of geological or hydrological structures in the shallow subsurface. This paper investigates the capability of time-series clustering to retrieve such features on real time-lapse ERT datasets considering three aspects: (1) the comparison between three clustering algorithms k-means, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC), and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), including the question of the optimal choice of cluster number and the identification of resistivity series whose classification is uncertain, (2) the effect of adding a spatial constraint in clustering, and (3) the robustness of the approaches to various representations of resistivity values and the number of time-steps involved in the clustering. The real time-lapse ERT dataset is obtained from dipole-dipole arrays on a 48 electrodes profile installed on the top of the Rochefort cave in Belgium. It consists of resistivity time-series defined over 465 days and associated with 1558 cells of the 2D ERT models derived from a time-lapse inversion. The clustering results are appreciated using clustering validation indices and further confronted with the expert-based structural model of the site. Results show that the three clustering algorithms provide similar spatial patterns on the standardized data and reveal correlated resistivity time-series. Some clusters are, however, spatially split and regroup time-series with a wide range of mean resistivity, suggesting different geological units within these groups. Clustering on the raw resistivity time-series may also appear inconsistent as the averaged resistivity series per cluster are highly correlated, thus missing the hydrological and functional traits of the subsurface elements. Applying a spatial constraint to the clustering of standardized data increases the number of clusters in order to retrieve spatially tied clusters. The grouped series are more homogeneous in terms of mean resistivity due to their spatial proximity, but some inconsistencies may remain due to synchronous hydrological forcing. Applying the clustering to various time-series representations allows us to gain confidence about the redundant spatial patterns. However, the patterns obtained from the clustering of the full standardized dataset cannot be reproduced from continuous sub-samples up to 100 days, but well from less than 20 samples picked randomly over the 465 days. Accordingly, our study highlights the importance of time-variable parameters in the identification of structural facies and hydrofacies with ERT while demonstrating the strength of long-term monitoring.}

This work proposes techniques that exploit the role of color spaces for addressing two important challenges in relation to salient object detection. The autonomous identification of a color space by which to carry out the processing has always been of prime importance to most image analysis tasks and this is equally so in relation to saliency detection. To address this challenge, a new adaptive color space selection method is proposed, here, which autonomously identifies the color space that is locally the most appropriate for saliency detection on an image by image basis. The color channels within this identified local color space are aggregated using joint l2, 1-norm minimization in order to determine feature importance and also to achieve feature selection leaning. A process relevant to saliency detection is multi-modality feature fusion, in which multiple features and color spaces are used in combination to capture the saliency aspects of an image/region. To implement this second process, a new technique for the region based optimal combination of feature modalities is introduced. The results of the rigorous experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive color space selection and also for the region based optimal combination methods in comparison to 13 other state-of-the-art saliency methods and all in relation to three benchmark datasets. The efficacy of the proposed color space selection and region based combination methods is further validated by examining their ability to select appropriate color spaces for, and successfully aggregate the results of, up to five benchmark methods.}

Various algorithms have been proposed to solve off-line planning and on-line adaption problems. However, it is still not able to ensure safety and flexibility in complex scenarios. In this paper, a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm is proposed to improve the robustness and flexibility. The method contains three components: A closed-loop control system is used to filter the preplanned trajectory and ensure the smoothness and stability of the robot motion; the dynamic repulsion field is adopted to fulfill the robot with primitive obstacle avoidance capability; to mimic human’s complex obstacle avoidance behavior and instant decision-making mechanism, a parametrized decision-making force is introduced to optimize all the feasible motions. The algorithms were implemented in planar and spatial robot manipulators. The comparative results show the robot can not only track the task trajectory smoothly but also avoid obstacles in different configurations.}

Nevertheless, variable rate treatments in olive groves have received little attention. Thus, field research was conducted in a 20.6-ha traditional olive grove. Two attributes of the trees – tree crown volume (V) and tree projected area – were determined, using 67 samples for V and all trees of the field (1433) for tree projected area. Spatial continuity of both attributes was modelled with exponential variograms. To gain a measure of local uncertainty, stochastic simulation algorithms were applied. One hundred simulated images were obtained for tree projected area using direct sequential simulation. Tree projected area simulations were used to improve spatial prediction of V, more difficult and more expensive to obtain, taking advantage of the high linear correlation between both variables (rxy = 0.72,p < 0.001). Thus, direct sequential cosimulation was employed to predict the spatial distribution of V, obtaining 100 geostatistical realizations of V. In order to estimate the potential reduction of pesticide use in the farm with variable rate treatments, two cut-off values of V were considered (50 and 100 m3crown volume). Local uncertainty, understood as the probability of each tree belonging to a given crown volume interval was determined. Probability maps were further transformed to morphological maps and finally to variable prescription maps. Two scenarios with 2 and 3 management zones (MZs) were obtained. In comparison with a conventional phytosanitary application, the variable rate treatments could reduce the pesticide amounts by 21.3% with 2 MZs, and by 38% with 3 MZs. The joint use of V and tree projected area in stochastic sequential simulation algorithms has shown to be useful to determine MZs in olive groves.}

National and international legislations address these threats and claim consistent, long-term monitoring schemes. Remote sensing data and products provide synoptic, spatio-temporal views and their integration can lead to a better understanding of lake ecology and water quality. Remote sensing therefore gains increasing awareness for analysing water bodies. Various empirical and semi-analytical algorithms exist to derive remote sensing indicators as proxies for climate change or ecological response variables. Nevertheless, most monitoring networks lack an integration of remote sensing data. This review article therefore provides a comprehensive overview how remote sensing can support lake research and monitoring. We focus on remote sensing indicators of lake properties, i.e. water transparency (suspended particulate matter, coloured dissolved organic matter, Secchi disc depth, diffuse attenuation coefficient, turbidity), biota (phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, submerged and emerged aquatic vegetation), bathymetry, water temperature (surface temperature) and ice phenology (ice cover, ice-on, ice-out). After a brief background introducing principles of lake remote sensing we give a review on available sensors and methods. We categorise case studies on remote sensing indicators with respect to lake properties and processes. We discuss existing challenges and benefits of integrating remote sensing into lake monitoring and ecological research including data availability, ready-to-use tools and accuracies.}

We proposed a robust adaptive control strategy, which is based on the coupling of the fuzzy logic system (FLS) with sliding mode control (SMC). First, a desired attitude solution model for the space debris removal is developed, and the error attitude dynamics equation of clean platform is formulated. Second, a sliding mode controller is designed due to its appreciable features to the uncertainties and disturbances. On this basis, a FLS is employed to approximate the unknown system functions, and the approximation errors are eliminated using adaptive algorithm. Meanwhile, the control gains of the switching control, being constant in the conventional SMC approach, are adjusted adaptively by fuzzy logic inference techniques in order to reduce the chattering phenomenon. The global stability of the closed-loop system is proven by the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, detailed numerical simulations are carried out to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control (AFSMC) approach. The simulation results show that the proposed AFSMC approach can ensure that the spacecraft exactly tracking the desired attitude in presence of inertial uncertainties and external disturbances and effectively reduce the chattering against to the conventional SMC approach.}

abstract = {Biochemical traits in forest vegetation are key indicators of leaf physiological processes, specifically photosynthetic and other photochemical light pathways, and are critical to the quantification of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Advances in remote sensing sensors and platforms are allowing multi-dimensional and continuous-spatial information to be acquired in a fast and non-destructive way to quantify forest biochemical traits at multiple spatial scales. Here we demonstrate the use of high spectral resolution, hyperspectral data combined with high density three-dimensional information from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) both acquired from an unmanned aerial system (UAS) platform, to quantify and assess the three-dimensional distribution of biochemical pigments on individual tree canopy surfaces. To do so, a DSM based fusion method was developed to integrate the 3D LiDAR point cloud with hyperspectral reflectance data. Regression-based models were then developed to predict a number of biochemical traits (i.e., chlorophyll (Chl) a, b, total Chl and total carotenoids (Cars) content) from a suite of common spectral indices at three vertical canopy levels, and were evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. One-way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple comparison post hoc tests were used to investigate the vertical distribution of biochemical pigments on individual tree canopy surfaces, and in response to age and species. Our results demonstrated that a number of vegetation indices, derived from the hyperspectral data, were strongly correlated with a number of biochemical traits (Adj-R2 = 0.85–0.91; rRMSE = 5.19–6.38%). In general, models fitted using leaf samples from the upper, middle and lower canopies separately (Adj-R2 = 0.85–0.91; rRMSE = 5.19–6.38%) had similar accuracy to the models developed with pooled data (Adj-R2 = 0.87–0.90; rRMSE = 5.21–6.11%). The differences between separate models and global models were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). However, the distribution of biochemical pigments across vertical layers varied significantly. For dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) and poplar (Populus deltoides), the results were consistent in that the lower component of the canopy (least light impacted) had the highest chlorophyll and carotenoids biochemical traits. Moreover, the vertical distribution of biochemical traits on individual tree canopy surfaces changed with age likely due to the growth variation from the photosynthetic activity of the canopy. This study indicates the potential of using fused 3D point cloud information with spectral data to monitor physiological activities of forest canopy for carbon accumulation estimation as well as precision forestry applications such as nutrition diagnosis, water regulation and subsequent productivity enhancement of these planted forest systems.}

abstract = {This paper proposes new versions of Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO) incorporated the survival-of-the-fittest principle of evolutionary algorithms. HHO is the recent swarm-based optimization algorithm imitating the surprise pounce behaviour of Harris’ hawks chasing style. HHO can show different patterns of the exploration and exploitation. It has a simple and time-varying structure, which further assist a smooth transition between the core phases. It has two main phases to iterate toward the optimal solution: exploration and exploitation. In the exploration phase, the current solution is either randomly modified based on any solution selected randomly or rebuilt from scratch. In evolutionary algorithms, selecting any solution from swarm basically relies on the natural selection principle of the survival-of-the-fittest to accelerate convergence. To make use of such principle, three selection strategies (i.e., tournament, proportional and linear rank-based methods) are employed in the exploration phase of HHO and introduces three new versions, which are Tournament HHO (THHO), Proportional HHO (PHHO), and Linear-Rank HHO (LHHO). In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed HHO versions, 23 well-regarded benchmark functions with various sizes and complexities are utilized as well as three real-world engineering problems. The sensitivity of proposed HHO versions to their parameter settings are studied and analyzed. Thereafter, a scalability study is conducted to show the effect of the population dimensions on the proposed HHO versions. Comparative evaluation shows that THHO version has superiority over other proposed HHO versions. Furthermore, the proposed HHO versions show enhanced trade off between the exploratory and exploitative trends and a better local optima avoidance. They are able to produce viable results competitively comparable with other eleven state-of-the-art methods using the same benchmark functions. Interestingly, the proposed variants of HHO are able to yield new results for some benchmark functions. Furthermore, three real-world engineering optimization problem of IEEE CEC2011 are also used in the evaluation process. Again, the proposed variants of HHO are able to achieve the best results.

We used 1,248 phytosociological plots to establish a complete typology of the study site's habitats. Locating these plots led us to select training areas that characterize 39 habitats to calibrate the Random Forest algorithm. We classified 11 single-date images spread evenly over a year and performed a multi-date classification of 9 images. We obtained high overall accuracy between 76.47% and 87.28% for the single-date image classifications and 98.7% for multi-date image classification.

abstract = {This paper suggests an optimal behaviour prediction mechanism for Multi Input-Multi Output control systems in a hierarchical control system structure, using previously learned solutions to simple tasks called primitives. The optimality of the behaviour is formulated as a reference trajectory tracking problem. The primitives are stored in a library of pairs of reference input/controlled output signals. The reference input primitives are optimized at the higher hierarchical level in a model-free iterative learning control (MFILC) framework without using knowledge of the controlled process. Learning of the reference input primitives is performed in a reduced subspace using radial basis functions for approximations. The convergence of the MFILC learning scheme is achieved via a Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning design of the feedback controllers in the lower level feedback control loops. The new complex trajectories to be tracked are decomposed into the output primitives regarded as basis functions. Next, the optimal reference input fed to the control system in order to track the desired new trajectory is then recomposed from the reference input primitives. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated on a case study concerning the control of a two-axis positioning mechanism, and the experimental validation is offered.}

abstract = {The exotic annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) dominates vast acreages of rangeland in the western USA, leading to increased fire frequency and ecosystem degradation that is often irreversible. Episodic regeneration failure (“die-off”) has been observed in cheatgrass monocultures and can have negative ecosystem consequences, but can also provide an opportunity for restoration of native species and ecological function within the imperiled sagebrush steppe ecosystem. Proximate causes of cheatgrass die-off are uncertain, although several taxa of fungal soil pathogens have been implicated. Die-off occurrence is stochastic and can occur in remote areas. Thus, developing remote sensing indicators that are repeatable over long time periods, across extensive regions, and at relatively fine spatial resolution would be beneficial for accurately pinpointing events. We developed a remote sensing approach for mapping historical die-off from the Landsat archive (1985–2015), and used this to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of die-off occurrence annually at 30-m resolution. A Random Forests classification of image-derived spectral endmembers, trained on 2014 data, predicted die-off with 93% accuracy (κ=0.845) when applied to independent validation data from 2009. Die-off extent varied greatly across years, though some areas experienced die-off multiple times during the observation period. We found a strong correspondence between die-off occurrence and winter drought conditions, with strongest negative associations with current-year winter precipitation and previous years’ lagged winter and annual precipitation. Die-off duration was heavily skewed towards single-year die-off (81.5% of events), even in localized areas of more frequent occurrence (‘die-off hotspots’). Our retrospective classification of the Landsat archive suggests that cheatgrass die-off occurrence is predictable as the intersection of particular site environmental conditions with annual weather conditions, possibly because they are favorable for disease expression. Associations with previous year conditions suggest that die-off may also depend upon feedbacks between cheatgrass dominance and litter production, suitable sites for seedling establishment, and abundance and persistence of pathogen inoculum. Remote sensing indicators such as those developed in this study are needed to develop hypotheses about die-off causal factors, as well as support improved management of cheatgrass, mitigation for negative consequences associated with die-off (e.g. wind erosion), and successful restoration of native plant communities on die-off areas.}

Hence an iterative approach is proposed which gradually increases the views to be generated till the images are registered.

We employ an analysis based on the Cramer-Rao lower bound and dilution of precision to formulate an optimization problem.

The approach is validated through simulation and experimental results in 2D scenarios, showing an improvement over a naive source placement.}

abstract = {Many satellite missions rely on modeling approaches to acquire global or regional evapotranspiration (ET) products. However, a current challenge in ET modeling lies in dealing with sub-pixel heterogeneity, as models often assume homogeneous conditions at the pixel level. This is particularly an issue for heterogeneous landscapes, such as tree-grass ecosystems (TGE). In these areas, while appearing homogeneous at larger spatial scales pertaining to a single land cover type, the separation of the spectral signals of the main landscape features (e.g. trees and grasses) may not be achieved at the conventional satellite sensor resolution (e.g. 10–1000 m). This leads to important heterogeneity within the pixel grid that may not be accounted for in traditional modeling frameworks. This study examined the effect of pixel heterogeneity on ET simulations over a complex TGE in central Spain. High resolution hyperspectral imagery from five airborne campaigns forced the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model at 1.5–1000 m spatial resolutions. Along with this, the sharpened (20 m) and original (1000 m) Sentinels for Evapotranspiration (Sen-ET) products were evaluated over the study site for 2017. Results indicated that TSEB accurately simulated ET (RMSD: ~60 W/m2) when the pixel scale was able to robustly discriminate between grass and tree pixels (<5 m). However, model uncertainty drastically increased at spatial resolution greater than 10 m (RMSD: ~115 W/m2). Model performance remains relatively constant between 30 and 1000 m spatial resolutions, with within pixel heterogeneity being similar at all these scales. For mixed pixels (≥30 m), forcing an effective landscape roughness into TSEB (RMSD: ~80 W/m2) or applying a seasonally changing TSEB (TSEB-2S; RMSD: ~65 W/m2) improved the modeling performance. The Sen-ET products behaved similarly at both scales with RMSD of ET roughly 80 W/m2. The non-linear relationship between input parameters and flux output, along with the poor representation of aerodynamic surface roughness, were the main drivers for the increased uncertainties at coarser scales. These results suggest that care should be taken when using global ET products over TGE and similarly heterogeneous landscapes. The modeling procedure should inherently account for the presence of vastly different vegetation roughness elements within the pixel, to achieve reliable estimates of turbulent fluxes over a TGE.}

To this end, a self-adaptive resources allocation-based differential evolution (SRADE) is presented in this paper. Specifically, during the evolutionary process, three mutation strategies with distinct focuses are collaboratively employed and adaptively assigned to different individuals based on their performance feedback. That is, most of the computing resources will be consumed by the most efficient strategy at different evolutionary stages to mitigate inefficient search under limited resources. These three collaborative strategies focus on maintaining population diversity, driving the population into feasible regions, and promoting the population toward the objective, respectively. Combining the self-adaptive resources allocation scheme and diverse search strategies is expected to satisfy the requirements of the population for diversity, convergence, constraints, and the objective at a certain iteration. Extensive experiments are performed on three benchmark test suites, including a large number of test functions from IEEE CEC 2006, 2010, and 2017. Compared to other well-designed constrained evolutionary approaches, SRADE exhibits superior or very competitive performance.}

The graph properties complicate the design of synchronization controllers due to the interplay between the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix and the required stabilizing gains. Two methods are given herein that decouple the design of the synchronizing gains from the detailed graph properties. Both are based on computation of the local control gains using Riccati design; the first is based on an H∞ type Riccati inequality and the second on an H2 type Riccati equation. Conditions are given for synchronization based on the relation of the graph eigenvalues to a bounded circular region in the complex plane that depends on the agent dynamics and the Riccati solution. The notion of ‘synchronizing region’ is used. An example shows the effectiveness of these design methods for guaranteeing synchronization in cooperative discrete-time systems.}

abstract = {The form of cancer related to the abnormal growth and division of leukocytes in the blood is called Leukemia whose most common method of treatment is chemotherapy which has a disadvantage of killing normal cells along with cancer cells. Monotonic and non-monotonic therapy functions have been used in the manuscript to describe different effects of treatment on both the normal and the leukemic cells by utilizing model of acute leukemia. Michaelis–Menten equation describes the behavior of monotonic function whereas the function with a threshold impact is known as non-monotonic function. Adaptive terminal sliding mode controller (AT-SMC) with input saturation, super-twisting sliding mode controller (ST-SMC) and synergetic controller have been proposed in this paper to attain the objectives of killing the leukemic cells and maintain a safe number of normal cells by using a safe value of total chemotherapeutic agent. Lyapunov stability theory has been used to analyze the stability of the designed controllers and Matlab/Simulink has been used to simulate them and their performance has been analyzed on the basis of transient response characteristics, steady state accuracy and robustness.}

abstract = {This paper deals with a stochastic multi-period task-resource allocation problem. A team of agents with a set of resources is to be deployed on a multi-period mission with the goal to successfully complete as many tasks as possible. The success probability of an agent assigned to a task depends on the resources available to the agent. Unsuccessful tasks can be tried again at later periods. While the problem can in principle be solved by dynamic programming, in practice this is computationally prohibitive except for tiny problem sizes. To be able to tackle also larger problems, we propose a construction heuristic that assigns agents and resources to tasks sequentially, based on the estimated marginal utility. Based on this heuristic, we furthermore propose various Approximate Dynamic Programming approaches and an Evolutionary Algorithm. All suggested approaches are empirically compared on a number of randomly generated problem instances. We show that the construction heuristic is very fast and provides good results. For even better results, at the expense of longer computational time, Approximate Dynamic Programming seems a suitable alternative.}

It is proved that the sparsity of the data representation is significantly promoted by propagating a low-rank structure, leading to a more robust description of the clustering structure. Based on a theoretical proof to support this observation, a novel subspace clustering algorithm is proposed with the structured representation. Two cascade self-expressions are leveraged to implement the propagation. One leads to a low-rank representation of the data samples by exploiting the global structure; whereas the other generates a sparse representation of the former low-rank representation to capture the neighborhood structure. The proposed representation strategy is further investigated from both a geometric and a physical perspective. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.}

Relative threshold event-triggered based extended state observers are respectively established in trajectory and attitude subsystems to recover the immeasurable velocity and unknown lumped disturbances with a less sampling cost, while an explicit relationship between the upper bound of estimation errors and the design parameters of event-triggered condition is derived. With the aid of estimation results, an aperiodic sampling based output feedback trajectory tracking control law is developed by inserting a relative threshold sampler into the controller-to-actuator channel, such that an enhanced robustness can be realized without involving excessive resource occupations. Additionally, a modified prescribed performance control is proposed to regulate the transient profile of trajectory tracking with an arbitrarily small overshoot and a fast convergence rate even in face of triggering error. All closed-loop signals are proved to be ultimately uniformly bounded meanwhile Zeno phenomena can be eliminated. The effectiveness of presented algorithm is validated by comparable simulations.}

The proposed transition controller has two levels. The lower level is a series of candidate controllers for the subproblems, which are obtained by the operation of divide and conquer. The higher level uses the state variables to determine which lower level candidate controller should be used. The candidate controllers are solved using the μ synthesis and the conventional longitudinal and lateral control loops. The robustness of the candidate controllers is guaranteed by the robust control theory. The stability and robustness of the transition controller is determined by the switch logic in the higher level. The stability of the proposed control strategy is analyzed. A 6 Degree of Freedom simulation with uncertain aerodynamic model is used to show the robustness and the performance of the proposed controller.}

This review article discusses the principal factors which influence mangroves in Vietnam including climate and climate change, hydrology, soil and topography, and anthropogenic factors such as aquaculture expansion, illegal logging, damming, pollution), which requires special attention. We further discuss the important role that Vietnamese mangrove forests play an in the socio-economic development of the country, even though the exploitation and protection of mangrove forests in many provinces are often uncontrolled. We discuss successful management practices including co-management models for mangrove restoration, which have been a success in Vietnam. Conservation and rehabilitation process of mangrove forests by various national and international agencies are still on-going and the success of such activities is influenced by various socio-economic, political as well as environmental factors. Further challenges in effective mangrove management arise due to climate change, which accelerates high atmospheric CO2, increased air temperature, sea level rise, storminess, ocean currents and alterations in precipitation regime. Recent developments in remote sensing applications can be utilized to improve the mapping and monitoring the changes in mangrove ecosystems in Vietnam thereby improving the effective management of mangrove forests.}

To deal with the difficulties involved in this problem, a robust and reliable optimization algorithm is required. In this paper, Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is employed as a search strategy to design a wrapper-based feature selection method. The GOA is a recent population-based metaheuristic that mimics the swarming behaviors of grasshoppers. In this work, an efficient optimizer based on the simultaneous use of the GOA, selection operators, and Evolutionary Population Dynamics (EPD) is proposed in the form of four different strategies to mitigate the immature convergence and stagnation drawbacks of the conventional GOA. In the first two approaches, one of the top three agents and a randomly generated one are selected to reposition a solution from the worst half of the population. In the third and fourth approaches, to give a chance to the low fitness solutions in reforming the population, Roulette Wheel Selection (RWS) and Tournament Selection (TS) are utilized to select the guiding agent from the first half. The proposed GOA_EPD approaches are employed to tackle various feature selection tasks. The proposed approaches are benchmarked on 22 UCI datasets. The comprehensive results and various comparisons reveal that the EPD has a remarkable impact on the efficacy of the GOA and using the selection mechanism enhanced the capability of the proposed approach to outperform other optimizers and find the best solutions with improved convergence trends. Furthermore, the comparative experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches when compared to other similar methods in the literature.}

A distributed algorithm in which agents employ time-varying and heterogeneous step-sizes is proposed by combining consensus of multi-agent systems with gradient tracking technique. The algorithm not only drives the agents’ iterates to a global and consensual minimizer but also finds the optimal value of the cost function. When the individual objectives are convex and smooth, we prove that the algorithm converges at a rate of O(1/t) if the homogeneous step-size does not exceed some upper bound, and it accelerates to O(1/t) if the homogeneous step-size is sufficiently small. When at least one of the individual objectives is strongly convex and all are smooth, we prove that the algorithm converges at a linear rate of O(λt) with 0 < λ < 1 even though the step-sizes are time-varying and heterogeneous. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and to validate the theoretical findings.}

At first stage local linearization of the robotic model is performed round its present operating point. The approximation error that is introduced to the linearized model due to truncation of higher-order terms in the performed Taylor series expansion is represented as a disturbance. The control problem is now formulated as a mini-max differential game in which the control input tries to minimize the state vector’s tracking error while the disturbances affecting the model try to maximize it. Using the linearized description of the robot’s dynamics an H-infinity feedback controller is designed through the solution of a Riccati equation at each step of the control algorithm. The inherent robustness properties of H-infinity control assure that the disturbance effects will be eliminated and the robot’s state variables will converge to the desirable setpoints. The proposed method, stands for a reliable solution to the problem of nonlinear control and stabilization for multi-DOF robotic manipulators. It is also a novel approach, comparing to control of a robotic manipulator based on global linearization of its dynamics. Its efficiency is further confirmed through simulation experiments.}

The strong size and cost constraints of DTN nodes lead to corresponding constraints on resources such as energy, memory, communication speed and bandwidth, which in turn limits the contact between DTN nodes. DTN has emerged as a promising new network paradigm that aims to cope with the increasing number of heterogeneous networks and the need for efficient and robust data dissemination to be more stable. But one of the hindering bottlenecks the full applicability of such a DTN-based approach to the IoT, is that forwarding data in an environment could lose when the connection between nodes is intermittent. In this paper, we propose an effective bundle forwarding strategy for the IoT environment in which we control the number of bundle replications to balance energy consumption on the network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution performs better than other methods in terms of delivery delay and delivery rate (roughly 18% improvement).}

Different from the existing works, this paper studies the optimization algorithm under uncoordinated step sizes. More specifically, by combining a random sleep strategy and the round-robin communication among clusters, a new hierarchical algorithm is developed to solve the considered problem. In the proposed algorithm, the random sleep strategy enables each agent to independently choose either performing the projected subgradient descent, or keeping the previous estimate by a Bernoulli decision, based on which the step size of each agent is selected as an uncoordinated form that only relates to the independent Bernoulli decision variable. Technically, by introducing a key definition on the algorithm history, it is proven that the estimates of the proposed algorithm can converge to the optimal solution even with the uncoordinated step sizes. In addition, we also study the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm with simpler constant step sizes. In this case, it is proven that the random sleep strategy can efficiently improve the convergence accuracy of the algorithm. Finally, the theoretical findings are verified via simulation examples.}

However, mainly due to the underestimate of unbalanced influences of spatial and temporal constraints posed by charging requests, traditional scheduling strategies achieve rather low charging request throughput and success rate, posing as a major bottleneck for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a Double Warning thresholds with Double Preemption (DWDP) charging scheme, in which double warning thresholds are used when residual energy levels of sensor nodes fall below certain thresholds. By introducing specific comparison rules, warning thresholds can be used to adjust charging priorities of different sensors, warn the upcoming recharge deadlines, as well as support preemptive scheduling. Then DWDP is extended to where multiple Wireless Charging Vehicles (WCVs) are employed, and a Collaborative Charging DWDP, namely CCDWDP is proposed. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to manifest the advantages of DWDP as well as CCDWDP. Simulation results reveal that DWDP can achieve better performance in guaranteeing the successful scheduling of the high-priority task and improving stability of the system. CCDWDP outperforms in terms of high charging throughput and short charging delay.}

To do such, the planner relies on some search algorithm capable of exploring the possibilities exposed by the model, and several different approaches have been used by different planners with varying degrees of success. This paper presents an insight on some of the most consolidated ones, both regarding deterministic and probabilistic domains, and focuses on search techniques and generic heuristics in order to assist the development of new algorithms focused on production and logistics. It also covers the main formal system modeling languages, such as STRIPS, PDDL and PPDDL, used by such planners.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the input constrained prescribed performance control (PPC) for asteroid hovering merely using position measurements. The controller guarantees the position error converges to a prescribed residual set with desired transient performance in the absence of sensed velocities. First, the position error is transformed into a new error variable and a proper error dynamic system is established according to the PPC methodology, based on which, a backstepping prescribed performance controller is devised with the input saturation handled by an auxiliary system. Then, a state observer is developed by employing the immersion and invariance (I&I) technique, and the estimate is substituted for the velocity in the controller; meanwhile, the auxiliary system is improved to handle the input saturation of the velocity-free controller. The closed-loop systems stability is established via Lyapunov analysis. Finally, simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

The increasing interest in acquisition of language in cognitive agents/robots with grounded phenomenon facilitates robotic services in real scenarios in real means through stepping into the shoes of human intelligence. In this paper, a cognitive robotics model is proposed for the grounding of a higher-order concept in the sensorimotor experience of humanoid robot. In the proposed model, robot’s conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized in a semantic network by using the inputted linguistic description of these words. The meaning of the higher-order word is indirectly grounded in sensorimotor primitives through a top-down activation process. Specifically, in the described model, the meaning of the abstract action word is acquired through the combination of already grounded action primitives. Hence, the proposed model with the strength of symbolic computation extends the grounding mechanism to the abstract words category, and also provides a tool (i.e. a practical way) to investigate the link that exists between sensorimotor representation and abstract conceptual knowledge of the cognitive robot. For verification of the proposed model, simulation- experiments have been conducted by using iCub robot data.}

In response, a rapidly expanding array of collaborative geospatial tools is being developed to help collaborators share data, code, and results. Successful navigation of these tools requires users to understand their strengths, synergies, and weaknesses. In this paper, we identify the key components of a collaborative Spatial Data Science workflow to develop a framework for evaluating the various functional aspects of collaborative geospatial tools. Using this framework, we then score thirty-one existing collaborative geospatial tools and apply a cluster analysis to create a typology of these tools. We present this typology as a map of the emergent ecosystem and functional niches of collaborative geospatial tools. We identify three primary clusters of tools composed of eight secondary clusters across which divergence is driven by required infrastructure and user involvement. Overall, our results highlight how environmental collaborations have benefitted from the use of these tools and propose key areas of future tool development for continued support of collaborative geospatial efforts.}

CPJ integrates VirusTotal, a cloud-based security analysis service, into a browser. Therefore, with the latest malware signature databases, it can analyze the behavior of a variety of JavaScript files.

Each UIO generates residuals that are insensitive to only one fault, and sensitive to rest of the other faults. For the diagnosis of actuator and sensor faults, assuming that both the actuator faults and the sensor faults do not occur simultaneously. The major advantage of using UIOs is that it makes possible to isolate more than one faulty component at a time. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of proposed work.

The underwater vision robot is essentially an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) for study of marine animals by automatically tracking and following them using computer vision. The AUV can also be used as a platform for Photo-mapping of the Seafloor using the onboard camera and light arrangement. The robot is proposed to have 5 thrusters configurations to achieve 4 degrees of freedom controlled by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) interfaced with control unit and powered by commercial LiPo battery packs. The robot is equipped with roll, pitch, heading, and depth sensors which provide sufficient feedback signals to automatically control the vehicle to track a pre-planned trajectory. The centre of gravity and centre of buoyancy of the vehicle are positioned in such a way that it is self-stabilized. Along with this the combinations of sensors and speed control drivers provide more stability to the system using a closed loop control system, without the operator involvement. The AUV also captures videos during its mission using the camera. It is planned to have a multi-core umbilical cable for video signal, water leakage alarm, feedback signals and battery charging lines. This will be only used for development and test purposes and will be removed during autonomous missions. Various control schemes can be applied for the vehicle to track different paths. The AUV is designed to the dimension of 575×210×175mm.TheAUV uses O-rings for the hulls for good water sealing effect as well as for faster assembly and disassembly. We expect this AUV development to mature in to an advanced system can be used as a platform for study of the ocean by scientists, for environmental studies and for defense applications.}

Due to many heterogeneous nodes in different locations of the edge cloud system, inefficient replica strategy will greatly affect the load balancing of the system. Therefore, the dynamic multi-objective optimized replica placement and migration strategies for SaaS applications in edge cloud are proposed in this paper. The multi-objective optimized replica placement problem is solved according to the fast non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. In the experiment, the algorithm of replica placement will minimize the effective network utilization, reduce the response time and guarantee the load balancing of data nodes. Moreover, the replica migration model for access hotspots is proposed to obtain the pairing migration relationship from source node to target node. In the experiment, the replica migration algorithm will effectively reduce the migration time, minimize the response time and improve network resource utilization. Besides, the applicability of the proposed replica methods is shown in different scenarios such as the social media, intelligent agriculture, military field and transportation field.}

With the aim to efficiently and effectively fuse complementary information from visible and thermal infrared images, this paper proposes an adaptive spatial pixel-level feature fusion network called the ASPFF Net, which can adaptively extract spatial pixel-level features from visible and infrared images for fusion. Specifically, first, two light networks with different weights are used to extract multi-scale features of visible and infrared images. Next, for features of the same scale but different modalities, the fusion weights of different spatial positions and pixels in the two feature maps are obtained by the spatial attention module (SAM) and pixel attention module (PAM). The original features of visible and infrared images are recalibrated by the fusion weights, and multi-scale fused feature layers are obtained. Finally, different scales of pedestrians are detected on the fused multi-scale feature layers. Compared with the other recent multispectral pedestrian detectors on the reasonable subset of the KAIST multispectral pedestrian detection dataset, the proposed detector is attractive in balancing speed and accuracy. The extensive experiments on the KAIST dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the fusion of visible and infrared image in multispectral pedestrian detection.}

We discuss algorithms for performing visual tasks, such as search and detection, with foveated imaging systems.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-agent system reconnaissance mission scheduling, which is the core of the reconnaissance decision support system and can be modeled as an extension of Multi-Mode Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. Three objectives are considered in this paper: (1) minimizing the reconnaissance mission’s makespan, (2) minimizing the total cost of allocating reconnaissance agents, and (3) maximizing the total quality of all reconnaissance tasks. An effective problem-specific multi-objective invasive weed optimization algorithm (PS-MOIWO) is proposed for solving the problem. Firstly, a new chromosome structure guaranteeing the feasibility of solutions and an initialization method are proposed. Secondly, we propose a self-adaptive penalty-based constraint handling technique to describe the fitness of each individual and adopt a novel non-dominated sorting method to rank the population. Thirdly, by using the problem-specific knowledge, a local search procedure is developed and incorporated into the PS-MOIWO framework to enhance the exploitation ability. Based on the Taguchi method, algorithm’s suitable parameter combinations are determined. Simulation results based on a set of newly generated reconnaissance instances and the comparisons with some existing algorithms demonstrate the proposed algorithm’s effectiveness.}

Mobile applications, especially for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, require powerful computation-intensive resources. Hence, running all the AI applications on a single MD introduces high energy consumption and application delay, as it has limited battery capacity and computation resources. Fortunately, the emerging edge-cloud computing (ECC) architecture pushes the computation resource to both the network edge and remote cloud to cope with challenging AI applications. Although the advantage of ECC greatly benefits various mobile applications, data security remains an important open issue in this scenario, which has not been well studied. This paper focuses on the profit maximization (PM) problem for security-aware task offloading in an ECC environment, i.e., considering the tasks from MDs with different service demands, edge nodes should decide them to be processed on the edge node or the remote cloud with a security guarantee. Specifically, we first construct the security model to measure the time overhead for each task under various scenarios. We then formulate the PM problem by jointly considering the security demand and deadline constraints of tasks. Finally, we propose a genetic algorithm-based PM (GA-PM) algorithm, the coding strategy of which considers the task execution location and execution order. Moreover, the crossover and mutation operations are implemented based on the coding strategy. Extensive simulation experiments with various parameters varying demonstrate that our GA-PM can achieve better performance than all the comparison algorithms.}

Source materials come from channel bed sediment, nearby landslides and rilling and surface erosion of slopes. The objective of this study was to develop a multi-source method–including field surveys, optical remote sensing interpretation, and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology–to estimate the volume of source materials in the debris flow in the Xulong Gully (XLG), China. The qualitative degree of stability of the source materials was estimated with volume of approximately 91.9 × 104 m3. Considering sediment connectivity, landslides debris were interpreted using optical remote sensing, and their volume was calculated, using an empirical formula, to be about 191.01 × 104 m3. Continuous monitoring using InSAR could help to obtain the large-scope precise process of ground surface deformation. Estimated erosion rate ranges from 1633 m3/(km2·year) to 4552 m3/(km2·year) and annual volume of erosion was 9.08 × 104 m3/year–25.31 × 104 m3/year. Higher elevation with good vegetation coverage showed the sedimentation process, while lower elevation area with little vegetation showed erosion process. The highest degree of erosion occurred in the summer, followed by spring, autumn, and winter. The trend of the degree of erosion was consistent with that of the monthly rainfall in the XLG in 2018. Verification results demonstrated that the proposed approach could improve the efficiency and accuracy of the estimates of source material volume in debris flows and assess hazards.}

This study evaluated the potential to map riverbed composition based on in situ and/or remote measurements of reflectance. Field spectra and substrate photos from the Snake River, Wyoming, USA, were used to identify different sediment facies and degrees of algal development and to quantify their optical characteristics. We hypothesized that accounting for the effects of depth and water column attenuation to isolate the reflectance of the streambed would enhance distinctions among bottom types and facilitate substrate classification. A bottom reflectance retrieval algorithm adapted from coastal research yielded realistic spectra for the 450 to 700nm range; but bottom reflectance-based substrate classifications, generated using a random forest technique, were no more accurate than classifications derived from above-water field spectra. Additional hypothesis testing indicated that a combination of reflectance magnitude (brightness) and indices of spectral shape provided the most accurate riverbed classifications. Convolving field spectra to the response functions of a multispectral satellite and a hyperspectral imaging system did not reduce classification accuracies, implying that high spectral resolution was not essential. Supervised classifications of algal density produced from hyperspectral data and an inferred bottom reflectance image were not highly accurate, but unsupervised classification of the bottom reflectance image revealed distinct spectrally based clusters, suggesting that such an image could provide additional river information. We attribute the failure of bottom reflectance retrieval to yield more reliable substrate maps to a latent correlation between depth and bottom type. Accounting for the effects of depth might have eliminated a key distinction among substrates and thus reduced discriminatory power. Although further, more systematic study across a broader range of fluvial environments is needed to substantiate our initial results, this case study suggests that bed composition in shallow, clear-flowing rivers potentially could be mapped remotely.}

abstract = {There has been a considerable amount of work done on tracking the boundaries of specified regions. The present paper focuses on the same problem. However, unlike previous works, this paper uses the cyclic pursuit scheme and its variants to locate the boundaries of specified regions, when the agents are initially deployed away from the region, and subsequently track the boundary continuously. The number of agents required under this paradigm is also considerably lesser than in existing strategies. In almost all cases, the algorithm described in this paper guarantees the convergence to the boundary. Simulation results have been presented to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.}

abstract = {This paper addresses both active and passive flutter suppressions for highly flexible wings using piezoelectric transduction. An active aeroelastic formulation is used in the studies, featuring a geometrically nonlinear beam formulation coupled with 2-D unsteady aerodynamic equations. The piezoelectric effect is involved in the dynamic nonlinear beam equations, allowing for the aeroelastic studies on multifunctional wings for both piezoelectric energy harvesting and active actuation. In this study, the active piezoelectric actuation is applied as the primary approach for the flutter suppression, with the energy harvesting, as a secondary passive approach, concurrently working to provide an additional damping effect on the wing vibration. The multifunctional system may also convert wing vibration energy to electric energy as an additional function. Moreover, a Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller is developed for the active control of wing limit-cycle oscillations due to the flutter instability. In the numerical studies, both the active and passive flutter suppression approaches are enabled for a highly flexible wing. The impact of the piezoelectric actuator and energy harvester placement on the wing flutter characteristic is explored. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to effectively suppress the aeroelastic instability of highly flexible piezoelectric wings, while allowing to harvest the residual vibration energy. The active multifunctional wing technology that is explored in the paper has the potential to improve the aircraft performance from both aeroelastic stability and energy consumption aspects.}

In this paper, we present a new approach for automatically detect and classify urban ground elements from 3D point clouds. The methodology enables a high level of detail classification from the combination of geometric and topological information. The method starts by a planar segmentation followed by a refinement based on split and merge operations. Next, a feature analysis and a geometric decision tree are followed to classify regions in preliminary classes. Finally, adjacency is studied to verify and correct the preliminary classification based on a comparison with a topological graph library. The methodology is tested in four real complex case studies acquired with a Mobile Laser Scanner Device. In total, five classes are considered (roads, sidewalks, treads, risers and curbs). Results show a success rate of 97% in point classification, enough to analyse extensive urban areas from an accessibility point of view. The combination of topology and geometry improves a 10% to 20% the success rate obtained with only the use of geometry.}

An inventory system comprising a finite number of machines, one warehouse, and one single-server repair station is considered. Numerical experiments were conducted to compare the performance of the proposed model with the performance of three existing priority rules: a first-come, first-served (FCFS) rule, a static priority rule, and a dynamic priority rule. A testbed with 20 instances of the problem was considered. The results showed that the proposed PHM-based rule consistently reduces the inventory system cost.}

First, the calculation formulas of pixel deformation and instrumental error were derived. Based on this, the calculation of digital camera calibration were obtained and used to calibrate the physical model for rock mass undergoing the changing mining process. Finally, the deformation characteristics of rock mass were revealed based on a geotechnical engineering of Daye iron mine and the monitored results of digital photogrammetry were compared with the dial indicators. It was found that the surface deformations measured by digital photogrammetric technique are similar to the results using dial indicators. The maximum error between these two was less than 0.02mm. These tests demonstrate the efficacy of digital photogrammetry as a powerful technique for deformation measurement in the geotechnical model tests.}

The advanced disturbance observer is adopted to actively estimate and compensate the synthetic uncertainties of the reformulated incremental model while retaining the advantage of the standard IBKS controller that not requiring the exact knowledge of aircraft dynamics. The state variables of the closed-loop system are proved to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The effectiveness of the FTESO based IBKS controller is validated by aircraft command tracking simulation studies in the presence of sudden system disturbance, actuator faults and measurement errors of angular accelerations. In addition, the control framework of the FTESO based IBKS controller can also be utilized to improve other incremental nonlinear controllers with proper disturbance observers.}

This paper proposes a novel strategy for Non-Cooperative Distributed Model Predictive Control (Non-Coop.

Moreover, the coupling is considered to be time-variant. We call this strategy Priority-Based Non-Coop. DMPC (PB-Non-Coop. DMPC). It is based on assigning priorities to the agents and the use of the coupling graph. Each PB-Non-Coop. DMPC is associated with a different agent and computes the local control inputs based only on its states and that of its neighbors. PB-Non-Coop. DMPC satisfies the prediction consistency property and reduces the overall computation time in comparison with existing Non-Coop. DMPC strategies in literature, thereby improves the overall behavior of NCS. We compare PB-Non-Coop. DMPC with centralized MPC as well as with another Non-Coop. DMPC strategy from literature.}

abstract = {A method to estimate peat depth and extent is vital for accurate estimation of carbon stocks and to facilitate appropriate peatland management. Current methods for direct measurement (e.g. ground penetrating radar, probing) are labour intensive making them unfeasible for capturing spatial information at landscape extents. Attempts to model peat depths using remotely sensed data such as elevation and slope have shown promise but assume a functional relationship between current conditions and gradually accrued peat depth. Herein we combine LiDAR-derived metrics known to influence peat accumulation (elevation, slope, topographic wetness index (TWI)) with passive gamma-ray spectrometric survey data, shown to correlate with peat occurrence, to develop a novel peat depth model for Dartmoor. Total air absorbed dose rates of Thorium, Uranium and Potassium were calculated, referred to as radiometric dose. Relationships between peat depth, radiometric dose, elevation, slope and TWI were trained using 1334 peat depth measurements, a further 445 measurements were used for testing. All variables showed significant relationships with peat depth. Linear stepwise regression of natural log-transformed variables indicated that a radiometric dose and slope model had an r2 = 0.72/0.73 and RMSE 0.31/0.31 m for training/testing respectively. This model estimated an area of 158 ±101 km2 of peaty soil >0.4 m deep across the study area. Much of this area (60 km2) is overlain by grassland and therefore may have been missed if vegetation cover was used to map peat extent. Using published bulk density and carbon content values we estimated 13.1 Mt. C (8.1–21.9 Mt. C) are stored in the peaty soils within the study area. This is an increase on previous estimates due to greater modelled peat depth. The combined use of airborne gamma-ray spectrometric survey and LiDAR data provide a novel, practical and repeatable means to estimate peat depth with no a priori knowledge, at an appropriate resolution (10 m) and extent (406 km2) to facilitate management of entire peatland complexes.}

Li-ion battery is one of the most important technological alternatives for high capacity energy storage and related industrial applications. State of Health (SoH) of Li-ion batteries plays a critical role in their deployment from economic, safety, and availability aspects. Most, if not all, of the studies related to SoH estimation focus on the measurement of a new parameter/physical phenomena related to SoH, or development of new statistical/computational methods using several parameters. This paper presents a new approach for SoH estimation for Li-ion battery systems with multiple battery cells: The main idea is a new circuit topology which enables separation of battery cells into two groups, main and test batteries, whenever a SoH related measurement is to be conducted. All battery cells will be connected to the main battery during the normal mode of operation. When a measurement is needed for SoH estimation, some of the cells will be separated from the main battery, and SoH estimation related measurements will be performed on these units. Compared to classical SoH measurement methods which deal with whole battery system, the proposed method estimates the SoH of the system by separating a small but representative set of cells. While SoH measurements are conducted on these isolated cells, remaining cells in the main battery continue to function in normal mode, albeit in slightly reduced performance levels. Preliminary experimental results are quite promising, and validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Technical details of the proposed circuit architecture are also summarized in the paper.}

This study formed predictive models for soil factors that in turn influence the soil strength and terrain trafficability in Finnish upland forests using readily available vegetation, terrain and soil data. The response soil variables represented soil texture, stoniness, organic matter content and depth of the humus layer. Explanatory variables in the models included site type, vegetation and tree coverage, climatic and topographic parameters and airborne gamma-ray radiation (K%) from the ground. The coefficients for determination in the general linear models for predicting the fine fraction content, organic matter content or depth of humus layer varied from 28 to 39%, which shows that a moderate part of the overall variation remained unexplained by the explanatory variables. The stoniness (vol% in 0-30 cm depth) could only be predicted relatively weakly (R2 = 17%). However, the classification efficiencies of the logistic models for predicting the soil clay contents to be lower or higher than 10% were good (ROC = 0.76–0.89), which indicates significant potential to distinguish and classify the upland soils with potential weak trafficability. Further means to improve trafficability estimations of uplands by using more detailed soil and regional phytogeomorphological data are discussed.}

Provenance can be broadly described as the information that explains where a piece of data object came from, how it was derived or created, who was involved in said creation, manipulations involved, processes applied, etc. It consists of information that had an effect on the data, evolving to its present state. Provenance has been used widely for the authenticity of data and processes. Despite having such a wide range of uses and applications, provenance poses vexing privacy and integrity challenges. Provenance data itself is, therefore, critical and it must be secured. Over the years, a number of secure provenance schemes have been proposed. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of secure provenance schemes and its associated security issues. In this paper, we have discussed why secure provenance is needed, what are its essential characteristics, and what objectives it serves? We describe the lifecycle of secure provenance and highlighted how trust is achieved in different domains by its application. Firstly, a detailed taxonomy of existing secure provenance schemes is presented.

abstract = {Object recognition systems constitute a deeply entrenched and omnipresent component of modern intelligent systems. Research on object recognition algorithms has led to advances in factory and office automation through the creation of optical character recognition systems, assembly-line industrial inspection systems, as well as chip defect identification systems. It has also led to significant advances in medical imaging, defence and biometrics. In this paper we discuss the evolution of computer-based object recognition systems over the last fifty years, and overview the successes and failures of proposed solutions to the problem. We survey the breadth of approaches adopted over the years in attempting to solve the problem, and highlight the important role that active and attentive approaches must play in any solution that bridges the semantic gap in the proposed object representations, while simultaneously leading to efficient learning and inference algorithms. From the earliest systems which dealt with the character recognition problem, to modern visually-guided agents that can purposively search entire rooms for objects, we argue that a common thread of all such systems is their fragility and their inability to generalize as well as the human visual system can. At the same time, however, we demonstrate that the performance of such systems in strictly controlled environments often vastly outperforms the capabilities of the human visual system. We conclude our survey by arguing that the next step in the evolution of object recognition algorithms will require radical and bold steps forward in terms of the object representations, as well as the learning and inference algorithms used.}

abstract = {This study presents a cellular lane-changing model where the traffic lanes are discretized into cells and formulates the lane-changing process as a multi-player non-zero-sum non-cooperative game in a connected environment where the real-time surrounding traffic data is shared. In a congested traffic scenario where a large quantity of mandatory lane-changing maneuvers are required simultaneously, the size of the game is extended dynamically (i.e., 2–5 players in this case, and it can be extended more if necessary) based on the traffic situation. Discretionary lane-changing maneuvers are also considered in the decision-making process to maximize the use of the capacity of each traffic lane, i.e., distributing the vehicles to each traffic lane as uniform as possible. Moreover, the competing vehicle on the target lane has more flexible actions (i.e., changing to other lanes) except for accelerating and decelerating actions. Thus, its temporary benefit is sometimes sacrificed by taking these actions to pursue the global benefit so that other vehicles could complete mandatory lane-changing maneuvers. It is a known fact that the space complexity expands exponentially as the game size increases, so a novel decomposition algorithm based on game theory is proposed to reduce the complexity and improve computational efficiency. Finally, a rule-based approach, a classic Nash equilibrium approach and the proposed decomposition algorithm are compared by the critical indicators such as the number of lane-changing vehicles, the maximum incoming queues during the process, the mean of computational time per iteration, etc. The performance shows no significant difference in the efficacy of lane-changing maneuvers among these approaches under the uncongested traffic condition. At the same time, the decomposition algorithm is more efficient in computing time than the classic Nash equilibrium approach. As the traffic gets congested, the game theory-based approaches prove more effective in lane-changing behaviours than the rule-based approach. Meanwhile, the decomposition algorithm outperforms the classic Nash equilibrium approach more significantly in terms of computational time.}

It is a type of decision making involving many decision makers which act collectively to choose the best alternative (or alternatives) from a set of feasible alternatives. Usually, numerical values have been used by the decision makers to express their opinions on the possible alternatives. However, as the standard representation of the concepts that humans use for communication is the natural language, words or linguistic terms instead of numerical values should be used by the decision makers to provide their preferences. In such a situation, the linguistic information has to be made operational in order to be fully utilized. In this contribution, assuming that decision makers express their opinions by using linguistic terms, we present an information granulation of such a type of information, which is formulated as an optimization problem in which consistency is maximized by a suitable mapping of the linguistic terms on information granules.}

The flow field modeling is performed through a sliding mesh technique that was used with k-ω SST turbulence model. The plasma body force generated by a dielectric barrier discharge DBD actuator is modeled with the phenomenological Shyy's model. The impact of plasma actuators on the flow is studied using two actuators located on the upper and bottom surfaces of the airfoil in each of the cyclorotor blades. Three cases are studied: actuation off; actuation over the upper surface of the blades; actuation over the bottom surface of the blades. The vorticity field and the evolution of the lift, thrust and power consumption are analyzed for when a control law is designed that combines both actuations based on the two last cases. The results show that the use of the proposed control law for plasma actuation improves the cyclorotor lift peak value per blade in 11% and the overall thrust by 1.5%. It is also demonstrated that the plasma actuator mitigates the virtual camber on the cyclorotor, this effect is named counter-virtual camber. We show that DBD actuators produce a reduction on the recirculation bubble at the blades suction surface. This effect is important to reduce the thickness of the blades, bringing improvements in terms of mitigating unsteady periodic mass acceleration in cyclorotors.}

The proposed control scheme contains three elements, a TDE element adopted to suitably cancel out the unknown lumped dynamics with purposely time-delayed signals of the closed-loop control system, a newly proposed FONTSM manifold adopted to realize finite-time convergence in the sliding mode phase and a fast-TSM-type reaching law adopted to ensure finite-time convergence in the reaching phase. The proposed control scheme is model-free and no longer needs system dynamics benefiting from TDE, which is very suitable and easy to use in practical applications. Meanwhile, high precision, fast convergence and good robustness against lumped uncertainties are ensured thanks to the newly proposed FONTSM manifold and adopted fast-TSM-type reaching law. Integrated stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is presented based on Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the effectiveness of our proposed control scheme is demonstrated by comparative 2-DoFs (degrees-of-freedom) simulation and experiments.}

abstract = {Radiative transfer models have long been used to characterize the foliar content at the leaf and canopy levels. However, they still do not apply well to close-range imaging spectroscopy, especially because directional effects are usually not taken into account. For this purpose, we introduce a physical approach to describe and simulate the variation in leaf reflectance observed at this scale. Two parameters are thus introduced to represent (1) specular reflection at the leaf surface and (2) local leaf orientation. The model, called COSINE (ClOse-range Spectral ImagiNg of lEaves), can be coupled with a directional–hemispherical reflectance model of leaf optical properties to relate the measured reflectance to the foliar content. In this study, we show that, when combining COSINE with the PROSPECT model, the overall PROCOSINE model allows for a robust submillimeter retrieval of foliar content based on numerical inversion and pseudo-bidirectional reflectance factor hyperspectral measurements. The relevance of the added parameters is first shown through a sensitivity analysis performed in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) ranges. PROCOSINE is then validated based on VNIR and SWIR hyperspectral images of various leaf species exhibiting different surface properties. Introducing these two parameters within the inversion allows us to obtain accurate maps of PROSPECT parameters, e.g., the chlorophyll content in the VNIR range, and the equivalent water thickness and leaf mass per area in the SWIR range. Through the estimation of light incident angle, the PROCOSINE inversion also provides information on leaf orientation, which is a critical parameter in vegetation remote sensing.}

One of the approaches to deal with these problems is the hybridization of techniques. This paper presents a hybrid metaheuristic that combines a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a Cross Entropy (CE) method to solve continuous optimization functions. The algorithm divides the population into two sub-populations, in order to apply GA in one sub-population and CE in the other. The proposed method is tested on 24 continuous benchmark functions, with four different dimension configurations. First, a study to find the best parameter configuration is done. The best configuration found is compared with several algorithms in the literature in order to demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposal. The results shows that GACE is the best performing method for instances with high dimensionality. Statistical tests have been applied, to support the conclusions obtained in the experimentation.}

However, it is difficult in practice to ensure signal sparsity making the reconstruction performance of the greedy algorithms stable. Moreover, some greedy algorithms with previous unknown signal sparsity are time-consuming in the process of adaptive adjustment of signal sparsity, and thereby making the reconstruction time too long. To address these concerns, the greedy algorithm from signal sparsity estimation proposed in this paper. Based on the restricted isometry property criterion, signal sparsity is estimated before atoms selection and the step size of atoms selection adjusted adaptively based on the relations between of the signal residuals in each iteration. The research which solves the problem of sparsity estimation in the greedy algorithm provides the compressed sensing available to the applications where the signal sparsity is un-known. It has important academic and practical values. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the performance of proposed algorithm to the greedy algorithms with previous unknown signal sparsity, no matter on the performance stability and reconstruction precision.}

As it is known, the quantization function is discontinuous, hence, nonsmooth analysis is used in this paper. We proved that with logarithmic quantizers, under undirected connected graph, the fault tolerant coordination scheme can be designed which makes the convergence set of the system goes to the origin. Furthermore, another fault tolerant coordination scheme is constructed by using uniform quantizers which makes the convergence set to go to a bounded set.

To address practical use of multitemporal lidar for forest and carbon monitoring, we conducted airborne lidar surveys four times from 2002 to 2012 over a region in Scotland, and combined the repeat lidar data with field inventories to map tree growth, biomass dynamics, and carbon change. Our analyses emphasized both individual tree detection and area-based, grid-level approaches. Lidar-detected heights of individual trees correlated well with field values, but with noticeable underestimation biases (r=0.94, bias=−1.5m, n=598) due to the increased probability of missing treetops as pulse density decreases. If not corrected for such biases, lidar provided unrealistic or wrong estimates of tree growth unless laser sampling rates were high enough (e.g., >7points/m2). Upon correction, lidar could detect sub-annual tree growth (p-value<0.05). At grid levels, forest biomass density was reliably estimated from area-based lidar metrics by both Random Forests (RF) and a linear functional model (r>0.86, RMSEcv<21Mg/ha), irrespective of laser sampling rates. But RF constantly overfit the data, often with poorer predictions. The better generality of the linear model was further confirmed by its transferability—fitted for one year but applicable to other years—a strength not possessed by RF but desired to alleviate the reliance on ground biomass data for model calibration. Resultant lidar maps of forest structure captured canopy dynamics and carbon flux at fine scales, consistent with growth histories and known disturbances. The entire 20-km2 study area sequestered carbon at a rate of 0.59±0.4MgC/ha/year. Overall, our study describes robust techniques well suited for multitemporal lidar analysis and affirms the utility and potential of repeat lidar data for resource monitoring and carbon management; however, the full potential cannot be attained without the support of accompanying field surveys or modeling efforts in enhancing stakeholders' trustworthiness of lidar-based inference.}

Data on smallholder maize systems are currently sparse, but satellite remote sensing offers promise for accelerating learning about these systems. Here we document the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to build “wall-to-wall” 10 m resolution maps of (i) cropland presence, (ii) maize presence, and (iii) maize yields for the main 2017 maize season in Kenya and Tanzania. Mapping these outcomes at this scale is extremely challenging because of very heterogeneous landscapes, lack of cloud-free satellite imagery, and the low quantity of quality ground-based data in these regions. First, we computed seasonal median composites of Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 optical reflectance measures for each pixel in the region, and used them to build both crop/non-crop and maize/non-maize Random Forest (RF) classifiers. Several thousand crop/non-crop labels were collected through an in-house GEE labeler, and thousands of crop type labels from the 2015–2017 growing seasons were obtained from various sources. Results show that the crop/non-crop classifier successfully identified cropland with over 85% out-of-sample accuracy in both countries, with Sentinel-1 being particularly useful for prediction. Among the cropped pixels, the maize/non-maize classier had an accuracy of 79% in Tanzania and 63% in Kenya. To map maize yields, we build on past work using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) that utilizes simulations from a crop model to train a regression that predicts yields from observations. Here we advance past approaches by (i) grouping simulations by Global Agro-Environmental Stratification (GAES) zones across the two countries, in order to account for landscape heterogeneity, (ii) utilizing gridded datasets on soil and sowing and harvest dates to setup model simulations in a scalable way; and (iii) utilizing all available satellite observations during the growing season in a parsimonious way by using harmonic regression fits implemented in GEE. SCYM estimates were able to capture about 50% of the variation in the yields at the district level in Western Kenya as measured by objective ground-based crop cuts. Finally, we illustrated the utility of our yield maps with two case studies. First, we document the magnitude and interannual variability of spatial heterogeneity of yields in each district, and how it varies for different parts of the region. Second, we combine our estimates with recently released soil databases in the region to investigate the most important soil constraints in the region. Soil factors explain a high fraction (72%) of variation in predicted yields, with the predominant factor being soil nitrogen levels. Overall, this study illustrates the power of combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, the GEE platform, and advanced classification and yield mapping algorithms to advance understanding of smallholder agricultural systems.}

abstract = {Woodland ecosystems, dominant on nearly 4% of all terrestrial land globally, are faced with a variety of threats, including increasingly prolonged and severe droughts, invasive insect outbreaks, and the rapid spread of pathogens. While many remote sensing methods have been developed for the detection and quantification of mortality in forested environments, woodland ecosystems present unique challenges to accurately mapping tree die-off due to relatively lower canopy covers, smaller and irregularly-shaped tree crowns, and greater influence of understory vegetation and soil cover on reflectance. To address these challenges, we developed a multi-sensor, multi-scale approach combining the analytical strengths of centimeter-resolution unmanned aerial system imagery for interpreting individual tree-level mortality, airborne lidar for crown mapping and quantifying percent canopy mortality, and Landsat imagery for upscaling mortality estimates to a regional scale. This approach utilizes a new algorithm for delineating the shapes of small, irregular woodland tree crowns using lidar. To demonstrate the application of this method, we map the extent and severity of a recent tree mortality event in piñon-juniper (PJ) woodlands of southeastern Utah. Our results suggest that 39% of PJ in this region has experienced some level of mortality, with patches exceeding 50% mortality. An analysis of potential mortality drivers revealed that canopy cover, terrain, and recent winter precipitation conditions are most directly linked with mortality, although the explanatory power of the mortality driver model was low. Our approach demonstrates a methodology that could be used for tree mortality mapping and scaling in a variety woodland ecosystems, and can provide a strong basis for further ecophysiological, ecological, and carbon cycle studies involving woodland tree mortality.}
