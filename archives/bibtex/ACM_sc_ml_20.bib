abstract = {Research in the Internet of Things (IoT) conceives a world where everyday objects are connected to the Internet and exchange, store, process, and collect data from the surrounding environment. IoT devices are becoming essential for supporting the delivery of data to enable electronic services, but they are not sufficient in most cases to host application services directly due to their intrinsic resource constraints. Fog Computing (FC) can be a suitable paradigm to overcome these limitations, as it can coexist and cooperate with centralized Cloud systems and extends the latter toward the network edge. In this way, it is possible to distribute resources and services of computing, storage, and networking along the Cloud-to-Things continuum. As such, FC brings all the benefits of Cloud Computing (CC) closer to end (user) devices. This article presents a survey on the employment of FC to support IoT devices and services. The principles and literature characterizing FC are described, highlighting six IoT application domains that may benefit from the use of this paradigm. The extension of Cloud systems towards the network edge also creates new challenges and can have an impact on existing approaches employed in Cloud-based deployments. Research directions being adopted by the community are highlighted, with an indication of which of these are likely to have the greatest impact. An overview of existing FC software and hardware platforms for the IoT is also provided, along with the standardisation efforts in this area initiated by the OpenFog Consortium (OFC).},

abstract = {The Coronavirus pandemic is one of the most devastating encounters in modern times. Over 175 million cases have been recorded globally with over 3.5 million deaths. Disseminating information to billions of people during the pandemic has been challenging, and social media has been one of the key resources for the public during these excruciating circumstances. Social media and other online sources have made it easier to access information on a variety of topics. This article presents an exploration of social media trends pertinent to information on the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of several technological advances, as well as methods for evaluating their effectiveness in combating COVID-19. We examine global case studies on the use of data from various sources to tackle COVID-19, address the issue of trust between the government and the public, and shed light on the manner in which it influences the public perception of information. We delve into the role of advances in web technology and data science in curbing COVID-19 while also touching upon the impacts in the field of smart living and healthcare. We examine studies from regions around the world, explore how the pandemic has affected people from different walks of life, and peek into the utilization of advances for disseminating information as well as curbing the spread of the virus. Additionally, we briefly discuss how the works investigated here can open pathways of research to help in further enhancing the situation as we all head towards the light at the end of the tunnel, and strive to restore global normalcy.},

abstract = {Increasing incorporation of advanced information technologies makes business and public organisations more effective and efficient, while often introducing exploitable vulnerabilities. The efficient provision of security of interconnected, and interdependent, processes and sectors against cyberattacks requires deep understanding of vulnerabilities, exposure, potential negative impact, as well as the contribution existing and emerging organisational and technological solutions will potentially have on preventing attacks, reducing vulnerabilities, protecting digital infrastructures, response and recovery, and resilience. Such understanding will allow minimisation of risks against a spectrum of plausible cyber threats and reducing negative consequences of one or a series of cyberattacks.Due to the complexity of the problem, the effective implementation of a number of functions and tasks in designing and operating distributed cyber secure and resilient systems require significant computational resources. This paper outlines six highlevel, computationally demanding functions. The first three relate to the formulation and implementation of cybersecurity policy: understanding risk; planning and implementing cybersecurity measures; and continuous adaptation to the changing technological, threat and policy landscape. The other three functions are operational: situational awareness, including detection of cyberattacks and hybrid malicious activities; operational decision making, e.g. selecting a course of action under attack; and cyber forensics.},

abstract = {Crowdsensing systems can be either participatory or opportunistic, depending on whether the user intentionally contributes data, or she simply acts as the bearer of a sensing device from which data is transparently collected. In this paper, we propose hybrid crowdsensing, a social media-based paradigm which aims at combining the strengths of both participatory and opportunistic crowdsensing. With hybrid crowdsensing, possibly relevant data is collected via an opportunistic approach. Then, users that spontaneously contributed are directly contacted and asked to provide additional information following a participatory approach. To demonstrate its feasibility and usefulness, we experimented the proposed paradigm for involving Twitter users in an emergency relief scenario. For each of the two real-world experiments we analyze the answer ratio to our questions, their time distribution, and responders' willingness to collaborate. Results support the adoption of hybrid crowdsensing, especially in those practical scenarios where users are emotionally involved.},

A gateway is designed and implemented to achieve DDS-HLA interoperability. This gateway has the ability to realize two-way data transfer between DDS and HLA systems. The gateway design is based on the idea of a configurable connector that is equipped with variability capabilities. It can perform data-type conversions between these two systems according to the mappings specified by the user.

abstract = {Car rental companies have to operate the fleet of vehicles considering a cost effective fleet sizing and rebalancing of the vehicles. Additionally, they have to ensure a good vehicle availability at the rental stations. We present a simulation model combined with optimization and queueing network analysis for mobility-on-demand networks with one-way car sharing. The system is modeled as a closed queueing network. On the one hand, this allows an estimation of the vehicle availability; on the other hand, constraints for the optimization model can be derived from the mathematical equations of the queuing network model. To optimize the total revenue, the optimization model considers price incentives for customer trips and cost of empty trips resulting in a mixed-integer linear programming problem. The simulation uses the optimization component for an optimized operation of the mobility-on-demand networks and computes the optimal fleet size, the cost of empty runs, and the vehicle availability.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence-enabled applications on edge devices have the potential to revolutionize disease detection and monitoring in future smart health (sHealth) systems. In this study, we investigated a minimalist approach for the severity classification, severity estimation, and progression monitoring of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a home environment using wearables. We used the recursive feature elimination technique to select the best feature set of 70 features from a total of 200 features extracted from polysomnogram. We used a multi-layer perceptron model to investigate the performance of OSA severity classification with all the ranked features to a subset of features available from either Electroencephalography or Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and time duration of SpO2 level. The results indicate that using only computationally inexpensive features from HRV and SpO2, an area under the curve of 0.91 and an accuracy of 83.97% can be achieved for the severity classification of OSA. For estimation of the apnea-hypopnea index, the accuracy of RMSE&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.6 and R-squared value&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.71 have been achieved in the test set using only ranked HRV and SpO2 features. The Wilcoxon-signed-rank test indicates a significant change (p&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0.05) in the selected feature values for a progression in the disease over 2.5 years. The method has the potential for integration with edge computing for deployment on everyday wearables. This may facilitate the preliminary severity estimation, monitoring, and management of OSA patients and reduce associated healthcare costs as well as the prevalence of untreated OSA.},

abstract = {High-Performance Computing (HPC) is one of the strategic priorities for research and innovation worldwide due to its relevance for industrial and scientific applications. We envision HPC as composed of three pillars: infrastructures, applications, and key technologies and tools. While infrastructures are by construction centralized in large-scale HPC centers, and applications are generally within the purview of domain-specific organizations, key technologies fall in an intermediate case where coordination is needed, but design and development are often decentralized. A large group of Italian researchers has started a dedicated laboratory within the National Interuniversity Consortium for Informatics (CINI) to address this challenge. The laboratory, albeit young, has managed to succeed in its first attempts to propose a coordinated approach to HPC research within the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, participating in the calls 2019--20 to five successful proposals for an aggregate total cost of 95M€. In this paper, we outline the working group's scope and goals and provide an overview of the five funded projects, which become fully operational in March 2021, and cover a selection of key technologies provided by the working group partners, highlighting their usage development within the projects.},

abstract = { Modeling human mobility has a wide range of applications from urban planning to simulations of disease spread. It is well known that humans spend &nbsp;80% of their time indoors but modeling indoor human mobility is challenging due to three main reasons: (i) the absence of easily acquirable, reliable, low-cost indoor mobility datasets, (ii) high prediction space in modeling the frequent indoor mobility, and (iii) multi-scalar periodicity and correlations in mobility. To deal with all these challenges, we propose WiFiMod, a Transformer-based, data-driven approach that models indoor human mobility at multiple spatial scales using WiFi system logs. WiFiMod takes as input enterprise WiFi system logs to extract human mobility trajectories from smartphone digital traces. Next, for each extracted trajectory, we identify the mobility features at multiple spatial scales, macro and micro, to design a multi-modal embedding Transformer that predicts user mobility for several hours to an entire day across multiple spatial granularities. Multi-modal embedding captures the mobility periodicity and correlations across various scales while Transformers capture long term mobility dependencies boosting model prediction performance. This approach significantly reduces the prediction space by first predicting macro mobility, then modeling indoor scale mobility, micro mobility, conditioned on the estimated macro mobility distribution, thereby using the topological constraint of the macro-scale. Experimental results show that WiFiMod achieves a prediction accuracy of at least 10% points higher than the current state-of-art models. Additionally, we present 3 real-world applications of WiFiMod - (i) predict high density hot pockets and space utilization for policy making decisions for COVID19 or ILI, (ii) generate a realistic simulation of indoor mobility data to simulate spread of diseases, (iii) design personal assistants.},

abstract = {Benefitting from the development of pervasive computing, recent years have witnessed a variety of meaningful human-centric applications, where automating the recognition of human activities plays a central role in bridging the gap between sensing data and high-level services. Accelerometer-based activity recognizer often remains a priority due to its recognition performance, low costs, and portability, however, few studies systematically investigate how to extract and use features from the time-series sensor data and further compare their discriminant power. To this end, we herein propose two different ways of extracting features and exploring their combinations. Specifically, we take as a resultant axis or separate channels the accelerometer axes and then extract axes-resultant and axis-wise features. Afterwards, we evaluate the cases where the two feature sets are used separately or jointly. Finally, we conduct comparative experiments on two public activity recognition datasets with five different classification models in terms of four performance metrics. Results show that the use of axis-wise features outperforms its competitor in the majority across the datasets and that their joint use generally leads to enhanced accuracy.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones equipped with cameras are extensively used in different scenarios such as surveillance of hazardous locations, disaster response and crime fighting. The related video streaming/analytics requires real-time drone-to-Ground Control Station (GCS) communication and computation co-ordination for desired user Quality of Experience (QoE). In situations where the quality of the video can be affected by occlusions (e.g., image distortion, frame stalling) due to network bottlenecks, there is a need to dynamically make decisions on the computation offloading and networking protocols in order to properly handle the video data for real world application purposes. In this paper, we propose a novel function-centric computing approach that helps a user to perform drone video analytics to assess a wide-area scene to chart a plan of action. Our approach involves handling network impairments affecting the switching between high resolution/low resolution video capture, or change of camera direction for assessment of the scene effectively. It also features a novel video quality enhancing algorithm based on occlusion-detection that adapts to video impairments related to image distortion and frame stalling. Our experiment results from a realistic testbed show that our approach can efficiently choose the suitable networking protocols (i.e., TCP/HTTP, UDP/RTP, QUIC) and orchestrate both the camera control on the drone, and the computation off-loading of the video analytics over limited edge computing resources. The performance improvements for computation off-loading involving our video quality enhancing algorithm are shown for different network conditions in terms of occlusion rate and processing times.},

abstract = { The Software Defined Internet of Things-Fog (SDIoT-Fog) has provided a new connectivity paradigm for effective service provisioning. SDIoT-Fog uses network resource virtualization to provide services to heterogeneous IoT devices. However, data privacy, and security are the two major challenges that prevents faster realization of SDIoT-based frameworks. Motivated from the aforementioned challenges, we present a Privacy-Preserving based Intrusion Detection Framework (P2IDF) for protecting confidential data and to detect malicious instances in SDIoT-Fog network traffic. This framework has two key engines. Firstly, a Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE)-based privacy-preservation engine is suggested that transforms original data into a new encoded form that avoids inference attacks. Secondly, an intrusion detection engine is suggested that uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to train and evaluate the outcomes of the proposed privacy-preservation engine using an IoT-based dataset named ToN-IoT. Finally, experimental results showed that the proposed P2IDF framework outperforms with some recent state-of-the-art frameworks in terms of detection rate, accuracy and precision score.},

abstract = {With the explosive growth of unstructured data (such as images, videos, and audios), unstructured data analytics is widespread in a rich vein of real-world applications. Many database systems start to incorporate unstructured data analysis to meet such demands. However, queries over unstructured and structured data are often treated as disjoint tasks in most systems, where hybrid queries (i.e., involving both data types) are not yet fully supported.In this paper, we present a hybrid analytic engine developed at Alibaba, named AnalyticDB-V (ADBV), to fulfill such emerging demands. ADBV offers an interface that enables users to express hybrid queries using SQL semantics by converting unstructured data to high dimensional vectors. ADBV adopts the lambda framework and leverages the merits of approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) techniques to support hybrid data analytics. Moreover, a novel ANNS algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy on large-scale vectors representing massive unstructured data. All ANNS algorithms are implemented as physical operators in ADBV, meanwhile, accuracy-aware cost-based optimization techniques are proposed to identify effective execution plans. Experimental results on both public and in-house datasets show the superior performance achieved by ADBV and its effectiveness. ADBV has been successfully deployed on Alibaba Cloud to provide hybrid query processing services for various real-world applications.},

To take advantage of available devices’ distributed resources, applications often are structured as microservices, often having stringent requirements of low latency and high availability. However, a decentralized edge system that the application may be intended for is characterized by high volatility, due to devices making up the system being unreliable or leaving the network unexpectedly. This makes application deployment and assurance that it will continue to operate under volatility challenging. We propose an adaptive framework capable of deploying and efficiently maintaining a microservice-based application at runtime, by tackling two intertwined problems: (i) finding a microservice placement across device hosts and (ii) deriving invocation paths that serve it. Our objective is to maintain correct functionality by satisfying given requirements in terms of end-to-end latency and availability, in a volatile edge environment. We evaluate our solution quantitatively by considering performance and failure recovery.},

abstract = {Demand for computer vision analytics in the embedded world has increased rapidly as the Internet of Things (IoT) expands into cities, workplaces, and homes. Common computationally intensive video and scene analysis tasks, such as pedestrian detection, counting, and tracking, are often relegated to acceleration hardware, or embedded GPUs. This paper showcases decision-making heuristics designed to improve the performance of these analytics. Working within the constraints of low power IoT infrastructure typically utilized in urban, traffic-heavy environments, our Precedent-Aware Classification (PAC) framework provides efficient pedestrian and vehicle detection in the absence of dedicated acceleration hardware. Our implementation takes advantage of frequently traveled routes in order to reduce the amount of required computation, which helps meet the tight timing requirements of embedded platforms where traditional computation models tend to fail. Testing and performance analysis of PAC was done using an ARM Cortex-A9 embedded processor, residing within the Xilinx Zynq 7000 FPGA. In normally populated traffic situations, PAC produced an average 3.23x speed-up and an average 16% improvement in pedestrian detection accuracy over using traditional classifiers alone.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges in facial expression recognition (FER) is to address the disturbance caused by various disturbing factors, including common ones (such as identity, pose, and illumination) and potential ones (such as hairstyle, accessory, and occlusion). Recently, a number of FER methods have been developed to explicitly or implicitly alleviate the disturbance involved in facial images. However, these methods either consider only a few common disturbing factors or neglect the prior information of these disturbing factors, thus resulting in inferior recognition performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-branch Disturbance Disentangling Network (D3Net), mainly consisting of an expression branch and a disturbance branch, to perform effective FER. In the disturbance branch, a label-aware sub-branch (LAS) and a label-free sub-branch (LFS) are elaborately designed to cope with different types of disturbing factors. On the one hand, LAS explicitly captures the disturbance due to some common disturbing factors by transfer learning on a pretrained model. On the other hand, LFS implicitly encodes the information of potential disturbing factors in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we introduce an Indian buffet process (IBP) prior to model the distribution of potential disturbing factors in LFS. Moreover, we leverage adversarial training to increase the differences between disturbance features and expression features, thereby enhancing the disentanglement of disturbing factors. By disentangling the disturbance from facial images, we are able to extract discriminative expression features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against several state-of-the-art FER methods on both in-the-lab and in-the-wild databases.},

abstract = {With the advance in automatic speech recognition, voice user interface has gained popularity recently. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, VUI is increasingly preferred in online communication due to its non-contact. Additionally, various ambient noise impedes the public applications of voice user interfaces due to the requirement of audio-only speech recognition methods for a high signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we present Wavoice, the first noise-resistant multi-modal speech recognition system that fuses two distinct voice sensing modalities, i.e., millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals and audio signals from a microphone, together. One key contribution is that we model the inherent correlation between mmWave and audio signals. Based on it, Wavoice facilitates the real-time noise-resistant voice activity detection and user targeting from multiple speakers. Furthermore, we elaborate on two novel modules into the neural attention mechanism for multi-modal signals fusion, and result in accurate speech recognition. Extensive experiments verify Wavoice's effectiveness under various conditions with the character recognition error rate below 1% in a range of 7 meters. Wavoice outperforms existing audio-only speech recognition methods with lower character error rate and word error rate. The evaluation in complex scenes validates the robustness of Wavoice.},

abstract = {The number of IoT (Internet of Things) devices connected in the Internet has been increasing rapidly. Each of these devices are manufactured by different vendors and provide multiple options for connections. When these devices are connected with default settings to create a user centric IoT network, it exposes a lot of vulnerabilities. In this research we propose a framework that will create a 3-layered abstraction in the IoT network to identify the user requirements on the IoT devices and explore all possible connections in an IoT network. Our goal is to provide a mapping of the user requirements on the IoT network and ensure that the mapping is secured.},

abstract = {Distributed networks and real-time systems are becoming the most important components for the new computer age – the Internet of Things (IoT), with huge data streams generated from sensors and data sets generated from existing legacy systems. The data generated offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. This can be achieved through the analysis of the heterogeneous data sources (structured and unstructured). In this paper, we propose a distributed framework – Event STream Processing Engine for Environmental Monitoring Domain (ESTemd) for the application of stream processing on heterogeneous environmental data. Our work in this area demonstrates the useful role big data techniques can play in an environmental decision support system, early warning and forecasting systems. The proposed framework addresses the challenges of data heterogeneity from heterogeneous systems and offers real-time processing of huge environmental datasets through a publish/subscribe method via a unified data pipeline with the application of Apache Kafka for real-time analytics.},

abstract = {The calibration of agent-based pedestrian simulation models requires empirical data. To avoid cost-intensive real-world experiments, human-in-the-loop simulations can be applied in which simulated pedestrians interact with human-controlled agents. However, the experiment results may be unrealistic if the human participants are presented with agents acting according to an uncalibrated model. We propose an incremental calibration approach that aims to address the circular dependency between the behaviour of human and simulated pedestrians. By incrementally adapting the parameters of the simulated agents to match the behaviour of the human participants, we aim to gradually approach a realistic interaction. We evaluate our approach using the simulation of the boarding procedure of a public transport vehicle in 2D and virtual reality experiments. The calibration results are compared with those gathered from a traditional non-incremental calibration. Our results indicate the feasibility of our approach and highlight the necessity for future research on efficient simulation model calibration.},

abstract = {In this article, first a comprehensive study of the impact of term weighting schemes on the topic modeling performance (i.e., LDA and DMM) on Arabic long and short texts is presented. We investigate six term weighting methods including Word count method (standard topic models), TFIDF, PMI, BDC, CLPB, and CEW. Moreover, we propose a novel combination term weighting scheme, namely, CmTLB. We utilize the mTFIDF that takes into account the missing terms and the number of the documents in which the term appears when calculating the term weight. For further robust term weight, we combine mTFIDF with two weighting methods. We evaluate CmTLB against the studied weighting schemes by the quality of the learned topics (topic visualization and topic coherence), classification, and clustering tasks. We applied weighting schemes to Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Dirichlet multinomial mixture (DMM) on eight Arabic long and short document datasets, respectively. The experiment results outline that appropriate weighting schemes can effectively improve topic modeling performance on Arabic texts. More importantly, our proposed CmTLB significantly outperforms the other weighting schemes. Secondly, we investigate whether the Arabic stemming process can improve topic modeling performance. We study the three approaches of Arabic stemming including root-based, stem-based, and statistical approaches. We also train topic models with weighting schemes on documents after applying four stemmers related to different stemming approaches. The results outline that applying the stemming process not only reduces the dimensionality of term-document matrix leading to fast estimation process, but also show enhancement of topic modeling performance both on short and long Arabic documents. Moreover, Farasa stemmer achieves the highest performance in most cases, since it prevents the ambiguity that may happen because of the blind removal of the affixes such as in root-based or stem-based stemmers.},

abstract = {Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged as a flexible and cost-effective paradigm, enabling resource constrained mobile devices to offload, either partially or completely, computationally intensive tasks to a set of servers at the edge of the network. Given that the shared nature of the servers' resources introduces high computation and communication uncertainty, in this paper we consider users' risk-seeking or loss-aversion behavior in their final decisions regarding the portion of their computing tasks to be offloaded at each server in a multi-MEC server environment, while executing the rest locally. This is achieved by capitalizing on the power and principles of Prospect Theory and Tragedy of the Commons, treating each MEC server as a Common Pool of Resources available to all the users, while being rivarlous and subtractable, thus may potentially fail if over-exploited by the users. The goal of each user becomes to maximize its perceived satisfaction, as expressed through a properly formulated prospect-theoretic utility function, by offloading portion of its computing tasks to the different MEC servers. To address this problem and conclude to the optimal allocation strategy, a non-cooperative game among the users is formulated and the corresponding Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE), i.e., optimal data offloading, is determined, while a distributed low-complexity algorithm that converges to the PNE is introduced. The performance and key principles of the proposed framework are demonstrated through modeling and simulation, while useful insights about the users' data offloading decisions under realistic conditions and behaviors are presented.},

abstract = { Services are normally composed following a structured model, or based on a particular goal that needs to be fulfilled. Such model is problematic for pervasive environments, since service components deployed in the environment are unknown beforehand. As a result, services may never execute due to the unavailability of one of the pre-specified components, or components missing to fulfill the service goal. This paper posits a new vision for service composition by inverting the control flow of service-oriented applications between users and the environment. Rather than having to request a particular service, services emerge from the environment based on interactions between available service components, and are pushed to be utilized by users. We present the architecture required to fulfill our vision in enabling service emergence in a pervasive environment. This vision architecture is realized by an initial prototype framework for software service emergence called Mordor. Early results of this vision are obtained from two examples demonstrating the feasibility of services emergence from previously unknown service components, and a case study demonstrating Mordor's usability in real world scenarios. },

abstract = {Private and public institutions are using open and public data to provide better services, which increases the impact of open data on daily life. With the advancement of technology, it becomes also important to equip our younger generation with the essential skills for future challenges. In order to bring up a generation equipped with 21st century skills, open data could facilitate educational processes at school level as an educational resource. Open data could acts as a key resource to enhance the understanding of data through critical thinking and ethical vision among the youth and school pupils. To bring open data into schools, it is important to know the teacher's perspective on open data literacy and its possible impact on pupils. As a research contribution, we answered these questions through a Danish public school teacher's survey where we interviewed 10 Danish public school teachers of grade 5-7th and analyzed their views about the impact of open data on pupils' learning development. After analyzing Copenhagen city's open data, we identified four open data educational themes that could facilitate different subjects, e.g. geography, mathematics, basic science and social science. The survey includes interviews, open discussions, questionnaires and an experiment with the grade 7th pupils, where we test the pupils' understanding with open data. The survey concluded that open data cannot only empower pupils to understand real facts about their local areas, improve civics awareness and develop digital and data skills, but also enable them to come up with the ideas to improve their communities.},

However, when available resources cannot satisfy those requirements, no guidance or alternative options are offered by existing composition solutions. In this paper we address this issue by presenting an approach that tries to find substitutions for unavailable resources while satisfying the initial requirements. If no satisfactory substitutions are found, the requirements are adapted based on the resources available. Given that such requirements adaptation might be unbounded, we limit the search space guided by the available resources. Our approach ensures that alternative compositions given to users are achievable using available resources. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by implementing a prototype tool and applying it to support individuals in meal planning to reduce food waste.},

A major challenge for BSS operators is the optimal resource allocation so as to have a full-time, flexible and operational system. Due to the multi-dimensional nature of the problem, an overall view of the system and a deep analysis are required. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted to date on taking a process mining view on BSS. The main idea and the scope of this paper is to analyze BSS as a process and employ process mining techniques to provide multi-perspective analysis and answer questions about the structure and operation of the system, so as to contribute to the optimal resource allocation management. From the analysis, it is shown that visual representations and animations can contribute to a better understanding of the functioning of the system and to the optimization of decision making.},
