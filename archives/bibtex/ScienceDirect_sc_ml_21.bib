abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.}

abstract = {The extensive utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a wide range of services prompts spectrum scarcity. Recently, Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have shown promising results in addressing the spectrum scarcity problem. Therefore, CRNs are envisaged to play a crucial role in accommodating the massive number of emerging IoT devices. However, two dominant shortcomings hinder the coalescence of IoT and CRNs. First, the selfish behavior among Secondary Users (SUs) during the spectrum sensing process. Second, the inability to construct a convenient metric for fair spectrum assignment. The contribution of this paper is quadruple: (i) a Direct Strategy Selection (DSS) mechanism that satisfies Aspiration Equilibrium (AE) and enforces cooperation among SUs during the spectrum sensing process; (ii) a spectrum allocation scheme that takes cooperative behavior as a fairness parameter; (iii) studying the effects of three windowing techniques on the proposed allocation scheme and selecting the window that achieves maximum fairness; (iv) exploring the trade-off between the utility function and cooperation among SUs. The results show that DSS yields instant convergence and a threefold increase in the index of cooperation. Regarding spectrum allocation, the proposed scheme combined with the Reverse Attenuation Window (RAW) shows a 22% increase in the Average Satisfaction Ratio (ASR) for SUs. The simulations are conducted in the worst case scenario, where all SUs in the CRN are requesting to access the spectrum at the same time.}

The benefit of IoT devices is that they enable automation however, a significant amount of energy is required for billions of connected devices communicating with each other. This requirement of energy, unless managed, can be one of the barriers in the complete implementation of IoT systems. This paper presents the energy management system for IoT devices. Both hardware and software aspects are considered. Energy transparency has been achieved by modelling energy consumed during sensing, processing, and communication. A multi-agent system has been introduced to model the IoT devices and their energy consumptions. Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the multi-agent system. Finally, simulation tools such as MATLAB Simulink and OpenModelica are used to test the system. The optimization results have revealed substantial energy consumption with the implementation of decentralized intelligence of the multi-agent system.}

However, different workers may provide data with varied degrees of quality. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a reliable crowdsensing system that guarantees the quality of service (QoS) for each task. In this paper, we propose a Reputation-based Multi-Auditing algorithmic mechanism (RMA) by integrating Task-based Temporal Reputation mechanism (TTR) and Reputation-based PM truth inference algorithm (RPM). Further, Performance-Based Payments scheme (PBP) is adopted to promote truthful workers. Based on the past benefits, the behavior of a rational requester may vary over time. Particularly, reinforcement learning and (1-ϵ) accuracy algorithm are used to model the update policy of a requester’s strategy. Both rational and irrational workers are considered in this paper. Depending on whether a worker can perceive the benefits of other workers, K-armed bandits and neighborhood learning mechanism are respectively adopted to model the update policy of rational workers. By using Lyapunov stability theory, it is qualitatively proved that the trustful provision of sensed data provides an unique stable evolutionary equilibrium for each rational worker in our proposed system. Finally, extensive simulations and real data experiments illustrate that the RMA mechanism has an outstanding performance on discovering truth and achieving profits.}

However, most existing video analysis methods do not take into account the effect of video semantic information. The topological information of the video image plays an important role in describing the association relationship of the image content, which will help to improve the discriminability of the video feature expression. Based on the above considerations, we propose a video semantic feature learning method that integrates image topological sparse coding with dynamic time warping algorithm to improve the gesture recognition in videos. This method divides video feature learning into two phases: semi-supervised video image feature learning and supervised optimization of video sequence features. Next, a distance weighting based dynamic time warping algorithm and K-nearest neighbor algorithm is leveraged to recognize gestures. We conduct comparative experiments on table tennis video dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more discriminative to the expression of video features and can effectively improve the recognition rate of gestures in sports video.}

To address this challenge, this project uses multivariate statistical techniques to analyze the city of Madrid (Spain) at the urban level, and to detect the impact of ICTs on the current structure of the city. The methodology develops a novel factor and cluster analysis approach that incorporates spatial constraints in a stepwise manner. This is based on a set of indicators, mainly on demographics, diversity, mobility and digital-society. The results, among other things, show an optimal classification grouping, as well as the way it was obtained, in this grouping different relationships were detected between the built space, urban services and the digital society. These results confirm the growing influence of the digital society in the modification of urban structures and dynamics, highlighting the need to translate this influence into effective planning and development criteria.}

However, different terminologies, namely smart manufacturing (SM) and intelligent manufacturing (IM), have been applied to what may be broadly characterized as a similar paradigm by some researchers and practitioners. While SM and IM are similar, they are not identical. From an evolutionary perspective, there has been little consideration on whether the definition, thought, connotation, and technical development of the concepts of SM or IM are consistent in the literature. To address this gap, the work performs a qualitative and quantitative investigation of research literature to systematically compare inherent differences of SM and IM and clarify the relationship between SM and IM. A bibliometric analysis of publication sources, annual publication numbers, keyword frequency, and top regions of research and development establishes the scope and trends of the currently presented research. Critical topics discussed include origin, definitions, evolutionary path, and key technologies of SM and IM. The implementation architecture, standards, and national focus are also discussed. In this work, a basis to understand SM and IM is provided, which is increasingly important because the trend to merge both terminologies rises in Industry 4.0 as intelligence is being rapidly applied to modern manufacturing and human–cyber–physical systems.}

For a long time, taxi service is facing a typical challenge, that is, passengers may be detoured and overcharged by some unethical taxi drivers, especially when traveling in unfamiliar cities. As a result, it is important to detect taxi drivers’ misbehavior through taxi’s GPS big data analysis in a real-time manner for enhancing the quality of taxi services. In view of this challenge, an online anomalous trajectory detection method, named OnATrade (pronounced “on a trade,” which means activities in a taxi trade on the fly), is investigated in this paper for improving taxi service using GPS big data. The method mainly consists of two steps: route recommendation and online detection. In the first step, route candidates are generated by using a route recommendation algorithm. In the second step, an online anomalous trajectory detection approach is presented to find taxis that have driving anomalies. Experiments evaluate the validity of our method on large-scale, real-world taxi GPS trajectories. Finally, several value-added applications benefiting from big data analysis over taxi’s GPS data sets are discussed for potential commercial applications.}

abstract = {Background
Emerging research suggested an association of early-life particulate air pollution exposure with development of asthma in childhood. However, the potentially differential effects of submicron particulate matter (PM; PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤1 μm [PM1]) remain largely unknown.
Objective
This study primarily aimed to investigate associations of childhood asthma and wheezing with in utero and first-year exposures to size-specific particles.
Methods
We conducted a large cross-sectional survey among 5788 preschool children aged 3 to 5 years in central China. In utero and first-year exposures to ambient PM1, PM with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm, and PM with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 μm at 1 × 1-km resolution were assessed using machine learning–based spatiotemporal models. A time-to-event analysis was performed to examine associations between residential PM exposures and childhood onset of asthma and wheezing.
Results
Early-life size-specific PM exposures, particularly during pregnancy, were significantly associated with increased risk of asthma, whereas no evident PM-wheezing associations were observed. Each 10-μg/m3 increase in in utero and first-year PM1 exposure was accordingly associated with an asthma’s hazard ratio in childhood of 1.618 (95% CI, 1.159-2.258; P = .005) and 1.543 (0.822-2.896; P = .177). Subgroup analyses suggest that short breast-feeding duration may aggravate PM-associated risk of childhood asthma. Each 10-μg/m3 increase in in utero exposure to PM1, for instance, was associated with a hazard ratio of 2.260 (1.393-3.666) among children with 0 to 5 months’ breast-feeding and 1.156 (0.721-1.853) among those longer breast-fed.
Conclusions
Our study added comparative evidence for increased risk of childhood asthma in relation to early-life PM exposures, highlighting stronger associations with ambient PM1 than with PM with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm and PM with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 μm.}

This paper brings an idea of an intelligent speed breaker system that helps in detecting speed breakers well in time so that such accidents can be avoided. This system makes use of a RF module that warns the person who is driving about the existence of a speed breaker in proximity, with this it assists in automatically reducing the vehicle’s speed if no action is taken by the driver in time.

This need has justified extensive efforts towards the design of effective solutions for extracting this information. In this work, we present the People Mobility Analytics (PmA) solution, which collects probe requests generated by Wi-Fi devices when scanning the radio channels to detect Access Points. The PmA system processes the collected data to extract key insights on the people mobility, such as: crowd density per area of interest, people flows, time of permanence, time of return, heat maps, origin-destination matrices and estimation of people positions.

The implementation of the new Learning Ability Index (LAI) is demonstrated by way of three different case studies chosen from the literature. It is concluded that LAI is an easy and illustrative tool to assess the learning ability of buildings. Particularly, it is useful for monitoring the performance of data-driven processes, when pursuing the preferred strategies to reach higher levels of building intelligence. The LAI considers the time invested in learning plus the quality and diversity of learning material. It is flexible with respect to system boundaries or the performance metrics, wherefore it can be implemented as a generic indicator of system evolution, as well.}

abstract = {Real-time road traffic monitoring is widely considered to be a promising traffic management approach in urban environments. In the smart cities scenario, traffic trajectory sensor data streams are constantly produced in real time from probe vehicles, which include taxis and buses. By exploiting the mass sensor data streams, we can effectively predict and prevent traffic jams in a timely manner. However, there are two urgent challenges to processing the massive amounts of continuously generated trajectory sensor data: (1) the inhomogeneous sparseness in both spatial and temporal dimensions that is introduced by probe vehicles moving at their own will, and (2) processing stream data in real time manner with low latency. In this study, we aim to ameliorate the aforementioned two issues. We propose an online approach to addresses the major defect of inhomogeneous sparseness, which focuses on employing only real-time data rather than mining historical data. Furthermore, we set up a real-time system to process trajectory data with low latency. Our tests are performed using field test data sets derived from taxis in an urban environment; the results show that our proposed method lends validity and efficiency advantages for tackling the sparseness, and our real-time system is viable for low latency applications such as trafficmonitoring.}

However, it is very difficult to detection objects from aerial images. The reason is that the scale of objects in the aerial images captured by UAVs varies greatly and needs to meet certain real-time performance in detection. To deal with these challenges, we proposed a lightweight model named DSYolov3. We made the following improvements to the Yolov3 model: 1) multiple scale-aware decision discrimination network to detect objects in different scales, 2) a multi-scale fusion-based channel attention model to exploit the channel-wise information complementation, 3) a sparsity-based channel pruning to compress the model. Extensive experimental evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. By the proposed approach, we could not only achieve better performance than most existing detectors but also ensure the models practicable on the UAVs.}

A well-defined system paradigm and EA help enterprises in adopting appropriate manufacturing resources and technologies, optimizing plans, schedules, and controls of production lines, and coping with complexity, changes, and uncertainties of business processes cost-effectively. It is understandable that a system paradigm should be evolved along with the availability and advancement of advanced manufacturing technologies; on the other hand, new system paradigms are mostly inspired by some successful manufacturing applications of new information technologies (ITs). One of the recently developed system paradigms is Digital Manufacturing (DM) where Digital Twin (DT-I) is used to describe the interactions of virtual and physical entities. This paper discusses the concepts of DM and DT-I and rationalizes the relations of DM and DT-I; in particular, the origin and evolution of DT-I are explored in details to identify its limitations to be used as an EA for DM. It is our finding that existing IT concepts show their limitations in supporting smooth transitions when systems have to be reconfigured in dealing with long-term changes in Sustainable Manufacturing, and this is evidenced by the fact of the trend of the shortened lifespans of modern enterprises even with the aids of rapidly developed digital technologies in decades. To overcome these limitations, a new concept so called Digital Triad (DT-II) is coined and the Internet of Digital Triad Things (IoDTT) is proposed as an information integration (II) solution for digital manufacturing enterprises, and their application is illustrated through a reconfigurable robotic system example. The rationales and significances of DT-II and IoDTT as well as future research directions of DM are summarized as a conclusion.}

abstract = {Wind power generation rapidly grows worldwide with declining costs and the pursuit of decarbonised energy systems. However, the utilization of wind energy remains challenging due to its strong stochastic nature. Accurate wind power forecasting is one of the effective ways to address this problem. Meteorological data are generally regarded as critical inputs for wind power forecasting. However, the direct use of numerical weather prediction in forecasting may not provide a high degree of accuracy due to unavoidable uncertainties, particularly for areas with complex topography. This study proposes a hybrid short-term wind power forecasting method, which integrates the corrected numerical weather prediction and spatial correlation into a Gaussian process. First, the Gaussian process model is built using the optimal combination of different kernel functions. Then, a correction model for the wind speed is designed by using an automatic relevance determination algorithm to correct the errors in the primary numerical weather prediction. Moreover, the spatial correlation of wind speed series between neighbouring wind farms is extracted to complement the input data. Finally, the modified numerical weather prediction and spatial correlation are incorporated into the hybrid model to enable reliable forecasting. The actual data in East China are used to demonstrate its performance. In comparison with the basic Gaussian process, in different seasons, the forecasting accuracy is improved by 7.02%–29.7% by using additional corrected numerical weather prediction, by 0.65–10.23% after integrating with the spatial correlation, and by 10.88–37.49% through using the proposed hybrid method.}

Onboard exhaust emissions measurement were made at selected corridors in a populous urban area of India. Exhaust emissions were characterized for different driving modes classified according to vehicle specific power (VSP). Results indicated that emissions at VSP modes under cruising speeds were 10–12 times less than idling (which is the mode used for emission standard certification), braking and accelerating conditions. Also it has been found that more than 20% of time vehicles were in idling conditions at most of the roads. Real-time exhaust emission prediction models for heterogeneous traffic conditions were developed using artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The vehicle characteristics such as revolutions per minute (RPM), speed, acceleration and VSP were used as input to the model. The onboard measurements of CO, HC and NOx concentrations were used to train the ANN based exhaust emission prediction models. Result showed good agreement with onboard measured emissions data (index of agreement = 0.9) of all driving modes. Further, ANN model's emissions were compared with emissions estimated from the COPERT model and emission factors recommended by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI). It was found that the ANN model emissions were edge over the ARAI and COPERT model emissions and useful for urban air quality management and traffic planning.}

In the process of collecting data, there are many factors causing data loss, which needs to be supplemented and repaired to reduce the instability, and improve the precision of system application in the intelligent transportation system. This paper proposes a Spatio-Temporal Learnable Bidirectional Attention Generative Adversarial Networks (ST-LBAGAN) for missing traffic data imputation. First, we take external factors, historical observations, incomplete data, and masked image as the input of generator, and obtain the missing data imputation by using binary classification as the output of the discriminator. Secondly, the encoder and decoder of generator are constructed on the basis of the U-Net. The forward attention map and the reverse attention map of learnable bidirectional attention correspond to the encoder and the decoder respectively to effectively obtain the spatial–temporal random characteristics of traffic flow. Thirdly, high-level and low-level features, in the encoder and decoder, are combined by multiple skip connections. Furthermore, a new objective function is optimized by combining masked reconstruction loss, perceptual loss, discriminative loss and adversarial loss to improve the data imputation ability. Finally, our model is well-adapted on the Beijing taxi GPS dataset. The experimental results show that an improved state-of-the-art performance is achieved on various standard benchmarks.}

As in most engineering fields, dealing with the problem of uncertainty in TF-based feature detection is an issue of fundamental importance. In this study, a new statistical, data-driven damage detection algorithm is proposed by rigorously modelling the variability of TF without postprocessing with circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian ratio distribution. The probabilistic distance of Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (SKL) divergence between TFs under baseline condition and potential damage scenarios which can measure the dissimilarity of probability distributions for the TFs under different states are computed as a damage index (DI) to detect structural anomaly. Compared against Mahalanobis distance which has the implicit assumption that the normal condition set is governed by Gaussian statistics, the probabilistic distance measure proposed in this study can deal with the deviations in TFs not following Gaussian distribution. A statistically rigorous threshold selection scheme integrating Bayesian inference strategy and Monte Carlo discordancy test is proposed to detect the the presence of damage by accommodating the uncertainties of measurements and the probabilistic model of TF. Numerical, experimental, and field test studies are conducted to validate the potential of probabilistic distance measure of TFs in anomaly detection under ambient vibration instead of forced vibration testing. Results demonstrate satisfactory performance of the proposed approach for detecting the existence and quantify the relative damage severity from a global perspective.}

Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is considered a significant threat pertaining to all contemporary and emerging online-based services. Intelligent solutions centered on the utilization of data mining methods are looming on the horizon as possible solutions to counter this kind of attacks. Rule Induction (RI), which is a well-known data mining method is regarded as a possible approach for developing an intelligent DDoS detection system. The current article offers an “Improved RI algorithm” (IRI) which decreases the searching space for generating classification rules by removing all unimportant candidate rule-items along the way of creating the classification model. The main advantage of IRI is producing a group of rules that can be described as concise, easy to understand, and easy-to-implement. In addition, the classifiers generated by IRI are more compact in size which is heavily weighted when producing any classification system. The proposed algorithm is then applied for detecting DDoS attacks (IRIDOS). Empirical evaluations using the UNSW-NB15 dataset that has been obtained from the University of New South Wales confirmed the robustness of IRIDOS.}

In addition, the complexity of Internet services has increased drastically with the introduction of cloud infrastructures, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and mobile Internet usage, and complexity will continue to increase in the future with the rise of Machine-to-Machine communication and ubiquitous wearable devices. Therefore, current and future network monitoring frameworks cannot rely only on information gathered at a single network interconnect, but must consolidate information from various vantage points distributed across the network. In this paper, we present DBStream, a holistic approach to large-scale network monitoring and analysis applications. After a precise system introduction, we show how its Continuous Execution Language (CEL) can be used to automate several data processing and analysis tasks typical for monitoring operational ISP networks. We discuss the performance of DBStream as compared to MapReduce processing engines and show how intelligent job scheduling can increase its performance even further. Furthermore, we show the versatility of DBStream by explaining how it has been integrated to import and process data from two passive network monitoring systems, namely METAWIN and Tstat. Finally, multiple examples of network monitoring applications are given, ranging from simple statistical analysis to more complex traffic classification tasks applying machine learning techniques using the Weka toolkit.}

These intrusive attacks last for a long time in the network due to the existence of compromised nodes this also affects the sensor reading. As the time span of the attack in longer in the network, it affects the system and can cause a system failure. Hence, we propose a technique that uses the combination of multi-varying kernel density estimation with distributed computing. This combination analyzes the individual probability of the existence of data and calculates the global value of the Probability Density Function (PDFs). Pearson’s divergence (PE) is applied for efficient in-network detection and estimation of intrusion at low False Positive Rate (FPRs). The approximation of PE divergence is carried out using different techniques of distributed computing. The value of PDFs is calculated for a successive period of time in order to provide efficient performance. We also propose an entropy-based method that uses a centralized computing approach. Results obtained using PE divergence and entropy-based method are compared in order to judge the robustness. Finally, the proposed algorithms are evaluated using real-world based datasets, and the results are compared using Accuracy and FPRs.}

Since the cooling system is one of the main energy consumers of DCs, optimization of its energy consumption can drastically reduce the operating costs while maintaining stable operation of the IT devices by efficient heat dissipation. Therefore, there is continuing development on improving the performance of cooling systems for DCs using different optimization strategies. In particular, model-based optimization algorithms have had impressive advances, but their deployment in real physical systems often becomes difficult due to limited data, poor optimization efficiency, and potential operation risks. In this paper, we propose a two-layer optimal scheduling framework for room-level cooling of DCs. In the global layer, we use limited data to build a set of novel physically-based empirical models to achieve accurate system energy tracking. Then with defined equipment operating constraints, a genetic algorithm efficiently obtains the optimal plan of all equipment control while ensuring safe system operations. In the local layer, through interactions with the global layer, local precision air conditioners are regulated to stabilize the room temperature within a safe range. To test our solution in a real physical system, we deployed the two-layer optimal scheduling technique in the real DC cooling system of Postal Savings Bank of China in Hefei, China. Our solution achieved an impressive average reduction of 6.1% on cooling load factor.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the person search task, which is a computer vision technology that finds the location of a pedestrian and retrieves it in a video taken by a single camera or multiple cameras. This task is much more challenging than the conventional settings for person re-identification or pedestrian detection since the search is susceptible to factors such as different resolutions, similar pedestrians, lighting, viewing angles and occlusion. Moreover, the person search task is a typical big data-small sample problem because each pedestrian only has a few images. It is difficult for the model to learn the discriminant features of pedestrians with a small quantity of pedestrian data. This paper proposes a framework for person search that uses the original training set without collecting extra data by implementing a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate unlabeled samples. We propose a deep complementary classifier for pedestrian detection to leverage complementary object regions for pedestrian/non-pedestrian classification. In the re-identification section, we propose a center-constrained triplet loss that avoids the complicated triplet selection of the triplet loss and simultaneously pushes away all the distances of rather similar negative centers and the positive center. Experiments show that the GAN-generated data can effectively help to improve the discriminating ability of the CNN model. On the two large-scale datasets, CUHK-SYSU and PRW, we achieve a performance improvement over the baseline CNN. We additionally apply the proposed center-constrained triplet loss and complementary classifiers in the training model, and we achieve mAP improvements over the original method of +1.9% on CUHK-SYSU and +2.5% on PRW.}

The SUDS deploys geospatial technology, synthetic small area urban metrics, and cloud computing to enable urban analytics, and geovisualization with the goal of deriving actionable knowledge for better urban management and data-driven urban decision making. At the core of the system is a programme of urban indicators generated by using novel forms of data and urban modelling and simulation programme. SUDS differs from other similar systems by its emphasis on the generation and use of regularly updated spatially-activated urban area metrics from real or near-real time data sources, to enhance understanding of intra-city interactions and dynamics. By deploying public transport, labour market accessibility and housing advertisement data in the system, we were able to identify spatial variations of key urban services at intra-city levels as well as social and economically-marginalised output areas in major cities across the UK. This paper discusses the design and implementation of SUDS, the challenges and limitations encountered, and considerations made during its development. The innovative approach adopted in the design of SUDS will enable it to support research and analysis of urban areas, policy and city administration, business decision-making, private sector innovation, and public engagement. Having been tested with housing, transport and employment metrics, efforts are ongoing to integrate information from other sources such as IoT, and User Generated Content into the system to enable urban predictive analytics.}

In this paper, we suggest the Pi-Mind technology as a compromise between completely human-expert-driven decision-making and AI-driven decision-making. Pi-Mind enables capturing, cloning and patenting essential parameters of the decision models from a particular human expert making these models transparent, proactive and capable of autonomic and fast decision-making simultaneously in many places. The technology facilitates the human impact (due to ubiquitous presence) in smart manufacturing processes and enables human-AI shared responsibility for the consequences of the decisions made. It also benefits from capturing and utilization of the traditionally human creative cognitive capabilities (sometimes intuitive and emotional), which in many cases outperform the rational decision-making. Pi-Mind technology is a set of models, techniques, and tools built on principles of value-based biased decision-making and creative cognitive computing to augment the axioms of decision rationality in industry.}

abstract = {Vehicle motion segmentation is an important task in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) for the sustainable development of smart city. In this paper, a novel trajectory clustering method is proposed using the rigid motion constraints (RMC) for the vehicle motion segmentation. Firstly, camera calibration is done for converting the 2D images to a copy one in 3D world. Then, the inverse projection image (IPI) can be obtained with a known 3D height information and the 2D image. Secondly, we present and verify the RMC of the feature point trajectories in the same rigid object and different rigid objects. By analyzing simulation results, we use the RMC as a measure to define the similarity function. Finally, spectral clustering is adopted to achieve the trajectory clustering, which contains two stages: initial clustering and inter-class merging. By applying this clustering method in actual traffic scene, much more stable clustering results can be obtained. Experimental results on traffic video demonstrate that the proposed method has a good performance in different traffic scenes. Moreover, its accuracy can reach 96% compared with other methods.}

The adaptive reuse of existing space reflects the underlying socioeconomic dynamics of the city and can be a leading indicator of economic growth and diversification. However, the collective understanding of building alteration patterns is constrained by significant barriers to data accessibility and analysis. We present a data mining and knowledge discovery process for extracting, analyzing, and integrating building permit data for more than 2,500,000 alteration projects from seven major U.S. cities. We utilize natural language processing and topic modeling to discover the thematic structure of construction activities from permit descriptions and merge with other urban data to explore the dynamics of urban change. The knowledge discovery process proceeds in three steps: (1) text mining to identify popular words, popularity change, and their co-appearance likelihood; (2) topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); and (3) integrating the topic modeling output with building information and ancillary data to discover the spatial, temporal, and thematic patterns of urban redevelopment and regeneration. The results demonstrate a generalizable approach that can be used to analyze unstructured text data extracted from permit records across varying database structures, permit typologies, and local contexts. Our machine learning methodology can assist cities to better monitor building alteration activity, analyze spatiotemporal patterns of redevelopment, and more fully understand the economic, social, and environmental implications of changes to the urban built environment.}

Due to the interaction between different disciplines and parties, Energy and Petroleum Projects (EPP) are considered among the most complex. This complexity produces a dense network of interrelated documents which are produced to cover the various aspects and details of the project. Analyzing this network which is composed of unstructured data is required to gain insights from old data, this task traditionally requires experience, knowledge, and awareness about the existence of the required data. Accordingly, a key asset of any company is the knowledge accumulated over the time from various projects. This research proposes a framework that enables salvaging traditional archives and include its data in searchable databases to increase the efficiency of archiving such accumulated data without affecting the normal workflow of companies, and hence decrease the manhours expenditure and reduce the time of archiving while not affecting the accuracy of the outcome. Due to the large diversity of the EPP projects, the research focuses on five main commodities which are selected based on the frequency of their existence in projects in addition to their monetary value as the main data to be stored which are Tanks, Air Coolers, Pumps, Generators and Distributed Control Systems (DCS). The key attributes of each commodity are identified based on technical questionnaires with technical specialists to act as the basis for building the proposed framework. The proposed framework integrates four modules to provide a complete solution to the problem, by implementing data mining techniques while harnessing the power of big data analytics tools to transform the existent unstructured data into structured data in the form of smart archives which can then be used to support ongoing business processes.}

This extensive range of functionality raises various security concerns related to data, virtualization, segregation, network communication and monitoring.

Recently, focus has only been on the latency and criticality based priority-aware policies for same channel bandwidth. Traffic scheduling and subsequent channel allocation are required to support both the differential throughput and latency requirements simultaneously for channels having different bandwidths and SNRs. In this paper, a QoS-aware framework for data traffic scheduling in cognitive radio based SG communication network is proposed. The channels available to smart grid Communication Nodes (SCNs) are categorized as low and high bandwidths. For each bandwidth, all SG applications are categorized into several priority-classes comprised of latency and throughput sub-classes. For both channel bandwidths, the scheduler maintains and updates two sets of priority queues based on weights associated with each class and its data type. The complete scheduling framework is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The overall objective function is the weighted sum of individual utility functions of latency and throughput. A novel usage of Adam optimizer is proposed to minimize the latency and maximize the throughput by obtaining optimal system cost, resulting in optimal decision policy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves desired QoS requirements in the presence of heavy PU traffic, whereas in case of no priority assignment, QoS requirements of lower priority applications are met by compromising the QoS of higher priority data.}

This paper presents a novel sequential slice representation with an attention-embedding network, named RSSNet, for 3D point cloud recognition and retrieval in road environments. RSSNet has two main branches. Firstly, a sequential slice module is designed to map disordered 3D point clouds to ordered sequence of shallow feature vectors. A gated recurrent unit (GRU) module is applied to encode the spatial and content information of these sequential vectors. The second branch consists of a key-point based graph convolution network (GCN) with an embedding attention strategy to fuse the sequential and global features to refine the structure discriminability. Three datasets were used to evaluate the proposed method, one acquired by our mobile laser scanning (MLS) system and two public datasets (KITTI and Sydney Urban Objects). Experimental results indicated that the proposed method achieved better performance than recognition and retrieval state-of-the-art methods. RSSNet provided recognition rates of 98.08%, 95.77% and 70.83% for the above three datasets, respectively.

However, the accompanying cybersecurity risks, such as environmental attacks and software attacks, must not be ignored. Thus, the security problem in recommender systems becomes a serious challenge for cloud-based IoT services. Moreover, most of existing collaborative recommendation algorithms mainly focus on user-item interaction relationships but seldom consider user-user or item-item co-occurrence relationships, which may affect prediction accuracy. To overcome the above shortcomings, this paper proposes a security-driven hybrid collaborative recommendation method to deal with the large-scale IoT services accessible by clouds in a more scalable and secure manner. Our proposal integrates the factorization-based latent factor model with the neighbor-based collaborative model to mine not only user-service interaction relationships but also user-user and service-service co-occurrence relationships. Moreover, the local sensitive hash (LSH) technique is adopted to speed up the neighbor searching and preserve users’ sensitive information for security concerns based on hash mapping. Finally, experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve prediction accuracy while guaranteeing information security.}

abstract = {Multi-robotic services are widely used to enhance the efficiency of Industry 4.0 applications including emergency management in smart factory. The workflow of these robotic services consists of data hungry, delay sensitive and compute intensive tasks. Generally, robots are not enriched in computational power and storage capabilities. It is thus beneficial to leverage the available Cloud resources to complement robots for executing robotic workflows. When multiple robots and Cloud instances work in a collaborative manner, optimal resource allocation for the tasks of a robotic workflow becomes a challenging problem. The diverse energy consumption rate of both robot and Cloud instances, and the cost of executing robotic workflow in such a distributed manner further intensify the resource allocation problem. Since the tasks are inter-dependent, inconvenience in data exchange between local robots and remote Cloud also degrade the service quality. Therefore, in this paper, we address simultaneous optimization of makespan, energy consumption and cost while allocating resources for the tasks of a robotic workflow. As a use case, we consider resource allocation for the robotic workflow of emergency management service in smart factory. We design an Edge Cloud based multi-robot system to overcome the limitations of remote Cloud based system in exchanging delay sensitive data. The resource allocation for robotic workflow is modelled as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem and it is solved through a multi-objective evolutionary approach, namely, NSGA-II algorithm. We have redesigned the NSGA-II algorithm by defining a new chromosome structure, pre-sorted initial population and mutation operator. It is further augmented by selecting the minimum distant solution from the non-dominated front to the origin while crossing over the chromosomes.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a leading field of computer science, which simplifies the life of human beings. The IoT, devices can interconnect and communicate with each other, in a fully autonomous mode. This autonomy has made the IoT network vulnerable to various security threats. However, due to this autonomy, there is a strong need for reliable security and storage mechanism for authentication to exchange data between IoT devices. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient method known as SCAB-IoTA, which ensures identification and authentication of IoT devices and also provides secure communication in the open environment. Along with authentication and secure communication, the scheme also ensures data integrity. SCAB-IoTA used the blockchain and hybrid cryptosystem (the combination of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) cryptographic techniques) to enhance the security of IoT applications to prevent various attacks along with less computational, and storage overhead. Furthermore, we have a secure cluster of IoT devices based on angular distance (AD), so that devices can securely communicate without any interruption. A secure and robust trust mechanism has employed to build these clusters, where each IoT device has to authenticate itself before joining the cluster. The obtained results satisfy the IoT security requirements with 60% reduced computation, storage and communication cost compared with state-of-the-art methods. The security analysis illustrates that SCAB-IoTA withstands against various cyberattacks such as impersonation, message replay, man-in-the-middle, and botnet attacks.}

Our work addresses the challenge of understanding DT trends by presenting a machine learning (ML) approach for topic modeling to review and analyze advanced DT technology research and development. A systematic review process is developed based on the comprehensive DT in manufacturing systems and engineering literature (i.e., 99 articles). Six dominant topics are identified, namely smart factory, sustainability and product-service systems, construction digital transformation, public infrastructure-centric digital transformation, techno-centric digital transformation, and business model-centric digital transformation.

Not only these emerging paradigms demand reevaluating cloud-native optimizations and exploring Fog and Edge-based solutions, but also the objectives require significant shift from considering only latency to energy, security, reliability and cost. Hence, it is apparent that optimization objectives have become diverse and lately Internet of Things (IoT)-specific born objectives must come into play. This is critical as incorrect selection of metrics can mislead the developer about the real performance. For instance, a latency-aware auto-scaler must be evaluated through latency-related metrics as response time or tail latency; otherwise the resource manager is not carefully evaluated even if it can reduce the cost. Given such challenges, researchers and developers are struggling to explore and utilize the right metrics to evaluate the performance of optimization techniques such as task scheduling, resource provisioning, resource allocation, resource scheduling and resource execution. This is challenging due to (1) novel and multi-layered computing paradigm, e.g., Cloud, Fog and Edge, (2) IoT applications with different requirements, e.g., latency or privacy, and (3) not having a benchmark and standard for the evaluation metrics. In this paper, by exploring the literature, (1) we present a taxonomy of the various real-world metrics to evaluate the performance of cloud, fog, and edge computing; (2) we survey the literature to recognize common metrics and their applications; and (3) outline open issues for future research. This comprehensive benchmark study can significantly assist developers and researchers to evaluate performance under realistic metrics and standards to ensure their objectives will be achieved in the production environments.}

abstract = {In the field of complex problem optimization with metaheuristics, semantics has been used for modeling different aspects, such as: problem characterization, parameters, decision-maker’s preferences, or algorithms. However, there is a lack of approaches where ontologies are applied in a direct way into the optimization process, with the aim of enhancing it by allowing the systematic incorporation of additional domain knowledge. This is due to the high level of abstraction of ontologies, which makes them difficult to be mapped into the code implementing the problems and/or the specific operators of metaheuristics. In this paper, we present a strategy to inject domain knowledge (by reusing existing ontologies or creating a new one) into a problem implementation that will be optimized using a metaheuristic. Thus, this approach based on accepted ontologies enables building and exploiting complex computing systems in optimization problems. We describe a methodology to automatically induce user choices (taken from the ontology) into the problem implementations provided by the jMetal optimization framework. With the aim of illustrating our proposal, we focus on the urban domain. Concretely, we start from defining an ontology representing the domain semantics for a city (e.g., building, bridges, point of interest, routes, etc.) that allows defining a-priori preferences by a decision maker in a standard, reusable, and formal (logic-based) way. We validate our proposal with several instances of two use cases, consisting in bi-objective formulations of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Radio Network Design problem (RND), both in the context of an urban scenario. The results of the experiments conducted show how the semantic specification of domain constraints are effectively mapped into feasible solutions of the tackled TSP and RND scenarios. This proposal aims at representing a step forward towards the automatic modeling and adaptation of optimization problems guided by semantics, where the annotation of a human expert can be now considered during the optimization process.}

These sensors, however, most often produce data of lower accuracy than higher-end instruments. In this study, we investigated linear and random forest models to correct PM2.5 measurements from the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment (DDPHE)’s network of low-cost sensors against measurements from co-located U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Federal Equivalence Method (FEM) monitors. Our training set included data from five DDPHE sensors from August 2018 through May 2019. Our testing set included data from two newly deployed DDPHE sensors from September 2019 through mid-December 2019. In addition to PM2.5, temperature, and relative humidity from the low-cost sensors, we explored using additional temporal and spatial variables to capture unexplained variability in sensor measurements. We evaluated results using spatial and temporal cross-validation techniques. For the long-term dataset, a random forest model with all time-varying covariates and length of arterial roads within 500 m was the most accurate (testing RMSE = 2.9 μg/m3 and R2 = 0.75; leave-one-location-out (LOLO)-validation metrics on the training set: RMSE = 2.2 μg/m3 and R2 = 0.93). For on-the-fly correction, we found that a multiple linear regression model using the past eight weeks of low-cost sensor PM2.5, temperature, and humidity data plus a near-highway indicator predicted each new week of data best (testing RMSE = 3.1 μg/m3 and R2 = 0.78; LOLO-validation metrics on the training set: RMSE = 2.3 μg/m3 and R2 = 0.90). The statistical methods detailed here will be used to correct low-cost sensor measurements to better understand PM2.5 pollution within the city of Denver. This work can also guide similar implementations in other municipalities by highlighting the improved accuracy from inclusion of variables other than temperature and relative humidity to improve accuracy of low-cost sensor PM2.5 data.}

The existing multi-oriented text detection methods fall short when facing two issues: 1) text scales change in a wide range, and 2) there exists the foreground-background class imbalance. In this paper, we propose a scale-robust deep multi-oriented text-detection model, which not only has the efficiency of the one-stage deep detection model, but also has the comparable accuracy of the two-stage deep text-detection model. We design the feature refining block to fuse multi-scale context features for the purpose of keeping text detection in a higher-resolution feature map. Moreover, in order to mitigate the foreground-background class imbalance, Focal Loss is adopted to up weight the hard-classified samples. Our method is implemented on four benchmark text datasets: ICDAR2013, ICDAR2015, COCO-Text and MSRA-TD500. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to the existing one-stage deep text-detection models and comparable to the state-of-the-art text detection methods.}

IoT platform has facilitated modern industries an efficient monitoring and controlling of physical systems (various hardware and machineries) resulting in an intelligent data acquisition, processing and highly productive and profitable management of business. Initially, these devices have been deployed without any security concern considering these will run in isolated networks. With the new IoT platform scenario, SCADA based ICS networks are integrated with the corporate networks over the internet. Therefore, the devices of a SCADA network are facing significant threat of malicious attacks either through the vulnerabilities of the corporate network or the devices used in the SCADA. Traditional IT security software products are not enough for ICS as these software products consider only operating system related calls and application program interface (API) behaviour of applications, which are only focused on corporate business solutions and related technologies. In this paper, we propose a secure architecture for ICS network that proposes a detection model based on SCADA network traffic. The proposed architecture develops two ensembles based detection algorithms using deep belief network (DBN) and standard classifier, including support vector machines (SVM). The novelty of the proposed architecture is that it uses network traffic feature and payload feature for detection model instead of conventional signature based or API based malware detection technique. In addition, ensemble-DBN of the proposed architecture can overcome many limitations of standard techniques, including the complexity and big size of the training data. The proposed architecture for ICS has been verified using a real SCADA network data. Experimental results show that our ensemble based detection system outperforms over existing attack detection engines.}

abstract = {In this paper, a blockchained Beyond Fifth Generation (B5G) enabled malicious node detection model is proposed for the Internet of Sensor Things (IoSTs). Moreover, a secure service provisioning scheme using cascading encryption and feature evaluation process is also proposed for the IoSTs. The presence of malicious nodes causes severe issues in the localization and service provisioning, which discourages new entities to join the network. Therefore, it is very important to establish trust between all entities by detecting and removing such nodes. The proposed B5G enabled malicious node detection model uses federated learning for the detection of malicious nodes. The federated learning uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to detect the malicious nodes. The malicious nodes are classified on the bases of their honesty and end-to-end delay. Moreover, the service provider nodes provide services to each other and get the reward. However, the service provisioning in the IoSTs has many issues like a repudiation of service providers as well as the clients. The feature evaluation and cascading encryption mechanisms are used to solve these issues. The digital signature in cascading encryption ensures the non-repudiation of the service provider. On the other hand, feature evaluation of service ensures that the client cannot repudiate about actually demanded services. Moreover, the conformance of services is also ensured by the feature evaluation process. The simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed non-repudiation model. The SVM and RF classifiers are compared in terms of accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall. The accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall of SVM are 79%, 1, 0.8795 and 0.78, respectively. On the other hand, the accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall of RF classifier are 95%, 0.92, 0.96 and 1, respectively. The results show that RF has better accuracy than RF in malicious nodes detection.}

The management of panic health and on-time evacuation prevents COVID-19 infection incidences in educational institutions and public places. Therefore, a system is required to predict the infection and suggests a safe evacuation path to people that control panic scenarios with mortality. In this paper, a fog-assisted cyber physical system is introduced to control panic attacks and COVID-19 infection risk in public places. The proposed model uses the concept of physical and cyber space. The physical space helps in real time data collection and transmission of the alert generation to the stakeholders. Cyberspace consists of two spaces, fog space, and cloud-space. The fog-space facilitates panic health and COVID-19 symptoms determination with alert generation for risk-affected areas. Cloud space monitors and predicts the person’s panic health and symptoms using the SARIMA model. Furthermore, it also identifies risk-prone regions in the affected place using Geographical Population Analysis. The performance evaluation acknowledges the efficiency related to panic health determination and prediction based on the SARIMA with risks mapping accuracy. The proposed system provides an efficient on time evacuation with priority from risk-affected places that protect people from attacks due to panic and infection caused by COVID-19.}

Meanwhile, the concept of internet of everything (IoE) is presented as such an omnipotent extension of IoT. However, the IoE realization meets critical challenges including the restricted network coverage and the limited resource of existing network technologies. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have attracted significant attentions attributed to their high mobility, low cost, and flexible deployment. Thus, UAVs may potentially overcome the challenges of IoE. This article presents a comprehensive survey on opportunities and challenges of UAV-enabled IoE. We first present three critical expectations of IoE: (1) scalability requiring a scalable network architecture with ubiquitous coverage, (2) intelligence requiring a global computing plane enabling intelligent things, (3) diversity requiring provisions of diverse applications. Thereafter, we review the enabling technologies to achieve these expectations and discuss four intrinsic constraints of IoE (i.e., coverage constraint, battery constraint, computing constraint, and security issues). We then present an overview of UAVs. We next discuss the opportunities brought by UAV to IoE. Additionally, we introduce a UAV-enabled IoE (Ue-IoE) solution by exploiting UAVs’s mobility, in which we show that Ue-IoE can greatly enhance the scalability, intelligence and diversity of IoE. Finally, we outline the future directions in Ue-IoE.}

Many documents do not come with descriptive terms, thus requiring humans to generate keywords on-the-fly. The need to automate this kind of task demands the development of keyword extraction systems with the ability to automatically identify keywords within the text. One approach is to resort to machine-learning algorithms. These, however, depend on large annotated text corpora, which are not always available. An alternative solution is to consider an unsupervised approach. In this article, we describe YAKE!, a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on statistical text features extracted from single documents to select the most relevant keywords of a text. Our system does not need to be trained on a particular set of documents, nor does it depend on dictionaries, external corpora, text size, language, or domain. To demonstrate the merits and significance of YAKE!, we compare it against ten state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and one supervised method.

abstract = {In the recent decade, there has been an exponential rise in the development and study of Blockchain Technology space. The driving force behind the interest in Blockchain research has been its key characteristics that provide security, anonymity, and integrity without relying on trusted third party organizations. Initially, Blockchain usage was restricted to cryptocurrencies only, however, with the advent of Ethereum that supports creation and execution of smart contracts (small computer programs that run on Blockchain), applications beyond cryptocurrencies are being developed and explored. Although there has been substantial progress towards improving Blockchain technology with a focus on the smart contracts, however, it was identified that there is a lack of descriptive review on the applicability of smart contracts in securing the Internet and IoT. This paper aims to identify and analyse peer reviewed literature that seeks to use Blockchain smart contracts for securing Internet in general and Internet of Things in particular and presents the systematic analysis of the identified literature. Finally, the paper highlights some challenges and future research directions in the field of Blockchain smart contracts application in securing Internet and IoT.}

This paradigm has given rise to users' concerns about their privacy, particularly with regard to whether users have to use a smart handling (self-establishment and self-management) in order to correctly install the SIoT, ensuring the privacy of the SIot-generated content and data. In this context, the present study aims to identify and explore the main perspectives that define user privacy in the SIoT; our ultimate goal is to accumulate new knowledge on the adoption and use of the concept of privacy “by default” in the scientific literature. To this end, we undertake a literature review of the main contributions on the topic of privacy in SIoT and Big Data processing. Based on the results, we formulate the following five areas of application of SIoT, including 29 key points relative to the concept of privacy “by default”: (i) SIoT data collection and privacy; (ii) SIoT security; (iii) threats for SIoT devices; (iv) SIoT devices mandatory functions; and (v) SIoT and Big Data processing and analytics. In addition, we outline six research propositions and discuss six challenges for the SIoT industry. The results are theorized for the future development of research on SIoT privacy by “default” and Big Data processing.}

abstract = {Stochastic weather generators (SWGs) are digital twins of complex weather processes and widely used in agriculture and urban design. Due to improved measuring instruments, an accurate SWG for high-frequency precipitation is now possible. However, high-frequency precipitation data are more zero-inflated, skewed, and heavy-tailed than common (hourly or daily) precipitation data. Therefore, classical methods that either model precipitation occurrence independently of their intensity or assume that the precipitation follows a censored meta-Gaussian process may not be appropriate. In this work, we propose a novel multi-site precipitation generator that drives both occurrence and intensity by a censored non-Gaussian vector autoregression model with skew-symmetric dynamics. The proposed SWG is advantageous in modeling skewed and heavy-tailed data with direct physical and statistical interpretations. We apply the proposed model to 30-second precipitation based on the data obtained from a dense gauge network in Lausanne, Switzerland. In addition to reproducing the high-frequency precipitation, the model can provide accurate predictions as the long short-term memory (LSTM) network but with uncertainties and more interpretable results.}

Such technologies not only spark the growth in business, but also add values to our daily lives in many aspects such as livelihood, health, work, and entertainment. Nowadays, with the emergence of wireless infrastructure and the advancements in cellular technologies, Mobile IoT (MIoT) has gained considerable amount of attention. Intelligent decisions are made based on the information retrieved from raw data through sensors, machines, and other devices. These decisions are widely utilized in many fields of life such as smart health-care, smart transportation, and smart energy etc. Usually such smart systems are realized through MIoT infrastructure. The devices participating in MIoT are heterogeneous and produce huge amount of data, and contribute to cross-platform solutions covering plethora of applications. In the wake of such volume and variety, the data produced because of spectrum analysis for the entire IoT network is also huge and thus referred to as Big Spectrum Data (BSD). To this end, BSD is a way forward to get deep insights to the big data generated by MIoT. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of the MIoT network focusing on the characteristics of mobility in MIoT from BSD perspective. More precisely, we focus on the relationship between MIoT and BSD, and discuss in detail, the BSD analytics to harness its benefits in MIoT. Furthermore, we investigate and outline the current solutions of BSD in MIoT. Additionally, through this work, we identify the existing challenges faced in dealing with BSD in MIoT and future research directions.}

The proposed technique extends the Markovian model to adopt the spatiotemporal aspects of this problem, allowing modern 5G vertical applications to communicate seamlessly in highly connected IoT networks.

This interest is further fueled by the emergence of e-commerce, where many applications can benefit from autonomous package delivery solutions. However, the environment stochasticity, variability and task complexity for autonomous operation make it difficult to deploy such systems in real-world applications without the incorporation of advanced machine learning and optimization algorithms. Moving away from designing a “one size fits all” agent to solve the outdoor package delivery problem and considering ad-hoc teams of agents trained within a data-driven framework could provide the answer. In this work, we propose a delivery scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using the pickup and delivery problem (PDP) formulation. Specifically, a 3-index mixed integer program-based PDP that allows coalition formation (PDP-CF) among agents is derived to allow multi-agent PDP schedules. We propose a quantum genetic algorithm to solve for the schedule since it is can better handle the large computational complexity of PDP-CF. Multiple PDP scenario simulations show the merits of the proposed approach.}

Hence, extensive studies have been conducted to establish the physiological data-based vigilance model for objectively monitoring or detecting vigilance decrement. Nevertheless, most of them using intrusive devices to collect physiological data and failed to consider context information. Consequently, these models can be used in a laboratory environment while cannot adapt to dynamic working conditions of traffic controllers. The goal of this research is to develop an adaptive vigilance model for monitoring vigilance objectively and non-intrusively. In recent years, with advanced information and communication technology, a massive amount of data can be collected from connected daily use items. Hence, we proposed a hybrid data-driven approach based on connected objects for establishing vigilance model in the traffic control center and provide an elaborated case study to illustrate the method. Specifically, eye movements are selected as the primary inputs of the proposed vigilance model; Bagged trees technique is adapted to generate the vigilance model. The results of case study indicated that (1) eye metrics would be correlated with the vigilance performance subjected to the mental fatigue levels, (2) the bagged trees with the fusion features as inputs achieved a relatively stable performance under the condition of data loss, (3) the proposed method could achieve better performance than the other classic machine learning methods.}

Compared with GBDT2NN, the new method is also applicable to the multi-classification problems, besides binary classification, regression. In the new framework, it takes the iteration of GBDT as the smallest unit to ensure the additive relation among the distilled models, and it predicts a probability vector rather than a numerical value.

In this paper, we propose to enrich feature aggregation via holistic aggregation paths and an extra bottom-up decoder network. The former aggregates multi-level features holistically to learn abundant feature interactions while the latter aggregates improved low-level features with high-level features, thus promoting their representation ability. Aiming at the two-stream architecture, we propose another early aggregation scheme to aggregate and propagate multi-modal encoder features at each level, thereby improving the encoder capability. We also propose a factorized attention module to efficiently modulate the feature aggregation action for each feature node with multiple learned attention factors. Experimental results demonstrate that all of the proposed components can gradually improve RGB-D SOD results. Consequently, our final SOD model performs favorably against other state-of-the-art methods.}

However, as a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolution, the classic GCN can not take full advantage of unlabeled data, especially when the unlabeled node is far from labeled ones. To capitalize on the information from unlabeled nodes to boost the training for GCN, we propose a novel framework named Self-Ensembling GCN (SEGCN), which marries GCN with Mean Teacher – a powerful self-ensemble learning mechanism for semi-supervised task. SEGCN contains a student model and a teacher model. As a student, it not only learns to correctly classify the labeled nodes, but also tries to be consistent with the teacher on unlabeled nodes in more challenging situations, such as a high dropout rate and graph corrosion. As a teacher, it averages the student model weights and generates more accurate predictions to lead the student. In such a mutual-promoting process, both labeled and unlabeled samples can be fully utilized for backpropagating effective gradients to train GCN. In a variety of semi-supervised classification benchmarks, i.e. Citeseer, Cora, Pubmed and NELL, we validate that the proposed method matches the state of the arts in the classification accuracy. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/RoyalVane/SEGCN.}

abstract = {Soil salinization is one of the most predominant processes responsible for land degradation globally. However, monitoring large areas presents significant challenges due to strong spatial and temporal variability. Environmental covariates show promise in predicting salinity over large areas provided a reasonable relationship is developed with field measured salinity at few points. While simple regression-based approaches to complex data mining methods have been used in the prediction, a comprehensive comparison of their performances has not been explored, leading to uncertainty in which algorithms to select. This study compares thirteen popularly and non-popularly used algorithms and their performances following four criteria in predicting soil salinity from environmental covariates from Kuqa Oasis from Xinjiang, China. The environmental covariates used for the prediction include principal components of Landsat satellite images at multiple spectral bands, climate factors (referring to land surface temperature), vegetation indices, salinity and soil-related indices, soil moisture indices, DEM derived indices, land use, landform and soil type and categorized them under parameter categories of the SCORPAN (S, soils; C, climate; O, organisms, biotic factor; R, relief; P, parent material; A, age; and N, space) model. The predictive relationships were developed using the algorithms including some previously used ones such as Multiple Linear regression (MLR), Multi-Layer Perceptron-Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), M5 Model Tree (M5), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) and some that have not previously been used in predicting salinity such as Alternating Model Tree (ATM), Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR), Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), Least Median Squared Linear Regression (LMSLR), and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree). Here, 5-fold cross-validation and an independent dataset (30% overall samples) at three depths, 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm, were used for parameter optimization and evaluating the performance of algorithms. The performances of these algorithms were compared against multiple criteria, including the parameterization, error level/fitting accuracy (determination coefficient, R2; root mean squared error, RMSE), stability (based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, R; mean absolute percent error, MAPE; root mean squared error, RMSE; Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, LCCC) and computational efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the result showed that CSRI is most important parameter for the prediction of soil salinity at the 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm depths, whereas for the 30–50 cm depth interval, VD was the most important predictor. For depths of 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm and 30–50 cm across all models, the model R2 values ranged from 0.60 to 0.74, 0.15 to 0.31, and 0.30 to 0.47, and the RMSE values ranged from 18.87 to 23.49 dS m−1, 9.94 to 13.48 dS m−1 and 3.79 to 7.11 dS m−1. The optimal algorithms at three depths of 0–10 cm, 10–30 cm and 30–50 cm are RF, M5 and GRBF with considering accuracy and stability. After a comprehensive assessment of algorithm performance, we recommend RF for mapping salinity in an arid environment such as that of Xinjiang and elsewhere globally. However, there is no algorithm that can perform ideally for all datasets. Therefore, we suggest that the algorithm should be carefully chosen according to the purposes of the study.}

We propose a non-intrusive and scalable robot signal extraction architecture, easily applicable in real manufacturing assembly lines. The novelty of the paper lies in the fact that it is the first proposal of a network architecture which is specially designed to address the predictive maintenance of industrial robots in real production environments. All the infrastructure needed for the implementation of the architecture is comprised of traditional well-known industrial assets. We synchronize the data acquisition with the execution of robot routines using common Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) to obtain comparable data batches. A network architecture that acquires comparable and structured data over time, is a crucial step to advance towards an effective predictive maintenance of these complex systems, in terms of effectively detecting time dependent degradation. We implement the architecture in a real automotive manufacturing assembly line and show the potential of the solution to detect robot joint failures in real world scenarios. The architecture is therefore specially interesting for industrial practitioners and maintenance personnel. Finally, we test the feasibility of using one-class novelty detection models for robot health status degradation assessment using data of a real robot failure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first contribution that uses robot torque signals of a real production line failure to train one-class models.}

It leverages sensor technology, cutting edge communication and data analytics technologies and the open Internet to consolidate IT and operational technology (OT) aiming to achieve cost and performance benefits. However, the underlying resource constraints and ad hoc nature of such systems have significant implications especially in achieving effective intrusion detection. Consequently, contemporary solutions requiring a stable infrastructure and extensive computational resources are inadequate to fulfill these characteristics of an IIoT system. In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection framework for the energy-constrained IoT devices which form the foundation of an IIoT ecosystem. In view of the ad hoc nature of such systems as well as emerging complex threats such as botnets, we assess the feasibility of collaboration between the host (IoT devices) and the edge devices for effective intrusion detection whilst minimizing energy consumption and communication overhead. We implemented the proposed framework with Contiki operating system and conducted rigorous evaluation to identify potential performance trade-offs. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can minimize energy and communication overheads whilst achieving an effective collaborative intrusion detection for IIoT systems.}

abstract = {Systematic interactions between buildings, vehicles, and renewables can increase eco-economic viability on a neighbourhood scale. In this study, an interactive buildings-vehicles energy sharing network with multidirectional energy interactions was formulated for energy interactions and integrations together with a grid-responsive strategy for the management of off-peak renewable energy and grid electricity. Energy flexibility indicators (e.g., off-peak surplus renewable shifted ratio and off-peak grid shifted ratio) were introduced, developed, and implemented in an interactive buildings-vehicles energy sharing network for the energy flexibility assessment. Several energy-related conflicts, such as energy congestion contradiction and energy-related economic and environmental conflicts, were presented and discussed together with effective solutions provided to decision-makers for optimal design and robust operation. To reach a trade-off between energy-related conflicts, multi-objective optimisation was conducted, and implemented with an advanced multi-objective optimisation algorithm (called Pareto archive NSGA-II). The research results show that the formulated interactive buildings-vehicles energy sharing network demonstrates greater robustness and competitiveness than the conventional isolated system in terms of cost, emissions, and energy flexibility. Regarding multiple energy-related conflicts in the formulated interactive energy sharing network, the results show that multi-objective optimisation is able to decrease the equivalent CO2 emissions of the buildings-vehicles energy system by 7.5%, from 147.4 to 136.4 kg/m2.a, and reduce the import cost from the electric grid by 8.5%, from 212.7 to 194.6 HK$/m2.a, together with a high energy flexibility: a maximum of 11.03% (1.5% in a conventional isolated system) of the off-peak grid electricity can be stored by the electrical storages and a maximum of 52.48% (33.6% in the conventional isolated system) of the off-peak surplus renewable electricity can be shifted to peak period. This study formulates an interactive energy sharing network between buildings and vehicles, together with quantifiable energy flexibility assessment criteria and effective solutions for dealing with multiple energy-related conflicts, which are critical for interactive buildings-vehicles energy sharing networks with high energy flexibilities in smart cities.}

The energy and exergy efficiencies of the geothermal system are found to be 27.6% and 35.7% respectively. Within the organic Rankine cycle, the exergy destruction at the boiler and the condenser add up to 15.8 MW, which makes up 94% of the total exergy destruction of this cycle.

abstract = {The information fusion field has recently been attracting a lot of interest within the scientific community, as it provides, through the combination of different sources of heterogeneous information, a fuller and/or more precise understanding of the real world than can be gained considering the above sources separately. One of the fundamental aims of computer systems, and especially decision support systems, is to assure that the quality of the information they process is high. There are many different approaches for this purpose, including information fusion. Information fusion is currently one of the most promising methods. It is particularly useful under circumstances where quality might be compromised, for example, either intrinsically due to imperfect information (vagueness, uncertainty, …) or because of limited resources (energy, time, …). In response to this goal, a wide range of research has been undertaken over recent years. To date, the literature reviews in this field have focused on problem-specific issues and have been circumscribed to certain system types. Therefore, there is no holistic and systematic knowledge of the state of the art to help establish the steps to be taken in the future. In particular, aspects like what impact different information fusion methods have on information quality, how information quality is characterised, measured and evaluated in different application domains depending on the problem data type or whether fusion is designed as a flexible process capable of adapting to changing system circumstances and their intrinsically limited resources have not been addressed. This paper aims precisely to review the literature on research into the use of information fusion techniques specifically to improve information quality, analysing the above issues in order to identify a series of challenges and research directions, which are presented in this paper.}

We refer them as non-deterministic multiple output classification (nDMOC) problems, which are particularly difficult for machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict outcomes accurately. Evaluating ML algorithms based on commonly used metrics such as Classification Accuracy (CA) is not appropriate. In a batch setting, Relevance Score (RS) was proposed as a better alternative, which determines how relevant a predicted output is to a given context. We introduce two variants of RS to evaluate ML algorithms in an online setting. Furthermore, we evaluate the algorithms using different metrics for two datasets that have non-deterministic input–output relationships. We show that instance-based learning provides superior RS performance and the RS performance keeps improving with an increase in the number of observed samples, even after the CA performance has converged to its maximum. This is a crucial result as it illustrates that RS is able to capture the performance of ML algorithms in the context of nDMOC problems while CA cannot.}

The qualitative data collected was analysed by using a thematic analysis approach. The results showed a set of 16 crucial barriers related to diverse technological, managerial, clinical, financial, legal and personal aspects. amongst these, lack of collaboration between WMD providers and public health organizations was identified to be the most critical barrier.

abstract = {Malware targeting interconnected infrastructures has surged in recent years. A major factor driving this phenomenon is the proliferation of large networks of poorly secured IoT devices. This is exacerbated by the commoditization of the malware development industry, in which tools can be readily obtained in specialized hacking forums or underground markets. However, despite the great interest in targeting this infrastructure, there is little understanding of what the main features of this type of malware are, or the motives of the criminals behind it, apart from the classic denial of service attacks. This is vital to modern malware forensics, where analyses are required to measure the trustworthiness of files collected at large during an investigation, but also to confront challenges posed by tech-savvy criminals (e.g., Trojan Horse Defense). In this paper, we present a comprehensive characterization of Linux-based malware. Our study is tailored to IoT malware and it leverages automated techniques using both static and dynamic analysis to classify malware into related threats. By looking at the most representative dataset of Linux-based malware collected by the community to date, we are able to show that our system can accurately characterize known threats. As a key novelty, we use our system to investigate a number of threats unknown to the community. We do this in two steps. First, we identify known patterns within an unlabeled dataset using a classifier trained with the labeled dataset. Second, we combine our features with a custom distance function to discover new threats by clustering together similar samples. We further study each of the unknown clusters by using state-of-the-art reverse engineering and forensic techniques and our expertise as malware analysts. We provide an in-depth analysis of what the most recent unknown trends are through a number of case studies. Among other findings, we observe that: i) crypto-mining malware is permeating the IoT infrastructure, ii) the level of sophistication is increasing, and iii) there is a rapid proliferation of new variants with minimal investment in infrastructure.}

It is designed to help grant access for unlicensed users and utilize the maximum available licensed bandwidth. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought a significant promise to a multitude of applications and services allowing for anytime and anywhere connectivity. The coexistence of IoT and CRN has enabled a broad range of solutions to be available for users in an efficient and somewhat secure manner. But, with today’s resource consuming and time-sensitive IoT applications, the lack of communication security proves to be a challenge. CRNs are prone to more attacks and have much more risks than traditional wireless networks. This paper introduces a security-aware routing protocol that considers jamming attacks which interrupt cognitive radio transmissions. The proposed protocol assigns the most secure channel for each hop within an IoT source-destination pair in accordance to an optimization problem. Moreover, since CRNs are more vulnerable to threats, an Ensemble-based Jamming Behaviour Detection and Identification (E-JBDI) technique is proposed as a second line of defence. It is used to identify the behavior anomaly of jamming attack. Extensive simulations are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed routing protocol in comparison to other relatively similar state-of-the-art solutions. Results show network performance improvements against increased numbers of proactive jamming attacks. Moreover, results also show the effectiveness of E-JBDI in terms of accuracy, detection and precision-recall rates with values of  ≈ 1.}

In this paper, we propose and illustrate through a number of case studies how Decisional DNA, a multi-domain knowledge structure based on experience, can be implemented as a comprehensive embedded knowledge representation for Internet of Things and Cyber Physical Systems. Decisional DNA gathers explicit experiential knowledge based on formal decision events and uses this knowledge to support decision-making processes. The main advantages of using Decisional DNA are as follows: (i) offers a standardized form of the collected knowledge and experience, (ii) provides versatility and dynamicity of the knowledge structure, (iii) stipulates storage of day-to-day explicit experience in a single configuration, (iv) delivers transportability and shareability of the knowledge, and (v) provides predicting capabilities based on the collected experience. Consequently, test and results of the presented implementation of Decisional DNA case studies support it as a technology that can improve and be applied to the aforementioned technologies enhancing them with intelligence by predicting capabilities and facilitating knowledge engineering processes.}

Data-driven methods are an effective way to enhance the visual realism of crowd simulation. However, the existing work mainly focuses on training models for specific scenarios and applies them to the same scenario, so it lacks consideration of scene adaptability. To address this problem, we present a residual network based scene-independent crowd simulation (ResNet-SICS) framework to simulate crowd motion. First, a data-driven crowd properties quantization (DCPQ) method is proposed. This method divides crowd properties into physical properties and social properties: the physical properties (such as the position and the velocity) are extracted from a large number of real videos, and the social properties (such as local cohesiveness and global collectiveness) are then quantified according to the physical properties of crowds. Second, a residual network for crowd behavior properties learning (ResNet-CBPL) motion prediction model is established. This model takes the crowd properties as parameters to construct the residual network, and uses real data to learn the movement rules of the crowd. The ResNet-CBPL motion prediction model can fit the movement behavior of the crowd more accurately than can other models. Finally, we implement a crowd simulation system based on ResNet-CBPL to visualize the results of theoretical analysis in a graphical way. The experimental results show that the proposed method can simulate the crowd motion more realistically, and the trained crowd simulation framework can be applied to various scenarios.}

However, this becomes increasingly speculative as one moves to more distant timelines and visionary technological forms. This raises the question of whether it is possible to rationally predict how a technology development trajectory might unfold into the future, perhaps to some ‘ultimate form’, that is accessible, surfaces the necessary technological features for development as well as considers the implications for human–artefact relationships. The proposed approach is conceptually grounded in a parsimonious framework that examines different configurations of human–artefact relationships, revealing ‘Six Genres of Technology’. This suggests how the shift from human-human to artefact-artefact and the increasing autonomy of the artefacts (technological beings), introduces specific features to each of the six Genres. Four features are identified in the later Genres that in combination, could be construed as, or indeed pose a threat: autonomy, intelligence, language, and autopoiesis. This paper advances the debate about future technological developments by using the proposed framework to structure an argument about the key issues that should be discussed today - so that the developments of tomorrow can be more reflectively considered, appropriately debated and knowingly pursued.}

abstract = {The recent advancement in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in terms of manufacturing processes, and communication and networking technology has led to a rise in their usage in civilian and commercial applications. The regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US had earlier limited the usage of UAVs to military applications. However more recently, the FAA has outlined new enforcement that will also expand the usage of UAVs in civilian and commercial applications. Due to being deployed in open atmosphere, UAVs are vulnerable to being lost, destroyed or physically hijacked. With the UAV technology becoming ubiquitous, various issues in UAV networks such as intra-UAV communication, UAV security, air data security, data storage and management, etc. need to be addressed. Blockchain being a distributed ledger protects the shared data using cryptography techniques such as hash functions and public key encryption. It can also be used for assuring the truthfulness of the information stored and for improving the security and transparency of the UAVs. In this paper, we review various applications of blockchain in UAV networks such as network security, decentralized storage, inventory management, surveillance, etc., and discuss some broader perspectives in this regard. We also discuss various challenges to be addressed in the integration of blockchain and UAVs and suggest some future research directions.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming the engine of a new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation; as such, it has attracted much attention of scholars in recent years. Surprisingly, scarce studies have shed lights on the effects of AI on the environment, especially with respect to carbon intensity. Based on the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model, we use Chinese industrial sector data from 2005 to 2016 to investigate how AI affects carbon intensity. The empirical results show that AI, as measured separately by the adoption of robotics by industry and the number of academic AI-related papers, significantly reduces carbon intensity. The results remain robust after addressing endogenous issues. We find that there are both stages and industrial heterogeneity in the effects of AI on carbon intensity. AI had a more decrease effect on carbon intensity during the 12th Five-Year Plan than the 11th. Compared with capital-intensive industries, AI tends to have a more decrease effect on carbon intensity in the labor-intensive and tech-intensive industries. To enlarge the effects of AI on reducing carbon intensity, the government should promote the development and application of AI and implement differentiated policies in line with the industry characteristics.}

abstract = {Gateways in the Internet of Things (IoT) play a decisive role in routing the preprocessed filtered data to cloud platforms. While investigating gateways, the need for a comprehensive systematic literature review that can elaborate the working and functionalities of IoT gateways was felt. This paper presents a systematic literature review of IoT gateways in general and smart gateways in particular. It considered papers published over the last 10 years, i.e., from 2011 till July 2021. A methodical literature analysis technique is used in this review; out of 2347 papers, 67 articles are selected for complete analysis based on well-defined criteria. The survey starts with the broad categorization of gateways in IoT as basic and smart gateways. Further, smart gateways are sub-divided into three categories as passive gateways, semi-automated and fully-automated gateways. The survey is performed based on well-defined criteria, which include: the type of gateways, their requirements, tools/platforms, the approach adopted, evaluation and their application domain. This paper demonstrates further bifurcation of functional requirements of IoT gateways. Research gaps and open issues have been identified in the area. Future prospects have accordingly being suggested to help academicians embark on advanced research.}

abstract = {This article reviews the nature, the current state and possible future of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is described both in the abstract and in four forms that are currently evident not only in laboratories but also in real-world applications. Clarity about the public's concerns is sought by articulating the threats that are inherent within AI. It is proposed that AI needs to be re-conceived as `complementary artefact intelligence', and that the robotics notion of `machines that think' needs to give way to the idea of `intellectics', with the focus on `computers that do'. This article lays a foundation for two further articles on how organisations can adopt a responsible approach to AI, and how an appropriate regulatory scheme for AI can be structured.}

abstract = {Describing and forecasting city traffic is challenging, given the array of factors influencing the movement of pedestrians and vehicles. Faced with this complexity, research has focused on machine learning as a way to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns, based on past sensor data. While the methods can accurately forecast high-dimensional observations, it is often hard to explain the models and their predictions. In many cases, only the predictive performance of an otherwise black box model is evaluated. An accurate but explainable alternative is provided by the Koopman operator, an emerging methodology for data-driven identification of high-dimensional and nonlinear dynamical systems. In this study, we showcase the method by analyzing pedestrian traffic data from Melbourne, Australia. We formulate our computations in the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition framework, where we approximate the Koopman operator in a function basis computed with time delay embedding and the Diffusion Map algorithm. The model captures the distinct temporal patterns of 11 traffic sensors simultaneously. Because the dynamics become linear in the operator-theoretic perspective, we can decompose the model into its spectral components. Importantly, these components facilitate interpretation and can increase scientific understanding of the underlying system and the model’s operations. For the Melbourne data, we show that the spectral components connect to the underlying state space geometry and indicate the model’s stability over a prediction horizon. Our study showcases how the Koopman operator framework offers explainable and accurate data-driven predictions in a real-world traffic system. The results can easily be transferred to other traffic systems.}
