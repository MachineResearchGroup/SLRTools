abstract={This two-part paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on how emerging technologies, e.g., wireless and networking, artificial intelligence (AI) can enable, encourage, and even enforce social distancing practice. In Part I, an extensive background of social distancing is provided, and enabling wireless technologies are thoroughly surveyed. In this Part II, emerging technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, thermal, ultrasound, etc., are introduced. These technologies open many new solutions and directions to deal with problems in social distancing, e.g., symptom prediction, detection and monitoring quarantined people, and contact tracing. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges (e.g., privacy-preserving, scheduling, and incentive mechanisms) in implementing social distancing in practice. As an example, instead of reacting with ad-hoc responses to COVID-19-like pandemics in the future, smart infrastructures (e.g., next-generation wireless systems like 6G, smart home/building, smart city, intelligent transportation systems) should incorporate a pandemic mode in their standard architectures/designs.},

abstract={In the today's society we are growing towards a world where we are using different techniques to automate different daily life tasks to reduce human efforts also the automation of different daily life tasks always offers a lot of advantages like high efficiency and accuracy to do those tasks. Today we are not only focused on the creation of automated systems but also on creation of smart systems like smart homes, smart cities etc. This includes a lot of tasks to be done with the help of Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence etc. All these technologies are widely used in order to create a system which can be used to complete a task automatically with the need of any human effort. In such a technology driven society there is always a need to create a system which can be used to monitor the usage of water in different apartments of a building. The main problem here is that there is no way to know how much of water is used in different apartments of a building and the cost of installation of separate water meters is too high also it will need a lot of construction work to install it. Currently there is no system to which is efficient enough to complete this such type of task as it need human efforts at many stages. In this there is a need of creation a system which can be installed easily with very less or no construction also it should be able to collect data and then it should continuously stream whole data to server for processing and generate result in real time also, the overall cost should be low enough that it can be used commercially. In this paper we are focusing on creating a low-cost smart device which can be used to collect the data of water consumption. To achieve this, we have proposed to create a device with Arduino along with some sensors and modules to collect multiple data of water consumption from different apartments. After collecting this data this device will send this data to server with the help of a Wi-Fi module attached to the device. At the same time, we are using an Artificial Neural Network model for the analysis of this data for generating high accuracy results. Finally, these results will be shown on an Android App and Web App for better availability and better usability of the whole system which will allow the user to access it anywhere any time.},

abstract={Efficient residential load power management represents, on one hand, a cornerstone towards Smart City Grids while, on the other hand a multifaceted challenge. The identified interplay between multiple parameters concerning both power consumption as well as generation, call for novel design approaches such as Fuzzy Logic, machine learning and AI regarding respective algorithms. Furthermore, aiming to propose highly reliable and practical solutions, respective implementations much be undertaken and evaluated in the context of real-world prominent communication and power control infrastructures. Driven, by such observations this paper presents a complete, efficient and feasible proposal able to tackle respective requirements. Specifically, a comprehensive multimodal Fuzzy Logic Inference (FIS) design is proposed able to incorporate heterogeneous factors pertaining both to residential power consumption and generation. Additionally, proposed designed is implemented in the context of a fully functional KNX based infrastructure monitoring and controlling power consumption of a real residence. Respective performance evaluation, firstly, serve as FIS implementation validation indicating convergence between Matlab based and KNX based performance. Secondly, it highlights the benefits the end-user can anticipate using such a system. Finally, an estimated projection is attempted based on actual performance results and Europe wide statistics concerning residential power consumption as well as CO2 omissions.},

abstract={To create and maintain comfortable indoor environments, predicting occupant thermal sensation is an important goal for architects, engineers, and facility managers. The link between thermal comfort, productivity, and health is common knowledge, and researchers have developed many state-of-the-art thermal-sensation models from dozens of research projects over the last 50 years. In addition to these, the use of intelligent data-analysis techniques, such as black-box artificial neural networks (ANNs), is receiving research attention with the aim of designing building thermal-behavior models from collected data. With the convergence of the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI), smart buildings now protect us and keep us comfortable while saving energy and cutting emissions. These types of smart buildings play a vital role in building smart cities of the future. The aim of this study is to help facility managers predict the thermal sensation of the occupants under the given circumstances. To achieve this, we applied a data-driven approach to predict the thermal sensation of occupants of an indoor environment using previously collected data. Our main contribution is to design and evaluate a deep neural network (DNN) for predicting thermal sensations with a high degree of accuracy regardless of building type, climate zone, or a building’s heating and/or ventilation methods. We used the second version of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Global Thermal Comfort Database to train our model. The hyperparameter-tuning process of the proposed model is optimized using the Bayesian strategy and predicts the thermal sensation of occupants with 78% accuracy, which is much higher than the traditional predicted mean vote (PMV) model and the other shallow and deep networks compared.},

abstract={Anomaly detection has a wide range of applications in security area such as network monitoring and smart city/campus construction. It has become an active research issue of great concern in recent years. However, most algorithms of the existing studies are powerless for large-scale and high-dimensional data, and the intermediate data extracted by some methods that can handle high-dimensional data will consume lots of storage space. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse representation framework that learns dictionaries based on the latent space of variational auto-encoder. For large-scale data sets, it can play the role of dimensionality reduction to obtain hidden information, and extract more high-level features than hand-crafted features. At the same time, for the storage of normal information, the space cost can be greatly reduced. To verify the versatility and performance of the proposed learning algorithm, we have experimented on different types of anomaly detection tasks, including KDD-CUP data set for network intrusion detection, Mnist data set for image anomaly detection, and UCSD pedestrian's data set for abnormal event detection in surveillance videos. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms competing algorithms in all kinds of anomaly detection tasks.},

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly emerging paradigm with many applications in healthcare, industries, and smart cities. However, this rise of global interest in AI has fueled a renewed interest from the public sector and global policymakers. As AI networks (e.g., chatbots, automation systems, and helping agents) are paving their way as interactive household items, a critically important research issue is understanding the ethical impact of these autonomous agents. What is the explanation of the AI decision-making process? What are the legal, societal, and moral consequences of these decisions and actions? Should these AI systems be allowed to make decisions for human beings and to what extent? These questions along with some of the underlying concerns are the main research focus of modern societies and institutions. Contrary to the popular and frightening dystopic image of AI, this article aims to present recent research developments on the ethics of AI. In particular, a concise and brief introduction to different AI techniques is provided which is followed by a detailed discussion on the ethics of AI and its influencing components. Since data is the key to improve AI algorithms, details on developing high-quality data are also given. Finally, some solutions to the ethical issues of AI are discussed. This article is expected to act as a fundamental building block and as a comprehensive survey for ethical solutions of AI systems.},

abstract={Facial expressions might be seen as a relevant and useful source of information. Indeed, they allow understanding and even identifying people behavior based on the emotional changes. Therefore, automatic facial expression recognition has been widely solicited in the context of smart cities and homes. However, recognizing human emotion automatically through facial expressions remains challenging. Moreover, multi-class Support Vector Machine classifiers have been widely employed and in most cases, the proposed architectures are based on the use of bi-class classifiers. In this paper, we propose an approach that exploits selected geometric-based features using the Extremely Randomized Trees method while the recognition is handled by three distinct multi-class Support Vector Machine architectures namely bi-class (One-against-One and One-against-All) and one-class classifiers. We also investigate the performance of the three different architectures by performing a comparison in terms of accuracy and computation time. The carried experiment on three benchmark datasets attests to the efficiency of the one-class classifier since the proposed approach yields 92.68%, 85.83% and 93. 33% with the JAFFE, RaFD and KDEF datasets, respectively.},

abstract={Network trustworthiness is considered a very crucial element in network security and is developed through positive experiences, guarantees, clarity and responsibility. Trustworthiness becomes even more compelling with the ever-expanding set of Internet of Things (IoT) smart city services and applications. Most of today;s network trustworthy solutions are considered inadequate, notably for critical applications where IoT devices may be exposed and easily compromised. In this article, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates both federated learning and blockchain to achieve both network trustworthiness and security. The solution is capable of dealing with individuals’ trust as a probability and estimates the end-devices’ trust values belonging to different networks subject to achieving security criteria. We evaluate and verify the proposed model through simulation to showcase the effectiveness of the framework in terms of network lifetime, energy consumption, and trust using multiple factors. Results show that the proposed model maintains high accuracy and detection rates with values of ≈0.93 and ≈0.96, respectively.},

abstract={Wireless networks are very significant in the present world owing to their widespread use and its application in domains like disaster management, smart cities, IoT etc. A wireless network is made up of a group of wireless nodes that communicate with each other without using any formal infrastructure. The topology of the wireless network is not fixed and it can vary. The huge increase in the number of wireless devices is a challenge owing to the limited availability of wireless spectrum. Opportunistic spectrum access by Cognitive radio enables the efficient usage of limited spectrum resources. The unused channels assigned to the primary users may go waste in idle time. Cognitive radio systems will sense the unused channel space and assigns it temporarily for secondary users. This paper discusses about the recent trends in the two most important aspects of Cognitive radio namely spectrum sensing and security.},

abstract={Recently, smart cities, smart homes, and smart medical systems have challenged the functionality and connectivity of the large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Thus, with the idea of offloading intensive computing tasks from them to edge nodes (ENs), edge computing emerged to supplement these limited devices. Benefit from this advantage, IoT devices can save more energy and still maintain the quality of the services they should provide. However, computational offload decisions involve federation and complex resource management and should be determined in the real-time face to dynamic workloads and radio environments. Therefore, in this work, we use multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents deployed on multiple edge nodes to indicate the decisions of the IoT devices. On the other hand, with the aim of making DRL-based decisions feasible and further reducing the transmission costs between the IoT devices and edge nodes, federated learning (FL) is used to train DRL agents in a distributed fashion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the decision scheme and federated learning in the dynamic IoT system.},

abstract={Automatic building boundariesextraction methods are important for urban planning, change monitoring, and smart city construction. In this article, we propose a regularized building boundaries extraction from remote sensing imagery based on augment feature pyramid network (AFPN) and morphological constraint. First, we build an AFPN, which can provide more accurate and dense global features for semantic segmentation tasks to avoid the loss of feature information. Second, the building shape is manually divided into linear and curved by analyzing the morphological characteristics. The extraction results are regularized to achieve the refined expression of contour according to different types of building shapes. Finally, we conduct experiments on the benchmark dataset to test the availability of the proposed approach. The results showed that the F1-score and intersection over union (IOU) reached 93.7% and 88.8%, respectively. Besides, our proposed approach is compared with some of the excellent research in recent years of models, such as PSPNet, Unet++, RefineNet, and DeconvNet. On the benchmark dataset, the proposed method increases the IOU by 0.9–2.7% and improves the F1-score by 0.2–2.5%. In addition, the results prove that our method considering morphological constraint can achieve better visual effects.},

abstract={Traffic forecasting is imperative to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and it has always been considered as a challenging research topic, due to the complex topological structure of the urban road network and the temporal stochastic nature of dynamic change. Popular sports events attract vast numbers of spectators travelling to the event, which will have a substantial effect on ITS, showing peaks on the network that can collapse a smart city's ITS. In this paper, we tackle traffic forecasting and use the Doha network in Qatar and the FIFA World Cup 2022 (FWC 2022) event as a case study. We propose a novel technique for embedding road network graphs into a Temporal-Graph Convolutional Network. The embedding process includes a modification to the graph weights based on graph theory and the properties of the line graph. Extensive simulations are carried out on a real-world calibrated dataset from Doha's road network. Our Temporal Line Graph Convolutional Network (TLGCN) proposal shows outstanding performance when compared to state-of-the-art techniques, not only for huge special events but also for the regular daily traffic.},

abstract={Automatic object detection in aerial imagery is being increasingly adopted in many applications, such as traffic monitoring, smart cities, and disaster assistance. In keypoint-based detectors, the prediction modules are usually generated from a fixed feature map scale. This configuration significantly limits the ability to detect multiscale objects in aerial scenes. The corner selection module in these detectors often ignores that a category in an aerial image is relatively unitary. In this article, a novel network, called the multiscale keypoint detection network (MKD-Net), is proposed to address these challenges. MKD-Net fuses multiscale layers to generate multiple feature maps for objects of different sizes. During the inference phase, both feature maps can be exploited for predicting corners. Moreover, a category attention module is designed to reduce the channel noise for a single-category scene. Experiments on benchmarks PASCAL VOC and DOTA show promising performance of MKD-Net compared with the baseline network. The code is available on https://github.com/jason-su/MKD-NET.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides the basic infrastructure for a hyper connected society where all things are connected and exchange information through the Internet. IoT technology is fused with 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for use various fields such as the smart city and smart factory. As the demand for IoT technology increases, security threats against IoT infrastructure, applications, and devices have also increased. A variety of studies have been conducted on the detection of IoT malware to avoid the threats posed by malicious code. While existing models may accurately detect malicious IoT code identified through static analysis, detecting the new and variant IoT malware quickly being generated may become challenging. This paper proposes a dynamic analysis for IoT malware detection (DAIMD) to reduce damage to IoT devices by detecting both well-known IoT malware and new and variant IoT malware evolved intelligently. The DAIMD scheme learns IoT malware using the convolution neural network (CNN) model and analyzes IoT malware dynamically in nested cloud environment. DAIMD performs dynamic analysis on IoT malware in a nested cloud environment to extract behaviors related to memory, network, virtual file system, process, and system call. By converting the extracted and analyzed behavior data into images, the behavior images of IoT malware are classified and trained in the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). DAIMD can minimize the infection damage of IoT devices from malware by visualizing and learning the vast amount of behavior data generated through dynamic analysis.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is the new trend to make devices interact among themselves.

IoT will lead to the development of a wide range of advanced information services that need to be processed in real-time and require large storage and computational power than can be provided by Cloud and Fog Computing. The integration of IoT with Cloud and Fog Computing make IoT capable of processing large-scale geo-distributed information. In any IoT application, communications are critical to deliver the required information to the end user, device or application, for instance to take actions during crisis events. However, IoT communication elements such as gateways or Fog nodes, will introduce major security challenges as they contribute to increase the attack surface, preventing the IoT to deliver accurate information. In this paper, we propose a methodology to develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on Anomaly Behavior Analysis (ABA) to detect when a Fog node has been compromised. The preliminary experimental results show that our proposed approach accurately detects known and unknown anomalies due to misuses or cyber-attacks, with high detection rate and low false alarms.},

Waste management methods and processes used by waste managers need to be improved to handle growing levels of MSW in a safe, effective, and timely manner. More cities worldwide are building data collection network architectures as part of ‘Smart Cities' initiatives. As a result, the use of technology to capture environmental data from waste bins has increased in recent years. This paper presents an overview of a proposed waste management research study that aims to demonstrate how collecting specific environmental data from public waste bins enables waste managers to decide the best method of collecting MSW. The proposed research study is to be performed within the City of Onkaparinga, a local council in South Australia. The study highlights that meaningful environmental data can be collected through the design of a wireless technology with multiple sensors placed in public waste bins. The analysis of the collected data will enable waste managers to make informed decisions on the most effective and efficient method of collecting MSW. In addition, this will help waste managers to devise better and efficient waste management processes and procedures.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is penetrating many facets of our daily life with the proliferation of intelligent services and applications empowered by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may not be feasible in realistic application scenarios due to the high scalability of modern IoT networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed collaborative AI approach that can enable many intelligent IoT applications, by allowing for AI training at distributed IoT devices without the need for data sharing. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of FL in IoT networks, beginning from an introduction to the recent advances in FL and IoT to a discussion of their integration.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) primary objective is to make a hyper-connected world for various application domains. However, IoT suffers from a lack of interoperability leading to a substantial threat to the predicted economic value. Schema.org provides semantic interoperability to structure heterogeneous data on the Web. An extension of this vocabulary for the IoT domain (iot.schema.org) is an ongoing research effort to address semantic interoperability for the Web of Things (WoT). To design this vocabulary, a central challenge is to identify the main topics (concepts and properties) automatically from existing knowledge in IoT applications. We designed knowledge extraction for the WoT (KE4WoT) to automatically identify the most important topics from literature ontologies of three different IoT application domains: 1) smart home; 2) smart city; and 3) smart weather-based on our corpus consisting of 4500 full-text conference and journal articles to utilize domain-specific knowledge encoded within IoT publications. Despite the importance of automatically identifying the relevant topics for iot.schema.org, up to know there is no study dealing with this issue. To evaluate the extracted topics, we compare the descriptiveness of these topics for the ten most popular ontologies in the three domains with empirical evaluations of 23 domain experts. The results illustrate that the identified main topics of IoT ontologies can be used to sufficiently describe existing ontologies as keywords.},

abstract={With the advancement in the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT), its number of applications has also increased such as in healthcare, smart cities, vehicles, industries, household appliances, and Smart Grids (SG). One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values. Here cryptography techniques can play a major role along with the private blockchain model for secure data transmission in smart meters. Hence, to overcome these existing issues and challenges in smart meter communication we have proposed a blockchain-based system model for secure communication along with a novel Advanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography Digital Signature (AECCDS) algorithm in Fog Computing (FC) environment. Here FC nodes will work as miners at the edge of smart meters for secure and real-time communication. The algorithm is implemented using iFogSim, Geth version 1.9.25, Ganache, Truffle for compiling smart contracts, Anaconda (Python editor), and ATOM as language editor for the smart contracts.},

abstract={In recent years, advances in deep learning (DL) technology have greatly improved research and services related to artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, real-time object recognition has become an important technology in smart cities. To achieve this, low-cost network deployment and low-latency data transfer are the key technologies. In this paper, we focus on Time- and Wavelength-Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (TWDM-PON) based inference systems to deploy cost-efficient networks that accommodate many network cameras. A significant issue for a GPU-based inference system via TWDM-PON is optimally allocating upstream wavelength and bandwidth to enable real-time inference. However, it has not been considered to increase the batch size of arrival data at edge servers ensuring low-latency transmission. Therefore, this paper proposes a concept of an inference system in which a large number of cameras periodically upload image data to a GPU-based server via TWDM-PONe We also propose a cooperative wavelength and bandwidth allocation algorithm to ensure low-latency and time-synchronized data arrival at the edge. The performance of the proposed scheme is verified with computer simulation.},

abstract={Interactive learning plays a key role in extending the occupant behavior implementation toward smart buildings. Efficient feedbacks can be obtained from the end user by involving occupants and increasing their awareness about energy systems. Working in highly energy-efficient buildings can be a great opportunity, but users need to feel empowered. This means making them aware of the building features and allowing them to manage some of the appliances. In this way, disorientation or annoyance is avoided, and people feel more in control. This paper proposes a solution to interact with occupants to estimate the number of occupants. A novel way of supervised learning is analyzed to estimate the occupancy in a room where actual occupancy is interactively requested to occupants when it is the most relevant to limit the number of interactions. Occupancy estimation algorithm relies on machine learning; it uses information gathered from occupants with the measurements collected from common sensors, for instance, motion detection, power consumption, and CO2 concentration. Two different classifiers are investigated for occupancy estimation with interactions: a decision tree C4.5 and a parameterized rule-based classifier. In this paper, the question of when interacting with occupants is investigated. This approach avoids the usage of a camera to determine the actual occupancy. A complete real-time interaction environment has been developed and is used to estimate the occupancy in an office case study. The graphical user interface has been designed to carry out a real-time experiment.},

abstract={Edge computing technology is an important computer operating system in China. It plays a key role in multi-system fusion and intelligent manufacturing, and can play a key role in training and testing of deep neural networks. The purpose of this paper is to study the application of edge computing technology in the collaborative optimization of intelligent transportation systems based on information and physical fusion. This article sets up monitoring points at different traffic intersections, and applies long-term and short-term memory networks to collect data at each traffic intersection. The DBN-SVR method model was used to detect the traffic flow of some intersections, and the edge computer technology was used to process the information signals generated by the intersections. The other portions of the intersections used traditional monitoring systems. By comparing the work efficiency and utility under the two methods, fitting data is performed, and mathematical statistics and mathematical analysis methods are used to verify the fitted data. The experimental data show that the edge computing technology can help the processing of traffic conditions in the intelligent transportation system integrated with information and physics, which has greatly improved the overall work efficiency of each system. Experimental data shows that intelligent transportation systems that integrate edge computing technology with information physics have improved transportation efficiency by about 20% and urban security by about 35%, which has a great effect on building smart cities and safe cities.},

The development of highly accurate machine learning models is yet harder when considering the optimization of hyperparameters, which is an expensive computational task. To tackle these challenges this work proposes the Distributed Evolutionary Hyperparameter Optimization (DEHO) for the Weighted Multivariate Fuzzy Time Series method (WMVFTS), a simple and non-parametric forecasting method with high scalability and accuracy, comprising a sequential training and forecasting procedure and a MapReduce extension for distributed processing. The proposed methods were evaluated using a cluster with commodity hardware and two big time series, showing increasing speed up for training and test times as new CPU cores are added to cluster. Then the DEHO method was executed in the computational cluster, achieving fast convergence and feasible processing time and generating highly accurate WMVFTS models.},

pages={124624-124632},
abstract={The Type-2 fuzzy set (T2 FS) is widely used for efficient control uncertainties, such as noise sensitivity in the fuzzy set. In addition, unsupervised machine learning requires a clustering parameter value in advance, and may affect clustering performance according to prior information such as the number and size of clusters. In this case, the fuzzifier value m to be applied is the most important factor in improving the accuracy of data. Therefore, in this paper, we intend to perform clustering to automatically acquire the determination of m1 and m2 values that depended on existing repeated experiments. To this end, in order to increase efficiency on deriving appropriate fuzzifier value, we used the Interval type-2 possibilistic fuzzy C-means (IT2PFCM), clustering method to classify a given pattern. In Efficient IT2PFCM method, used for clustering, we propose an algorithm that derives suitable fuzzifier values for each data. These values also extract information from each data point through the histogram approach and Gaussian Curve Fitting method. Using the extracted information, two adaptive fuzzifier value m1 and m2 are determined. Obtained values apply the new lowest and highest membership values. In addition, it is possible to form an appropriate fuzzy area on each cluster by only taking advantage of the characteristics of IT2PFCM, which reduces uncertainty. This doesn't only improve the accuracy of clustering of measured sensor data, but can also be used without additional procedures such as data labeling or the provision of prior information. It is also efficient at monitoring numerous sensors, managing and verifying sensor data collected in real time such as smart cities. Eventually, in this study, the proposed method is to improve IT2PFCM performance on accurate and quick clustering of large amount of complex data such as Internet of Things (IoT).},

Homomorphic Encryption (HE) schemes and secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) are considered suitable solutions for privacy protection. In this paper, we propose and analyze the performance of three homomorphic Logistic Regression (LR) models with Gradient Descent (GD) algorithms based on the Residue Number System (RNS). We compare their performance with four traditional non-homomorphic versions, one homomorphic algorithm based on RNS with Batch GD, and two state-of-the-art homomorphic algorithms. To validate our approach, we consider six public datasets of different medicine domains (diabetes, cancer, drugs, etc.) and genomics. We use a 5-fold cross-validation technique for a fair comparison in terms of the solution quality and training time. The results show that propose homomorphic solutions have similar accuracy with non-homomorphic algorithms, increased classification performance, and decreased training time compared with the state-of-the-art HE algorithms.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) plays an increasingly significant role in our daily activities, connecting physical objects around us into digital services. In other words, IoT is the driving force behind home automation, smart cities, modern health systems, and advanced manufacturing. This also increases the likelihood of cyber threats against IoT devices and services. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in application protocols, including Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) that interact directly with backend database systems and client-server applications to store data of IoT services. Successful exploitation of one or more of these protocols can result in data leakage and security breaches. In this paper, an ensemble intrusion detection technique is proposed to mitigate malicious events, in particular botnet attacks against DNS, HTTP, and MQTT protocols utilized in IoT networks. New statistical flow features are generated from the protocols based on an analysis of their potential properties. Then, an AdaBoost ensemble learning method is developed using three machine learning techniques, namely decision tree, Naive Bayes (NB), and artificial neural network, to evaluate the effect of these features and detect malicious events effectively. The UNSW-NB15 and NIMS botnet datasets with simulated IoT sensors' data are used to extract the proposed features and evaluate the ensemble technique. The experimental results show that the proposed features have the potential characteristics of normal and malicious activity using the correntropy and correlation coefficient measures. Moreover, the proposed ensemble technique provides a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate compared with each classification technique included in the framework and three other state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract={In low-altitude target situation, the multi-path signals cause the amplitude-phase distortion of direct signal from targets and degrade the performance of existing methods. Hence, in this paper, we propose a phase enhancement method for low-angle estimation using supervised deep neural network (DNN) to mitigate the phase distortion, thus to improve direction of arrival (DOA) estimation accuracy. The mapping relationship between the original phase difference distribution of the received signal and desired phase difference distribution is learned by DNN during training. The phase of test data is enhanced by trained DNN, and the enhanced phase is used for DOA estimation. We explain the significance of enhancing phase instead of amplitude by discussing the sensitivity of amplitude and phase on DOA estimation. Moreover, we prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method by simulation experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed technique has a better performance in terms of estimation error and goodness of fit (GoF) than the physics-driven DOA estimation methods and state-of-the-art methods including feature reversal and the support vector regression (SVR).},

abstract={The decomposition number $K$ and penalty factor $\alpha $ in the variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm have a great influence on the decomposition effect and the accuracy of subsequent fault diagnosis. Therefore, a gear fault diagnosis method based on genetic mutation particle swarm optimization VMD and probabilistic neural network (GMPSO-VMD-PNN) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the GMPSO algorithm is used to optimize the $[K,\alpha]$ parameter combination in the VMD algorithm, and the optimal $[K,\alpha]$ parameter combination of each gear fault vibration signal to be decomposed is selected. Then, the gear fault vibration signal is decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by VMD, and the sample entropy value of each IMFs is extracted to form the feature vector of subsequent fault diagnosis. Finally, the characteristic vector of gear fault vibration signal is input into PNN model, and gear fault is accurately classified. By comparing with fixed parameter VMD algorithm, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm, the superiority of this method in gear fault diagnosis is verified. Therefore, the GMPSO-VMD-PNN algorithm proposed in this paper has certain application value for gear fault diagnosis.},

abstract={Internet-connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices are exploding, which pose a significant threat for their management and security protection. IoT device identification is a prerequisite for discovering, monitoring, and protecting these devices. Although the existing proactive identification methods based on protocol fingerprint can discover and identify large-scale IoT devices, the fingerprint granularity is difficult to meet the requirements of security risk assessment for large-scale IoT devices. Since IoT devices usually support multiple network protocols for specific collection and control tasks, we propose a cross-layer protocol fingerprint to achieve large-scale fine-grained devices identification instead of traditional single protocol fingerprint. We first design a probing scheme for gathering HTTP and TCP cross-layer packets. Then we select the specific field of the HTTP and TCP protocols based on the diversity and consistence of field value. Finally, we utilize convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-term memory network (LSTM) to extract and construct feature fingerprint of these specific fields, and achieve a fine-grain IoT devices identification with high accuracy. The experimental results show that our identification accuracy of devices model reaches 96.6%, the recall rate reaches 97.4%.},

abstract={Traditional methods for studying the activity dynamics of people and their social interactions in cities require time-consuming and resource-intensive observations and surveys. Dynamic online trails from geosocial networks (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, Flickr etc.) have been increasingly used as proxies for human activity, focusing on mobility behavior, spatial interaction, and social connectivity, among others. Social media records incorporate geo-tags, timestamps, textual components, user-profile attributes and points-of-interest (POI) features, which respectively address spatial, temporal, topical, demographic, and contextual dimensions of human activity. While the information contained in social media data is complex and high-dimensional, there is a lack of studies exploiting the combined potential of their information layers. This article introduces a framework that considers multiple dimensions (i.e. spatial, temporal, topical, and demographic) of information from social media data, and combines Geo-Self-Organizing Maps (GeoSOMs) in conjunction with contiguity-constrained hierarchical clustering, to identify homogeneous regions of social interaction in cities and, subsequently, estimate appropriate locations for new POIs. Drawing on the discovered regions, we build a Factorization Machine-based model to estimate appropriate locations for new POIs in different urban contexts. Using geo-referenced Twitter records and Foursquare data from Amsterdam, Boston, and Jakarta, we evaluate the potential of machine learning techniques in discovering knowledge about the geography of social dynamics from unstructured and high-dimensional social web data. Moreover, we demonstrate that the discovered homogeneous regions are significant predictors of new POI locations.},

abstract={The rapid development of the internet of things (IoT)promotes research in smart city and Fog computing. The vast volume of real-time visual data produced from the tremendous end devices in IoT is a big challenge for the network to transmit and for the data center to store. The typical case is the huge volume of visual data produced by the surveillance cameras in a smart city. In this paper, we consider the problem of how to allocate the calculation ability of the Fog node to handle the surveillance data to obtain low delay meanwhile maintain the video quality. To solve this challenge, we attempt to reduce the tremendous video data using deep learning models in the computational Fog node and optimize the transmission function for high efficiency. To reduce data, we extract video feature and keep salient zones with high resolution meanwhile leave the unavoidable distortion in less important areas. To obtain the least transmission delay under the dynamic bandwidth in Fog computing, we model the transmission delay function and solve it by Lagrangian dual decomposition. We make experiments on public dataset Cityscapes and 4G/LTE Bandwidth Log to evaluate our method. The experiment results show that our feature-based image processing method obtains around 68.7% higher average SSIM (structural similarity index)than the traditional HEVC in the salient zones, and our solution reduces the system delay by 71.02 % comparing with the plain transmission method. It proves our solution reduces the video transmission latency meanwhile keeps the SSIM of salient areas in the video.},

abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Artificial Intelligence revived in the last decade. The need for progress, the growing processing capacity and the low cost of the Cloud have facilitated the development of new, powerful algorithms. The efficiency of these algorithms in Big Data processing, Deep Learning and Convolutional Networks is transforming the way we work and is opening new horizons. Thanks to them, we can now analyse data and obtain unimaginable solutions to today’s problems. Nevertheless, our success is not entirely based on algorithms, it also comes from our ability to follow our “gut” when choosing the best combination of algorithms for an intelligent artefact. It’s about approaching engineering with a lot of knowledge and tact. This involves the use of both connectionist and symbolic systems, and of having a full understanding of the algorithms used. Moreover, to address today’s problems we must work with both historical and real-time data. We must fully comprehend the problem, its time evolution, as well as the relevance and implications of each piece of data, etc. It is also important to consider development time, costs and the ability to create systems that will interact with their environment, will connect with the objects that surround them and will manage the data they obtain in a reliable manner. In this keynote, the evolution of intelligent computer systems will be examined. The need for human capital will be emphasised, as well as the need to follow one’s “gut instinct” in problem-solving. We will look at the benefits of combining information and knowledge to solve complex problems and will examine how knowledge engineering facilitates the integration of different algorithms. Furthermore, we will analyse the importance of complementary technologies such as IoT and Blockchain in the development of intelligent systems. It will be shown how tools like “Deep Intelligence” make it possible to create computer systems efficiently and effectively. “Smart” infrastructures need to incorporate all added-value resources so they can offer useful services to the society, while reducing costs, ensuring reliability and improving the quality of life of the citizens. The combination of AI with IoT and with blockchain offers a world of possibilities and opportunities. The use of edge platforms or fog computing helps increase efficiency, reduce network latency, improve security and bring intelligence to the edge of the network; close to the sensors, users and to the medium used. This keynote will present success stories regarding specially smart cities. All these fields require the development of interactive, reliable and secure systems which we are capable of building thanks to current advances. Deepint.net, a tool developed by DCSc and BISITE will be presented. Several use cases of intelligent systems will be presented and it will be analysed how the different processes have been optimized by means of tools that facilitate decision-making.},

abstract={Video cameras are an important high-fidelity source of surveillance information. They are especially useful in traffic monitoring scenarios in smart cities to reduce congestion, regulate traffic and enforce regulations. Unfortunately, increasing the number of cameras at a specific location makes it harder to keep quality attention on the scene due to high amount of unstructured data mixed with privacy breaching non-essential data, like faces of pedestrians etc. In this paper, we propose a method for real-time merging of multiple surveillance video sources to extract the required information in a single, world coordinate-based, virtual traffic camera view. Such a composite view allows for future improvements in quality of critical details using techniques as super resolution, while at the same time removing unnecessary private information. The implementation is validated on real world traffic data using NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as an edge device and consists of perspective transformation, image merging and object detection/tracking using YOLOv4 machine learning model for the extraction of significant objects only.},

abstract={Advanced artificial intelligence techniques, such as federated learning, has been applied to broad areas, e.g., image classification, speech recognition, smart city, and healthcare. Despite intensive research on federated learning, existing schemes are vulnerable to attacks and can hardly meet the security requirements for real-world applications. The problem of designing a secure federated learning framework to ensure the correctness of training procedure has not been sufficiently studied and remains open. In this paper, we propose VFChain, a verifiable and auditable federated learning framework based on the blockchain system. First, to provide the verifiability, a committee is selected through the blockchain to collectively aggregate models and record verifiable proofs in the blockchain. Then, to provide the auditability, a novel authenticated data structure is proposed for blockchain to improve the search efficiency of verifiable proofs and support a secure rotation of committee. Finally, to further improve the search efficiency, an optimization scheme is proposed to support multiple-model learning tasks. We implement VFChain and conduct extensive experiments by utilizing the popular deep learning models over the public real-world dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed VFChain system.},

abstract={To meet the stringent demands of emerging IoT applications such as smart home, smart city, and virtual reality in 5G/6G Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, edge content caching for mobile/multi-access edge computing (MEC) has been identified as a promising approach to improve the quality of services in terms of latency and energy consumption. However, the limitations of cache capacity makes it difficult to develop an effective common caching framework that satisfies diverse user preferences. In this paper, we propose a new content caching strategy that maximizes the cache hit ratio through flexible prediction in dynamically changing network and user environments. It is based on a hierarchical deep learning architecture: long short-term memory (LSTM)-based local learning and ensemble-based meta-learning. First, as a local learning model, we employ an LSTM method with seasonal-trend decomposition using loess (STL)-based preprocessing. It identifies the attributes for demand prediction on the contents in various demographic user groups. Second, as a meta-learning model, we employ a regression-based ensemble learning method, which uses an online convex optimization framework and exhibits sublinear ‘regret’ performance. It orchestrates the obtained multiple demographic user preferences into a unified caching strategy in real-time. Extensive experiments were conducted on the popular MovieLens datasets. It was shown that the proposed control provides up to a 30% higher cache hit ratio than conventional representative algorithms and a near-optimal cache hit ratio within approximately 9% of the optimal caching scheme with perfect prior knowledge of content popularity. The proposed learning and caching control can be implemented as a core function of the 5G/6G standard’s network data analytic function (NWDAF) module.},

volume={65},

pages={1407-1417},
abstract={Railway transportation systems are the backbone of smart cities. With the rapid increasing of railway mileage, the energy consumption of train becomes a major concern. The uniqueness of train operations is that the geographic characteristics of each route is known a priori. On the other hand, the parameters (e.g., loads) of a train varies from trip to trip. Such a specialty determines that an energy-optimal driving profile for each train operation has to be pursued by considering both the geographic information and the inherent train conditions. The solution of the optimization problem, however, is hard due to its high dimension, nonlinearity, complex constraints and time-varying characteristics of a control sequence. As a result, an energy-saving solution to the train control optimization problem has to address the dilemma of optimization quality and computing time. This work proposes an energy-efficient train control framework by integrating both offline and onboard optimization techniques. The offline processing builds a decision tree based sketchy solution through a complete flow of sequence mining, optimization and machine learning. The onboard system feeds the train parameters into the decision tree to derive an optimized control sequence. A key innovation of this work is the identification of optimal patterns of control sequence by data mining the driving behaviors of the experienced train drivers and then apply the patterns to online trip planning. The proposed framework efficiently find an optimized driving solution by leveraging the training results derived with a compute-intensive offline learning flow. The framework was already testified in a smart freight train system. It was demonstrated an average of $9.84$ percent energy-saving can be achieved.},

abstract={Multi-modal travel is becoming prominent amongst Indian Passengers due to the advance of low-cost air travel, increasing disposable income, and connectivity by rail, bus, and air across various cities. This is a huge opportunity for all stakeholders within transport sector like Rail, Aviation, and Surface transport to operate seamlessly to boost domestic transportation and ultimately offer passengers the best of breed travel solution. In this paper, we will propose a framework for policy analytics for Rail and Air connectivity and discuss how big data can play a key role to analyze the existing datasets like routes, schedules, booking information, benchmark studies, economic characteristics, and passenger demographics. Big data tools are very useful in processing unstructured data sets by analyzing them and providing meaningful visualizations. Policy analytics can combine the power of information technology, operations research, statistical modeling and machine learning to modernize and equip policy makers for better data-driven decisions while drafting policies. This would ultimately enable Government's vision on smart cities, seamless transport hubs, and interchanges that provide seamless connectivity and high passenger satisfaction.},

abstract={The impending Internet of Things (IoT) wave is promising to affect every aspect of our daily lives, ranging from smart things to smart buildings, smart cities, and smart environments. A lot of attention has been devoted to the tsunami of data produced by IoT, and the related means of extracting useful actionable information from it, spawning efforts in Big Data processing and machine learning. Yet, all of this does little to address the need for IoT to capture, interpret, and act on this wall of (noisy) information at the right time, at the right place, and in the right form. Conventional computing systems are a poor match to the needs of this emerging massively distributed real-time system. Hence, alternative computing techniques present an attractive alternative, trading off computational resolution for significant gains in quality-of-service energy efficiency and robustness. This observation is based on the conjecture that most applications related to IoT have an inherent error resilience and are evolutionary (that is, learning-based). Alternative computing strategies may be conceived at every level of the design hierarchy, starting from the device level with novel 3-D nonvolatile memory/logic combinations, or at the architectural level by shifting away from the traditional von Neumann architecture to different computing paradigms such as neuromorphic and/or stochastic computation all the way up to the algorithmic and data representation levels.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) is nowadays embedded in several computing devices, consumer electronics, and cyber-physical systems. Smart sensors are deployed everywhere, in applications such as wearables and perceptual computing devices, and intelligent algorithms power our connected world. These devices collect and aggregate volumes of data, and in doing so, they augment our society in multiple ways; from healthcare, to social networks, to consumer electronics, and many more. To process these immense volumes of data, ML is emerging as the de facto analysis tool that powers several aspects of our Big Data society. Applications spanning from infrastructure (smart cities, intelligent transportation systems, smart grids, and to name a few), to social networks and content delivery, to e-commerce and smart factories, and emerging concepts such as self-driving cars and autonomous robots, are powered by ML technologies. These emerging systems require real-time inference and decision support; such scenarios, therefore, may use customized hardware accelerators, are typically bound by limited resources, and are restricted to limited connectivity and bandwidth. Thus, near-sensor computation and near-sensor intelligence have started emerging as necessities to continue supporting the paradigm shift of our connected world. The need for real-time intelligent data analytics (especially in the era of Big Data) for decision support near the data acquisition points emphasizes the need for revolutionizing the way we design, build, test, and verify processors, accelerators, and systems that facilitate ML (and deep learning, in particular) implemented in resource-constrained environments for use at the edge and the fog. As such, traditional von Neumann architectures are no longer sufficient and suitable, primarily because of limitations in both performance and energy efficiency caused especially by large amounts of data movement. Furthermore, due to the connected nature of such systems, security and reliability are also critically important. Robustness, therefore, in the form of reliability and operational capability in the presence of faults, whether malicious or accidental, is a critical need for such systems. Moreover, the operating nature of these systems relies on input data that is characterized by the four “V’s”: velocity (speed of data generation), variability (variable forms and types), veracity (unreliable and unpredictable), and volume (i.e., large amounts of data). Thus, the robustness of such systems needs to consider this issue as well. Furthermore, robustness in terms of security, and in terms of reliability to hardware and software faults, in particular, besides their importance when it comes to safety-critical applications, is also a positive factor in building trustworthiness toward these disrupting technologies from our society. To achieve this envisioned robustness, we need to refocus on problems such as design, verification, architecture, scheduling and allocation policies, optimization, and many more, for determining the most efficient, secure, and reliable way of implementing these novel applications within a robust, resource-constrained system, which may or may not be connected. This special issue, therefore, addresses a key aspect of fog and edge-based ML algorithms; robustness (as defined above) under resource-constraint scenarios. The special issue presents emerging works in how we design robust systems, both in terms of reliability as well as fault tolerance and security, while operating with a limited number of resources, and possibly in the presence of harsh environments that may eliminate connectivity and pollute the input data.},

The great development of Internet of Things devices and applications is fostering more and more pervasive communication paradigms, but smart devices and gateways need further capabilities to become fully connected intelligent things.

In parallel, there has been a strong growth in integrating intelligence, often in the form of machine/deep learning, into applications, which also leads to vastly increasing computational requirements. These innovations then will be integrated into complex systems, which need to be properly engineered to become safe, reliable, trustworthy, and secure while at the same time being cost-efficient.},

abstract={Recent advances in communication and networking technologies are leading to a plethora of novel wireless services that range from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication to smart cognitive networks and massive Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Enabling these emerging applications over the fifth generation (5G) of wireless cellular systems requires meeting numerous challenges pertaining to spectrum sharing and management. In fact, most 5G applications will be highly reliant on intelligent spectrum management techniques, which should adapt to dynamic network environments while also guaranteeing high reliability and high quality-of-experience (QoE). In this context, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that include deep learning, convolutional neural networks, and reinforcement learning, among many others, is expected to play a very important role in paving the way towards truly AI-driven spectrum management, thus enabling tomorrow's smart city services. Therefore, it has become imperative to investigate and apply AI techniques to solve emerging spectrum management problems in various wireless networks. This includes leveraging AI to address a wide range of wireless networking challenges ranging from network management to dynamic spectrum sharing and resource management.},

abstract={The papers in this special section focus on smart fuzzy optimization in operational research and renewable energy. Over the last five decades, fuzzy optimization has found numerous successful applications in diverse fields, including operational research (OR), manufacturing, information technology, energy optimization, data science, smart cities, and big data analytics. Fuzzy optimization has strongly influenced research and development into other areas of intelligent computing leading to many hybrid and deep learning systems. It has opened new horizons in thinking, research and development and it will guide us into another half century of progress. In actually, fuzzy optimization is an approximation of nonlinear optimization, which has formed a systematic but not yet unified theory of fuzzy systems and other fuzzy-set based methodologies. Fuzzy optimization along with decision making is an interdisciplinary area, which focuses on extracting useful knowledge with data technology and employing it. Specific topics include fuzzy sets, rough sets, statistical methods, parallel/distributed data mining, hybrid fuzzy optimization, hybrid evolutionary and swarm intelligence methods, big data optimization, IoTs, flexibility, reliability and robustness, smart systems, high-dimensional and big-data analytics, energy optimization, and software engineering. },

abstract={In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the ability of embedded devices, sensors, and actuators to communicate, and create a ubiquitous cyber-physical world. The growth of the notion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rapid development of technologies such as short range mobile communication and improved energy-efficiency is expected to create a pervasive connection of “things.” This will inevitably result in the generation of enormous amount of data, which have to be stored, processed, and accessed. Cloud computing has long been recognized as a paradigm for big data storage and analytics. The combination of cloud computing and IoT can enable ubiquitous sensing services and powerful processing of sensing data streams beyond the capability of individual things, thus stimulating innovations in both fields. For example, cloud platforms allow the sensing data to be stored and used intelligently for smart monitoring and actuation with the smart devices. Novel data fusion algorithms, machine learning methods, and artificial intelligence techniques can be implemented and run centralized or distributed on the cloud to achieve automated decision making. These will boost the development of new applications, such as smart cities, grids, and transportation systems. New challenges, however, arise when IoT meets cloud—there is an urgent need for novel network architectures that seamlessly integrate them, and protocols that facilitate big data streaming from IoT to the cloud. QoS and QoE, as well as data security, privacy, and reliability, are critical concerns during the integration.},

Such circumstances could intrude on the rights to privacy, and human dignity, with disclosures potentially harmful to the individual, families, friends, associates, and communities. This workshop will examine ways to promote the best outcomes for the residents and visitors of smart cities through the lens of human rights. Affective rights will also be discussed as requisite to formulating the optimal smart city. Moreover, this workshop will foster discussion around the still relatively nascent technology of Affective Computing, which is the application of AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), biometric measurement, sentiment analysis, and psychological factor assessment in determining and interacting with the affective states of the individual. This workshop is open to all stakeholders in smart city development and management, including computer scientists, engineers, smart city integrators, application developers, third party vendors, ethicists, city managers and administrators.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is the major technology of the 4th industrial revolution in which various types of devices are connected together to work smartly without the intervention of humans. IoT seems to impart a great impact on our social, economic, and commercial lives. IoT applications are converting from smart home and smart me to the smart cities or smart planet. However, the large number of devices interconnected with each other by multi protocols puts the security of IoT networks on the verge of threats. Making the IoT devices more secure is also not feasible because of their limited computational power. Hence, there is a need for advancement in methods to secure IoT networks. Machine Learning (ML) models have been hot topics in security research in past years. As the IoT devices generate tons of data on a daily basis which can be used to train ML algorithms, it could be a reasonable solution to provide security to IoT systems. In this work, the main goal is to provide a broader survey of research works in the IoT security field regarding ML implementation. We briefly described the security issues in IoT networks and their impact on the privacy of important data. We then shed light on different ML algorithms and models and discussed their advantages, disadvantages, and applications in IoT individually. Moreover, the ML models currently working in IoT networks for security purposes are discussed. We also talked about the limitations of using ML models to secure the IoT networks which could provide new future research directions.},

Urban growth models predict rapid increases in extent and populations all over the world. It is anticipated that over two-thirds of the population will live in cities by 2050. The fastest growing cities in the world are in the developing countries where the infrastructure growth has not been matching the urban growth thereby creating a range of socio-economic issues. In developed countries, urban monitoring mainly consists in tracking more subtle changes and densification within cities. In both cases, poorly planned urbanization can lead to greater risks to the quality of life and thereby significant economic risks.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the way how information is processed and stored. Due to latency sensitive applications and huge amounts of data produced at the edge of the network, more and more data is processed where it is produced - namely on the edge. This development results in completely new network topologies where besides massive data centers we experience growing amount of so called micro data centers on the edge of the network. However, increasing complexity of multiple data centers necessary to execute an application represents a new challenge for the deployment and runtime operation of large scale applications like those in the area of smart cities, self-driving vehicles and tele medicine. The challenge thereby is to deploy application in a way to satisfy user requirements in form of different Quality of Service parameters (e.g., latency) but at the same time minimize energy consumption necessary to execute the application. In this talk we discuss several research challenges that arise when deploying near real time analytics on the edge of the network.},
