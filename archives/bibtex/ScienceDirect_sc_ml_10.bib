abstract = {The incoming IoT big data era requires efficient and resource-constrained mining of large sets of distributed data. This paper explores a possible approach to this end, combining the two emerging paradigms of Conditional Neural Networks with early exits and Fog Computing. Apart from describing the general framework, we provide four specific contributions. First, after reviewing the basic architectures of CDNNs with early exits and characterizing their computational capacity, we consider three basic algorithms for their supervised training (namely the End-to-End, Layer-Wise and Classifier-Wise training algorithms), and, then, formally characterize and compare the resulting tradeoffs in a Fog-supported implementation. Second, after presenting a reference architecture for the local classifiers equipping the considered CDNNs, we develop an optimized framework for the parallel and distributed setting of their decision thresholds. Third, we propose a greedy algorithm for placing the early exits efficiently on the considered CDNNs and prove its linear scaling complexity. Fourth, we analytically characterize in closed-form and analyze the energy performance of the optimal CDNN-onto-Fog mapping. Finally, extensive numerical tests are presented, in order to test and compare the energy-vs.-implementation complexity-vs.-accuracy performance of the resulting optimized CDNN-over-Fog platforms under the IoT-oriented SVHN and FER-2013 datasets.}

abstract = {Big data collection practices using Internet of Things (IoT) pervasive technologies are often privacy-intrusive and result in surveillance, profiling, and discriminatory actions over citizens that in turn undermine the participation of citizens to the development of sustainable smart cities. Nevertheless, real-time data analytics and aggregate information from IoT devices open up tremendous opportunities for managing and regulating smart city infrastructures in a more efficient and sustainable way. The privacy-enhancing aggregation of distributed sensor data, such as residential energy consumption or traffic information, is the research focus and challenge tackled in this paper. Citizens have the option to choose their privacy level by reducing the quality of the shared data at a cost of a lower accuracy in data analytics services. A baseline scenario is considered in which IoT sensor data are shared directly with an untrustworthy central aggregator. A grouping mechanism is introduced that improves privacy by sharing data aggregated first at a group level compared to a baseline scenario in which each individual shares data directly to the central aggregator. Group-level aggregation obfuscates sensor data of individuals, in a similar fashion as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption schemes, thus inference of privacy-sensitive information from single sensors becomes computationally harder compared to the baseline scenario. The proposed system and its generic applicability are evaluated using real-world data from two smart city pilot projects. Privacy under grouping increases, while preserving the accuracy of the baseline scenario. Intra-group influences of privacy by one group member on the other ones are measured and fairness on privacy is found to be maximized between group members with similar privacy choices. Several grouping strategies are compared. Grouping by proximity of privacy choices provides the highest privacy gains. The implications of the strategy on the design of incentives mechanisms are discussed.}

abstract = {The identification of a favorable location for investment is a key aspect influencing the real estate market of a smart city. The number of factors that influence the identification easily runs into a few hundreds (including floor space area, crime in the locality and so on). Existing literature predominantly focuses on the analysis of price trends in a given location. This paper aims to develop a set of tools to compute an optimal location for investment, a problem which has received little attention in the literature (analysis of house price trends has received more attention). In previous work the authors proposed a machine learning approach for computing optimal locations. There are two main issues with the previous work. All real estate factors were assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables. To address this, in the current paper we propose a network structure to derive the relational inferences between the factors. However, solving the location identification problem using only a network incurs computational burden. Hence, the machine learning layers from the previous work is combined with a network layer for computing an optimal location with proven lower computational cost. A second issue is that the computations are performed on an online database which has inherent privacy risks. The online data, user information and the algorithms can be tampered through privacy breaches. We present a privacy preservation technique to protect the algorithms, and use blockchains to secure the identity of the user. This paper presents solutions to two interesting problems in the analysis of real estate networks: a) to design tools that can identify an optimal location for investment and b) to preserve the privacy of the entire process using privacy preserving techniques and block chains.}

Vehicles are one of the most important objects in cross-camera target recognition systems, and recognizing them is one of the most difficult tasks due to the subtle differences in the visible characteristics of vehicle rigid objects. Compared to various methods that can improve re-identification accuracy, data augmentation is a more straightforward and effective technique. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis method for V-ReID based on local-region perspective transformation, transformation state adversarial learning and a candidate pool. Specifically, we first propose a parameter generator network, which is a lightweight convolutional neural network, to generate the transformation states. Secondly, an adversarial module is designed in our work, it ensures that noise information is added as much as possible while keeping the labeling and structure of the dataset intact. With this adversarial module, we are able to promote the performance of the network and generate more proper and harder training samples. Furthermore, we use a candidate pool to store harder samples for further selection to improve the performance of the model. Our system pays more balanced attention to the features of vehicles. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly boosts the performance of V-ReID on the VeRi-776, VehicleID and VERI-Wild datasets.}

A key challenge for adopting these energy sources is their high integration costs. Artificial intelligence (AI) solutions and data-intensive technologies are already used in different parts of the electricity value chain and, due to the growing complexity and data generation potential of the future smart grid, have the potential to create significant value in the system. However, different uncertainties or lack of understanding about its impact often hinder the commitment of decision makers to invest in AI and data intensive technologies, also in the energy sector. While previous work has outlined a number of ways AI solutions can be used in the power sector, the goal of this article is to consider the value creation potential of AI in terms of managing VRE integration costs. We use an economic model of variable renewable integration cost from the literature to present a systematic review of how AI can decrease substantial integration costs. We review a number of use cases and discuss challenges estimating the value creation of AI solutions in the power sector.}

Whilst this was traditionally achieved by modelling self-engineering behaviours at the component-level, efforts are now being focused on the sub-system and system-level through advancements in artificial intelligence. Exploiting its benefits requires some innovative thinking to integrate overarching concepts from big data analysis, digitisation, sensing, optimisation, information technology, and systems engineering. With recent developments in Industry 4.0, machine learning and digital twin, there has been a growing interest in adapting these concepts to achieve autonomous maintenance; the automation of predictive maintenance scheduling directly from operational data and for in-built repair at the systems-level. However, there is still ambiguity whether state-of-the-art developments are truly autonomous or they simply automate a process. In light of this, it is important to present the current perspectives about where the technology stands today and indicate possible routes for the future. As a result, this effort focuses on recent trends in autonomous maintenance before moving on to discuss digital twin as a vehicle for decision making from the viewpoint of requirements, whilst the role of AI in assisting with this process is also explored. A suggested framework for integrating digital twin strategies within maintenance models is also discussed. Finally, the article looks towards future directions on the likely evolution and implications for its development as a sustainable technology.}

This paper proposes a fast and compact loop closure detection method (FastLCD) based on comprehensive descriptors and machine learning to achieve reliable and precise results using 3D point cloud for indoor LiDAR mobile mapping. Comprehensive descriptors proposed in this paper encode discriminative multimodality features to describe each scan of point clouds. The specific values of descriptors of point cloud scan pairs are fed into a machine learning model. We leverage the pre-trained learning model as a classifier to distinguish whether a pair of laser scans is a loop candidate. Then, to ensure the resultsâ precision, a novel double-deck loop candidate verification strategy is used to reject false positives. The algorithm is evaluated on datasets of some typical indoor environments. Compared with some state-of-the-art loop closure detection algorithms, the proposed FastLCD algorithm demonstrates superior performance in precision and recall rate. Moreover, the method proposed also exhibits high time efficiency, excellent generalization performance and insensitivity to threshold changes.}

abstract = {Human action recognition in videos is an active area of research in computer vision and pattern recognition. Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) based systems are needed for human-behavior assessment and security purposes. The existing action recognition techniques are mainly using pre-trained weights of different AI architectures for the visual representation of video frames in the training stage, which affect the featuresâ discrepancy determination, such as the distinction between the visual and temporal signs. To address this issue, we propose a bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) based attention mechanism with a dilated convolutional neural network (DCNN) that selectively focuses on effective features in the input frame to recognize the different human actions in the videos. In this diverse network, we use the DCNN layers to extract the salient discriminative features by using the residual blocks to upgrade the features that keep more information than a shallow layer. Furthermore, we feed these features into a BiLSTM to learn the long-term dependencies, which is followed by the attention mechanism to boost the performance and extract the additional high-level selective action related patterns and cues. We further use the center loss with Softmax to improve the loss function that achieves a higher performance in the video-based action classification. The proposed system is evaluated on three benchmarks, i.e., UCF11, UCF sports, and J-HMDB datasets for which it achieved a recognition rate of 98.3%, 99.1%, and 80.2%, respectively, showing 1%â3% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.}

Most cities and urban regions all over the world compete to increase resident and visitor satisfaction.

Real estate is one of the principal anthropogenic components of urban environment thus become a subject of thorough multidisciplinary analysis in the field of data requiring spatial information systems. Recent advances in information technology, combined with the increased availability of high-resolution imagery from Earth observation, create an opportunity to use new sources of data that enable to identify, monitor, and solved many of urban environmental problem. The aim of the paper is to elaborate precise, complete and detailed property information with the use of remote sensing observations in a suitable numerical algorithm. The authors concentrate on providing one of the most important, and probably the most lacking, feature describing properties â building usable floor area (BUFA). The solution is elaborated in the form of an automatic algorithm based on machine learning and computer vision technology related to LiDAR (big data), close range images with respect to spatial information systems requirements. The obtained results related to BUFA estimation in comparison to the state-of-the-art results are satisfactory and may increase the reliability of decision-making in investment, fiscal, registration and planning aspects.}

In this paper, we propose a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method to search a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) module for 3D indoor point cloud semantic segmentation. Specifically, we aim to automatically find an effective feature pyramid architecture as a feature fusion neck in a designed novel pyramidal search space covering all information communication paths for multi-level features. The searched FPN module, named SFPN, contains the most important connections among all the potential paths to fuse representations at different levels. Our proposed SFPN is generic and effective as well as capable to be added to existing segmentation networks to augment the segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and S3DIS show that consistent and remarkable gains of segmentation performance can be achieved by different classical networks combined with SFPN. Specially, PointNet++-SFPN achieves mIoU gains of 7.8% on ScanNet v2 and 4.7% on S3DIS, and PointConv-SFPN achieves 4.5% and 3.7% improvement respectively on the above datasets.}

It is a virtual machine based, an open source mobile platform that powers millions of smartphone and devices and even a larger no. of applications in its ecosystem. Surprisingly in a short lifespan, Android has also seen a colossal expansion in application malware with 99% of the total malware for smartphones being found in the Android ecosystem. Subsequently, quite a few techniques have been proposed in the literature for the analysis and detection of these malicious applications for the Android platform. The increasing and diversified nature of Android malware has immensely attenuated the usefulness of prevailing malware detectors, which leaves Android users susceptible to novel malware. Here in this paper, as a remedy to this problem, we propose an anti-malware system that uses customized learning models, which are sufficiently deep, and are âEnd to End deep learning architectures which detect and attribute the Android malware via opcodes extracted from application bytecodeâ. Our results show that Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTMs) neural networks can be used to detect static behavior of Android malware beating the state-of-the-art models without using handcrafted features. For our experiments in our system, we also choose to work with distinct and independent deep learning models leveraging sequence specialists like recurrent neural networks, Long Short Term Memory networks and its Bidirectional variation as well as those are more usual neural architectures like a network of all connected layers(fully connected), deep convnets, Diabolo network (autoencoders) and generative graphical models like deep belief networks for static malware analysis on Android. To test our system, we have also augmented a bytecode dataset from three open and independently maintained state-of-the-art datasets. Our bytecode dataset, which is on an order of magnitude large, essentially suffice for our experiments. Our results suggests that our proposed system can lead to better design of malware detectors as we report an accuracy of 0.999 and an F1-score of 0.996 on a large dataset of more than 1.8 million Android applications.}

Given n nodes and the distances between each pair of nodes, the COTSP in this paper aims to find the shortest possible tour with a traveling distance that starts from the depot (i.e., node 1) and visits each node exactly once without needing to return to the depot. As known, a cuboid has height, length, and depth and the COTSP defines its x, y, z coordinates as a cuboid corresponding to height, length, and depth. In addition to the traveling distance, the platform (building breakwaters) cost is measured by the z coordinates (depths) of the nodes/platforms that represent both the platforms below the sea level. Note that unlike the traditional TSP, it has a variable seed number and a variable number of nodes/platforms in each solution. The paper aims to find the Pareto front solutions by minimizing the traveling distance and platform cost of the infrastructures below the sea level simultaneously. We develop a multi-objective self-adaptive differential evolution (MOJDE) algorithm, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII), and a harmony search (MOHS) algorithm to solve the problem in such a way that we minimize the traveling distance while minimizing the platform cost simultaneously. All algorithms are compared to each other. The computational results show that the MOJDE and NSGAII algorithms outperform the MOHS algorithm in terms of commonly used performance measures from the literature.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of video image technology and fifth-generation mobile network technology, the automatic verification of mechanical water meters has become an increasingly important topic in smart cities. Although much research has been done on this subject, the efficiency and accuracy of existing water meter pointer reading technology can still be improved. This paper proposes a new water meter pointer reading recognition method based on target-key point detection. Our method consists of a target detection module and a key point detection module. The target detection module uses a modified YOLOv4-Tiny network to detect and classify the areas where the dials and pointers are located in water meter images with distinct characteristics. The key point detection module is used to detect the key point of the pointer image. In this module, the structure of the RFB-Net network is improved to introduce multiple layers of low-level feature information, therefore, it can make full use of the information between multi-scale feature layers for key point detection. In addition to, aiming at the problem of dial rotation, a method of establishing a right-angle coordinate system based on key point is proposed to realize pointer reading. The whole method proposed in this paper is compared to the Hough transform feature matching algorithm and traditional machine learning algorithms through experiments which test the detection and recognition of the water meter dial, pointer and key points. The experiment results show that the missed detection rate of the model in this paper is 1.88% and 1.07% for the dial region and the pointer region, respectively. And the accuracy rate reaches 98.68%, the average processing time per image is 0.37 s. This implies that the water meter inspection task is completed quickly and accurately with strong robustness. Thanks to the lightweight algorithm of our approach, the model can also be fully automated and easily deployed on mobile devices.}

This is attributable to the flexibility, and convenience of representing complex channel models. However, owing to the characteristics of deep neural networks (DNNs), as the AE learns the representation of the channel, overfitting limits its performance. In this paper, we propose RegAE, a regularized DNN architecture that overcomes the overfitting limitation in AEs and reduces their training complexity, which are characteristics of models with higher dimensions. We demonstrate that RegAE improves the block error rate (BLER) as compared with equivalent models from the literature. Thereby, it achieves a performance (1) better than that of a 4â7 rate Hamming code with a 16 phase-shift keying (16PSK) modulation under an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, (2) comparable to that of a 4â7 rate maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) with a EbâN0 range from 1 dB to 5 dB, and (3) equivalent to that of an uncoded binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation over a EbâN0 range from 0 dB to 10 dB.}

IoT and Multiple IoT scenarios are thus more and more studied. This paper represents a first attempt to investigate anomalies in a Multiple IoT scenario (MIoT). First, we propose a new methodological framework that can make future investigations in this research field easier, coherent, and uniform. Then, in the context of anomaly detection in an MIoT, we define the so-called âforward problemâ and âinverse problemâ. The definition of these problems allows the investigation of how anomalies depend on inter-node distances, the size of IoT networks, and the degree centrality and closeness centrality of anomalous nodes. The approach proposed herein is applied to a smart city scenario, which is a typical MIoT.

Four new empirical models are introduced and validated with experimental data. This work is focused on the prediction of monthly mean daily global solar radiation (GSR) for different cities in India with most influencing input parameters identified using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software. WEKA identifies month, latitude, maximum temperature and bright sunshine hours as the most influencing and relative humidity as the least influencing input parameter. SVM model with most influencing input parameter performs better than ANN and Empirical models. Exclusion of relative humidity does not affect the prediction accuracy. Therefore this work reduces the dimensionality of the data and improves the prediction accuracy. This work also attempts in assessing the solar energy potential of smart cities of Tamil Nadu, India using the SVM model. The predicted annual GSR varies from 17 to 22 MJ/m2/day which is precise enough for a wide range of solar applications.}

Due to the growing urbanization, industrialization, and transportation, this impact on the living and non-living components of the coastal area is expected to further increase in the coming years. Artificial intelligence based automation of the coastal monitoring, including data collection, analysis and decision making, provides real-time insights and opportunities for large-scale coastal management and governance. In this paper, a framework for autonomous litter surveying and human activity monitoring for governance intelligence in coastal eco-cyber-physical systems (ecoCystem) is presented. A large dataset of more than 20,000 images focused on smart coastal management is collected to model the real world scenarios. A combination of various artificial intelligence based methods are used for automatic detection and classification of various litter in the coastal environment. Furthermore, the proposed framework is capable of autonomous monitoring of humans activities and detection of illegal entry of vehicles and boats to the beach area. The accuracy of the proposed autonomous system is 87% for correct classification of fully visible litter and 95% for fully visible vehicles. The experimental results show that the application of computer vision and machine learning for autonomous litter classification shows promising results for increasing the speed and scale of litter surveying in the coastal area. Further training of the artificial intelligence models is necessary for increasing the accuracy of the proposed framework and real-world deployment in the coastal environment. The proposed human activity monitoring system can be used for autonomous coastal law enforcement and real-time and active protection of the coastal zones.}

The system architecture and its component technologies are described in addition to a mobile application use case. The technologies used in this paper have been used in the literature in the past. However, we have not found any work where all these technologies have been brought together to develop a mobile application that provides uniquely focused information on user mobility. Google Maps notifications could provide information about nearby road closure or other events where relevant. However, we propose to pull in and provide information to the users about their travel locally, nationally, and internationally. More importantly, relevant information is pulled in from multiple news media and other sources and provided to the user in multimedia formats including text, voice and video.}

Such reformation has initiated revolutions in various industries and is gradually reshaping our daily routines. Among these trends, the data-driven intelligentization in Urban Public Transportation Systems can bring the most significant impact to our society, because they provide pervasive reachability. Optimizing and constructing such systems, which requires deep insights into passenger behavioral patterns, is a highly domain-specific data mining task. Although computational infrastructures have provided sufficient processing capacity, the practical utilization of such data is facing several challenges: information alignment in heterogeneous data sources and information enrichment for domain-specific applications. In this article, we first propose a cross-domain method to increase the usability of data by removing the inconsistency in vehicles' positioning and passengers' transaction data. We then use rule-based methods to reconstruct latent mobility information, thereby enabling small grained trajectory based applications. Finally, we provide use cases using the reconstructed information to derive insights to the public transportation system of our target city. Our work can serve as a domain-specific information enrichment and data mining framework for CPS in smart cities.}

We use real-world traffic data from two locations (i.e., Los Angeles and London) with frequent fluctuations (due to proneness to traffic accidents and/or congestion) to train and test our model. For each location, we consider road segments with and without junctions (i.e., linear vs intersection). We compare our model against well-known existing machine/deep learning prediction models. Our results indicate that our ALLSCP model consistently achieves the most accurate predictions (â96% accuracy both on linear and intersection roadways) when compared against existing models in the literature. In addition, we conducted ablation experiments to further gain insights into the contributions of individual constituent models of our ensemble ALLSCP model.

In addition, the injected false data will ensure bypassing the existing water systemâs state-estimation and bad data detection methods, a condition that was not considered in previously developed attacks.

abstract = {Recently, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Cities have emerged as a potential business opportunity for most cloud service providers. However, centralized cloud architectures cannot sustain the requirements imposed by many IoT services. High mobility coverage and low latency constraints are among the strictest requirements, making centralized solutions impractical. In response, theoretical foundations of Fog Computing have been introduced to set up a distributed cloud infrastructure by placing computational resources close to end-users. However, the acceptance of its foundational concepts is still in its early stages. A key challenge still to answer is Service Function Chaining (SFC) in Fog Computing, in which services are connected in a specific order forming a service chain to fully leverage on network softwarization. Also, Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) have been getting significant attention. Opposed to traditional wireless technologies, LPWANs are focused on low bandwidth communications over long ranges. Despite their tremendous potential, many challenges still arise concerning the deployment and management of these technologies, making their wide adoption difficult for most service providers. In this article, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for the IoT service allocation problem is proposed, which takes SFC concepts, different LPWAN technologies and multiple optimization objectives into account. To the best of our knowledge, our work goes beyond the current state-of-the-art by providing a complete end-to-end (E2E) resource provisioning in Fog-cloud environments while considering cloud and wireless network requirements. Evaluations have been performed to evaluate in detail the proposed MILP formulation for Smart City use cases. Results show clear trade-offs between the different provisioning strategies. Our work can serve as a benchmark for resource provisioning research in Fog-cloud environments since the model approach is generic and can be applied to a wide range of IoT use cases.}

However, processing such unstructured point clouds is very challenging, epitomized by high cost, movable objects, limited object classes, and high information inadequacy/redundancy. We noticed that many city objects are not in random shapes; rather, they have invariant cross-sections following the Gestalt design principles, including proximity, connectivity, symmetry, and similarity. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised method, called Clustering Of Symmetric Cross-sections of Objects (COSCO), to process urban LiDAR point clouds to a hierarchy of objects based on their characteristic cross-sections. First, city objects are segmented as connected patches of proximate 3D points. Then, symmetric cross-sections are detected for symmetric city objects. Finally, the taxonomy and groups of city objects are recognized from a hierarchical clustering analysis of the dissimilarity matrix. Experimental results showed that COSCO detected the correct taxonomy and types of 12 cars from 24,126 LiDAR points in 8.28Â s. Based on the cross-sections and taxonomy, a digital twin was created by registering online free 3D car models in 29.58Â s. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents an effective unsupervised method for understanding and developing DTC objects in LiDAR point clouds by harnessing innate Gestalt design principles. Secondly, COSCO can be an efficient LiDAR pre-processing tool for recognizing symmetric city objectsâ cross-sections, positions, heading directions, dimensions, and possible types for smart city applications in GIScience, Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO), and autonomous vehicles.}

In this paper, patterns in harmonic waves of four manufacturing plants are analyzed in the time and frequency domain. For machine allocation, features were extracted and classified by k-means and support vector machines with an accuracy of 97.3 and 97.9%. For comparison, convolutional neural networks were trained with the harmonic profiles in the time domain with an accuracy of 98.7%.}

abstract = {While digital interconnectivity of smart cities has significantly enhanced the quality of life of residents, it has introduced cybersecurity challenges that may interrupt the operation of critical infrastructures. Water distribution systems are among the most critical infrastructures in smart cities that need to be secured against potential cyberattacks. False data injection cyberattacks in water distribution systems can be designed to bypass bad data detection algorithms, generating false measurements that ultimately lead to cascading failures. Developing models for these cyberattacks and analyzing them will elucidate hidden layers and tactics used to design the attacks, helping water systemsâ authorities to improve and upgrade state-estimation processes and detection algorithms accordingly. In this paper, a bi-level nonlinear optimization cyberattack model is proposed that will result in sequential tankâs overflow or fully withdrawn in less than three hours. The attack model is developed based upon injecting false data into the hourly measurements of the pump(s) feeding the tank, as well as the total demand of the network. By modifying a few estimation parameters in the neighborhood of the targeted tank, these false data injections are deliberately designed to bypass the existing water systemâs state-estimation and bad data detection methods.}

Doctors and patients are now using their smart-phones to control and monitor implantable medical devices (IMDs) such as cardiac implants, insulin pumps, deep brain neurostimulators, etc. via the Internet or Bluetooth connections. Although such connectivity expands the devicesâ ability to fulfill healing and diagnostic functions in a quick and cost-effective manner and can help save many lives, too much reliance on software also results in exposure to several security threats. Control of such devices via the underlying communication network may allow attackers to exploit the critical system vulnerabilities of these devices. Attackers could manipulate the settings of these devices and may try to harm the patients and these malicious attacks can originate from anywhere in the world. However, there have been very few real attempts to hack such devices and harm patients. We investigate the practical security risks involved with the use of IMDs and the motivations for an attacker to hack these devices. While some risks discussed in research are genuine and can be prevented using various security measures, it seems that quite a few risks are mere exaggerations. In our paper, we review the aspects mentioned above of IMDs and also outline some practical security measures that can further enhance the security and privacy for patients using IMDs.}

This question arises overtly amidst a pandemic, but it also lurks behind the widespread diffusion of smart energy systems throughout the world and the increased use of smart meters in those systems. The extent to which forms of monitoring, disciplining and sanctioning of energy behavior and practices could come to reality is thus an important question to consider.

Edge-fog computing has seen significant development in recent years and supports the association of various intelligent things with sensors for establishing smooth data transfer. However, it becomes challenging for edge-fog computing to tackle diverse IoHT settings such as efficient disease management, emergency response management, etc. The key limitation of existing architectures is the restricted scalability and inability to meet the demands of hierarchical computing environments for IoHT. This is because latency-sensitive applications often require large quantities of data to be measured and transferred to the data centers, which causes delay and reduced output. This research proposes a novel edge-fog computing framework for the convergence of machine learning ensemble with edge-fog computing. The proposed architecture delivers healthcare as a fog system that handles data from different sources to manage the diseases effectively. The proposed framework is used for the real-life implementation and automatic detection of gliomas diseases. Glioma is a kind of tumor, which ensues in the spinal cord and a portion of the brain. Glioma instigates in the glial cells that surround the nerve cells. The proposed edge-fog framework efficiently manages the real-time data related to gliomas. This framework is configured for specific operating modes including diverse edge-fog scenarios, different user requirements, quality of service, precision, and predictive accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated using real-time datasets from various sources and experimentally tested with reliable datasets that disclose the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of power consumption, latency, accuracy, and execution time, respectively.}

It will trigger a multi-fold increase in cooling demand, especially at a residential level, mitigation to which remains a policy and research gap. This study forwards a novel residential energy stress mitigation framework called REST to estimate warming climate-induced energy stress in residential buildings using a GIS-driven urban heat island and energy modelling approach. REST further estimates rooftop solar potential to enable solar photo-voltaic (PV) based decentralised energy solutions and establish an optimised routine for peer-to-peer energy sharing at a neighbourhood scale. The optimised network is classified through a decision tree algorithm to derive sustainability rules for mitigating energy stress at an urban planning scale. These sustainability rules established distributive energy justice variables in urban planning context. The REST framework is applied as a proof-of-concept on a future smart city of India, named Amaravati. Results show that cooling energy stress can be reduced by 80 % in the study area through sensitive use of planning variables like Floor Space Index (FSI) and built-up density. It has crucial policy implications towards the design and implementation of a national level cooling action plans in the future cities of the Global South to meet the UN-SDG â 7 (clean and affordable energy) and SDG â 11 (sustainable cities and communities) targets.}

In the society of smart-cities and Industry 4.0, where many cyberâphysical devices connect and exchange data through the Internet of Things, the need for addressing information security and solve system failures becomes inevitable. System failures can occur because of hardware failures, software bugs or interoperability issues. In this paper we introduce the industry-originated concept of âsmart-troubleshootingâ that is the set of activities and tools needed to gather failure information generated by heterogeneous connected devices, analyze them, and match them with troubleshooting instructions and software fixes. As a consequence of implementing smart-troubleshooting, the system would be able to self-heal and thus become more resilient. This paper aims to survey frameworks, methodologies and tools related to this new concept, and especially the ones needed to model, analyze and recover from failures in a (semi)automatic way. Smart-troubleshooting has a relation with event analysis to perform diagnostics and prognostics on devices manufactured by different suppliers in a distributed system. It also addresses management of appropriate product information specified in possibly unstructured formats to guide the troubleshooting workflow in identifying faultâcauses and solutions. Relevant research is briefly surveyed in the paper in order to highlight current state-of-the-art, open issues, challenges to be tackled and future opportunities in this emerging industry paradigm.}

Firstly, the acquired images are processed by sliding window technology to construct a bridge crack dataset. Then we propose a trainable context encoder network which uses the recurrent residual convolutional neural network (RRCNN) to improve the encoder structure to better extract low-level features. Additionally, it combines dense atrous convolution block (DAC) and residual multi-kernel pooling block (RMP) which can retain more crack information and features from the crack image, as well as improve the performance of crack segmentation. Finally, our research results are validated in the developed software platform. The experiments show that our method is more stable and accurate than other methods, its accuracy and mean intersection over union (mIoU) have reached 98.62% and 80.93%, respectively. Moreover, it performs well in cracks facing complex conditions, which can be applied to the bridge maintenance projects.}

abstract = {Edge Computing (EC) is a recent architectural paradigm that brings computation close to end-users with the aim of reducing latency and bandwidth bottlenecks, which 5G technologies are committed to further reduce, while also achieving higher reliability. EC enables computation offloading from end devices to edge nodes. Deciding whether a task should be offloaded, or not, is not trivial. Moreover, deciding when and where to offload a task makes things even harder and making inadequate or off-time decisions can undermine the EC approach. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, such as Machine Learning (ML), have been used to help EC systems cope with this problem. AI promises accurate decisions, higher adaptability and portability, thus diminishing the cost of decision-making and the probability of error. In this work, we perform a literature review on computation offloading in EC systems with and without AI techniques. We analyze several AI techniques, especially ML-based, that display promising results, overcoming the shortcomings of current approaches for computing offloading coordination We sorted the ML algorithms into classes for better analysis and provide an in-depth analysis on the use of AI for offloading, in particular, in the use case of offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing Networks, actually one technology that gained more relevance in the last years, enabling a vast amount of solutions for computation and data offloading. We also discuss the main advantages and limitations of offloading, with and without the use of AI techniques.}

However, our primary focus is on the quantitative evaluation of the amount of contextual information provided to the neural network. In particular, the information used to mimic the tacit information that a human is capable of using, like a sense of unambiguous order and the capability of improving its estimation by complementing already learned information. Our results show that, after a set of pre and post-processing methods applied to both the training data and the neural network architecture, the predictions made were drastically closer to the expected output in comparison to the cases where no contextual additions were provided.

abstract = {Knowledge about what transport mode people use is important information of any mobility or travel behaviour research. With ubiquitous presence of smartphones, and its sensing possibilities, new opportunities to infer transport mode from movement data are appearing. In this paper we investigate the role of spatial context of human movements in inferring transport mode from mobile sensed data. For this we use data collected from more than 8000 participants over a period of four months, in combination with freely available geographical information. We develop a support vectors machines-based model to infer five transport modes and achieve success rate of 94%. The developed model is applicable across different mobile sensed data, as it is independent on the integration of additional sensors in the device itself. Furthermore, suggested approach is robust, as it strongly relies on pre-processed data, which makes it applicable for big data implementations in (smart) cities and other data-driven mobility platforms.}

This new measure is a weighted Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method based on Gaussian probability function, named GWDTW, that reflects the relative importance of peak hours. We have shown its superior performance over two benchmark similarity measures, the Euclidean distance and conventional DTW measure, on the intersection clustering task using k-medoids clustering algorithm, with respect to both internal and external evaluation measures. With intensive evaluation, the results show that GWDTW is a very effective similarity measure for modelling traffic behaviours, which can provide policy makers with more valuable information for infrastructure design, and smart city development.}

This digital transformation is also characterised by a change of paradigm, based on moving from computer-aided technologies to Smart Systems, which are present in several domains such as Smart Cities, Smart Manufacturing, or Smart Services. In this scenario, the exploration of the conceptualisation of Smart Systems has been addressed in the scientific literature with the objective to understand the characteristics of such systems and the implications of their use. However, there is a lack of a generic view of the concept since most studies focus on specific domains. This view is necessary to provide common ground for the development or implementation of Smart Systems within various domains, specially for those that have not been tackled yet. This work aims at addressing this issue through the exploration and analysis of conceptualisations of Smart Systems and Smartness within the scientific literature. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review is performed aiming at gathering papers including definitions of Smart Systems, regardless of the application domain. Text mining processing techniques are applied to obtain insights from the definitions extracted from the collected papers. Considering the findings of the literature review and the analysis of the extracted definitions, we enumerate and describe a set of characteristics of Smart Systems. We also provide a diagrammatic view of the elements of a Smart System and their relationships through a meta-model.}

Though it has uplifted public health, yet the rise of chronic diseases is a concern in sustainable cities. In this work, a sustainable lung cancer detection model is developed to integrate the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) and computational intelligence, causing the least harm to the environment. IoHT unit retains connectivity continuously generates data from patients. Heuristic Greedy Best First Search (GBFS) algorithm is used to select most relevant attributes of lung cancer data upon which random forest algorithm is applied to classify and differentiates lung cancer affected patients from normal ones based on detected symptoms. It is observed during the experiment that the GBFS-Random forest model shows a promising outcome. While an optimal accuracy of 98.8 % was generated, simultaneously, the least latency of 1.16â¯s was noted. Specificity and sensitivity recorded with the proposed model on lung cancer data are 97.5 % and 97.8 %, respectively. The mean accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and f-score value recorded is 96.96 %, 96.26 %, 96.34 %, and 96.32 %, respectively, over various types of cancer datasets implemented. The developed smart and intelligent model is sustainable. It reduces unnecessary manual overheads, safe, preserves resources and human resources, and assists medical professionals in quick and reliable decision making on lung cancer diagnosis.}

Transfer learning is one of the practical solutions to reduce the data required for training, which tries to reuse learned knowledge for similar tasks. Nevertheless, many technical details of transfer learning implementation are not well documented. Therefore, in this work, two datasets collected from plastics manufacturing processes were studied to investigate different transfer learning approaches and implementation details for high-performance model building under the constraint of limited available training data. Different transfer learning implementations are compared and important technical details are also discussed in this study. Through this study, the minimum number of training samples can be estimated. Transfer learning is compared with the newly developed few-shot learning approach as a brief comparative study. Finally, this work summarizes practical guidelines for the development of image classification models with limited data resources.}

abstract = {In a data-rich digital world, our hand-held resource-constrained mobile devices are restricted to performing small-to-medium-level computation processes and are incapable of performing high-computation processes. Computation offloading is a suitable solution for overcoming this shortcoming. Until recently, we have perceived cloud computing as an appropriate computation-offloading platform for mobile devices. However, cloud data centers, being far-end networks for mobile devices, increase the latency or network delay, which in turn affects the performance of real-time mobile Internet-of-Things applications. Hence, for critical real-time applications, a near-end network approach of computation offloading is required. Furthermore, the major hurdles for geographically distributed mobile devices are mobility and heterogeneity in the process of computation offloading. To overcome these challenges, the use of a deep-learning-based response-time-prediction framework is proposed in this paper to determine whether to offload in the nearby fog/edge node or neighbor fog/edge node, or cloud node. Furthermore, a restricted Boltzmann machines learning is applied to tackle the randomness in the availability of resources. We simulate the proposed model in MATLAB while considering the mobility and fluctuating resource demands of the end users. Implementing our deep-learning-based response-time-prediction framework improves the performance of the computation offloading because it facilitates a prompt selection of the offloading location.}

abstract = {The increased adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the daily life of consumers have led towards the emergence of greener smart cities. However, the problem of energy stability, i.e., balancing the demand and supply, remains persistent in the context of charging stations (CSs). To solve this problem, a unique conceptual solution using EVs has been presented in this paper. The proposed solution deals with the problem of managing the miscellaneous power or power deficit at the CSs by utilizing EVs-as-a-service (EVaaS). On one hand, EVaaS provides opportunities to the owner of EVs to earn profit and on the other hand, it helps to balance the demand and supply at the CSs. This concept works in two steps; (1) EV-as-a-buyer: EVs act as energy buyers and CSs act as energy sellers, and (2) EV-as-a-seller: EVs act as energy sellers and CSs act as energy buyers. In EVaaS paradigm, the CSs are placed in residential, commercial, and industrial areas which broadcast their price for buying (or selling) the deficit (or excess) power from (or to) the EVs. The EVs would then decide whether to charge (or discharge) their battery power from (or at) which CSs based on the factors such asâprice and distance. If both the parties come to an agreement, then the EVs would travel to the specified location and exchange the energy with CSs. For the smooth movement of EVs in the smart city, a mobility model is also designed. In addition, this approach also utilizes the software defined networking (SDN) paradigm for enabling faster communication between the entities involved. For this purpose, a flow management scheme is designed for efficient data transfer between EVs and CSs. Through this study, it has been shown that such a strategy for energy trading would help the CSs to balance their load requirements as well as provide profit to the EV owners. The results prove that SDN improves the communication in terms of delay, throughput and network utilization over the conventional networks; while EVs can be successfully utilized to manage the load requirements of various CSs to gain a significant amount of profit.}

The feature used in this approach is the Mel spectrogram. Our approach is to define features from audio clips in the form of spectrogram images. The randomly selected CNN models used in this experiment are, a 7-layer or a 9-layer CNN learned from scratch. Also, various well-known deep learning structures with transfer learning and with a concept of freezing initial layers, training model, unfreezing the layers, again training the model with discriminative learning are considered. Three datasets, ESC-10, ESC-50, and Us8k are considered. As for the transfer learning methodology, 11 explicit pre-trained deep learning structures are used. In this study, instead of using those available data augmentation schemes for images, we proposed to have meaningful data augmentation by considering variations applied to the audio clips directly. The results show the effectiveness, robustness, and high accuracy of the proposed approach. The meaningful data augmentation can accomplish the highest accuracy with a lower error rate on all datasets by using transfer learning models. Among those used models, The ResNet-152 attained 99.04% for ESC-10 and 99.49% for Us8k datasets. DenseNet-161 gained 97.57% for ESC-50. From our understanding, they are the best-achieved results on these datasets.}

The computation of the traffic flows is based on processing video in the compressed domain. Only using motion vectors as input, traffic flow is computed in real-time over an embedded architecture. An estimation of the AQI is supported by machine learning regression techniques, using different feature data obtained from the IoT device. These automatic learning techniques overcome the need for complex calibration and other limitations of embedded devices in making the needed measurements of the pollutant gases for the computation of the actual AQI. The experimentation with the data obtained from different cities representing different scenarios with a variety of climate and traffic conditions, allows validating the proposed architecture. As regressors, Linear Regression (LR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Random Forest (RF) are compared using the performance metrics R2, MSE, MAE and MRE resulting in a relevant improvement of the AQI estimations of our proposal.}

Although urban water infrastructure (UWI) performs important functions in a city (e.g., supply of drinking water), information and communication technologies (ICT) and system-wide management of network-based UWI are not yet widely deployed. Therefore, this review summarises first both existing and potential applications related to network-based UWI, characterised by different spatial and temporal resolution of measurement and control data. Second, a comprehensive analysis of ICT is provided, which is extended with exemplary applications in the field. The analysis reveals that a coordination between intended application and usable communication technology is required to realise an efficient monitoring and control network in the field of UWI networks. To overcome this limitation, a detailed framework is developed, which can be used by researcher, network operators, and stakeholder to identify suitable communication technologies for different UWI applications or to determine possible applications for an existing ICT system. Following, the applicability of the framework is demonstrated by selected examples. As the framework also indicates, an integrated approach towards smart water cities requires the combination of different communication technologies to satisfy all specifications.}

These marked changes are motivated by the increased need to tackle the problematicity surrounding sustainable cities as quintessential complex systems in terms of their development planning, operational management, and fragmentary design strategies and technology solutions. That is to say, sustainable cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of big data technologies and their novel applications in an attempt to effectively deal with the complexities they inherently embody and to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainabilityâunder what has been termed âdata-driven smart sustainable cities.â This new area is a significant gap in and of itselfâas it is still in its infancyâthat this paper seeks to fill together with to what extent the integration of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism is addressed and what directions and forms it takes. Using a compelling evidence synthesis approach, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review of the flourishing field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. This study corroborates that big data technologies will change sustainable urbanism in fundamental and irreversible ways, bringing new and innovative ways of monitoring, understanding, analyzing, planning, and managing sustainable cities. It reveals that the evolving development planning approaches and operational management mechanisms enabled by data-driven technologies are of crucial importance to increase and maintain the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability in the face of urbanization. However, what smart urbanism entails and the way it functions raises several critical questions, including whether the policy and governance of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future will become too technocentric and technocratic respectively, but also with regard to other aspects of social and environmental sustainability. Addressing these important contemporary concerns is of equal importance in achieving the desired outcomes of sustainability. This review and critique of the existing work on the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism provides a valuable reference for scholars and practitioners and the necessary material to inform them of the latest developments in the burgeoning field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. In addition, by shedding light on the increasing adoption and uptake of big data technologies in sustainable urbanism, this study seeks to help policymakers and planners assess the pros and cons of smart urbanism when effectuating sustainable urban transformations in the era of big data, as well as to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on the topic.}

Currently, analysis of this data is typically achieved through centralised cloud-based services. However, according to many studies, this approach may present significant issues from the standpoint of data ownership, as well as wireless network capacity. In this paper, we exploit the fog computing paradigm to move computation close to where data is produced. We exploit a well-known distributed machine learning framework (Hypothesis Transfer Learning), and perform data analytics on mobile nodes passing by IoT devices, in addition to fog gateways at the edge of the network infrastructure. We analyse the performance of different configurations of the distributed learning framework, in terms of (i) accuracy obtained in the learning task and (ii) energy spent to send data between the involved nodes. Specifically, we consider reference wireless technologies for communication between the different types of nodes we consider, e.g. LTE, Nb-IoT, 802.15.4, 802.11, etc. Our results show that collecting data through the mobile nodes and executing the distributed analytics using short-range communication technologies, such as 802.15.4 and 802.11, allows to strongly reduce the energy consumption of the system up to 94% with a loss in accuracy w.r.t. a centralised cloud solution up to 2%.}

We discuss how âsmart citiesâ are beginning to invest in this area to improve the health of their populations; provide examples around model approaches for making large quantities of data available to researchers and clinicians among other stakeholders; discuss the current state of big data approaches to improve clinical care including specific examples, and then discuss some of the policy issues around and examples of successful regulatory approaches, including deidentification and privacy protection.}

abstract = {Audio carry a large amount of life scenes and physical events in the city, therefore, developing deep learning approach to automatically extract this information has huge potential and application in building smart-city. In this paper, a novel urban sound event classification model based on 2-order dense convolutional network using dual features is proposed, which aims at the problems of insufficient classification accuracy and adaptability of current models. Firstly, the brief introduction of urban sound classification development and application is presented in Section 1. Then, the method of feature extraction and add noise environment is respectively introduced in Section 2. Moreover, a new network structure referred to as 2-order dense convolutional network (shorten as 2-DenseNet) and its algorithm are presented in Section 3. Meanwhile, an urban sound event classification model based on 2-DenseNet using dual features, i.e. D-2-DenseNet is proposed in this paper. Theoretically, D-2-DenseNet not only can accelerate the convergence speed when compared with DenseNet, but also can enhance the classification accuracy and guarantee a good generalization ability owing to the fact that dual features fusion is exploited in the proposed model. Finally, in order to validate advantages of the D-2-DenseNet, this new model is respectively exploited in the urban sound event classification based on UrbanSound8K and Dcase2016 datasets. The experimental result shows that the accuracy of the network is respectively 84.83% and 85.17%, which has increase up to 13.81% and 7.07% compared with baseline. Compared with single feature network, the classification accuracy of D-2-DenseNet has increased by 3.35% and 4.78% respectively in noise environment.}

A coupled approach integrating satellite data products of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change along with chemical evaluation of As toxicity were modelled to evaluate the groundwater vulnerability. Change detection analysis was incorporated using the satellite images of 2013 and 2016 which shows 10 % increase in the buildings as compared to the total area of the study in given period. The LULC class that has been most compromised in this expansion and got reduced were the vegetation (â¼6 %) and the barren areas (â¼4 %) and the total surface water sources (0.5 %), all contributing in increased urban sprawl. As per the origin of As contamination in the area it seems that high sediment deposition along the braided Brahmaputra River stretch leads to As contamination which was associated with Fe-(oxy)-hydroxide dissolution. The vulnerability assessment using Artificial Neural Network technique in this region shows that As is present relatively in lesser concentration in the east direction. The continuous expansion of the urban habitation towards the greater As concentration zone will further make the situation critical for the people dependent on groundwater. The study suggests that prior settlement planning must be carried out in accordance to the presence of any toxic constituent in drinking water source to avoid future crisis for potable water.}

Nonetheless, difficulties in deploying and maintaining traditional wired sensors and managing vast amount of data collated from a dense array of wired sensors were fundamental drawbacks of using such systems. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) were thus introduced to overcome the noted shortcomings. However, the energy required to power WSNs has become an important concern due to battery limitations. Energy harvesting technologies have been developed to extend the lifetime of WSNs by addressing the energy constraint problem. Recently, a new generation of WSNs based on self-powered sensors have become a reality by bridging the gap between the harvested energy and the energy required for sensing, computation, storage, and communication. Self-powered sensors are increasingly being used and establishing themselves as promising solutions to conventional WSNs in civil infrastructure. This review paper summarizes the applications of self-powered sensors in civil infrastructure during the last decade. First, a general introduction to self-powered sensing and its significance in civil engineering are presented. Thereafter, various self-powered sensors currently used in civil engineering arena are reviewed. Finally, the advantages of deploying these sensors are presented, and future research trends for their innovative use are highlighted.}

XSS attack is one such security attack that supports the attacker to intrude into user's personal space. Therefore, this paper is focused on designing an approach that detects XSS attack in IoT network to protect the data privacy. It employs Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to detect the XSS attack payload after applying certain data preparation methods.

It is the first-of-its-kind survey paper to comprehensively review literature in both transportation engineering and AI for mixed traffic modeling. We will discuss state-of-the-art applications of AI-guided methods, identify opportunities and obstacles, and raise open questions. We divide the stage of AV deployment into four phases: the pure HVs, the HV-dominated, the AV-dominated, and the pure AVs. This paper is primarily focused on the latter three phases. Models used for each phase are summarized, encompassing game theory, deep (reinforcement) learning, and imitation learning. While reviewing the methodologies, we primarily focus on the following research questions: (1) What scalable driving policies are to control a large number of AVs in mixed traffic comprised of human drivers and uncontrollable AVs? (2) How do we estimate human driver behaviors? (3) How should the driving behavior of uncontrollable AVs be modeled in the environment? (4) How are the interactions between human drivers and autonomous vehicles characterized? We also provide a list of public datasets and simulation software related to AVs. Hopefully this paper will not only inspire our transportation community to rethink the conventional models that are developed in the data-shortage era, but also start conversations with other disciplines, in particular robotics and machine learning, to join forces towards creating a safe and efficient mixed traffic ecosystem.}

The emergence of deep learning has greatly promoted the development of anomaly detection and much remarkable work has been presented on this topic. However, the existing approaches for anomaly detection generally encounter problems such as insufficient utilization of motion patterns and instability on different datasets. To improve the performance of anomaly detection in surveillance video, we propose a framework based on bidirectional prediction, which predicts the same target frame by the forward and the backward prediction subnetworks, respectively. Then the loss function is constructed based on the real target frame and its bidirectional prediction frame. Furthermore, we also propose an anomaly score estimation method based on the sliding window scheme which focuses on the foregrounds of the prediction error map. The comparison with the state-of-the-art shows that the proposed model outperforms most competing models on different video surveillance datasets.}

This study explores the impact of Smart home dimensions on highly-educated students, drawn from what is known as the âdigital nativeâ population, one of the key components of the smart living concept. As digital natives are already engaged with the adoption of new technologies and sustainable development, we have postulated that they would be keen to use smart technologies in the home that could improve their daily life while preserving the environment. This study tests a scale developed to measure consumer perception of the Smart Home Concept (SHC) and the impact on âPerformance Expectancyâ and âHabitâ.

When associating with Software-Defined Networks (SDN), the deployment of IDSs can leverage the centralized control plane in SDN to support for large-scale network monitoring. However, machine learning-based IDSs themselves can be attacked and tricked by adversarial examples with additional perturbation from the original ones. It is vital to provide supplementary unknown traffic to evaluate and improve the resilience of IDS against variants of cyberattacks. Thus, this work explores the method of generating adversarial attack samples by Generative Adversarial Model (GAN) to deceive IDS. We propose DIGFuPAS, a framework can create attack samples which can bypass machine learning-based IDSs in SDN with the black-box manner. In this framework, instead of Vanilla GAN, we use Wassertein GAN (WGAN) to improve the ability of GAN convergence training. In addition, the strategy of preserving functional features of attack traffic is applied to maintain the operational aspect of adversarial attacks. Through our implementation and experiments on NSL-KDD and CICIDS2018 dataset, the decreased detection rate of black-box IDSs on adversarial attacks demonstrates that our proposed framework can make IDSs in SDN-enabled networks misclassify on GAN-based synthetic attacks. Also, we utilize DIGFuPAS as a tool for evaluating and improving the robustness of IDS by repetitively retraining classifiers from crafted network traffic flow.}

Such datasets often include sensitive information, yet most recommender systems are focusing on the modelsâ accuracy and ignore issues related to security and the usersâ privacy. Despite the efforts to overcome these problems using different risk reduction techniques, none of them has been completely successful in ensuring cryptographic security and protection of the usersâ private information. To bridge this gap, the blockchain technology is presented as a promising strategy to promote security and privacy preservation in recommender systems, not only because of its security and privacy salient features, but also due to its resilience, adaptability, fault tolerance and trust characteristics. This paper presents a holistic review of blockchain-based recommender systems covering challenges, open issues and solutions.

Current activity recognition techniques are using convolutional neural network (CNN) models with computationally complex classifiers, creating hurdles in obtaining quick responses for abnormal activities. To address these challenges in real-time surveillance, this paper proposes a lightweight deep learning-assisted framework for activity recognition. First, we detect a human in the surveillance stream using an effective CNN model, which is trained on two surveillance datasets. The detected individual is tracked throughout the video stream via an ultra-fast object tracker called the âminimum output sum of squared errorâ (MOSSE). Next, for each tracked individual, pyramidal convolutional features are extracted from two consecutive frames using the efficient LiteFlowNet CNN. Finally, a novel deep skip connection gated recurrent unit (DS-GRU) is trained to learn the temporal changes in the sequence of frames for activity recognition. Experiments are conducted over five benchmark activity recognition datasets, and the results indicate the efficiency of the proposed technique for real-time surveillance applications compared to the state-of-the-art.}

abstract = {This paper reviews big data and Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications in smart environments. The aim is to identify key areas of application, current trends, data architectures, and ongoing challenges in these fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first systematic review of its kind, that reviews academic documents published in peer-reviewed venues from 2011 to 2019, based on a four-step selection process of identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion for the selection process. In order to examine these documents, a systematic review was conducted and six main research questions were answered. The results indicate that the integration of big data and IoT technologies creates exciting opportunities for real-world smart environment applications for monitoring, protection, and improvement of natural resources. The fields that have been investigated in this survey include smart environment monitoring, smart farming/agriculture, smart metering, and smart disaster alerts. We conclude by summarizing the methods most commonly used in big data and IoT, which we posit to serve as a starting point for future multi-disciplinary research in smart cities and environments.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology at the beginning of the 21st century, the traditional transportation system is rapidly transforming to Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Meanwhile, as a powerful optimization tool for the applicationsâ performance under the framework of ITS, the traffic prediction model has gained much attention. The traffic prediction model belongs to the traditional time series prediction model, widely used in industry for business analysis, abnormalities detection, etc. There are two main categories of traffic prediction models â the parametric model and the non-parametric model. The non-parametric model develops rapidly in recent years due to the machine learning theoryâs maturing and increment in computing power. Compared to the parametric model, the non-parametric model is more accurate and requires less advanced analysis of traffic patternsâ correlation, and can better handle a large amount of historical data. However, the non-parametric model also requires more powerful devices for training and implementation. The traffic prediction systemâs implementation environment, built by on-road resources and off-road infrastructures, is relatively limited compared to the traditional data center. This paper uses several well-known state-of-the-art non-parametric models and their Deep Learning structures for traffic prediction, and evaluates the modelsâ performance on both freeway and urban-road dataset. Focusing on the modelâs accuracy and training cost while deploying prediction models in a large-scale traffic network, this paper provides a novel optimized training strategy called CTS to reduce the implementation cost of a complex inner structure model. This approach could be further used to reduce the deployment cost, especially the training time, for the big data intelligent system using machine learning.}

Security experts have predicted that the development of 5G technology will increase the frequency and the vector of DDoS attacks. Moreover, enhanced DDoS attack technology utilises artificial intelligence [1], which will escalate the level of difficulty to identify malicious traffic correctly to mitigate the attack effectively. The Internet service provider (ISP) is the connector between the users and the Internet. Deploying DDoS mitigation systems within the ISP domain can offer an efficient solution. Therefore, we propose a dynamic learning system (DLS) for the ISP. The DLS is an unsupervised ensemble model using the Complete Autoencoder (CA) as base learners to classify network traffic. The utmost difference between the CA and the regular Autoencoder is that the CA exploits the imbalanced characteristic of the attack data to generate a binary classification via a class switch. When the predicted number of normal IP addresses is over 50% of the total IP addresses, the CA swaps the class of the IP addresses. The CA is directed by a reference object (RO), which is either a reference limit or the mean of a reference error function (RL1Â¯), to furnish the automation to the DLS. The DLS was trained with a TCP-ICMP flood attack and tested with a UDP-TCP and a UDP-TCP-ICMP flood attack data set. The average Recall, Precision and F1 Score are all above 0.97. Additionally, the DLS outperformed the K-means and the Self-Organising Map models on a UDP flood attack data set.}

In this paper, we propose a DDoS mitigation framework for IoT using fog computing to ensure fast and accurate attack detection. The fog provides resources for effective deployment of the mitigation framework, this solves the deficits in resources of the resource-constrained IoT devices. The mitigation framework uses an anomaly-based intrusion detection method and a database. The database stores signatures of previously detected attacks while the anomaly-based detection scheme utilizes k-NN classification algorithm for detecting the DDoS attacks. By using a database containing the attack signatures, attacks can be detected faster when the same type of attack is executed again. The evaluations using a DDoS based dataset show that the k-NN classification algorithm proposed for our framework achieves a satisfactory accuracy in detecting DDoS attacks.}

The performance metrics indicated that the NCP yielded the most accurate predictive performance accounting for an improvement compared to other neural methods accounting for 27%â30%.

Selected aspects of the platform, which covers the Glasgow, UK, city-region, are available to other researchers, and allows knowledge discovery on critical urban living themes, for example in transportation, lifelong learning, sustainable behavior, social cohesion, ways of being in a digital age, and other topics. It further allows research into the technological and methodological aspects of emerging forms of urban data. Key highlights of the platform include a multi-topic household and person-level survey; travel and activity diaries; a privacy and personal device sensitivity survey; a rich set of GPS trajectory data; accelerometer, light intensity and other personal environment sensor data from wearable devices; an image data collection at approximately 5-second resolution of participantsâ daily lives; multiple forms of text-based and multimedia Internet data; high resolution satellite and LiDAR data; and data from transportation, weather and air quality sensors. We demonstrate the power of the platform in understanding personal behavior and urban patterns by means of three examples: an examination of the links between mobility and literacy/learning using the household survey, a social media analysis of urban activity patterns, and finally, the degree of physical isolation levels using deep learning algorithms on image data. The analysis highlights the importance of purposefully designed multi-construct and multi-instrument data collection approaches that are driven by theoretical frameworks underpinning complex urban challenges, and the need to link to policy frameworks (e.g., Smart Cities, Future Cities, UNESCO Learning Cities agendas) that have the potential to translate data to impactful decision-making.}

Accurate prediction of passenger demands is an essential step towards rescheduling resources to resolve the above challenges. However, existing work cannot fully capture and leverage the complex nonlinear spatialâtemporal relationships within multi-modal data. They either include excessive data from weakly-correlated regions or oversight the correlations among those similar yet geographically distant regions. Moreover, these methods mainly focus on predicting the passenger demand for one future time step, whereas predictions over longer time scales are more valuable for developing efficient vehicle deployment strategies. We propose an end-to-end deep learning based framework to solve the above challenges. Our model comprises three parts: (1) a cascade graph convolutional recurrent neural network to extract spatialâtemporal correlations within citywide historical vehicle demand data; (2) two multi-layer LSTM networks to represent the external meteorological data and time meta separately; (3) an encoderâdecoder module to fuse the above two parts and decode the representation to achieve prediction over a longer time period into the future. We evaluate our framework on three real-world datasets and show that our model can better capture the spatialâtemporal relationships and outperform the most discriminative state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {In this work, we propose a deep learning framework for the classification of COVID-19 pneumonia infection from normal chest CT scans. In this regard, a 15-layered convolutional neural network architectureÂ is developed which extracts deep features from the selected image samples â collected from the Radiopeadia. Deep features are collected from two different layers, global average pool and fully connected layers, which are later combined using the max-layer detail (MLD) approach. Subsequently, a Correntropy technique is embedded in the main design to select the most discriminant features from the pool of features. One-class kernel extreme learning machine classifier isÂ utilized for the final classification to achieving an average accuracy of 95.1%, and the sensitivity, specificityÂ & precision rate of 95.1%, 95%, & 94% respectively. To further verify our claims, detailed statistical analyses based on standard error mean (SEM) is also provided, which proves the effectiveness of our proposed prediction design.}

abstract = {Video Synopsis is a smart and efficient solution to summarize a long duration of surveillance video into short. Most of the video synopsis techniques are not suitable to address complex situations like changes in illumination, dynamic background, camera jitter, etc. These techniques firmly depend on the preprocessing results of foreground extraction and multiple objects tracking. Further, the optimization process is a vital phase for the decrement of collision rate among moving objects, where the widely used Simulated Annealing (SA) usually suffers from the issue of slow convergence rate with a high computational overhead. Taking these aforementioned facts into account for feature extraction, we formulate a foreground extraction scheme exploring the concept of multi-frame and multi-scale in Generative Adversarial Network (mFS-GANs). Further, an optimization algorithm is proposed through the hybridization of SA and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), named as, HGWOSA to ensure global optimal result with a low computing overhead. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through extensive simulations and compared with that of the benchmark schemes. The experiments are carried out using some standard surveillance video dataset (ChangeDetection.Net, MIT Surveillance Dataset, and UMN Dataset) and one self-generated surveillance video at IIIT Bhubaneswar. Overall analysis and experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the other competing schemes in terms of both the quantitative and qualitative measures. Finally, the proposed model can be substantially employed in the generation of off-line video synopsis, which is potentially applicable to video surveillance applications for smart cities.}

abstract = {Major advances in telecommunications and the Internet of Things have given rise to numerous smart city scenarios in which smart services are provided. What was once a dream for the future has now become reality. However, the need to provide these smart services quickly, efficiently, in an interoperable manner and in real time is a cutting-edge technological challenge. Although some software architectures offer solutions in this area, these are often limited in terms of reusability and maintenance by independent modules âinvolving the need for system downtime when maintaining or evolving, as well as by a lack of standards in terms of the interoperability of their interface. In this paper, we propose a fully reusable microservice architecture, standardized through the use of the Web of things paradigm, and with high efficiency in real-time data processing, supported by complex event processing techniques. To illustrate the proposal, we present a fully reusable implementation of the microservices necessary for the deployment of the architecture in the field of air quality monitoring and alerting in smart ports. The performance evaluation of this architecture shows excellent results.}
