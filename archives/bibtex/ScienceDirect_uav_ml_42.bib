abstract = {Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) form a large and important part of the logistic transport systems in today's industry. They are used on a large scale, especially in Europe, for over a decade. Current employed AGV systems and current systems offered by global manufacturers almost all operate under a form of centralized control: one central controller controls the whole fleet of AGVs. The authors do see a trend towards decentralized systems where AGVs make individual decisions favoring flexibility, robustness, and scalability of transportation. Promoted by the paradigm shift of Industry 4.0 and future requirements, more research is conducted towards the decentralization of AGV-systems in academia while global leading manufacturers start to take an active interest. That said, this implementation seems still in infancy. Currently, literature is dominated by central as well as by decentral control techniques and algorithms. For researchers in the field and for AGV developers, it is hard to find structure in the growing amount of algorithms for various types of applications. This paper is, to this purpose, meant to provide a good overview of all AGV-related control algorithms and techniques. Not only those that were used in the early stages of AGVs, but also the algorithms and techniques used in the most recent AGV-systems, as well as the algorithms and techniques with high potential.}

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the multiple traveling salesman problem (MTSP) with the minmax objective, which includes more than one salesman to serve a set of cities while minimizing the maximum distance traveled by any salesman. For this problem, we have proposed a novel memetic algorithm, which integrates with a sequential variable neighborhood descent that is a powerful local search procedure to exhaustively search the areas near the high-quality solutions. However, there are some inefficient neighborhoods in the existing sequential variable neighborhood descent for the minmax MTSP, which could restrict the search performance. Therefore, we have redefined a new neighborhood sequence where only the neighborhoods that move cities from one tour to another unidirectionally are considered. Computational experiments on a wide range of benchmark problems within an acceptable time limit show that compared with six existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm is better than the other algorithms in terms of three aspects, including the precision, the robustness and the convergence speed. Meanwhile, we have also investigated the total distance traveled by all the salesmen when optimizing the minmax objective, and the results show that in comparison with the six existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm has a better or at least competitive capacity to maintain the total distance as short as possible. Furthermore, two kinds of statistical tests are utilized to examine the significance of the presented results, indicating the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the other algorithms on the minmax objective.}

abstract = {In the last two decades, airborne laser scanning (ALS) has found widespread application and driven fundamental advances in the Earth sciences. With increasing availability and accessibility, multi-temporal ALS data have been used to advance key research topics related to dynamic Earth surface processes. This review presents a comprehensive compilation of existing applications of ALS change detection to the Earth sciences. We cover a wide scope of material pertinent to the broad field of Earth sciences to encourage the cross-pollination between sub-disciplines and discuss the outlook of ALS change detection for advancing scientific discovery. While significant progress has been made in applying repeat ALS data to change detection, numerous approaches make fundamental assumptions that limit the full potential of repeat ALS data. The use of such data for 3D change detection is, therefore, in need of novel, scalable, and computationally efficient processing algorithms that transcend the ever-increasing data density and spatial coverage. Quantification of uncertainty in change detection results also requires further attention, as it is vitally important to understand what 3D differences detected between epochs represent actual change as opposed to limitations in data or methodology. Although ALS has become increasingly integral to change detection across the Earth sciences, the existence of pre- and post-event ALS data is still uncommon for many isolated hazard events, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and landslides. Consequently, data availability is still a major limitation for many ALS change detection applications.}

Although GPSs are very useful, they have some drawbacks in urban applications that affect their accuracy. Visual odometry is an alternative or complementary method because provides the ego motion of the vehicle with enough accuracy and uses a sensor already available in some vehicles for other tasks, so no extra sensor is needed. In this paper, a new method is proposed that detects and tracks features available on the surface of the ground, due to the texture of the road or street and road markings. This way it is assured only static points are taken into account in order to obtain the relative movement between images. A Kalman filter improves the estimations and the Ackermann steering restriction is applied so the vehicle follows a constrained trajectory, which improves the camera displacement estimation obtained from a PnP algorithm. Some results and comparisons in real urban environments are shown in order to demonstrate the good performance of the algorithm. They show the method is able to estimate the linear and angular speeds of the vehicle with high accuracy as well as its ability to follow the real trajectory drove by the vehicle along long paths within a minimum error.}

Then, a decentralised state feedback sliding mode control is proposed to drive interconnected systems to the designed sliding surface in finite time, and sliding motion occurs thereafter. The bounds on the uncertainties and interconnections are known nonlinear functions, which are employed in the control design to reject the effects of uncertainties and unknown interconnections to enhance the robustness.

This delay can be disastrous in time-sensitive industrial IoT deployments where immediate detection and actions impact security, safety, and machine failures. With an efficient MAC protocol, data will be provided quickly to enable the IoT to be fully effective for mission-critical applications. Efficient medium sharing is even more difficult in IIoT due to ultra-low latency, high reliability, and high quality of service (QoS) compared to best-effort for IoT. This article does not survey all existing MAC protocols for IoTs, which was already done in other works. The goal of this paper is to analyze existing MAC protocols that are more suitable for IIoT.}

Its criticality has raised its extraction since the beginning of the XX Century, which means an increase in mining activity and a higher pressure on natural resources. In this context, D-Miner Project initiated an investigation on how to enhance the sustainability of mining, incorporating new technologies to ease the localization of minerals with a minor environmental impact. This article focuses on the outcome of using remote sensing technology for mining exploration, endowing a drone with gadgets to recover spectral information about the mineral.

abstract = {Evaluation of seismic reflection data has identified the presence of fluid escape structures cross-cutting overburden stratigraphy within sedimentary basins globally. Seismically-imaged chimneys/pipes are considered to be possible pathways for fluid flow, which may hydraulically connect deeper strata to the seabed. The properties of fluid migration pathways through the overburden must be constrained to enable secure, long-term subsurface carbon dioxide (CO2) storage. We have investigated a site of natural active fluid escape in the North Sea, the Scanner pockmark complex, to determine the physical characteristics of focused fluid conduits, and how they control fluid flow. Here we show that a multi-scale, multi-disciplinary experimental approach is required for complete characterisation of fluid escape structures. Geophysical techniques are necessary to resolve fracture geometry and subsurface structure (e.g., multi-frequency seismics) and physical parameters of sediments (e.g., controlled source electromagnetics) across a wide range of length scales (m to km). At smaller (mm to cm) scales, sediment cores were sampled directly and their physical and chemical properties assessed using laboratory-based methods. Numerical modelling approaches bridge the resolution gap, though their validity is dependent on calibration and constraint from field and laboratory experimental data. Further, time-lapse seismic and acoustic methods capable of resolving temporal changes are key for determining fluid flux. Future optimisation of experiment resource use may be facilitated by the installation of permanent seabed infrastructure, and replacement of manual data processing with automated workflows. This study can be used to inform measurement, monitoring and verification workflows that will assist policymaking, regulation, and best practice for CO2 subsurface storage operations.}

Department of Transportation's (DDOT) field inventory. We classify the 19 most abundant tree species with an overall accuracy of 61.3% and classify the ten most abundant genera with an overall accuracy of 73.7%. We observe that (1) there are larger declines in accuracy when attempting to classify species in the same genus, and (2) the most valuable phenological period is fall senescence for classification at different taxonomic levels. Especially if satellite data can be matched to the key pheno-phases, our study highlights that current VHR satellite sensors now have the radiometric, spectral, and spatial resolution to potentially help manage species-rich urban forests.}

Distinct from the former results, the cooperative encirclement hunting guidance laws are based on the leader-follower coordination structure, and are divided into two parts. Firstly, for the leader flight vehicle, a full-head-on interception guidance law is proposed against the maneuvering target, where the uncertain dynamics and the target's unknown maneuver are estimated and compensated by using an extended state observer. For the follower flight vehicles, the distributed time-varying encirclement hunting line of sight angle formation tracking laws with overload saturation are designed where distributed extended state observers are introduced to approximate the complicated uncertain items and the leader vehicle's input signals. Then, the design processes of cooperative encirclement hunting guidance laws are summarized within five steps as an algorithm. Thirdly, the stability and the properties of the proposed cooperative encirclement hunting guidance algorithm are analyzed by employing Lyapunov theories. Finally, numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of achieved cooperative encirclement hunting guidance strategies.}

It mainly deals with how to allocate many unresolved tasks to groups of agents in a distributed manner. In this paper, we propose a distributed parallel multi-task allocation algorithm among self-organizing and self-learning agents. To tackle the situation, we disperse agents and tasks geographically in two-dimensional cells, and then introduce profit sharing learning (PSL) for a single agent to search its tasks by continual self-learning. We also present strategies for communication and negotiation among agents to allocate real workload to every tasked agent. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with Shehory and Kraus' distributed task allocation algorithm which were discussed by many researchers in recent years. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can quickly form a solving coalition for every task. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can specifically tell us the real workload of every tasked agent, and thus can provide a specific and significant reference for practical control tasks.}

abstract = {Floating structures oscillate in waves, where these wave-induced motions may be critical for various marine operations. An important consideration is thereby given to the sea states at the planning and operating stages for an offshore project. The most important information extracted from a sea state is the directional wave spectrum, indicating wave direction, significant wave height, and wave spectrum peak period. Among several available methods of measuring and estimating the directional wave spectrum, the wave buoy analogy technique based on vessel motion responses is an in situ and almost real-time solution without extra costs of devices. If the forms of the wave spectra are not predefined in the estimation, the method is called a nonparametric approach. Its most remarkable advantage is the flexible form, but the smoothness should be regulated. After the discrete Fourier transform has been applied to the measured vessel motions, smoothing is necessary. However, this process results in disturbed vessel cross-spectra and a lowpass characteristic of the windowing function. This paper presents a nonparametric approach for directional wave spectrum estimation based on vessel motion responses. It introduces novel smoothness constraints using Bézier surface and includes a more robust estimate using L1 optimization. Both techniques are applied to the wave buoy analogy for the first time. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the proposed algorithm.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a dynamic mobile ad hoc network (MANET) management system to improve network connectivity by using controlled network nodes, called agents. Agents have predefined wireless communication capabilities similar to the other nodes in the MANET, however their movements, and thus their locations, are dynamically determined to optimize network connectivity. A new approach to measuring connectivity using a maximum flow formulation is proposed – this is both responsive and tractable. Furthermore, users’ locations are predicted for several time steps ahead and this is shown to improve network connectivity over the network operation period. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm uses the maximum flow objective to choose optimal locations of the agents during each time step of network operation. The proposed MANET management system is rigorously tested on numerous static and dynamic problems. Computational results show that the proposed approach is effective in improving the connectivity of MANETs and predicting movements of user nodes and deploying agents accordingly significantly improves the overall performance of a MANET.}

abstract = {Although multispectral images acquired during the summer season have been used extensively in impervious surface extraction with relatively high accuracy, the area of impervious surface extracted is generally underestimated. In this study, a quantitative comparison of urban impervious surface extraction was conducted using WorldView-2 images of the summer and winter seasons over two urban areas in a temperate region of Northern China. A hierarchical object-based classification method was adopted to extract urban impervious surfaces. The results showed that the impervious surface extraction from the winter image achieved an accuracy comparable with that from the summer image. However, the area of impervious surface extracted from the winter image was much greater than that from the summer image, which was mainly attributed to seasonal variations of deciduous trees. Therefore, winter images are recommended for impervious surface mapping in temperate regions using very high resolution images.}

abstract = {The paper is concerned with the distributed optimization problem (DOP) for a class of uncertain multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear multi-agent systems with arbitrary relative degree. The target is to design distributed control laws such that the outputs of the agent systems converge to a consensus value and on which the sum of the local cost functions is minimized. By introducing pseudo gradient technique, internal model technique and adaptive control technique, a novel state based distributed control law is firstly constructed. An incremental type Lyapunov function based approach is presented to show that the proposed DOP is solved by the state based control law without requiring the eigenvalue information of Laplacian matrix. By further introducing distributed high-gain observer technique, an output based distributed control law is constructed and by which the DOP is solved under some mild assumption. The proposed control laws are validated on a group of Euler-Lagrange systems, a group of robot manipulators with flexible joints and a group of Chua circuit systems. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}

The robustness of the community is critical to its performance. Using the complex network modeling method, the knowledge collaboration network of the community is formulated, and the robustness of the network is systematically and dynamically studied. The characteristics of the network along the development period determine that its robustness should be studied from three time stages: the start-up, development and mature stages of the network. Five kinds of user-loss pattern are designed, to assess the network’s robustness under different situations in each of these three time stages. Two indexes – the largest connected component and the network efficiency – are used to evaluate the robustness of the community. The proposed approach is applied in an existing open source car design community. The results indicate that the knowledge collaboration networks show different levels of robustness in different stages and different user loss patterns. Such analysis can be applied to provide protection strategies for the key users involved in knowledge dissemination and knowledge contribution at different stages of the network, thereby promoting the sustainable and stable development of the open source community.}

This paper presents a novel maintenance optimization strategy for multi-component systems that uses local prognostic control to improve health statue of operating systems at component-level and solves a global optimal problem to find proper maintenance interval at system-level, the combination of which can increase maintenance economy effectively. The proposed strategy can be demonstrated by a case study of braking system of rail vehicles.

As vehicle's acceleration could produce damping attitude errors, the horizontal outputs from accelerometers are firstly used to judge the vehicle's motion so as to determine whether the damping attitudes could be reasonably applied. This article also analyzes the limitation of this approach. Furthermore, it suggests a residual chi-square test to judge the validity of damping attitude measurement in real time, and accordingly puts forward proper information fusion strategy.

Furthermore, BSO algorithm has good ability in exploring the search space by clustering the solutions and searching in each cluster independently, thus leading to slow convergence speed, to enhance the local intensification capability and to overcome the slow convergence of the BSO algorithm, we introduce Late Acceptance Hill Climbing (LAHC) with three neighborhoods to the BSO algorithm. Extensive computational experiments were carried out on four well-known benchmarks for FJSSP, and the performance of the BSO algorithm was compared with that of the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the BSO algorithm.

The selection of the reference vertical navigation speeds and altitudes was solved as a discrete combinatory problem by means of a graph-tree passing through nodes using the beam search optimization technique. To achieve a compromise between the execution time and the algorithm’s ability to find the global optimal solution, a heuristic methodology introducing a parameter called “optimism coefficient was used in order to estimate the trajectory’s flight cost at every node. The optimal trajectory cost obtained with the developed algorithm was compared with the cost of the optimal trajectory provided by a commercial flight management system(FMS). The global optimal solution was validated against an exhaustive search algorithm(ESA), other than the proposed algorithm. The developed algorithm takes into account weather effects, step climbs during cruise and air traffic management constraints such as constant altitude segments, constant cruise Mach, and a pre-defined reference lateral navigation route. The aircraft fuel burn was computed using a numerical performance model which was created and validated using flight test experimental data.}

First, a fault isolability evaluation index is defined as the worst-case probability of correct FI in different faulty scenarios, and a new objective function is proposed for the integrated design of parity space-based residual generator, evaluation logic and fault isolability properties. Based on this, the FI problem is formulated as a bank of optimal multiclass classification problems. Next, using the technique of minimum error minimax probability machine (MEMPM), a group of feasible parity space matrices for residual generation are obtained. Furthermore, the FI method by MEMPM is presented with a desirable trade-off between the fault isolability properties in different faulty scenarios. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a satellite attitude control system subject to six faults is considered.}

A drone acts on the world, and is therefore a robot. The remote pilots, and the operators of drone facilities such as cameras, depend on high-tech tools that interpret data that display transmitted, enhanced and generated image and video, and that enable the composition of commands. So drone operators are already cyborgs. Many drones carry cameras and are used for surveillance. Computing, data communications, robotics, cyborgisation and surveillance offer power and possibilities, but with them come disbenefits and risks.

The recent developed Building Information Modelling (BIM) technique combines 3D modelling and information management. One of its modern application is heritage documentation and has generated a new concept of Historic/Heritage Building Information Modelling (HBIM). This paper summarises the applications of these information techniques on the built heritage documentation. We utilise Web of Science Collection to monitor the publications on built heritage documentation. We analyse the research trend in heritage modelling by comparing the attention paid by researchers before and during the 2010s. The results show that photogrammetry is always the most popular method in heritage modelling. More and more works in heritage modelling have begun to use laser scanning, computer science, GIS and especially BIM techniques. Ontologies and 3D computer graphics are traditional ways for heritage documentation. Moreover, we pay attention to the roles of BIM on heritage documentation and conduct a detailed discussion on how to extend the HBIM capabilities by integrating with other techniques. The integration provides possible enhanced functions in HBIM, including accurate parametric modelling from computer graphics, automatic semantic segmentation of 3D point cloud from reality-based modelling, spatial information management and analysis by GIS, and knowledge modelling by ontology.}

In order to efficiently resist such a strong attack, a novel chaos and compressive sensing based image encryption algorithm is presented in this work. Firstly, the original plaintext image is compressed via Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Partially Known Support (OMP-PKS) and then the compressed image is confused and diffused using TD-ERCS and Skew-tent chaotic maps, respectively. Correlation among the compressed pixels is break down via confusing the image pixels using Tangent Delay Ellipse Reflecting Cavity Map System (TD-ERCS). Skew-tent chaotic map is employed for the pixel diffusion process. To get the final ciphertext image, the confused pixels are further changed through bitwise XORed operation via random matrix. For the sake of higher security, the initial conditions of chaotic maps are made dependent on the plaintext image and the parameters are computed via SHA-512. Furthermore, to decrease the transmission bandwidth, the measurement matrix is generated via Beta chaotic map. Instead of sending the whole measurement matrix, the sender will just send the Beta chaotic map initial conditions and control parameters (key) values along with the compressed ciphertext. The reliability and robustness of the designed image compression and encryption scheme are verified via experimental analysis and simulation results. All the experimental and simulation results are in favor of the proposed scheme.}

This study introduces data needs, data standards, and data sources to develop city building datasets for UBEM. First, a literature review of data needs for UBEM was conducted. Then, the capabilities of the current data standards for city building datasets were reviewed. Moreover, the existing public data sources from several pioneer cites were studied to evaluate whether they are adequate to support UBEM. The results show that most cities have adequate public data to support UBEM; however, the data are represented in different formats without standardization, and there is a lack of common keys to make the data mapping easier. Finally, a case study is presented to integrate the diverse data sources from multiple city departments of San Francisco. The data mapping process is introduced and discussed. It is recommended to use the unique building identifiers as the common keys in the data sources to simplify the data mapping process. The integration methods and workflow are applied to other U.S. cities for developing the city-scale datasets of their existing building stock, including San Jose, Los Angeles, and Boston.}

Experimental data has confirmed its improved accuracy. The particle swarm tuned neuro-fuzzy model has been applied to a practical photovoltaic power generation system for maximum power point control. The simulated results showed an average error of 0.25% with respect to the maximum extractable power of the panel used under static conditions; this percentage remains universal for a range of dynamic weather conditions at sampling rate of 1 sample/12 min. The errors obtained, on average, are reduced to one fourth in comparison of the genetic algorithm based model proposed in a previous research.}

By introducing the concept of situation, the probabilities addressing average behaviors are obtained. Furthermore, these probabilities are introduced to construct the transition matrix in the CTMDP. A policy iteration method for solving the CTMDP is also given. To demonstrate the CTMDP method for pursuit-evasion, examples in a grid environment are computed.

In the latter context, special attention is dedicated to the study of angular reflection effects, caused by the interaction of incident sunlight with a canopy. High precision airborne analysis of these effects requires multi-view sensor systems and multi-view ITC segmentation. In particular oblique view image segmentation is difficult and has been addressed by numerous template based methods. This contribution identifies persistent shortcomings in the state of the art and tackles the problem by a multi-step workflow utilizing the digital surface model (DSM), derived from multi-view stereo data. A slightly revised version of the previously published levelset-watershed segmentation of the DSM is presented as the first step. In the second step, the contour of the visible part of a candidate tree in images with known orientation is obtained by means of ray casting and concave hull calculation. The method was tested on a deciduous, mixed and coniferous plot, whose aerial images were acquired using the 3K camera system in 2018 at Kranzberg Forest, Bavaria, Germany. Accuracies were assessed at hand of human operator generated groundtruth tree tops for the DSM as well as images with zenit angles of approximately 0,45 and 52 degrees. The resulting F1-scores, averaged over the plots, are 0.909/0.902/0.886/0.876 for the DSM/near-nadir-/oblique-/maximum-oblique-images, respectively.}

Mill.). Remote sensing satellite imagery represents a valuable data source for seamless regional-scale mapping of forest composition. This study developed and evaluated new models to map the distribution and abundance of SBW host species at 20 m spatial resolution using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery in combination with several site variables for a total of 191 variables in northern New Brunswick, Canada using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We found Sentinel-2 multi-temporal single spectral bands and numerous spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) yielded the classification of SBW host species with an overall accuracy (OA) of 72.6% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.65. Incorporating Sentinel-1 SAR data with Sentinel-2 variables coupled with elevation, only marginally improved the performance of the model (OA: 73.0% and K: 0.66). The use of Sentinel-1 SAR data with elevation resulted in a reasonable OA of 57.5% and K of 0.47. These spatially explicit up-to-date SBW host species maps are essential for identifying susceptible forests, monitoring SBW defoliation, and minimizing forest losses from insect impacts at landscape scale in the current SBW outbreak in the region.}

One critical problem transit authorities encounter is that they can not clearly understand the actual behavioral preference and travel demand of their passengers, worse even, nowadays, the passively collected data from IoT devices do not guarantee the integrity of information and make it more difficult. To address these problems, in this research, we first propose a novel framework to derive passengers’ closed transit chains along with their home and work locations from incomplete travel records using an information enrichment and probabilistic inference approach. We then leverage both evaluation and volunteers’ records to evaluate the usability and theoretical boundaries of our methods. We finally apply our proposed framework to mine a series of useful information about the city and behavioral preferences of our passengers. Our proposed methods are applicable to mining individuals’ behavioral patterns from sparsely collected crowdsourcing data in future.}

We discuss how the approach could be adapted and modified to boost the impact of ERR and help achieve more effective recovery of biodiversity, ecosystem health, and human health and well-being in the vast dryland ecosystems of the world. In arid and semiarid ecosystems, not all native species respond well to methods for growing in nurserys, and a key to ERR success is the identification of a coherent set of species selected on the basis of multiple criteria, both ecological and practical, and simple tests for field performance. We describe selection criteria and early results of field trials of three candidate framework plant species undergoing field trials in our region. Of these three, Atriplex lampa and Hyalis argentea var. latisquama showed uniformly high performance while the response of Senecio subulatus var. subulatus varied according to substrates.

Furthermore, utilizing external reference texts that characterize service robots from a technical perspective, we propose and apply a novel approach to match the constructed topics to service robotics. The matching procedure is based on frequency and exclusivity of words overlapping between the patents and the reference texts. We identify around 20 topics belonging to service robotics. Our results corroborate earlier findings, but also provide novel insights on the content and stage of development of application areas in service robotics.

The attitude and angular velocity are estimated from a minimum of two linearly independent known vectors measured in the body-fixed frame, and the measured angular velocity vector is assumed to have a constant bias in addition to measurement errors. The estimated attitude evolves directly on the special orthogonal group SO(3) of rigid body rotations, avoiding any ambiguities and singularities. The constant bias in angular velocity measurements is also estimated. The estimation scheme is proven to be almost globally finite time stable in the absence of measurement errors using a Lyapunov analysis. The robustness of the scheme in the presence of bounded measurement errors is analytically shown. The estimation scheme is discretized as a geometric integrator for digital implementation. Numerical simulations demonstrate the finite time stability properties of the estimation scheme. Robustness of this estimation scheme is also demonstrated through a numerical comparison against some state-of-the-art nonlinear attitude estimation schemes.}

In addition, a path-tracking control method based on pole assignment, virtual Ackerman steering control model of a single-cylinder diesel-engine-powered tracked vehicle, and forward-steering proportional control method based on the principle of pulse-width modulation were designed. Simulations and field experiments were performed to test the application of the proposed system. The experimental results indicated that the absolute average and standard deviation of the path waypoint interval decreased from 0.227 and 0.348 m to 0.018 and 0.015 m, respectively. In 5- and 6-m-radius-circular and straight-line path-tracking simulations, the average error in path tracking was less than 0.002 m. For path tracking in an orchard environment, the average tracking error and standard error deviation between tree rows were 0.051 and 0.084 m, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed control system enable significantly stable control of single-cylinder diesel-engine-powered tracked vehicles, and its control accuracy meets the operational objectives of tracked vehicles.}

abstract = {This paper provides a legged stable walking control strategy based on multi-sensor information feedback about BIT-NAZA-II, a large load parallel hexapod wheel-legged robot developing for the problem of vertical contact impact and horizontal sliding of heavy leg robot in complex terrain environments. The BIT-NAZA-II robot has six legs and six wheels, and the wheels are installed on the foot-end. The wheels of each foot-end for the legs of the robot are locked when walking with legs. In order to realize the smooth transition between swing phase and stance phase, the leg motion is divided into different stages for control by state machine switching controller based on event (SMSCE). In the Z-direction, in order to avoid the shaking of the body caused by the contact impact at the moment of contact between the foot-end and the ground during the walking of the robot, an active compliance controller (ACC) based on impedance control (IC) is applied to solve the problem of contact impact. Moreover, in the X-direction, the swing leg retraction (SLR) based on Bezier curve (BC) is introduced to generate the foot-end trajectory of the robot, which solves the slip problem of the heavy leg robot and improves the horizontal stability. Finally, the control strategy of stable walking is respectively verified by the simulations and experiments. The results show that the ACC based on IC can effectively reduce the contact impact between the foot-end and the ground in the Z-direction and improve the stability of body. Besides, the anti-sliding ability is realized after introducing SLR based on BC in the X-direction, and we also verify that stable walking control strategy is effective, which provides a reference value for the stable walking of heavy leg robot in complex terrain.}

abstract = {The daily working hours of mobile robots are limited primarily by battery life. Most systems use a combination of thresholds and fixed periods to decide when to charge. This produces charging behaviour that ignores high-value tasks that must be performed within time-windows or by deadlines. Instead the robot should schedule charging adaptively, taking into account the times of day when it is expected to be given more valuable tasks to perform. This paper proposes an approach that exploits the fact that, during long-term deployments, the robot can learn when it is most probable that valuable tasks are added to the system, enabling it to schedule charging at times that are expected to be less busy. We pose the problem of scheduling battery charging as a multi-objective sequential decision making problem over a time-dependent Markov decision process model of expected task rewards and battery dynamics. We evaluate the scalability and solution quality of our multi-objective scheduler, and compare it with a typical rule-based approach. Empirical results show that our approach enables more flexible and efficient robot behaviour, which takes into account both the value of current available tasks and the predicted value of future tasks to decide whether to charge at a given time.}

Adaptive control methods are effective for handling perturbations, but most rely on expert knowledge in choosing parametric estimator structures. These uncertainties in quadrotor dynamics own complex representation form, so the structure of the estimator is difficult to determine. Our work integrates modified Gaussian process regression (GPR) with a quaternion-based command filtered backstepping framework, such that quadrotors subjected to perturbations can rapidly and accurately track the desired trajectory. GPR-based control architecture applies Bayesian nonparametric representation to estimate the distribution of perturbations; the nonparametric estimation method requires no prior knowledge about uncertainties and can inherently manage measurement noises. The zero-mean prior of GPR is modified by using the error integral, which compensates for the estimation bias of constant and/or low-frequency disturbances. Furthermore, to estimate the rapidly changing perturbations, a time-dependent form regarding state point selection is applied to increase the influence of recent measurements. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of these modifications and the superiority of the proposed control system.}

When neither the location of the robot nor the map of its surrounding known, localization and mapping become highly interdependent tasks that must be performed concurrently. This problem is known as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Many techniques have been developed to make the utmost of the robot sensors to solve the SLAM problem. A solution to SLAM in dynamic environments would expand robotic applications and open up a vast range of potential applications. In this context, we propose the adaptive smooth variable structure filter (ASVSF) based approach to solve the SLAM problem and reconstruct a reliable 2D environment representation.

However, CQR approach in harsh environments, in terms of long-range transmission, high dynamic topology, and three-dimensional monitor region, is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose a novel grid-based routing approach, namely FMCQR protocol, to guarantee QoS-aware routing for heterogeneous services in above harsh environments. Our approach is explored by the synthesis of three kernel features. First, a grid-based route model is developed on the basis of two key points, i.e., Three-dimensional Geographic Grid (TGG) space and Controlled Virtual Node (CVN). Hereinto, TGG provides a refined virtual addressing space; CVN, basically a distributed cooperative strategy within TGG border, forms the intra-TGG nodes into a virtual MIMO agent, thus the three-dimensional high dynamic topology can be transferred into a CVN-based stationary topology in TGG space. Second, a QoS routing mechanism, namely CQR, is introduced to guarantee QoS-aware route for heterogeneous requests with the assist from CVN-based metrics, and achieve the route discovery in unknown environments by switching between relay-destination (RD) and source-relay (SR) searching algorithms. Third, a novel Fading Memory Optimization (FMO) algorithm, based on Ebbinghaus memory principle, is designed to further enhance the route efficiency. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the above features, compared to related typical routing protocols, our approach has better convergence and better QoS in terms of successful delivery ratio, average delay, average link overhead, and normalized routing distance.}

The attributes are those that have strong correlations with components of vegetation condition and are expected to produce trustable indications of change. Further to this, it aims to identify those vegetation attributes that can be best assessed using field survey and those that can be remotely measured world-wide. Vegetation has various structural, functional and compositional characteristics. To measure specific vegetation characteristics, the suitable type of RS sensor is required. Multi-spectral, hyperspectral, Radio Detection And Ranging (RADAR) and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) are the main types of RS sensors, and each type has a range of applications. A variety of automated and repeatable methods are provided by RS technology to monitor the indicators of vegetation condition. However, dependency on site-based data remains. Further work is essential to find a rapid, cost effective and transferable RS method to map and monitor vegetation condition. Moreover, near future improvements in RS, such as Sentinel products, are expected to ease the process of vegetation condition assessment and enhance the outcomes.}

abstract = {This paper is studied with the hierarchical type stability and stabilization of networked control systems (NCSs) with event-triggered mechanism (ETM). In the cause of reducing the amount of data transmission and saving the limited network bandwidth, ETM is introduced into NCSs, and the closed-loop time-delay NCSs model with ETM is presented. An improved Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF), containing delay-product-type terms and being appropriate for the canonical BesselLegendre inequality (BLI), is first constructed. Then, by utilizing the canonical BLI and the extended reciprocally convex matrix inequality (ERCMI) to deal with the single integral terms of the derivative of LKF, a sufficient condition on asymptotically stable is derived for NCSs. Based on above N-dependent stability criteria, a co-design method is developed, which can be capable of calculating the control gain of controller and the weighting matrix of the ETM. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the results are verified by two examples.}

For which, the human task are replaced by robots to achieve good accuracy, high efficiency, speed and multiplicity. In industries, these robots are employed to carry heavy objects in working place. As the environment or working area may be dynamically changing, the algorithm or the rules must be devised to ensure an optimistic collision-free path. A* algorithm is a heuristic function based algorithm for proper path planning. It calculates heuristic function's value at each node on the work area and involves the checking of too many adjacent nodes for finding the optimal solution with zero probability of collision. Hence, it takes much processing time and decreases the work speed. The modifications in A* algorithm for reducing the processing time are proposed in this paper. The proposed A* algorithm determines the heuristic function's value just before the collision phase rather than initially and exhibits a good decrement in processing time with higher speed. This paper involves MATLAB simulation of robot movement from source to goal. Several cases are considered with proposed A* algorithm which exhibit maximum 95% reduction in processing time.}

We analyze the iterative optimizations for pose tracking and map refinement of visual SLAM in multi-camera cases. The analysis ensures the soundness and accuracy of each optimization update. A well-known monocular visual SLAM system is extended to utilize two cameras with non-overlapping fields of view (FOVs) in the final implementation. The resulting visual SLAM system enables autonomous navigation of an MAV in complex scenarios. The theory behind this system can easily be extended to multi-camera configurations, when the onboard computational capability allows this. For operations in large-scale environments, we modify the resulting visual SLAM system to be a constant-time robust visual odometry. To form a full visual SLAM system, we further implement an efficient back-end for loop closing. The back-end maintains a keyframe-based global map, which is also used for loop-closure detection. An adaptive-window pose-graph optimization method is proposed to refine keyframe poses of the global map and thus correct pose drift that is inherent in the visual odometry. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed visual SLAM system for applications onboard of MAVs in experiments with both autonomous and manual flights. The pose tracking results are compared with ground truth data provided by an external tracking system.}

While nitrate in the upper layers of the soil (< 1 m) has been extensively studied, less information is available on its variation and the controlling factors at depth (> 1 m). To study controls on nitrate accumulation in a subtropical monsoon area, a total of 728 regolith samples, taken from land surface to fresh bedrock, were collected from 21 drillings in a typical red soil Critical Zone in southern China. We characterized the variation of nitrate in these deep horizons and investigated the effect of land use, slope position and regolith physiochemical properties. The results showed that the amount of nitrate at 240-380 cm depth was more stable than at 100-240 cm or 380-500 cm depth, and accumulated at that depth in the upland and orchard regoliths. Nitrate contents in the deep horizons of upland and orchard regoliths were significantly larger than that in the paddy fields or woodland (p < 0.05). When compared to the regoliths from the upper slope of the upland, those from the middle slope stored significantly more nitrate in the deep regolith layer (p < 0.05). Soil pH was the most important single variable in explaining nitrate variability, followed by particle-size distribution (sand, silt and clay) at the point scale. We found that land-use was the most important control in explaining nitrate variation followed by slope position and finally regolith physiochemical properties. These results suggest that deep regoliths of the uplands and orchards in humid regions are most likely to hold a large reservoir of nitrate, which has routinely been overlooked in the past. Moreover, the dominant physiochemical properties of the regolith in controlling the nitrate levels varied among different layers. The findings could have significant implications for biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in deep soil layers.}

Mobile nodes form ad-hoc distributed processing networks that produce accessible and quality-stamped information about the surrounding environment. Due to the dynamic network topology of such networks the context quality indicators seen by the nodes vary over time. A node delays the context forwarding decision until context of better quality is attained. Moreover, nodes have limited resources, thus, they have to balance between energy conservation and quality of context. We propose a time-optimized, distributed decision making model for forwarding context in a MSN based on the theory of optimal stopping. We compare our findings with certain context forwarding schemes found in the literature and pinpoint the advantages of the proposed model.}

In the context of product development, functional design is one of the most challenging but rewarding design activities. On the one hand, designers must extract useful information from a large amount of diversified, unstructured, and even inconsistent customer voices. On the other hand, designers must formulate a set of functional requirements that are inherently intangible, solution-neutral, and arguably subjective. Functional design exerts great impacts on the formation of innovative design thinking. It is especially difficult for novice designers who are naturally inclined to rapidly dive into the solution space with little exploration of the problem space. This paper presents a systematic functional design framework to guide novice designers, through a step-by-step process, to sequentially investigate the customer domain, explore the functional domain, and manage design couplings between customer needs and functional requirements. A collection of existing design methods is incorporated, in an adaptive manner, into the framework to facilitate the execution of each step. To date, the proposed framework has been iteratively taught, practiced, and refined based on two engineering design courses since 2013.}

abstract = {Vehicle detection in remote sensing images has attracted increasing interest in recent years. However, its detection ability is limited due to lack of well-annotated samples, especially in densely crowded scenes. Furthermore, since a list of remotely sensed data sources is available, efficient exploitation of useful information from multi-source data for better vehicle detection is challenging. To solve the above issues, a multi-source active fine-tuning vehicle detection (Ms-AFt) framework is proposed, which integrates transfer learning, segmentation, and active classification into a unified framework for auto-labeling and detection. The proposed Ms-AFt employs a fine-tuning network to firstly generate a vehicle training set from an unlabeled dataset. To cope with the diversity of vehicle categories, a multi-source based segmentation branch is then designed to construct additional candidate object sets. The separation of high quality vehicles is realized by a designed attentive classifications network. Finally, all three branches are combined to achieve vehicle detection. Extensive experimental results conducted on two open ISPRS benchmark datasets, namely the Vaihingen village and Potsdam city datasets, demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed Ms-AFt for vehicle detection. In addition, the generalization ability of Ms-AFt in dense remote sensing scenes is further verified on stereo aerial imagery of a large camping site.}

abstract = {Aerial surveys are increasingly used for assessing the presence and abundance of many large faunal species. However, detection rates often suffer significant sightability errors. Using sensors that capture thermal infrared can sometimes improve the detectability of fauna by increasing the contrast of target animals against their surrounds. However, there are several situations where this does not work well. Submerged fauna in marine environments are one example, and where the detection error can be substantial. To identify what wavelength selection might enhance detectability rates beyond standard cameras, we used a drone-based hyperspectral sensor to measure the reflectance of 64 animals and their corresponding surrounds. Fauna included white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), and various other species of ray (Rhinoptera neglecta, Aetobatus narinari, Rhynchobatus australiae) and fish (Seriola lalandi). Data were analysed using Generalized Additive Mixed-Models (GAMM) to compare the difference in spectral reflectance between fauna and their surrounds. The GAMMs showed little difference between submerged fauna groups, but indicated that a band of wavelengths between 514 and 554 nm provided the greatest contrast between fauna and their surrounding backgrounds. This was also consistent across the range of environmental conditions. We contend that restricting the spectral input to a standard high-resolution camera, or focusing on the channels that accentuate the green colours in post-processing, will likely result in increased accuracy in the detection of submerged fauna. This approach may also be applied to fauna surveys in other landscapes, particularly where the use of thermal sensors is not appropriate.}

Most existing threat assessment methods can only obtain ranking results, decision-makers usually need to subjectively choose priority targets to attack or interfere based on the preset threat level and ordering results, which does not meet the requirements of complex battlefield situation and uncertain information processing. A method is urgently needed, which can objectively produce threat classification results and automatically provide priority targets for combat. Therefore, we propose a novel target threat assessment method based on three-way decisions under intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute decision making environment. The core parts are the conditional probability of each target is estimated by intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS and the decision thresholds of each target are constructed by intuitionistic fuzzy evaluation values. The results of two numerical examples show that the proposed method can effectively deal with dynamic uncertain situation information, turn the traditional ranking results of two-way decisions to the objective classification results of three-way decisions and can flexibly reflect the acquisition of situation information by setting the risk avoidance coefficient.}

Thus, it is important to have an accurate estimate of the current and near future fire risk to take proper planning precautions. Cloud computing services providing access to weather data in the form of measurements and forecasts combined with recent developments in fire risk modelling may enable smart and fine-grained fire risk predication services. The main contribution of this study is implementation and experimental validation of a predictive fire risk indication model, which exploits cloud-provided measurements from weather stations and weather forecasts to predict the current and future fire risk for wooden homes at a given geographical location. The basic idea of the model is to estimate the indoor climate using measured and forecasted outdoor climate for computing indoor wooden fuel moisture content and an estimated time to flashover as indication of the fire risk. The model implementation was integrated into a micro-service based software system and experimentally validated during one winter at selected geographical locations, relying on weather data provided by the RESTful API of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Additionally, weather data from several historical fires were considered to relate our predictions to known fire incidents. Our evaluation demonstrates the ability to provide trustworthy and accurate fire risk indications using a combination of weather data measurements and forecast data. Furthermore, our cloud-and micro-service based software system implementation is efficient with respect to data storage and computation time.}

The velocity control augmentation follows a loop-shaping design for the inner-loop attitude control and a dynamic inversion velocity control design for the outer-loop. The identified model of the dynamics along with the uncertainties is used to determine the robustness and performance of the velocity control system.

abstract = {Existing trackers usually exploit robust features or online updating mechanisms to deal with target variations which is a key challenge in visual tracking. However, the features being robust to variations remain little spatial information, and existing online updating methods are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we propose a dual-margin model for robust and accurate visual tracking. The dual-margin model comprises an intra-object margin between different target appearances and an inter-object margin between the target and the background. The proposed method is able to not only distinguish the target from the background but also perceive the target changes, which tracks target appearance changing and facilitates accurate target state estimation. In addition, to exploit rich off-line video data and learn general rules of target appearance variations, we train the dual-margin model on a large off-line video dataset. We perform tracking under a Siamese framework using the constructed appearance set as templates. The proposed method achieves accurate and robust tracking performance on five public datasets while running in real-time. The favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

The non-linear, coupled and time-varying dynamics of AUVs necessitates the development of adaptive controllers. The on-line identification and adaptation of the controller is carried out using the HNFN approach. The methodology uses the input-output data to come up with a structure for the controller and optimal adaptation of the parameters to achieve the required accuracy. The Semi-Serial-Parallel-Model is employed both for identification and control. Initial validation of the identification results are carried out numerically using a mathematical model. Hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulations are presented to validate the controller before carrying out the experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed controller is capable of suitably controlling the AUV in real environment and demonstrate its robust characteristics.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of spatial curvilinear path following control of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with multiple uncertainties. Firstly, in order to design the appropriate controller, path following error dynamics model is constructed in a moving Serret–Frenet frame, and the five degrees of freedom (DOFs) dynamic model with multiple uncertainties is established. Secondly, the proposed control law is separated into kinematic controller and dynamic controller via back-stepping technique. In the case of kinematic controller, to overcome the drawback of dependence on the accurate vehicle model that are present in a number of path following control strategies described in the literature, the unknown side-slip angular velocity and attack angular velocity are treated as uncertainties. Whereas in the case of dynamic controller, the model parameters perturbations, unknown external environmental disturbances and the nonlinear hydrodynamic damping terms are treated as lumped uncertainties. Both kinematic and dynamic uncertainties are estimated and compensated by designed reduced-order linear extended state observes (LESOs). Thirdly, feedback linearization (FL) based control law is implemented for the control model using the estimates generated by reduced-order LESOs. For handling the problem of computational complexity inherent in the conventional back-stepping method, nonlinear tracking differentiators (NTDs) are applied to construct derivatives of the virtual control commands. Finally, the closed loop stability for the overall system is established. Simulation and comparative analysis demonstrate that the proposed controller exhibits enhanced performance in the presence of internal parameter variations, external unknown disturbances, unmodeled nonlinear damping terms, and measurement noises.}

In this paper, we focus on network failures caused by links that are prone to fail due to their advanced stage of lifetime. In particular, the formalization of the Hardware Deterioration Failure Mode (HDFM) for network line cards is provided to evaluate the penalty for network operators of handling HDFM failing links using classical methods based on Bidirectional Forwarding Detection and Fast Re-Route mechanisms. An algorithm, named Hardware Deterioration Detection (HDD), is proposed to detect if links are experiencing failures as well as to provide an estimation of their remaining lifetime. The performance evaluation over data generated by our provided network failure simulator shows that HDD is able to correctly classify links as failing or not failing, regardless of the type of failure considered. Moreover, overall descriptions for failure models in which HDD is able to produce high quality estimations of the remaining lifetime have been identified, with a trade-off between the hardware deterioration time dependence and the relationship between lifetime and packet loss probability.}

The rules comprise heuristic and fuzzy knowledge together with numerical data obtained from a geometric analysis of the control problem that considers the kinematic and dynamic constraints of the robot. Numerical data allow tuning the fuzzy symbols used in the rules to optimize the controller performance. From the implementation point of view, very few computational and memory resources are required: standard logical, addition, and multiplication operations and a few data that can be represented by integer values. This is illustrated with the design of a controller for the safe navigation of an autonomous car-like robot among possible obstacles toward a goal configuration. Implementation results of an FPGA embedded system based on a general-purpose soft processor confirm that percentage reduction in clock cycles is drastic thanks to applying the proposed neuro-fuzzy techniques. Simulation and experimental results obtained with the robot confirm the efficiency of the controller designed. Design methodology has been supported by the CAD tools of the environment Xfuzzy 3 and by the Embedded System Tools from Xilinx.}

Most of existing works for distributed MAB demand long-time stable networks connected by powerful devices and hence may not be suitable for mobile IoT networks with harsh IoT constraints. To meet the challenge of resource constraints in mobile IoT environment, we propose a lightweight and robust learning algorithm in a dynamic network allowing topology changes. In our model, each agent is assumed to have only limited memory and communicate with each other asynchronously. Moreover, we assume that the bandwidth for exchanging information is limited and each agent can transmit O(log2K) bits (K denotes the number of arms) per communication. Rigorous analysis shows that despite these harsh constraints, the best arm/option can be identified collaboratively by the agents and the algorithm converges efficiently. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits good efficiency and stability in mobile settings.}

abstract = {Smart cities is an emerging concept that allows the usage of technology to improve the quality and efficiency of services delivered to the population of a given city, considering a vast application domain. Some applications, like smart surveillance using Internet of Things sensors demand the transmission of high amounts of traffic with strict quality of service, what may not be available at all times. One solution to deal with this traffic overload is to implement the concept of resources sharing. Considering this context, in this article, a heterogeneous network scenario is considered to implement a multi-purpose real time video surveillance application which can be applied to both smart cities and military surveillance such as borderline security. The proposed solution considers three crucial aspects: the QoS requirements of the real time video application; the cost-benefit of the spectrum allocation; and the time constraints involved in a vertical handover operation to avoid interference. The main contribution of the article are: (I) inclusion of a multilevel resources broker in the Smart Cities architecture, (II) a QoS-enabled solution for video surveillance to provide borderline security, and (III) a low overhead control mechanism to avoid interfering with the legitimate network traffic. Results obtained via simulations show that after the proposed solution is implemented delay and jitter are kept below their specific thresholds and therefore the QoS is guaranteed considering the coexistence of up to 500 IoT sensors. Nearly 70% of the traffic is accommodated either in IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.22 networks, which offer relatively low cost resources. These results are also compared with two state of the art related works and show that the proposed solution performs better than the related work in the analyzed scenarios. Finally, with respect to the time constraints, the implementation of the proposed solution leads to fast vertical handover, attaining times up to 46% lower than the maximum allowed handover duration.}

Timely evaluation of road networks’ performance loss and resilience enables emergency management agencies (EMAs) to make quick and optimized decisions on resource allocation to critical road segments and bridges. However, real-time monitoring of road network conditions has been recognized as a challenge during major natural disasters because the affected regions are often inaccessible. This research introduces the Internet of People (IoP) enabled framework to assess road network’s performance loss during disasters and proposes a performance loss rate to evaluate the road network resilience. The framework is illustrated by a case study of Hurricane Florence in Wilmington, North Caroline, USA. Through semantic analysis of road-related social media data, this study identifies the affected roads during the hurricane. To further evaluate the road network resilience, this research utilizes road network analysis to generate a service zone for each main hospital before and after the hurricane. The population-weighted travel time in each service zone are compared before and after the hurricane to indicate the degree of performance loss. The findings show that our IoP enabled framework can effectively support CI protection for building smart and resilient city environments.}

More specifically, we first partition each aerial image into several fine subregions, each of which is represented using the computed spatial pyramid-based local features. Afterwards, each image is characterized by the most representative features engineered by the saliency map and quality assessment module. Subsequently, a regularized topic model based probabilistic learning is designed for recognizing different types of aerial images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method.}

abstract = {Metaheuristic algorithms are solution approaches to solve optimization problems by repeating some algorithmic steps while searching the solution space. The strategy of the metaheuristic includes two basic tactics; exploration for escaping the local optimum and exploitation for the global optimum. The number of solutions while exploring the solution space can be used to classify metaheuristics. If the metaheuristic uses only one solution to generate a new solution, we call it the single-solution-based metaheuristic. Simulated annealing, iterated local search, adaptive large neighborhood search, iterated greedy, local search, and tabu search are examples of single-solution-based metaheuristics. Most of these metaheuristics use an acceptance criterion to whether accept the newly generated solution instead of the incumbent solution to escape from the local optimal. The most used acceptance criterion in the literature is the Metropolis criterion or simulated annealing-like acceptance criterion that decides whether accept the new solution by calculating its acceptance probability. In this study, we propose a fuzzy rule-based acceptance criterion that fuzzies the inputs of the metaheuristic within a fuzzy inference system to create the decision output about the acceptance. The proposed new acceptance criterion is compared with the well-known probabilistic approach in the experimental study with traveling salesman problem, multidimensional knapsack problem, single machine weighted earliness/tardiness problem, linear regression problem, and two continuous optimization problems. The statistical analyses reveal that the number of acceptance solutions while using the proposed acceptance criterion is less than the probabilistic one has but the metaheuristic performance increases with the proposed criterion. Additional analyses are made to explain why the fuzzy criterion convergences better to the global optimum than the probabilistic criterion.}

abstract = {Increased availability and resolution of remotely-sensed (RS) imagery of Earth's surface has greatly enhanced the precision, spatial extent, and temporal frequency at which we can analyze river channel migration and width changes. Despite a body of research identifying and quantifying sources of uncertainty inherent in such data, no framework has emerged to comprehensively quantify and handle uncertainty. Herein, we summarize and evaluate present best practices, test new approaches to quantify and handle uncertainty, and provide recommendations for future work using remotely-sensed measurements of river migration and width changes. While our research focuses on river systems, the principles and approaches are applicable to research delineating boundaries or using boundaries to measure changes: glacier retreat or advance, erosion or deposition along coastlines and lakeshores, changes in wetland extent, expansion or contraction of vegetation (e.g., deforestation), cliff retreat, sea level rise due to climate change, change in aeolian depositional systems, and anthropogenic/political boundary disputes. From our results, the following conclusions and recommendations arise:1.Planform change measurements should span spatial intervals larger than coherent units of adjustment to avoid spatial autocorrelation.2.Uncertainty in manual riverbank delineations is dominated by arbitrary user inconsistency rather than poor image quality (i.e., resolution, colour versus grayscale, year of acquisition) or environmental conditions (i.e., shadows and vegetation cover).3.We recommend that digitizations follow the vegetated boundary that best approximates bankfull width, whenever possible, to avoid inconsistency along ambiguous reaches.4.Using a spatially variable level of error detection (LoD) threshold improves the quantity and quality of retained measurements relative to a uniform LoD.5.After applying a LoD threshold, we recommend first using expert discretion to manually classify any ‘nondetect’ measurements that qualify as ‘significant’ measurements of zero (i.e., no change actually occurred).6.Subsequently, three methods may be used for handling the remaining nondetects; Kaplan-Meier (KM) and Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLE). The specific approach chosen for handling nondetects is contingent upon each case, but can be guided and informed by descriptions and assumptions of each method, references to external resources, and results of our river-focused analyses.7.Finally, we encourage a focus on improving the simplicity, generalizability, and open-source opportunities of tools and packages used for calculating river planform change and spatially variable uncertainty, thereby enabling a common platform to measure and compare results.}

Firstly, the simple Lyapunov candidate function is discussed to judge the validity of the proposed controller. Secondly, according to the sliding mode control method, a controller is designed to achieve the consensus tracking problem when the followers are described by the fractional-order linear dynamics. Thirdly, the case when the dynamics of followers own the intrinsic nonlinear function is discussed, it proves that the designed sliding mode controller is still valid for this case under the certain conditions. For the above two parts, the systems stabilities are judged based on the result of the first part. Finally, several simulations are presented to verify the obtained results.}

However, general information on the accuracy of this technology to assess the vegetation's biophysical and -chemical trait composition, and on the variables which are mediating this accuracy, is often lacking so far. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap for grass- and shrubland ecosystems and applied novel three-level meta-analytical regression equations to 77 studies that validated hyperspectral remote sensing data with field observations. Our results showed that the accuracy of hyperspectral sensors is generally high, but strongly depends on the trait being studied (leaf area index: R2 = 0.79 and nRMSE = 0.19, chlorophyll: R2 = 0.77 and nRMSE = 0.21, carotenoids: R2 = 0.80 and nRMSE = 0.29, phosphorus: R2 = 0.75 and nRMSE = 0.14, nitrogen: R2 = 0.74 and nRMSE = 0.09, water: R2 = 0.69 and nRMSE = 0.13, and lignin content: R2 = 0.64 and nRMSE = 0.26). Moreover, they indicated that the use of multivariate signal processing techniques could improve these estimation accuracies (adjusted p < 0.06 for LAI, chlorophyll and nitrogen). Finally, estimations from air- and spaceborne imaging spectrometers, allowing for functional mapping at broader spatial scales, were found to be as accurate as estimations from ground-based spectral measurements. Despite these promising findings, we revealed that leaf morphological properties (e.g. specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) and biochemical traits which are not growth-related (e.g. lignin and cellulose) remain underexplored in grass- and shrublands. Moreover there was a strong publication bias towards R2 for assessing model performance. Our findings foster and direct further methodological and technological developments for a more accurate and complete functional characterization of these ecosystems worldwide.}

abstract = {Seagrasses are rapidly losing their ability to serve ecosystem services (ESs) with the loss of global biodiversity and coastal habitat degradation over the past few decades. Monitoring ESs is therefore important for tracking subsequent decline or recovery. The development of new Earth Observation (EO) technologies and approaches involved in observing and analyzing data collected from remote sensing (RS) satellite/aircraft would make for a useful application: monitoring and mapping spatial distribution of ESs that seagrasses provide to marine ecosystems and human well-being. Unfortunately, current approaches greatly rely on spatial proxy measures to map distribution of ESs. Many of biophysical parameters are currently detectable by EO instruments, with relevance to ESs. This paper review the capabilities of advanced RS techniques for informing species diversity, growth traits, health condition, ecological processes, and water quality variables linking ESs and describe how these EO products can contribute to ES assessments. Incorporation of both the direct (seagrass extent) and indirect (water related ESs) estimates derived from EO data can now provide more direct estimates of seagrass ecosystem properties (seagrass habitat quality and biodiversity) influencing ESs than the spatial proxies presently in use and they can support in developing more mechanistic models in GIS framework and spatially explicit maps of ESs. The increasing range of EO system and data sets suitable for measuring ES indicators has potential to supporting integrated coastal land use planning. Because each ES indicator and service responds to the environment, there is no ‘one approach fits all’ solution. Selecting EO products, with required resolution to be analyzed will guide to improving mapping efforts. This work also shed lights to sensitize discussion about need of holistic methodologies, challenges, and to motivate an enhanced use of EO-based technology and data. The need for a multidisciplinary project team of ecologists, sociologists, biologists and RS experts has been suggested for proper identification of ES indicators and advanced analysis of EO data. By doing so, we anticipate rapid progress in satellite based ES assessment and characterization of ESs and, in turn, supporting conservation and management of coastal ecosystem.}

Allowing the problem at hand to be solved by automation often leads to novel approaches and new insights. A common problem encountered with this approach is that when this optimization occurs in a simulated environment, the optimized policies are subject to the reality gap when implemented in the real world. This often results in sub-optimal behavior, if it works at all. This paper investigates the automatic optimization of neurocontrollers to perform quick but safe landing maneuvers for a quadrotor micro air vehicle using the divergence of the optical flow field of a downward looking camera. The optimized policies showed that a piece-wise linear control scheme is more effective than the simple linear scheme commonly used, something not yet considered by human designers. Additionally, we show the utility in using abstraction on the input and output of the controller as a tool to improve the robustness of the optimized policies to the reality gap by testing our policies optimized in simulation on real world vehicles. We tested the neurocontrollers using two different methods to generate and process the visual input, one using a conventional CMOS camera and one a dynamic vision sensor, both of which perform significantly differently than the simulated sensor. The use of the abstracted input resulted in near seamless transfer to the real world with the controllers showing high robustness to a clear reality gap.}

abstract = {An important open problem in robotic planning is the autonomous generation of 3D inspection paths – that is, planning the best path to move a robot along in order to inspect a target structure. We recently suggested a new method for planning paths allowing the inspection of complex 3D structures, given a triangular mesh model of the structure. The method differs from previous approaches in its emphasis on generating and considering also plans that result in imperfect coverage of the inspection target. In many practical tasks, one would accept imperfections in coverage if this results in a substantially more energy efficient inspection path. The key idea is using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm to optimize the energy usage and coverage of inspection plans simultaneously – and the result is a set of plans exploring the different ways to balance the two objectives. We here test our method on a set of inspection targets with large variation in size and complexity, and compare its performance with two state-of-the-art methods for complete coverage path planning. The results strengthen our confidence in the ability of our method to generate good inspection plans for different types of targets. The method's advantage is most clearly seen for real-world inspection targets, since traditional complete coverage methods have no good way of generating plans for structures with hidden parts. Multiobjective evolution, by optimizing energy usage and coverage together, ensures a good balance between the two – both when 100% coverage is feasible, and when large parts of the object are hidden.}

Therefore, the variable Mach number waverider is proposed to achieve good flight performance in a wide speed range. In this paper, based on the delta-winged variable Mach number waverider, a variable-sweep-wing morphing waverider is proposed and studied, including four specific sweep-wing configurations, namely loiter, standard, dash and wing-retracted configurations. In the current study, the aerodynamic performances of this variable-sweep-wing morphing waverider with four configurations are investigated under subsonic/supersonic/hypersonic flight conditions. At the same time, the numerical approaches employed are validated against the available experimental data in the open literature. The obtained results show that compared with the wing-retracted configuration, the best flight performance of this variable-sweep-wing morphing waverider can be achieved using different configuration for different flight condition. However, within the hypersonic speed range, the aerodynamic performance is improved through morphing but its advantages are not as large as that in the subsonic speed. Besides, effects of wing downwash and shockwave are also analyzed. In conclusion, the variable-sweep-wing morphing waverider improves both low-speed and high-speed aerodynamic performances, and it expands the flight speed range.}

This paper presents a stochastic evolution (StocE) algorithm for solving the MOSP problem. The proposed algorithm is a single-solution-based evolutionary algorithm (EA) with an archive for storing several non-dominant solutions. The solution quality of the proposed algorithm is comparable to the established population-based EAs. In StocE, the solution replaces its bad characteristics as the generations evolve. In the proposed algorithm, different sub-paths are the characteristics of the solution. Using the proposed perturb operation, it eliminates the bad sub-paths from generation to generation. The experiments were conducted on huge real road networks. The proposed algorithm is comparable to well-known single-solution and population-based EAs. The single-solution-based EAs are memory efficient, whereas, the population-based EAs are known for their good solution quality. The performance measures were the solution quality, speed and memory consumption, assessed by the hypervolume (HV) metric, total number of evaluations and memory requirements in megabytes. The HV metric of the proposed algorithm is superior to that of the existing single-solution and population-based EAs. The memory requirements of the proposed algorithm is at least half than the EAs delivering similar solution quality. The proposed algorithms also executes more rapidly than the existing single-solution-based algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for solving MOSP problems in embedded systems.}

Such an environment is distributed and competitive in nature. In this paper, we take a game theoretical approach to computation offloading optimization in a fog computing environment. Such an approach captures and characterizes the nature of a competitive environment. The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows. First, we formulate a non-cooperative game with both UEs and MECs as players. Each UE attempts to minimize the execution time of its tasks with an energy constraint. Each MEC attempts to minimize the product of its power consumption for computation and execution time for allocated tasks. Second, we develop a heuristic algorithm for a UE to determine its “heuristically” best response to the current situation, an algorithm for an MEC to determine its best response to the current situation, and an iterative algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium. Third, we prove that our iterative algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium. We demonstrate numerical examples of our non-cooperative games with and without MECs' participation. We observe that our iterative algorithm always quickly converges to a Nash equilibrium. The uniqueness of our non-cooperative games is that the strategy set of a player can be discrete and the payoff function of a player can be obtained by a heuristic algorithm for combinatorial optimization. To the best of the author's knowledge, there has been no such investigation of non-cooperative games based on combinatorial optimization for computation offloading optimization in a fog computing environment.}

The capabilities of Sentinel-2 satellite data to retrieve an operator-independent winter cover crop biomass have been assessed. Biomass samples were collected in 1 m quadrats for various types of winter cover fields classically used in Belgium (mustard, phacelia, oat and a range of mixed cover), in 2016 and 2017 (yield between 0.1 to 5 tons of dry matter per hectare). Empirical relationships between the winter cover crop biomass and a wide range of vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 have been defined, and the most performant VI identified. For pure stands of winter cover crops, the cross-validation RMSE (CVRMSE) of the best model is 0.36 Mg DM ha−1 for mustard and 0.3 Mg DM ha−1 for phacelia. The CVRMSE observed for mixed stands, around 0.61 Mg DM ha−1, is roughly two times higher than the CVRMSE observed for pure stands. The added-value of objective satellite-based estimation of winter cover biomass was also assessed by comparing respective estimations with regards to an independent reference dataset made of sample measurements on the ground. Models based on Earth observation showed better results than farmer visual assessment for mustard crops, and were as good as farmers for phacelia crops.}

Nonetheless, the use of remote sensing techniques for optimizing the management and production of coconut plantations is still at a latent stage. In this paper, we present an airborne laser scanning (lidar) based tree detection method applied for automatically identifying individual coconut trees in a plantation in southeast Brazil. This method locates individual trees by searching treetops on canopy height models (CHM) derived from lidar data through a moving window having fixed treetop window size (TWS). Here, an adaptive TWS approach was implemented as a function of lidar-derived canopy cover (COV, %) along with additional smoothening window sizes (SWS) for enhancing tree detection accuracy. A total of 19 plots characterized by varying levels of canopy cover were used for testing the accuracy of our framework and we were able to obtain an average tree detection accuracy of 86.22%. From a total of 341 trees, 294 trees were detected correctly by the algorithm using adaptive TWS. A low TWS (3x3) value was found to perform best in study plots having COV > 80% and for rest of the cases, a higher TWS (7x7) was perceived suitable. Results were further analyzed and compared, to evaluate the relationship of Individual Tree Detection (ITD) accuracy with varying canopy cover levels, within-plot tree distribution patterns, TWS and SWS values. Proceedings from our work show that appropriate combination of lidar-derived CHMs, local maxima (LM) algorithm and window sizes have the potential to satisfactorily (F-score ˜ 0.90) detect plantation species having irregular canopies such as coconut trees. As an extension of the ITD, estimation of forest uniformity, which gives a measure of the level of homogeneity or heterogeneity of stands, is also performed.}
