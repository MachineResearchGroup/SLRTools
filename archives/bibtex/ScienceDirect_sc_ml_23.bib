abstract = {In this paper, I present B-DRIVE—a blockchain-based distributed IoT (Internet of Things) network for smart urban transportation. The network is designed to connect a large fleet of IoT devices, installed on various vehicles and roadside infrastructures, to distributed data storage centers, called as Full-Nodes, to log and disseminate sensor generated data. It connects devices from around the city to multiple Full-Nodes to log timestamped data into the blockchain. These sensors vary from GPS (Global Positioning System), air quality meter, gyrometer to speed cameras in order to facilitate efficient urban mobility. The three identified hardware layers that comprise the network are the IoT layer, Storage layer, and User layer. They consist of Moving/Static-Nodes, Full-Nodes, and Smart devices, respectively. The Moving/Static-Nodes are primarily made up of moving vehicles and road-side infrastructures, respectively, thus acting as various data sources. Whereas, Full-Nodes and Smart devices are institutions and mobile phones, acting as data handler/disseminator and navigator/data visualizer, respectively. The data, or data blocks, received by Full-Nodes get appended into Full and Running-Blockchain, meant for specific purposes. The network is designed to be free from any block mining activity. It provides open access to anonymous sensor data to end-users, especially scientists, policy-makers and entrepreneurs, to develop innovative urban transportation solutions. It is believed that a system like B-DRIVE, along with existing VANETs (Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks), is capable of answering some of the current urban transportation issues around traffic congestion, navigation, and vehicle parking. Other applications of blockchain data could vary from user activity mapping to VGI (volunteered geographic information) data quality assessment. Two identified limitations of the presented architecture are the low processing power of current IoT devices and the lack of urban IoT infrastructure.}

This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for recovering 3D road boundary using multi-source data, which include mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds, spatial trajectory data, and remote sensing images. The proposed road recovery method uses extracted 3D road boundaries from MLS point clouds as inputs. First, after automatic erroneous boundary removal, a CNN-based boundary completion model completes road boundaries. Then, to refine the imperfect road boundaries, road centerlines generated from dynamic taxi GPS trajectory data and remote sensing images are used as completion guidance for a generative adversarial nets model to obtain more accurate and complete road boundaries. Finally, after associating a sequence of taxi GPS recorded trajectory points with the correct 3D road boundaries, inherent geometric road characteristics and road dynamic information are extracted from the complete boundaries and taxi GPS trajectory data, respectively. The testing dataset contains two urban road MLS datasets, and the KITTI dataset. The experimental results on point clouds from different sensors demonstrate our proposed method is effective and promising for recovering 3D road boundary and extracting road characteristics.}

We re-examine the locality-preserving character of spectral clustering by constructing a graph over image regions with both global and local connections. Our novel approach to build graph connections relies on two key observations: 1) local region pairs that co-occur frequently will have a high probability to reside on a common object; 2) spatially distant regions in a common object often exhibit similar visual saliency, which implies their neighborship in a manifold. We present a novel energy function to efficiently conduct graph partitioning. Based on multiple high quality partitions, we show that the generated eigenvector histogram based representation can automatically drive effective unary potentials for a hierarchical random field model to produce multi-class segmentation. Sufficient experiments, on the BSDS500 benchmark, large-scale PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, demonstrate the competitive segmentation accuracy and significantly improved efficiency of our proposed method compared with other state of the arts.}

Such benefits are attractive for user applications and industrial domain. The entry of the IoT domain into the industrial market, also termed as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), was recently observed. However, security threats are increasing daily with the prevalent use of IIoT technology. An efficient security solution that can help in the prevention of malicious attacks is researched despite the existence of multiple security solutions. The current study will help the research community to understand the security flaws and causes by classifying and comparing the different certificateless signature schemes of IIoT domain. This survey aims to provide a comparative analysis of the available solutions to improve security. The multi-criteria decision-making approach is utilized for the comparative analysis of the existing certificateless signature schemes by employing the EDAS technique to evaluate the previously suggested solution proposed for IIoT. The authors believe that this technique has never been previously used for any cryptographic solutions. In addition, the study addresses some of the public research issues for technologists, academia, and researchers to develop the security aspects of IIoT.}

In this paper, we provide a new power allocation technique for improving the energy and spectral efficiency of NOMA-enabled IoT devices. The power allocation is performed without compromising the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the network. By considering the transmit power, QoS and successive interference cancellation (SIC) constraints, we use the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) technique to solve the non-convex problem. To assess the performance of our scheme, we compare the proposed SQP-based approach with the conventional KKT-based optimization method. We provide Monte Carlo simulation results to assess our proposed power allocation framework and illustrate the performance improvements against orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme. The results uncover that the proposed SQP-based power optimization design substantially improves the performance of the NOMA-enabled IoT network.}

This is especially true for sustainability issues, which have so far been neglected in the discussion about the impact of AI despite its immense importance. Consequently, this paper focuses on the impact of AI on the regional energy system, which is considered to play a crucial role in addressing the societal challenge of climate change. Apart from the direct influence of AI on the regional energy consumption in Germany, regional differences are also investigated. For the corresponding empirical analysis, various datasets are combined and analysed in a panel-regression at the regional NUTS-3 level (Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques). Evidence is found that the energy decreasing/increasing effect of AI highly depends on the regional circumstances, the technological as well as industrial portfolio. Thus, a shotgun approach on subsidizing AI is not advisable when focussing on sustainability.}

abstract = {Collision is a key factor to be considered in the design of a communication system for unmanned vehicles, especially when they do extreme surveillance. Collisions can be avoided by establishing efficient vehicle-2-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-2-infrastructure (V2I) communications through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Recently, software defined cognitive radio (CR) based IoV has emerged as a potential technology for efficient communications among unmanned vehicles. However, spectrum mobility is a challenge for keeping CR-based networks interoperable and has not been sufficiently investigated in the existing research. In our previous work, the cognitive-radio Site (CR_Site) has been proposed as an in-vehicle CR-device which can be utilized to establish an efficient IoV system. However, the CR_Site is not capable of resolving the spectrum mobility challenge in high-speed unmanned IoV systems. Therefore, in this paper we introduce an emotion-inspired cognitive agent (EIC_Agent) for spectrum mobility in CR_Site. The agent is equipped with a novel emotion-controlled spectrum mobility scheme that achieves efficient syntactic interoperability among unmanned vehicles. For efficient spectrum mobility, a probabilistic and deterministic finite automaton using a fear factor is proposed. Moreover, we performed a quantitative computation of different fear intensity levels with the help of fuzzy logic. We tested the system using active data from different GSM service providers on the Mangla-Mirpur road. The results are supplemented by extensive simulation experiments, which validate the proposed scheme for a CR-based high-speed unmanned vehicle network. Finally, we compare the proposed scheme with the existing state-of-the-art, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed EIC-agent-based spectrum mobility scheme within a CR-based IoV system.}

abstract = {Cloud services are provided at the edge of the network so that data from users can be processed and calculated at the edges. The user's irregular access triggers the fluctuations of the edge cloud workload. Therefore, an elastic resource management method based on workload forecasting in edge clouds is proposed in this paper. When the resource demand is large, more resources are requested from the cloud service provider so that the task can be completed before the deadline. When the resource demand is small, the idle resource is released to meet the cost constraint. The resource demand is judged based on the workload forecasting. In order to improve the accuracy of workload forecasting, a workload forecasting model based on error correction is proposed in this paper. Neither overload nor the light-load status of edge cloud nodes can make full use of the resources. To improve the node processing performance and reduce migration times, a workload migration model for minimizing migration times is proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that the proposed methods can effectively forecast the workload and improve the processing performance of the entire cluster.}

The connectivity of each and every piece of technology in the environment with Internet, has opened many avenues of research and development. Applications, algorithms, trust models, devices, all have evolved to accommodate the demands of user needs in the most optimal way possible. However, one thing still remains constant: host-centric communication. It is the most predominant way of communication in Internet today. With evolution of everything else, host based communication has been stretched to limits, and exploration of new models have been underway for sometime. Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a major contender for the future Internet architecture, where content is the basic element regardless of its location (host). It intends to offer in-network caching, inherent mobility, multicast support, and content based security as part of design and not add-on functionality. In recent years, numerous efforts have been made to integrate IoT with ICN as the communication model. In this paper, we provide a detailed and systematic review of IoT–ICN research. We investigate ICN as communication enabler for IoT domain specific use cases, and the use of ICN features for the benefit of IoT networks. These include IoT device & content naming, discovery, and caching. We also survey synchronization, interoperability, publish/subscribe communication, quality of service, security, and mobility of IoT devices with ICN perspectives.

These data are usually yielded as streams, characterized for being continuous and infinite, and presenting the peculiarity of modifying their behavior over time. Due to the large capacity of storage, data processing, and provisioning of resources, such data are generally processed/analyzed in Cloud Computing environments. Although those environments provide IoT infrastructure with adequate scalability and resource-centric features, the distance between devices and the cloud can impose limitations to achieve low latency in data traffic. In order to maintain scalability, achieve low latency, and reduce data traffic between the IoT devices and the Cloud, the Fog Computing was proposed, providing resource availability at the edge of the network. Although Fog Computing establishes resource availability at the edge of the network, the technologies/techniques currently used for IoT data processing and analysis may not be sufficient to support the continuous and unlimited streams that IoT platforms and applications produce. In addition, data stream applications at Fog must be supported by the computationally limited devices. Therefore, aiming at taking advantage of Fog Computing and resolve the gap of the data stream in IoT environments, this work presents a new platform called FoT-Stream designed to process and analyze, in real-time, data stream from the Internet of Things in Fog. The main advantage of using our approach is the possibility of reducing the amount of data transmitted on the network infrastructure, which allows, as a consequence, to perform an online data modeling, by detecting changes in data behavior, and a reduction of the Internet usage. Our results in a real-world scenario emphasize FoT-Stream considerably reduces the latency and amount of data traffic in IoT environments without affecting the system throughput.}

Inclusion of small microcontroller chips, smart sensors and actuators in the existing socio-economic sectors have paved the Internet of Things (IoT) to act upon the dissemination of smart services to the end users. Thus, a strong need of understating of the industrial elements of edge computing has become necessary that can share the mutual goal while assimilating with the IoT.

First, we present the taxonomical classification and review the industrial aspects that can benefit from both of the IoT and edge computing scenario, then discuss about each of the taxonomical components in detail. Second, we present two practically implemented use cases that have recently employed the edge-IoT paradigm together to solve urban smart living problems.

Thus, WoT is expected to have a great impact on the smart retrofit of buildings once data from existing and future planned systems are able to be gathered and analysed seamlessly.

Due to the multi-functional applications in the adventurer environment, the sensor modules are damaged by various external and internal sources, which leads to a failure sensor network. Therefore, automated fault diagnosis and fault tolerance are of utmost importance in WSN. In this article, a complete fault diagnosis methodology is proposed for faulty sensors in the failed WSN. The proposed methodology consists of four phases of functioning such as initialization, fault detection, fault classification, and fault tolerance phase. The hard fault and link fault are detected by checksum and Fletcher’s checksum method. The soft faults (permanent, intermittent, and transient) are detected by Mann-Whitney U statistical test. The Gaussian transformation function with a classification factor is used for soft faults classification. The fault tolerance is attained in the sensor system by the stepwise regressional method. The proposed methodology is implemented in a real testbed experiment with simulation setup. The parameters like fault detection accuracy, false alarm rate, false positive rate, fault classification rate, false classification rate, R-squared value, standard error, fault probability, and degree of sensors are considered for the evaluation of the proposed diagnosis methodology.}

abstract = {The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is rapidly increasing the demands for efficient processing of low latency stream data generated close to the edge of the network. Edge computing-based stream processing techniques that carefully consider the heterogeneity of the computational and network resources available in the infrastructure provide significant benefits in optimizing the throughput and end-to-end latency of the data streams. In this paper, we propose a novel stream query processing framework called Amnis that optimizes the performance of the stream processing applications through a careful allocation of computational and network resources available at the edge. The Amnis approach differentiates itself through its consideration of data locality and resource constraints during physical plan generation and operator placement for the stream queries. Additionally, Amnis considers the coflow dependencies to optimize the network resource allocation through an application-level rate control mechanism. We implement a prototype of Amnis in Apache Storm. Our performance evaluation carried out in a real testbed shows that the proposed techniques achieve as much as 200X improvement on the end-to-end latency and 10X improvement on the overall throughput compared to the default resource aware scheduler in Storm.}

Searching for particular surveillance objects is a common but challenging task. In this paper, we present an efficient features extraction framework which utilizes an optimal subset of kernels from the first layer of a convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet dataset for object-based surveillance image search. The input image is convolved with the set of kernels to generate feature maps, which are aggregated into a single feature map using a novel spatial maximal activator pooling approach. A low-dimensional feature vector is computed to represent surveillance objects. The proposed system provides improvements in both performance and efficiency over other similar approaches for surveillance datasets.}

abstract = {Sparse learning has significant applications in statistics, big data, bioinformatics and machine learning. In big data systems, a large amount of redundant, missing and noisy data cause sparsity, and the rapid changes of information result in uncertainty. Since the traditional sparse learning model is difficult to deal with uncertain data, we propose a Fuzzy Granular Sparse Learning (FGSL) model for identifying antigenic variants of influenza viruses. Firstly, a fuzzy set theory is introduced to measure and granulate the influenza viruses. Some fuzzy granules are induced by a single feature fuzzy granulation. Then, a fuzzy granular vector is constructed from these fuzzy granules, and the fuzzy granular regression is presented. Some constraint norms for granules and granular vectors are proposed, which are two granule norms and four granular vector norms. Therefore, the FGSL model is constructed based on granular regression and constraint norms. The FGSL model includes granular ridge and lasso regressions under different constraint norms. Furthermore, we prove the derivative forms of two granular regression functions, guaranteeing the convergence of the FGSL model. The optimization problem of the FGSL model is discussed and two gradient descent algorithms of the FGSL model are designed. Finally, we employ the FGSL model to serologic data and hemagglutinin sequences for learning antigenicity-associated mutations and inferring antigenic variants. The experimental results confirm some advantages of the FGSL model with fast convergence, low RMSE and strong feature selection ability. We successfully identify antigenic variants of influenza viruses by the FGSL model.}

abstract = {Precise and spatially explicit regional estimates of soil salinity are necessary to efficiently management and utilise limited land and water resources. Despite advances achieved in remote sensing over the past century, knowledge about the distribution and severity of soil salinization in economically important areas, such as oasis agroecosystems and desert-oasis ecotones (OADoE), is currently limited. An example of an area is southern Xinjiang, where the OADoE has a high anthropogenic influence. This study was conducted with the aim of mapping soil salinity in typical OADoE using remote sensing and machine learning techniques (Cubist and Random Forest, RF). A range of covariates was obtained from the multi-temporal Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI) satellite for the period from 2013 to 2018. The values of coefficients of determination (R2), Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and relative root mean squared error values, were 0.78, 0.87, 9.59, and 0.76, respectively, for the Cubist and 0.78, 0.86, 9.79, and 0.78, respectively, for RF models. The slope of the linear fitting equation was higher for the Cubist model (0.75) than for RF (0.69). The explanatory power of Cubist and RF for soil salinity variation were 33.22% and 31.41% in the agroecosystem, and 72.25% and 71.66% in desert-oasis ecotone, respectively. For the agroecosystem, the range of the predicted values for 89.13% (Cubist) and 84.78% (RF) of sample was controlled within the same observational range at an interval of 0–5 dS m−1. Compared to single-year data (from 2013 to 2018), the ability to account for model spatial variability in soil salinity based on multi-year Landsat images was increased by 16%–35%. According to the variable importance evaluation, soil-related indices are the most important predictor variables, followed by vegetation, topography, landform, and land use, with relative importance values of 60%, 21%, 16%, and 3%, respectively. The predicted map was also broadly consistent with those obtained for Xinjiang in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) from the second national soil survey of China conducted from 1984 to 1997. The results also showed that the average value of the study area is 8.10 dS m−1 based on the Cubist-based map whereas that of the HWSD is 10.60 dS m−1, this implied that the overall salinity level has reduced by 23.58%. The methodological framework presented covers all prediction process steps and has considerable potential to be used in future soil salinity mapping at large scales for other similar region as OADoEs. The map derived from the Cubist/RF model revealed more detailed variation information about spatial distribution of the soil salinity compared to HWSD, and can further assist with decision-making when planning and utilising on existing soil and water resources in OADoEs.}

However, given that those approaches only scan files partially, some of malwares are not detected. This paper proposes a novel method for finding the malwares in GCSs that utilizes a fastText model to create lower-dimension vectors than those the vectors by one-hot encoding and a bidirectional LSTM model to analyze the correlation with sequential opcodes. In addition, API function names are utilized to increase the classification accuracy of the sequential opcodes. In the experiments, the Microsoft malware classification challenge dataset was utilized and the malwares in the dataset were classified by family types. The proposed method showed the performance improvement of 1.87% comparing with the performance by a one-hot encoding-based approach.

The results indicated that the correlation of coefficients (R) between SOMCs and hyperspectral data processed by fractional derivative were significant at the 0.01 level; the number of wave bands increased initially and then decreased when the order increased. The correlation of coefficient peak appeared at the 1.2 order with a value of 0.52. The correlation of coefficients (R) between SOMCs and the optimal remote sensing indexes (the ratio index, RI; difference index, DI; and the normalized difference index, NDI) of peaked at the 1.2 order, with correlation of coefficients (R) values of 0.81, 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. Six SOMC estimation models were created by means of a single band and optimal remote sensing indexes using Gray Relational Analysis-BP Neural Network (GRA-BPNN). This study found that the optimal model was a 1.2 order derivative model, where the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) was 3.26 g/kg, the highest was 0.92, and the residual prediction deviation (RPD) was 2.26. To complete the high accuracy retrieval of SOMCs, based on Landsat OLI operational land images data, more ‘hidden’ information from the Landsat OLI images were obtained by employing the subsection of spectral band method and the fractional derivative algorithm. Accuracy of the SOMC map was attained by the optimal model of the ground hyperspectral data and the Landsat OLI data, which had low RMSE values of 4.21 g/kg and 4.16 g/kg, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that the SOMC can be estimated and retrieved using a fractional derivative algorithm, the subsection of spectral band method, and the optimal remote sensing index.}

Besides the ability to know the fluctuations of the future values contributes to the management of daily/weekly and long term operations. This study aims to predict the electricity load demand using a hybrid method that incorporates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms. The proposed EMD-SVR method integrates the EMD method to SVR algorithm by using EMD as a denoising step on the training data. Unlike the previous studies, the proposed algorithm is not dependent to a specific Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) for denoising and model learning. Experimental results are conducted on 3 electricity load datasets from different countries and the proposed method is compared with SVR algorithm using different feature vectors as well. It is shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the SVR and non-feature used denoised-SVR algorithm on electricity load forecasting.}

Endowing a robotic system with vision and tactile capabilities, similar to those of medical professionals, and thus enabling robots to assess a patient’s status in an emergency is a highly sought after characteristic in healthcare robotics. This paper presents a novel fuzzy triage system exploiting visual and tactile sensing, to equip a robot with the skills to accurately determine key vital signs in humans. There are three key signs of human health: respiratory rate, pulse rate (Beats Per Minute (BPM)) and capillary refill time. Using ground truth from a medical professional, the fuzzy triage system is trained and validated initially with informed synthetic data and then further evaluated using vital signs data collected from subjects in a pilot study. Results from this pilot study indicate that the fuzzy triage system is capable of classifying a patient’s health using the novel approaches for collecting BPM, Respiratory Rate (RR) and Capillary Refill Time (CRT) which replicate, to some extent, the approaches used by medical professionals for measuring vital signs. Furthermore, the intelligent system proved capable of determining whether a pulse was regular or arrhythmic, whether respiratory rate was regular or irregular, and determining the subject’s capillary refill time. Such results imply that this system could ultimately be used, for example, in a home assistance robot for elderly or disabled persons, or as a first responder robot. Ultimately the aim would be that these methods could be utilised by robotic systems in emergency scenarios or disaster zones.}

Due to the large variations of visual appearance caused by view angle, pose changing, light changing, background clutter and occlusion, person re-identification is very challenging. In practice, there exist large differences among different types of features and among different cameras. To improve the favorable representation of different features, we propose a multi-view based coupled dictionary pair learning framework, which can learn dictionary pairs for multiple categories of features, e.g., the color features, texture features and hybrid features etc. Specifically, with the learned color feature dictionary pair, we can obtain the color feature representation coefficients of each person from different cameras. The texture feature dictionary pair seeks to learn the texture feature representation coefficients of each person from both cameras. The hybrid feature dictionary pair aims to learn the hybrid feature coefficients for each person. The learned coupled dictionary pairs can demonstrate the intrinsic relationship of different cameras and different types of features. When the resolution of image is too low, the texture information will be lost to some extent. There is few high-resolution person dataset so far, we contribute a newly collected dataset, named High-Resolution Pedestrian re-Identification Dataset (HRPID) on the campus of Wuhan University. The size of person images is normalized to 230 × 560 pixels, which is bigger than existing person re-identification datasets. Experimental results on a new dataset and two public pedestrian datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach can perform better than the other competing methods.}

We consider the entire network energy while choosing the next hop for the routed packets in the targeted wireless sensor network. Our delivery approach considers resource limitations in terms of hop count, and remaining-energy levels. Extensive simulations are performed and achieved results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to other baseline energy-aware routing protocols in the literature.}

Since maintaining fast and accurate tracking of targets with fast move and motion blur in industrial applications is still a major challenge, this paper proposes a novel mechanism based on reliability for target matching, which is the basic problem in computer vision. Then, by using the proposed reliability-based mechanism, a novel visual tracking method with edge computing is proposed to achieve accurate and rapid tracking with high reliability. Experimental results on Object Tracking Benchmark (OTB) dataset showed effectiveness of the proposed mechanism by comparing reliability-based and original algorithm. Results also showed that tracking performance of the proposed method has been increased, especially effected greatly on fast-moving, background clutter and motion blur. Therefore, the proposed method is validated to play an important role in real industrial applications with edge computing, which is more suitable for IIoT environments and automotive industry.}

This contribution aims to demonstrate that a third way is possible, starting from the acknowledgement of the role that human rights can play in regulating the impact of data-intensive systems. The focus on human rights is neither a paradigm shift nor a mere theoretical exercise. Through the analysis of more than 700 decisions and documents of the data protection authorities of six countries, we show that human rights already underpin the decisions in the field of data use. Based on empirical analysis of this evidence, this work presents a methodology and a model for a Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA). The methodology and related assessment model are focused on AI applications, whose nature and scale require a proper contextualisation of HRIA methodology. Moreover, the proposed models provide a more measurable approach to risk assessment which is consistent with the regulatory proposals centred on risk thresholds. The proposed methodology is tested in concrete case-studies to prove its feasibility and effectiveness. The overall goal is to respond to the growing interest in HRIA, moving from a mere theoretical debate to a concrete and context-specific implementation in the field of data-intensive applications based on AI.}

abstract = {Introduction
Over the last two decades, many walkability attributes and variables have been considered in the evaluation of walkability scores with various methods and approaches. This study investigates the recent trend of walkability measures in terms of the scale of analysis, the case study location, the type of measurements, the data collection tool, the analysis method, and the research field.
Methods
In a review of existing literature, this paper analyzes and compares the walkability studies over the past two decades. A total of 75 articles from 40 journals and conference proceedings were selected through a systematic and sequential procedure. In order to explore the research trend among the reviewed articles, we applied a hierarchical clustering technique. A meta-analysis was performed to systematically assess the results of previous walkability studies to derive conclusions about the future direction of research.
Results
The result of this review reveals that recent walkability studies in North America have prevailed in a street-level microscopic analysis while the others in Asia and Europe have focused on both large and small-scale walkability analysis. Advanced images and instrument audit tools are being applied nowadays in addition to traditional physical audit tools for measuring walkability. In recent years, urban design qualities objectively measuring at a street level (e.g., comfort/convenience, aesthetics, sidewalk design, etc.) have been widely used in determining walkability in lieu of the traditionally used attributes (e.g., roadway level of service).
Conclusion
This study presents a future direction for walkability studies along with the recent trend in walkability measures and data analysis. Walkability studies have attracted significant attention more recently than in previous years. The recent trend of automated and systematic walkability data collection will eventually enable detailed analysis at a large scale and contribute to advancing walkability studies.}

Usually, one has to resort to dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, MDS or t-SNE to represent such data. Such dimensionality reduction techniques make it possible to highlight the high-dimensional structures of data. In many of such visualizations, comparable instances appear to form visual clusters. However, no feedback is directly given by these techniques to the user about the features that make the instances cluster together in the visualization. As such, the interpretation of which features define a given visual cluster is a complicated task. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive approach (called Interactive eXplanation of Visual Clusters — IXVC) to explain dimensionality reduction visualizations by mapping their clusters to explanations provided by decision trees. The decision trees use features in high-dimensional data to explain two-dimensional clusters, filling the gap between the dimensionality reduction visualization and the original data.}

With accelerating global economic integration processes, the financial risk early warning requirements for companies are becoming higher and higher. This study discusses the financial risk evaluation Z-Score Model for intelligent IoT-based enterprises. The financial risk early warning system of an IoT company is made up of four parts: alarm source analysis, Z-Score Model analysis, and main financial ratio analysis. Among them, the police source analysis is the premise and important guarantee for the operation of the system overall. After analyzing the internal and external risk factors from different sources in combination with the annual and industry reports of the IoT company, we found that the main risk sources IoT companies face focus on external legal risk, industry competition risk (mainly affected by the external environment), and external tenant credit risk (dominated by their own characteristics). Based on analysis of police sources, a Z-Score Model analysis for IoT companies can be carried out. Z-Score Model analysis is the core of the new financial risk early warning system of IoT companies; therefore, an IoT company's long-term solvency is weak. Any IoT company should be committed to diversifying investments and to carefully selecting investment projects. This study may prove helpful for IoT companies in reducing the probability of crises and developing in a healthy and orderly way.}

abstract = {The growing gap between users and the Big Data analytics requires innovative tools that address the challenges faced by big data volume, variety, and velocity. Therefore, it becomes computationally inefficient to analyze and select features from such massive volume of data. Moreover, advancements in the field of Big Data application and data science poses additional challenges, where a selection of appropriate features and High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution has become a key issue and has attracted attention in recent years. Therefore, keeping in view the needs above, there is a requirement for a system that can efficiently select features and analyze a stream of Big Data within their requirements. Hence, this paper presents a system architecture that selects features by using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). Moreover, a Kalman filter is used in Hadoop ecosystem that is used for removal of noise. Furthermore, traditional MapReduce with ABC is used that enhance the processing efficiency. Moreover, a complete four-tier architecture is also proposed that efficiently aggregate the data, eliminate unnecessary data, and analyze the data by the proposed Hadoop-based ABC algorithm. To check the efficiency of the proposed algorithms exploited in the proposed system architecture, we have implemented our proposed system using Hadoop and MapReduce with the ABC algorithm. ABC algorithm is used to select features, whereas, MapReduce is supported by a parallel algorithm that efficiently processes a huge volume of data sets. The system is implemented using MapReduce tool at the top of the Hadoop parallel nodes with near real-time. Moreover, the proposed system is compared with Swarm approaches and is evaluated regarding efficiency, accuracy and throughput by using ten different data sets. The results show that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient in selecting features.}

The energy consumption is mostly due to the sensing, data processing, communications and other wasted energies such as idle listening, collisions and overhearing. These sensor nodes are regularly powered by an external power source and consequently have a shorter lifetime. Fortunately, different approaches for wireless energy harvesting (WEH) have been improved. Thus, wake-up radio (WuR) becomes a remedy for WEH which provides active, passive and semi-passive circuits consumption and other protocols. For instance, the most used, convincing and productive go to passive WuR which can significantly increase the network lifetime in a sensor network (SN) by decreasing unnecessary idle listening. Eventually, this paper proposes a state of the art in active, semi-passive, centering more on passive WuR and covers the applications areas. Then, an overview of WuR related to physical, medium access control (MAC) and routing layers. Lastly, the paper accentuates the potential research opportunities for wake-up technology for future IoT applications.}

Since the objects in the IoT are directly connected to the unsafe Internet, the resource constraint devices are easily accessible by the attacker. Such public access to the Internet causes things to become vulnerable to the intrusions. The purpose is to categorize the attacks that do not explicitly damage the network, but by infecting the internal nodes, they are ready to carry out the attacks on the network, which are named as internal attacks.

abstract = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) paradigm enables users equipped with energy-constrained smart devices to participate in sensing and reporting of assigned tasks. To achieve seamless communication as well as effective energy and resource management, we leveraged the fog computing platform to propose a centralized, energy-efficient and robust data collection framework, called bioMCS, based on the topological properties of a biological network called transcriptional regulatory network. However, since MCS platforms may potentially entail a high number of mobile users and massive volumes of data traffic, we extend the current work under the name bioMCS 2.0 to conceive a distributed energy-aware data forwarding mechanism where the fog devices function as task data relay nodes. bioMCS 2.0 combines energy-awareness, abundance of subgraphs (called motifs) in the fog network and proximity to the base station to perform efficient task sensing and forwarding in a dynamic scenario where fog devices are both energy constrained and mobile. It also ensures quality of information by accepting task data from reliable smart devices. Extensive simulation on the map of New York City and realistic mobility models suggests that bioMCS 2.0 exhibits comparable performance in terms of data delivery, latency and energy efficiency in comparison with both random next hop (fog node) selection as well as centralized forwarding technique that rely on global network knowledge.}

We propose a heterogeneous KPI capability representation model (HKPM) in our study. Based on the Meta Object Facility architecture, a nine-tuple multi-hierarchical meta-model is formulated to define the metadata components. Nine specific representation element datasets for specific KPIs are proposed to represent the meta-model. Besides, the KPI classification based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been accomplished to support HKPM instantiated in concrete application. Experiments are conducted with the multi-type KPIs to validate the feasibility of HKPM, as shown in public service and Air Quality Index KPI instantiation example. Furthermore, the KPIs can be characterized in different dimensions, which can be modelled in a stereoscopic manner, promoting a comprehensive perception of sustainable cities.}

Several benefits have been observed in multiple domains of applications that has used SDN and NFV in integrated way. Thus, SDN/NFV paradigm has been investigated to seek whether network services could be efficiently delivered, managed, and disseminated to the end users. Internet of Things (IoT) is justifiably associated with the SDN/NFV augmentation to make this task enriched. However, factors related to edge-cloud communication and network services have not been effectively mitigated until now. In this paper, we present an in-depth, qualitative, and comprehensive systematic review to find the answers of following research questions, such as, (i) how does state-of-the-art SDN/NFV architecture look like, (ii) how to solve next generation cellular services via architecture involvement, (iii) what type of application/test-bed need to be studied, and (iv) security framework should be catered. We further, elaborate various key issues and challenges in the existing architecture mitigation for SDN/NFV integration to the IoT-based edge-cloud oriented network service provisioning. Future directions are also prescribed to support fellow researchers to improve existing virtualized service scenario. Lessons learned after performing comparative study with other survey articles dictates that our work presents timely contribution in terms of novel knowledge toward understanding of formulating SDN/NFV virtualization services under the aegis of IoT-centric edge-cloud scenario.}

In order to pass the sensitive data securely, authentication is the first step towards it. The authentication schemes help network to reduce unwanted users and prevent from deceptions effectively since the authentication process identifies the user's identity that he or she claims to be. In connection to the safe communication, authentication is one of the key aspects. So, it is important to design novel authentication schemes; those offer secure authentication and prevent various security attacks in WBANs. A lot of methods and techniques have been proposed for authentication in WBANs. In this survey paper for improving the authentication process in WBANs, an overview of WBAN and their characteristics, various authentication types and classification of authentication schemes has been done. It further provides a complete comparison of different authentication schemes and highlights their pros, cons, limitations, challenges, performance evaluation and their robustness against different security attacks which open doors of new opportunities.

abstract = {Introduction: Traffic safety issues associated with taxis are important because the frequency of taxi crashes is significantly higher than that of other vehicle types. The purpose of this study is to derive safety implications to be used for developing policies to enhance taxi safety based on analyzing intrinsic characteristics underlying the cause of traffic accidents. Method: An in-depth questionnaire survey was conducted to collect a set of useful data representing the intrinsic characteristics. A total of 781 corporate taxi drivers participated in the survey in Korea. The proposed analysis methodology consists of two-stage data mining techniques, including a random forest method, with data that represents the working condition and welfare environment of taxi drivers. In the first stage, the drivers’ intrinsic characteristics were derived to classify four types of taxi drivers: unspecified normal, work-life balanced, overstressed, and work-oriented. Next, priority was determined for classifying high-risk taxi drivers based on factors derived from the first analysis. Results: The derived policies can be categorized into three groups: ‘the development of new policies,’ ‘the improvement of existing policies,’ and ‘the elimination of negative factors.’ Establishing a driving capability evaluation system for elderly drivers, developing mental health management programs for taxi drivers, and inspecting the taxi's internal conditions were proposed as new policies. Improving the driver's wage system, supporting the improvement of rest facilities, and supporting the installation of security devices for protecting taxi drivers are methods for improving existing policies to reinforce the traffic safety of taxi drivers. Last, restricting overtime work for taxi drivers was proposed as a policy to eliminate negative factors for improving taxi traffic safety. Practical Applications: It is expected that by devising effective policies using the policy implications suggested in this study, taxi traffic accidents can be prevented and the quality of life of taxi drivers can be improved.}

Therefore, energy effciency of IOT networks is important. This paper employs content caching mechanism of Named Data Network (NDN) as leverage to propose a novel Endpoint Linked Green Content Caching scheme to reduce energy consumption in NDN based IOT network architectures. We implement a novel threshold based content offloading mechanism where endpoints can adapt to increase in content request rate in real time, conserve energy and collect metadata required to maintain the freshness of transient data. The proposed scheme achieved reduction in network energy consumption in the range of 30%–57% and reduction in response time for content request in the range of 35%–75% when compared with different existing schemes. The strategy performed consistently when the number of nodes in the network was scaled.}

abstract = {In the subject of smart sustainable cities, the underlying theories are a foundation for practice. Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning. This study provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses with high potential for integration, fusion, and practicality in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development.}

Studies on ants motion usually involve researchers watching video recordings and manually scoring each ant's movements. The traditional observation method is challenging because many ants can interact with each other, interfering with perceiving motion. Pixel-level motion estimation can perform this more robustly and accurately. This paper focuses on optical flow estimation to observe ant movements from an imaging system to perceive the motion through the sequence of images. It is known that the optical flow methods suffer from the issue of ill-defined edges and boundaries of the moving objects. An edge-preserving filter-based optical flow method is constructed to estimate the motion of ants in outdoor complex scenarios. The results reveal that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of motion estimation.}

This paper focuses on the association between life satisfaction and street-level visible greenness exposure at residential and work locations, using a combination of sensor data and individual cross-sectional survey data (4619 employed respondents) in Beijing, China. We use a single self-reported question (‘“how well are you satisfied with your life as a whole”’) to measure life satisfaction. Street View Greenness (SVG) is taken as a surrogate for street-level visible greenness exposure at residential and work locations. The results suggest that street-level visible greenness exposure in residential locations is positively associated with perceived satisfaction, though such effects are less significant after considering greenness exposure at work locations. The stratified analysis provides the insight that the associations between street-level visible greenness exposure and life satisfaction vary with individual demographic and socioeconomic characteristics such as sex, age educational attainment and income. Males, young adults, people with low income and educational attainment may benefit more from SVG exposure than other groups. Findings of this study suggest that urban greenness in residential and work environments should simultaneously be taken into the design of land use and public policies aiming to improve people’s subjective wellbeing.}

abstract = {Virtualization technology provides a new way to improve resource utilization and cloud service throughput. However, the randomness of task arrival, tight coupling between resource load imbalance and node heterogeneity, high computing power, and other factors have hindered the energy consumption optimization and cost reduction objectives of the existing technology. Consequently, task scheduling failure cannot be easily eliminated, and cloud computing performance is decreased dramatically. In this study, a strong agile response task scheduling optimization algorithm is proposed on the basis of the peak energy consumption of data centers and the time span of task scheduling. Agile response optimization techniques are also adopted. From the perspective of task failure rate, the proposed algorithm can be used to investigate the strong agile response optimization model, explore the probability density function of the task request queue overflow, and request a timeout to avoid network congestion. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve the stability and efficiency of task scheduling and effectively improve the throughput of the cloud computing system.}

abstract = {The acceptability, energy consumption, and environmental benefits of electric vehicles are highly dependent on travel patterns. With increasing ride-hailing popularity in mega-cities, urban mobility patterns are greatly changing; therefore, an investigation of the extent to which electric vehicles would satisfy the needs of ride-hailing drivers becomes important to support sustainable urban growth. A first step in this direction is reported here. GPS-trajectories of 144,867 drivers over 104 million km in Beijing were used to quantify the potential acceptability, energy consumption, and costs of ride-hailing electric vehicle fleets. Average daily travel distance and travel time for ride-hailing drivers was determined to be 129.4 km and 5.7 h; these values are substantially larger than those for household drivers (40.0 km and 1.5 h). Assuming slow level-1 (1.8 KW) or moderate level-2 (7.2 KW) charging is available at all home parking locations, battery electric vehicles with 200 km all electric range (BEV200) could be used by up to 47% or 78% of ride-hailing drivers and electrify up to 20% or 55% of total distance driven by the ride-hailing fleet. With level-2 charging available at home, work, and public parking, the acceptance ceiling increases to up to 91% of drivers and 80% of distance. Our study suggests that long range BEVs and widespread level-2 charging infrastructure are needed for large-scale electrification of ride-hailing mobility in Beijing. The marginal benefits of increased all electric range, effects on charging infrastructure distribution, and payback times are also presented and discussed. Given the observed heterogeneity of ride-hailing vehicle travel, our study outlines the importance of individual-level analysis to understand the electrification potential and future benefits of electric vehicles in the era of shared smart transportation.}

This study introduces an integrated assignment-allocation model that combines three issues: customer-facility assignments, allocation of fortification resources and data envelopment analysis (DEA). To justify the approach used to deal with a more reasonable solution for real world applications, we consider the outputs of the model as a function of the assignment variables. In new proposed model, the DEA efficiency measure is used to allocate fortification resources and select the best facilities for serving the customers after interdiction operations. For this purpose, we present a new bi-objective optimization model that optimally serves customers’ demands in a remarkably efficient manner and allocates fortification resources to relieve potential disaster, including interdiction operations. Also, Internet of Things (IoT) optimizes the performance of the customers and enhances the safety of facilities. Indeed, a new parking management system based on IoT is proposed to assist parking drivers in managing and handling parking in the presence of protection and interdiction operations considerably. The proposed model is multi-objective and Non-deterministic Polynomial-time (NP)-hard; so, a weighted metric approach by using the CPLEX solver through MATLAB and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA II) are utilized in problem solving. Several numerical instances are generated and solved by CPLEX and NSGA II. Experimental results show that NSGA II solves instances in considerably less time than CPLEX. Besides, it is seen that none of the solutions obtained by these two approaches are not dominated.}

The proposed PSOSMA-ANFIS has been trained with air quality index time series data of three years and has been applied to forecast the fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for one year. We also compared the proposed PSOSMA to other MH algorithms used to train ANFIS. We found that the modified ANFIS using PSOSMA achieved better performance than compared algorithms. Moreover, we analyzed the impacts of the lockdown of Wuhan City on the concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, CO2, and SO2. We compared the correspondence period with previous years, and we concluded that there are significant decreases in the concentrations of PM2.5, CO2, SO2, and NO2.}

Network on chip (NoC) provides an efficient and flexible communication infrastructure to these systems. One of the most prominent research problems in NoC is mapping the real-time application tasks to multiple cores. The aim is to map the cores, which require frequent and high-bandwidth communications close enough to increase the performance and decrease the chip’s power consumption. In this research, a nature-inspired Andean condor algorithm (ACA) is applied to the mapping problem of application tasks on multiple cores of NoC. Initially, a clustering-based technique provides the main algorithm a head-start for fast convergence, and then the main ACA is applied to achieve the optimal performance. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of various performance metrics, such as communication cost, average packet latency, throughput and energy consumption. The proposed algorithm achieves up to 27.11% improvement in communication cost and provides 78.9% savings in computational overhead.}

But how accurate need such predictions be for effective PT operation? We address this question through an experimental case study of PT trips in Metropolitan Copenhagen, Denmark, which we conduct independently of any specific prediction models. First, we simulate errors in demand prediction through unbiased noise distributions that vary considerably in shape. Using the noisy predictions, we then simulate and optimize demand-responsive PT fleets via a linear programming formulation and measure their performance. Our results suggest that the optimized performance is mainly affected by the skew of the noise distribution and the presence of infrequently large prediction errors. In particular, the optimized performance can improve under non-Gaussian vs. Gaussian noise. We also find that dynamic routing could reduce trip time by at least 23% vs. static routing. This reduction is estimated at 809,000 €/year in terms of Value of Travel Time Savings for the case study.}

The learning behaviors of students attending remote video lectures are assessed by logging their behavior and analyzing the resulting multimedia data using machine learning algorithms. An attention-scoring algorithm, its workflow, and the mathematical formulation for the smart assessment of the student learning experience are established. This setup has a data collection module, which can be reproduced by implementing the algorithm in any modern programming language. Some faces, eyes, and status of eyes are extracted from video stream taken from a webcam using this module. The extracted information is saved in a dataset for further analysis. The analysis of the dataset produces interesting results for student learning assessments.

Automation suppliers have already started to re-think their business approach to cyber security.

The method presented in this work enforces message integrity to build trusts between DCS system components, but it should not be viewed as the main nor the only protection layer implemented on an industrial automation system. The proposed solution can be viewed as a low-level security procedure to avoid malicious attacks such as Stuxnet.}

In parallel, similar concepts often used as synonyms − such as “smart manufacturing”, “digital transformation”, and “fourth industrial revolution” − have increased the sense of confusion around the scope and characteristics of the phenomenon. This study approaches the issue through an analysis of almost 100 definitions of Industry 4.0 and related concepts.

Objective
This study aims to identify and synthesise state-of-the-art architectural elements including the design patterns, styles, views, quality attributes, and evaluation methodologies in the convergence of cloud computing and IoT.
Method
We used systematic literature review (SLR) methodology for a detailed analysis of 82 primary studies of a total of 1618 studies.
Results
We extracted six architectural design patterns in this domain; among them, edge connectivity patterns stand out as the most popular choice. The service-oriented architecture is the most frequently applied style in this context. Among all applicable quality attributes, scalability, timeliness, and security were the most investigated quality attributes. In addition, we included nine cross analyses to address the relationship between architectural patterns, styles, views, and evaluation methodologies with respect to different quality attributes and application areas.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that research on software architectures in this domain is increasing. Although few studies were found in which industrial evaluations were presented, industry requires more scientific and empirically validated design frameworks to guide software engineering in this domain. This work provides an overview of the field while identifying areas for future research.}

However, it is not clear how well the requirements imposed by LGA policy implementation will be met by UTC systems being developed for the future. Therefore, research was undertaken to analyse how delivery of urban transport policies over the next 5–10 years would shape LGAs' requirements for the next generation of UTC systems, and thereby to identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to provide user-led guidance for future system development. A two-stage survey of LGA policy makers and implementers from around the world was conducted. The results produced consensus among the group of participants (n = 16) on 17 KPIs, representing a synthesis of expert opinions on the desired features of future UTC systems from a policy implementation perspective. The research makes an important contribution in eliciting the wide-ranging breadth of issues associated with delivering strategic transport policies and understanding how these issues affect the requirements LGAs have for future UTC systems. Aligning future UTC system capabilities with LGAs’ requirements will enable more effective implementation of strategic urban transport policies worldwide and allow the benefits to society associated with those policies to be realised.}

abstract = {The shift towards energy efficiency (EE) programme in accelerating a resource efficient society requires the development of a portfolio for assessing and demonstrating a solution to support decision-making, planning and policy. EE market entails building capacity for industry initiatives in energy savings towards a culture of greater resource efficiency. Many energy predictions have been research by analysing of a large amount of historical and sensing data with high accuracy of the prediction results. However, most of these researches does not apply in practice to energy efficiency and IoT energy management systems, which involves real-time data performance. The proposed methodology is conceptualise on cyber physical systems and application of directed communication approach through a direct and indirect information exchange between agents. This paper explores prediction of energy demands based on measurement data and a statistical regression model using a variable frequency drive (VFD) to control reconfigurable vibrating screen (RVS) machine fixed-speed electric agitating motor. The model acceptance criteria provide a prediction method of energy costs against usage in mining of materials through load testing with measured data every 2 minutes for 24 hours. The logged data prediction accuracy reached 98.47% according to material screening rate, showing close alignment to the measured model and 96.97% coefficient of determination, showing the percentage of variation of independent variables (energy cost with VFD) that affect the dependent variable EED. The study will assist in reducing the energy consumption in conformance to South Africa Department of Energy (DoE) vision to support sustainability in manufacturing.}

In this paper, an algorithm for Internet of Energy in the context of Bus-based VANET is proposed, i.e., street-centric routing scheme (SCRS) to address the problem of optimal-route and relay-bus selection. Firstly, we propose a multipath routing scheme using probability of street consistency and probability of path consistency. The multipath improves performance concerning packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay. Secondly, to enhance the packet forwarding, a new relay-bus selection mechanism is introduced by ant colony optimization (ACO)-based clustering. The relay-bus aims to transmit packets to next forwarding relay. Results show that clustering in ACO algorithm improves the relay-bus selection process by decreasing the computational cost, end-to-end delay, and unnecessary beacon messages. Thus, we conclude that the employment of multipath and clustering significantly improves performance of SCRS.}

abstract = {An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the fundamental building blocks in securing a network. A huge number of techniques have been proposed and implemented to improve the performance and accuracy of intrusion detection models. In recent years, efforts have been made to keep the attack surface as small as possible. However, the attack vectors have evolved in terms of complexity and diversity, and various intelligent techniques have been employed by the adversaries to exploit the ecosystems. This exploitation can either make the whole system dysfunctional or may lead to important information leakage. More specifically, with the evolution of Internet of Things (IoT), more heterogeneous and resource-constrained devices are interconnecting with each other. These devices have limited processing power and resources, particularly for detecting intrusions. Consequently, Swarm Intelligence (SI) based techniques have received considerable attention, especially in the past decade, as the SI approaches have achieved a decent success rate by optimizing various aspects of an IDS. This paper presents a systematic review with a thorough coverage of articles published between 2010 and 2020 of the state-of-the-art swarm intelligence approaches deployed in various attack surfaces for intrusion detection in various domains. The paper also presents a categorization in accordance with applicability of these SI approaches in improving various aspects of an intrusion detection process. Moreover, the paper also discusses the capabilities and features of various datasets used in experimentation. This aims to help researchers in assessing the capabilities and limitations of SI algorithms to identify security threats and challenges to design and implement an IDS for the detection of cyber attacks in various domains. Moreover, this will also help security individuals in differentiating SI based IDS with traditional ones. As such, the survey would be equally beneficial for the researchers working in the domain of swarm intelligence as well as cybersecurity. The survey highlights certain existing challenges and provides directions to address them effectively. In addition, new research directions are also identified.}

The idea is to use building thermal inertia in a periodic pattern by relaxing the temperature setpoints to an upper bound and setting back to a lower bound to avoid air conditioning while the room is still within human comfort zone. This periodic operation planning in turn facilitates the collaboration across a building community to reduce the aggregate demand. The objective is to assign periodic temperature setpoints for a building cluster so that the aggregate cooling electric demand reduces with the minimum cost and steady aggregate load shape. Ideal operation schedule forms are identified and elaborated in detail. Human comfort level and demand-side management applications are evaluated and incorporated into an optimization framework. The impact of peak demand reduction on the grid and power generation costs and the impact on the society is also investigated. The results demonstrate up to 12.5% savings in electricity consumption and 10% peak demand reduction for a community of 26 buildings.}

As robots made our lives much more convenient than ever before, they also brought many potential risks and challenges in technology, security, and ethic. To better understand the development of robots, we proposed a concept of a robot’s living space and analyzed the role of robots in our society. In this paper, we focus on setting a theoretical framework of the robot’s living space to further understand the human-robot relationship. The research in this paper contains three central aspects. First, we interpret the concept of the robot’s living space and the functions of each space. Second, we analyze and summarize the relative technologies which support robots living well in each space. Finally, we provide advice and improvement measures based on a discussion of potential problems caused by the developments of robots. With the trend of robots humanization and human-robot society integration, we should seriously consider how to collaborate with intelligent robots to achieve hybrid intelligence. To build a harmonious human-robot integrated society, studying the robot’s living space and its relationship with humans is the pre-requisite and roadmap.}

However, as both CE and DTs are emerging fields, there exists little systematic guidance on how DTs can be applied to capture the full potential of circular strategies for improving resource efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, there is little insight into the supporting business analytics (BA) capabilities required to accomplish this. To address this gap, this paper conducts a theory- and practice-based review, resulting in the Smart CE framework that supports translating the circular strategies central to the goals of manufacturing companies in contributing the United Nation’s (UN) 12th Sustainable Development Goal, that is, “sustainable consumption and production,” into the BA requirements of DTs. Both scholars and practitioners may find the framework useful to (1) create a common language for aligning activities across the boundaries of disciplines such as information systems and the CE body of knowledge, and (2) identify the gap between the current and entailed BA requirements and identify the strategic initiatives needed to close it. Additionally, the framework is used to organize a database of case examples to identify some best practices related to specific smart circular strategies.}

NFV provides the means to flexibly and dynamically manage and allocate resources, without being restricted to the hardware limitations of the network/cloud infrastructure. Resource orchestration for specific 5G vertical industries and use case families, such as Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), often introduce very strict requirements in terms of network performance. In such a dynamic environment, the challenge is to efficiently place directed graphs of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), named as SFCs (Service Function Chains), to the underlying network topology and to dynamically allocate the required resources. To this end, this work presents a novel framework, which makes use of a delay and location aware Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach, in order to perform optimized sequential SFC placement. Evaluation results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of producing solutions that approximate well the global optimal, as well as achieving low execution time due to the employed GA-based approach and the incorporation of an early stopping criterion. The performance benefits of the proposed framework are evaluated in the context of an extensive set of simulation-based scenarios, under diverse network configurations and scales.}

This study enhances the understanding of smart tourism governance (SG), showing how contextual factors affect DMO perspectives of SG. A mixed-methods approach was used to investigate heritage tourism destinations in the United Kingdom. The results demonstrate that well-established DMOs do not perceive SG as potentially beneficial, as they already perform well in many areas in which SG promises improvements, such as citizen engagement, decision-making, and stakeholder engagement. Despite this, this research highlights the aspects of SG that these destinations can take advantage of as social inclusion, environmental performance and the provision of citizen-centric services. All of these can help heritage tourism destinations to optimise their tourism development. This research additionally demonstrates the effect of contextual factors, such as the level of public-sector support for tourism and the growing influence of non-tourism stakeholders in destination management, on DMO perceptions of SG and makes recommendations for how developments in the use of SG by DMOs can be made, in light of these.}

However, one of the key challenges for IoT hardware is the energy efficiency as most of IoT devices/objects are expected to run on batteries for months/years without a battery replacement or on harvested energy sources. Widespread use of IoT has also led to a large-scale rise in the carbon footprint. In this regard, academia, industry and policy-makers are constantly working towards new energy-efficient hardware and software solutions paving the way for an emerging area referred to as green-IoT. With the direct integration and the evolution of smart communication between physical world and computer-based systems, IoT devices are also expected to reduce the total amount of energy consumption for the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. However, in order to increase its chance of success and to help at reducing the overall energy consumption and carbon emissions a comprehensive investigation into how to achieve green-IoT is required. In this context, this paper surveys the green perspective of the IoT paradigm and aims to contribute at establishing a global approach for green-IoT environments. A comprehensive approach is presented that focuses not only on the specific solutions but also on the interaction among them, and highlights the precautions/decisions the policy makers need to take. On one side, the ongoing European projects and standardization efforts as well as industry and academia based solutions are presented and on the other side, the challenges, open issues, lessons learned and the role of policymakers towards green-IoT are discussed. The survey shows that due to many existing open issues (e.g., technical considerations, lack of standardization, security and privacy, governance and legislation, etc.) that still need to be addressed, a realistic implementation of a sustainable green-IoT environment that could be universally accepted and deployed, is still missing.}

Currently, the adversarial learning OCC (ALOCC) method has been proven to significantly improve OCC performance. However, its drawbacks include instability issues and non-evident reconstruction between the IC and OC samples. Therefore, we propose multihead enhanced self-attention in the ALOCC network, thereby increasing the difference between the IC and OC samples and significantly increasing OCC accuracy compared with ALOCC accuracy. For training, we propose a new loss, called adversarial-balance loss, that effectively solves the training instability problem, further increasing OCC accuracy. The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with state-of-art methods.}

Data analysis methods (e.g., k-means) are often used to process data collected from wireless sensor networks to provide treatment advices for physicians and patients. However, many methods pose a threat of privacy leakage during the process of data handling. To address privacy issues, we propose a mutual privacy-preserving k-means strategy (M-PPKS) based on homomorphic encryption that neither discloses the participant’s privacy nor leaks the cluster center’s private data. The proposed M-PPKS divides each iteration of a k-means algorithm into two stages: finding the nearest cluster center for each participant, followed by computing a new center for each cluster. In both phases, the cluster center is confidential to participants, and the private information of each participant is not accessible by an analyst. Besides, M-PPKS introduces a third-party cloud platform to reduce the communication complexity of homomorphic encryption. Extensive privacy analysis and performance evaluation results manifest that the proposed M-PPKS strategy can achieve high performance. In addition, it can obtain approximate clustering results efficiently while preserving mutual private data.}

abstract = {Modal frequency (MF) prediction under varying environmental condition (EC) has received tremendous attention. Most existing methods for MF prediction, belonging to discriminative approaches, collapse when information of EC is incomplete in the prediction stage. Generative approaches attempt to construct a joint PDF of uncertain MF and EC, and then predict MF under varying EC by conducting operations of marginalization and conditioning using the joint PDF. There are two fundamental difficulties in this process. The first difficulty is joint PDF modelling of multivariate MF and EC as they are too irregular to be depicted by traditional multivariate distributions. The second difficulty is predictive PDF derivation of MF conditional on incomplete information of EC as operations of marginalization and conditioning in the high-dimensional case require huge computational cost. Aiming to resolve these two difficulties of generative approaches, this paper proposes BAyeSIan Copula-based Uncertainty Quantification (BASIC-UQ). BASIC-UQ contains three stages. Stage I introduces probabilistic model class candidates. Stage II conducts Bayesian inference on parameters and model class candidates with embedding the idea of inference functions for margins. The optimal parameters are determined in a decoupled way, and the most plausible univariate marginal PDF of each random variable (RV) along with the most plausible copula are selected. Stage III derives predictive PDF of MF conditional on incomplete information of EC. The exact solutions are derived for the multivariate Gaussian copula and the multivariate Student’s t copula. Examples using simulated data and SHM data are presented to illustrate the capability of BASIC-UQ in joint PDF modelling of MF and EC, and predictive PDF derivation of MF using incomplete information of EC.}
