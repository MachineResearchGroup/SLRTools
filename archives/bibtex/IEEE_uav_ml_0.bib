abstract={Unsupervised learning is used for analysing and clustering data when the expected cluster or class labels are not available, i.e., we are not aware of the type of information to be found. When we know only a little about the data labels, it is still challenging to make conclusions out of the data, although this may be the case for many real world data mining problems. We name the type of learning algorithms useful in this scenario as Near Unsupervised Learning (NUL). My group has been developing NUL algorithms based on the previous ly proposed Growing Self Organising Maps. The concept and the algorithm development in NUL and the application in various biological data mining problems will be discussed. Some “unusual” features and signatures captured by my team will also be presented. Real problems attempted using NUL includes the following: 1) Metagenomics involves the challenging problem of clustering and eventually labelling genomic data of microbial species that cannot be easily grown in laboratories. We only know about 2% of these species found on Earth. Could this be the life form we expect to find on another planet? How do we understand and use some unique characteristics of microbes living in our environment and our body? 2) Analysing metabolite profiles of various wheat plants to understand how some type of the plants can survive droughts is an area where NUL can provide good solutions, 3) Can we analyse signals coming from biological neural networks grown on wet labs to differentiate the sick brain tissues from healthy ones? Our collaborating researchers create mice with genetics based brain diseases and analyse the brain tissues wi th and without the introduction of drugs. Which drugs (for example drugs preventing epileptic attacks) are more effective on a particular type of sickness?},
