abstract = {Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) can boost the development of smart cities, and artificial intelligence and edge computing are key technologies that support the implementation of ITS. Vehicle localization is critical for ITS since the safety driving and location-aware serves highly depend on the accurate location information. In this article, we construct a vehicle localization system architecture composed of multiple Internet of Things (IoT) with arbitrary array configuration and a large amount of vehicles in smart cities. In order to deal with the coexisting of circular and non-circular signals transmitted by vehicles, we proposed several vehicle number estimation methods for non-circular signals. Based on the machine learning technique, we extend the vehicle number estimation method into mixed signals in more complex scenario of smart cities. Then the DOA estimation method for non-circular signals based on IoT is proposed, and then the performance of this method is analyzed as well. Simulation outcomes verify the excellent performance of the proposed vehicle number estimation methods and the DOA estimation method in smart cities, and the vehicle positions can be achieved with high estimation accuracy.},

abstract = {Smart traffic management is essential for smart cities. Detection and classification of traffic signs is essential in autonomous driving and in helping with traffic navigation in general. Automated recognition of street parking signs, however, is a more challenging task, due to their small size and huge diversity. Identification of street parking signs is not only helpful in autonomous driving but also in notifying drivers of available parking spaces ahead, significantly alleviating traffic congestion. In this paper, we introduce a new street parking sign detection and classification method that is based on a deep learning network that receives a video feed from a car camera to accurately detect and classify different street parking signs in real-time. Performance evaluations showed that our model achieves mean average precision of 98.56%.},

abstract = {Singapore ratified the Paris Agreement on September 21, 2016, and the unconditional target by 2030 is the reduction of emission by 36%. Furthermore, the cities are the major source of emission, and transportation accounts for about 14% of the total emissions in Singapore. Transportation is one of the necessary infrastructures for cities and over 80% of the population in Singapore depends on public transportation systems. To significantly cut emissions, smart cities are expected to play an essential role, therefore the conventional transportation systems are transforming to be intelligent. The emission of vehicles depends on various factors like the average speed of the vehicle, total distance covered by the vehicle, urban driving conditions, and type of vehicle. In this research, COPERT model is used for calculation of emission cost after extracting features from real-world GPS datasets, and machine learning models are built to predict the total emission cost of the buses in an area of Singapore. In this study, the performance of emission cost estimation using three modeling techniques, namely MLP, RF, and Light GBM are compared. Results prove that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is 97% when Light GBM is implemented.},

abstract = {Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where algorithms are created and function similar to those in machine learning, but there are numerous layers of these algorithms each providing a different interpretation to the data it feeds on. Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) is picking up huge popularity due to their potential of providing low-cost solutions to real-world communication problems. MANETs are more susceptible to the security attacks because of the properties such as node mobility, lack of centralized management and limited bandwidth. To tackle these security issues, traditional cryptography schemes can-not completely safeguard MANETs in terms of novel threats and vulnerabilities, thus by applying deep learning methods in IDS are capable of adapting the dynamic environments of MANETs and enables the system to make decisions on intrusion while continuing to learn about their mobile environment. IDS represent the second line of defense against malevolent behavior to MANETs since they monitor network activities in order to detect any malicious attempt performed by Intruders. Recently, more and more researchers applied deep neural networks (DNNs) to solve intrusion detection problems. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the two main types of DNN architectures, are widely explored to enhance the performance of intrusion detection system. In this paper, we present the most well-known deep learning models CNN, Inception-CNN, Bi-LSTM and GRU and we made a systematic comparison of CNN and RNN on the deep learning-based intrusion detection systems, aiming to give basic guidance for DNN selection in MANET},

abstract = { Graffiti is an element of graphic expression that manifests different states of the human being. However, for many governments worldwide, it has been an element of discord between them and the communities that express themselves through graffitis. This article proposes identifying graffiti and concentration zones through Computer Vision and object detection and localization to support public policy management in smart cities. ASUM-DM methodology is used to achieve the aim. Initially, the current problems faced by municipal governments in the management of public graffiti policy are identified. Then available datasets of images from Google Street View (GSV) and other acquired datasets are identified for the case study carried out in the city of Medell\'{\i}n (Colombia) and border municipalities. A training dataset of 1,395 images and a production dataset of 71,100 panoramas is placed on strictly using the experimental method of the division of training data, validation, and a production sample, to make a correct estimation of the generalization error. As a result of the training process, we obtained an Average Precision of 69,14%, which presented a high precision Tag of 89.23%, and low precision of 59.13% in Mural. Finally, it is possible to build heat maps of graffiti concentration areas that could guide rulers to create or improve public policies related to graffiti expression.},

abstract = {Efficient signal control at isolated intersections is vital for relieving congestion, accidents, and environmental pollution caused by increasing numbers of vehicles. However, most of the existing studies not only ignore the constraint of the limited computing resources available at isolated intersections but also the matching degree between the signal timing and the traffic demand, leading to high complexity and reduced learning efficiency. In this article, we propose a traffic signal control method based on reinforcement learning with state reduction. First, a reinforcement learning model is established based on historical traffic flow data, and we propose a dual-objective reward function that can reduce vehicle delay and improve the matching degree between signal time allocation and traffic demand, allowing the agent to learn the optimal signal timing strategy quickly. Second, the state and action spaces of the model are preliminarily reduced by selecting a proper control phase combination; then, the state space is further reduced by eliminating rare or nonexistent states based on the historical traffic flow. Finally, a simplified Q-table is generated and used to optimize the complexity of the control algorithm. The results of simulation experiments show that our proposed control algorithm effectively improves the capacity of isolated intersections while reducing the time and space costs of the signal control algorithm.},

abstract = {Nowadays, urban traffic affects the quality of life in cities and metropolitan areas as the problem becomes ever more exacerbated by parking issues: congestion increases due to drivers looking for slots to park their vehicles. An Internet of Things approach permits drivers to know the parking space availability in real time through wireless networks of sensor devices. This research focuses on studying the data generated by parking systems in order to develop predictive models that generate forecasted information. This can be useful in improving the management of parking areas, especially on-street parking, while having an important effect on urban traffic. This work begins by looking at the state of the art in predictive methods based on machine learning for time series. Similar proposed solutions for parking prediction are described in terms of the technology and current state-of-the-art predictive models. This paper then introduces the recurrent neural network method that was used in this research, namely Gated Recurrent Unit, as well as the model developed according to a real scenario in the city of Riyadh. In order to improve the quality of the model, exogenous variables related with weather and calendar effects are considered, and the baseline model is compared to the models that used this extra information. Finally, the obtained results are described, followed by suggestions for future research.},

abstract = {While the global population continues to grow, more people are living in cities. In 2018, 55 per cent of the world's population lived in cities. By 2050, this is expected to increase to 68 per cent - almost seven in every ten people will live in cities. If sustainable development is to deliver to all people, urban development plays a critical role. The 'smart city' is now the playbook for resilient, sustainable and liveable cities, and smart technologies are creating daily touchpoints that make both huge and small impacts across all walks of people's lives. Today's cities and tomorrow's smart cities are intricately linked to the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development across its 17 goals. This paper first explores at-a-glance the fundamentals and layers that support smart cities, providing an overview but not a deep-dive into the technicalities. This includes, but not limited to, the policy and infrastructure frameworks, the data ecosystem including open data and big, data, the device level including Internet of Things and mobile devices, and the application level in general. Three dimensions of policy integration in smart city development is suggested, namely: (i) horizontal integration across sectors and disciplines; (ii) vertical integration across different governmental levels as well as linkages between national and local development; and (iii) a whole-of-society approach in smart city development with the engagement of the private sector and civil society. The nexus of smart city goals and the global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is then articulated. Building on the key issues identified, a high-level analysis of global and regional metrics in accessing smart cities is done, emphasizing the importance of the clich\'{e} - "what's get measured, gets valued".},

abstract = {Smart City is one of the vital issues in the next coming years as it is estimated that more number of people will be migrating towards city and by 2040 cities is populated by 70% of the world's population. This will give raise to the city management problems like traffic congestion, parking queues, capacity planning and continuous depreciation in energy. Hence there is a need to understand the upcoming issues and find an efficient way to resolve them by resource planning.The evolution of city to Smart City demand information and communications technology (ICT) to gather data. The data is collected based on city infrastructure and conduct of people in the city. This big data is analyzed to make knowledgeable decisions to give quality of life to the citizens. It is referred as the evolution of intelligent city to the next generation city of information technology. ICT provides real time processing of data to gather useful information. Based on this information visual applications can be developed to have a more farsighted view of the Smart City. Online banking, online shopping and remote video communication are some of the applications of Smart City.As one of the concepts to improve city structure and its facilities, Smart City is vital in city management and development and uses information and communication technology (ICT) for city evolution and fast growth. These cities are planned to enhance more business and industrial growth thus increasing in economic development and raising living standard of the inhabitants [1]. It offers various facilities to the city like better transportation in the city, more job opportunities, less travelling time, healthy environment, better healthcare, less crime etc.Smart City is a concept which works with sensors and data analytics to enhance the standard and quality of life in the cities. Smart City deals with the challenges like traffic, parking, capacity planning, energy etc. and resolves them to provide better city facilities to their citizens [2]. ICT is becoming widespread in the cities and is being used as a tool to deal with Smart City application domains. Smart City is using big data to generate intelligent information systems which support decision making capabilities. With effective data sources and data analytics tool we can design high end services for the citizens in urban cities. Big data has changed the way we store data and process the data efficiently. Now this crucial data is not only used to get the historic trends information but also used to predict the future. It is significant in planning the future of the cities. Data is analyzed to develop action plans from the predicted results.In this paper, various datasets for traffic management and parking garage management have been tested and evaluated by using data analytics techniques in order to find a pattern in a historical information. Based on this research this information is further analyzed by machine learning tools and algorithms to predict the future behavior and help on taking decision. Machine learning and Analytics tools for Data Analytics from Hadoop and Elasticsearch environments as well as Mining algorithms from Python library are used for data prediction.This paper gives us the details of some domain applications of Smart City listed as below:• Smart City Traffic Management• Smart City Parking Management.},

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is one of the current disruptive technologies that is considered one of the most promising and widely discussed topics in connection with Smart City implementations. However, the IoT revolution comes along with other so-called disruptive technologies. Making sense of the data gathered through sensors comes along with discussions of AI, Big Data, Machine Learning and other such technological advancements. While a number of projects already address current challenges of exploiting such technological advancements in digital government, the full scope of deploying the disruptive technologies in smart city initiatives requires more research. This paper therefore aims at investigating research needs in successfully implementing and deploying disruptive technologies in smart cities. The paper first analyses existing EU-funded projects concerning the research needs these projects address and/or put forward. Subsequently, a future scenario is developed to demonstrate the potentials of using disruptive technologies in smart cities. Finally, nine research needs (technical and nontechnical) derived from the comparison of existing research needs from the projects and from the future scenario.},

abstract = {Smart cities fully utilize the new generation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the process of urban informatization to optimize the urban management and service. However, in the IoT system, while information exchange and communication, wireless sensor network devices may not be able to resist all forms of attacks, which may lead to security issues such as user data disclosure. Aiming at the information security risks in smart city, the typical technologies in IoT is analyzed from the perspective of IoT perception layer and provides corresponding security solutions for the existing security threats. Regarding the communication security, the emerging wireless technology, long range (LoRa), is discussed, and the performance of wireless communication protocol is analyzed through simulation experiments, to verify that the IoT technology based on LoRa communication technology can improve the security of the system in the construction of smart city. The results show that REBEB, a new backoff algorithm, is similar to the binary exponential backoff algorithm in terms of throughput performance. REBEB focuses more on fairness, which is up to 0.985, and to a certain extent, its security is significantly improved. The fairness of REBEB algorithm is more than 0.4 in different nodes and competing windows, and the fairness of the system is better when the number of nodes is small. To sum up, the IoT system based on LoRa communication can effectively improve the security performance of the system in the construction of smart city and avoid the security threats in the IoT signal transmission.},

abstract = {Typical smart city applications generally require two different communications infrastructures, a wide area cellular network to provide connectivity and long-range communications and efficient communication strategies for transmitting short data packets, particularly in case of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The cellular infrastructure is optimized for high data rates and large data sizes while IoT devices mostly exchange small data packets with high energy efficiency and low data rates. To fully exploit both communication infrastructures together, different strategies related to 5G and Device-to-Device (D2D) communications are proposed in literature. In this paper, we survey these strategies and provide useful considerations for seamless integration of smart city applications in 5G networks. Moreover, we present smart city scenarios, their communication requirements and the potential impact on the life of citizens. Finally, we elaborate big data impact on smart cities with possible security and privacy concerns.},

abstract = {Every major car manufacturer and leading technology company today is pursuing the development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). However, given cities will be most affected by CAVs, there is an urgent need to assess whether our cities are prepared and will respond well to the advancement in CAV technology. This paper proposes the first readiness index to measure the extent to which current cities are ready for CAVs. We consider three key elements in computing a CAV readiness score: a city's policies and regulations, its physical infrastructure, and its cyber infrastructure. We identify 16 major factors related to the key elements contributing to a city's readiness, and compute the readiness index as a weighted average of these factors. Moreover, we collected survey responses regarding the importance of each factor from 13 of the most populous US cities. We also selected a metric for quantifying each factor, and collected the corresponding data from our survey and existing studies. We then leverage decision trees as a machine learning model to predict 52 major US cities' readiness for CAVs. While it is difficult to draw general conclusions on our cities' readiness due to limited data availability, our preliminary study does suggest that there is a big gap between our industry and public's interest in CAVs and the policy and infrastructure support provided by our cities. Most importantly, we believe that the proposed readiness index provides practical guidelines for policy makers and planners to improve their cities' policies and infrastructure to facilitate CAVs.},

abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant loss of global deaths, economical status, and so on. To prevent and control COVID-19, a range of smart, complex, spatially heterogeneous, control solutions, and strategies have been conducted. Earlier classification of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is needed to cure and control the disease. It results in a requirement of secondary diagnosis models, since no precise automated toolkits exist. The latest finding attained using radiological imaging techniques highlighted that the images hold noticeable details regarding the COVID-19 virus. The application of recent artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) approaches integrated to radiological images finds useful to accurately detect the disease. This article introduces a new synergic deep learning (SDL)-based smart health diagnosis of COVID-19 using Chest X-Ray Images. The SDL makes use of dual deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and involves a mutual learning process from one another. Particularly, the representation of images learned by both DCNNs is provided as the input of a synergic network, which has a fully connected structure and predicts whether the pair of input images come under the identical class. Besides, the proposed SDL model involves a fuzzy bilateral filtering (FBF) model to pre-process the input image. The integration of FBL and SDL resulted in the effective classification of COVID-19. To investigate the classifier outcome of the SDL model, a detailed set of simulations takes place and ensures the effective performance of the FBF-SDL model over the compared methods.},

The advancements in deep learning have greatly enhanced visual understanding, but the domain of aerial vision remains largely unexplored. Aerial images pose many unique challenges for performing proper scene parsing such as high-resolution data, small-scaled objects, a large number of objects in the camera view, dense clustering of objects, background clutter, and so on, which greatly hinder the performance of the existing deep learning methods. In this work, we propose ISDNet (Instance Segmentation and Detection Network), a novel network to perform instance segmentation and object detection on visual data captured by UAVs. This work enables aerial image analytics for various needs in a smart city. In particular, we use dilated convolutions to generate improved spatial context, leading to better discrimination between foreground and background features. The proposed network efficiently reuses the segment-mask features by propagating them from early stages using residual connections. Furthermore, ISDNet makes use of effective anchors to accommodate varying object scales and sizes. The proposed method obtains state-of-the-art results in the aerial context.},

abstract = {Developing a “smart city” can follow numerous pathways. Policymakers can follow a technology-focused pathway, a data-driven approach or an environmentally-influenced perspective, among many others. However, following a people-centric smart city developmental path requires a societal approach that involves public engagement and participation as a core developmental philosophy. This requires the city to develop the capacity to widely measure wellbeing and the state of “happiness”, and respond through its public policy frameworks. City-wide innovations using societal big data are making such engagements feasible today. The case of Dubai's “Happiness Agenda” is an example of a smart city initiative that applies a hybrid of big data-driven tools and more traditional approaches in citizen-government interactions. Dubai's transformation plan, is primarily fueled by digital technology and data, with a core focus on public “happiness” and making Dubai one of the “happiest” places to live — as stated in the vision of Smart Dubai Office. Within the smart city framework, such vision entails the challenge of shaping happiness into national policy goals and employing digital technology to apply this vision. This paper reports the findings of semi-structured interviews with the people behind the design of Dubai's Happiness Agenda. The findings highlight the challenges and enablers of developing a people-centric developmental pathway towards “happiness” in the age of big data and smart cities. Even when a positive view towards citizen-engagement exists in government, how can the smart city stakeholders reach a unified definition for happiness in the digital age? How can big data enable the mapping of various needs of a cosmopolitan and culturally diverse society? This paper provides an exploratory case study of citizen-centric and data-driven smart city development initiative, which can provide valuable policy lessons to smart city policymakers and enrich the smart city and e-participation literature.1 },

abstract = {A smart city has recently become an aspiration for many cities around the world. These cities are looking to apply the smart city concept to improve sustainability, quality of life for residents, and economic development. The smart city concept depends on employing a wide range of advanced technologies to improve the performance of various services and activities such as transportation, energy, healthcare, and education, while at the same time improve the city's resources utilization and initiate new business opportunities. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the big data technology. Effective and intelligent use of big data accumulated over time in various sectors can offer many advantages to enhance decision making in smart cities. In this paper we identify the different types of decision making processes involved in smart cities. Then we propose a service-oriented architecture to support big data analytics for decision making in smart cities. This architecture allows for integrating different technologies such as fog and cloud computing to support different types of analytics and decision-making operations needed to effectively utilize available big data. It provides different functions and capabilities to use big data and provide smart capabilities as services that the architecture supports. As a result, different big data applications will be able to access and use these services for varying proposes within the smart city.},

Currently, many cities have released crime-related data as part of an open data initiative. Using this as input, we can apply analytics to be able to predict and hopefully prevent crime in the future. In this work, we applied big data analytics to the San Francisco crime dataset, as collected by the San Francisco Police Department and available through the Open Data initiative. The main focus is to perform an in-depth analysis of the major types of crimes that occurred in the city, observe the trend over the years, and determine how various attributes contribute to specific crimes. Furthermore, we leverage the results of the exploratory data analysis to inform the data preprocessing process, prior to training various machine learning models for crime type prediction. More specifically, the model predicts the type of crime that will occur in each district of the city. We observe that the provided dataset is highly imbalanced, thus metrics used in previous research focus mainly on the majority class, disregarding the performance of the classifiers in minority classes, and propose a methodology to improve this issue. The proposed model finds applications in resource allocation of law enforcement in a Smart City.},

Crucial to transforming a city into a smart city is the collection and access to reliable data. One of the main problems experienced by S.A. cities is the limited access to data, resulting from a traditionally fragmented approach to data collection, sharing and use. Crime-related data is one of the most commonly collected datasets in smart cities. In S.A., crime data is predominantly collected by the S.A. Police Services (SAPS) and security companies. While the latter are not readily available for public use, SAPS crime data is consolidated and disseminated at the national level. Initial data exploration, however, shows that temporal, spatial and structural inconsistencies in the data limits the usefulness of available crime data. In this study, the inconsistencies in SAPS crime data are summarised, and standard data wrangling techniques are implemented and evaluated to clean the data. The study proposes a data wrangling model for S.A. crime data. Furthermore, this study will further developments that could benefit S.A. cities in general as they transform into smart cities.},

abstract = {In the paradigm of smart cities1, video surveillance is becoming a widely-applied technology to help improve the quality of human life in the era of digital living, where pedestrian detection is one of the key components for people-centered smart cities applications including wellbeing, security, traffic guiding, and unmanned vehicles, etc. While so far most surveillance cameras are of low quality resolution for cost-saving reasons, the impact of the image resolution on detection accuracy becomes a concerned issue. Though lower resolution can save the cost as well as the processing time, it has not been clearly reported how the resolution can impact on the detection accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the limit of low-resolution cameras with regards to the accuracy of the pedestrian detection, and experimentally demonstrate its impact on the most widely-applied HOG-SVM pedestrian detector, which is a combination of Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for pedestrian detection. From our experiments, it is found that there is an optimal resolution to balance between speed and accuracy, while we show in our experiments that the resolution has apparent influence on both the accuracy and the computing time.},

abstract = {The traffic monitoring projects responsible for the current traffic monitoring infrastructure utilized by companies and government agencies tend to be very expensive and require difficult and extensive implementation. The challenge and goal of this paper is to create a smaller scale, low cost method of analyzing, controlling, and predicting traffic conditions. Traffic data including car count, frequency, and direction, is gathered from a USB camera and sent to a microcontroller to be interpreted using computer vision libraries. The traffic data is then transferred and stored onto the cloud to be further analyzed. This paper focuses on two aspects of managing traffic. The first aspect involves the optimization of traffic cycles at an intersection using incoming car counts to minimize the wait time between traffic light cycles. The second aspect involves predicting future traffic flow by training a deep neural network utilizing collected traffic data and machine learning techniques.},

abstract = {Smart city simulators are useful tools for simulating various scenarios with the impact of human/non-human factors, and evaluating efficiency and influence of services. Although current simulation platforms have made achievements in aspects like energy consumption modeling and urban planning, there are still gaps in integrating various domains together and involving the randomness of reality at the same time. Thus, we propose an open-source smart city simulator to provide more comprehensive features to satisfy diverse demands in scenario construction, information exchange, and urban services with more similarity to the real world, which can suit the needs of both city designers in plan evaluation and researchers in multi-domain data generation for data-driven models. Functions of the proposed simulator including three main components: (1) basic structure layers for constructing networks with map data, (2) event layers for receiving and exchanging information of (emergency) events, and (3) service layers for providing urban services in transportation, emission, and energy domains and responding to events. To better simulate unexpected circumstances in the real world, the randomness of reality is embodied in the uncertainty of sensing, devices, and events. Finally, two cases are designed in the demo to present functions of different layers and data generation with uncertainty.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a prototype website for traffic, parking and transport in a smart city. Machine Learning (ML) tools are applied to open datasets from the City of Melbourne, Australia to develop a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that provide useful information for the city's managers and citizens. The APIs accessed from this website enable users to query the ML models and obtain answers to questions such as: which parts of the city have the greatest pedestrian traffic, or the availability and cost of parking spots. The freeware tool RStudio was used for Big Data analytics while Machine Learning with Plumber was used to wrap the R code into APIs and Swagger to specify and document them. Postman and Swagger were used for testing while Docker was employed to package the APIs into standard containers for cloud deployment. The prototype website was developed using Wix and deployed on the Nectar cloud. The resulting website provides predictive models for COM traffic, parking, and transport and demonstrates the application of online smart city services for city planners and managers.},

abstract = { The status of air pollution is serious all over the world. Analysing and predicting vehicle energy consumption becomes a major concern. Vehicle energy consumption depends not only on speed but also on a number of external factors such as road topology, traffic, driving style, etc. Obtaining the cost for each link (i.e., link energy consumption) in road networks plays a key role in energy-optimal route planning process. This paper presents a novel framework that identifies vehicle/driving environment-dependent factors to predict energy consumption over a road network based on historical consumption data for different vehicle types. We design a deep-learning-based structure, called DeepFEC, to forecast accurate energy consumption in each and every road in a city based on real traffic conditions. A residual neural network and recurrent neural network are employed to model the spatial and temporal closeness, respectively. Static vehicle data reflecting vehicle type, vehicle weight, engine configuration and displacement are also learned. The outputs of these neural networks are dynamically aggregated to improve the spatially correlated time series data forecasting. Extensive experiments conducted on a diverse fleet consisting of 264 gasoline vehicles, 92 Hybrid Electric Vehicles, and 27 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles/Electric Vehicles drove in Michigan road network, show that our proposed deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prediction algorithms. To make the results reproductible, the code, the used data and details of the experimental setup are made available online at https://github.com/ElmiSay/DeepFEC.},

abstract = {Effective communication with citizens is an important goal of smart cities. To this end the digital age offers many mechanisms to not only enable timely communication, but also bilateral communication. Mechanisms such as blog posts and online press releases allow cities and organisations to leverage these benefits. However, to assess the efficacy of these communication mechanisms, cities need to track the virality of the news they publish. To this end we propose a novel architecture that uses natural language processing techniques to track not only the resharing of the original articles, but also other articles and posts about that article. We have developed a prototype implementation of this article and present the interface as well as the results of performance tests.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a courier dispatching problem (CDP) raised from an online pickup-service platform of Alibaba. The CDP aims to assign a set of couriers to serve pickup requests with stochastic spatial and temporal arrival rate among urban regions. The objective is to maximize the revenue of served requests given a limited number of couriers over a period of time. Many online algorithms such as dynamic matching and vehicle routing strategy from existing literature could be applied to tackle this problem. However, these methods rely on appropriately predefined optimization objectives at each decision point, which is hard in dynamic situations. This paper formulates the CDP as a Markov decision process (MDP) and proposes a data-driven approach to derive the optimal dispatching rule-set under different scenarios. Our method stacks multi-layer images of the spatial-and-temporal map and apply multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques to evolve dispatching models. This method solves the learning inefficiency caused by traditional centralized MDP modeling. Through comprehensive experiments on both artificial dataset and real-world dataset, we show: 1) By utilizing historical data and considering long-term revenue gains, MARL achieves better performance than myopic online algorithms; 2) MARL is able to construct the mapping between complex scenarios to sophisticated decisions such as the dispatching rule. 3) MARL has the scalability to adopt in large-scale real-world scenarios.},

abstract = {Nowadays, rapid urbanization leads to severe urban challenges, e.g., congestion and energy consumption, related to human mobility. To address them, it is essential to (i) measure and predict human mobility based on data from urban infrastructure, and (ii) intervene and alter human mobility with novel services on urban infrastructure, i.e., a Cyber-Physical System approach. However, both existing mobility models and resultant services are built upon the interaction of residents with single infrastructure (e.g., taxis) or multiple infrastructures from single domains (e.g., transportation), which are limited by their homogeneous nature. Fortunately, cross-domain infrastructures and their data from the latest infrastructure expansion enable us to explore real-time interactions between residents and infrastructures across domains. In this talk, we will introduce some of our recent work under cross-domain interactions. },

abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) is a new technology that shapes the future of a world that is rapidly being invaded by smart devices connected to the Internet. Such technology has a great role in developing the idea of a smart city. A smart city is a city that takes advantage of existing infrastructure and integrates it with the Internet of things technology to improve the quality of life. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are distributed geographically around the city to collect data from the environment (i.e.: streets, cars, traffic lights...etc.), process, and manage it to provide intelligent actionable information to citizens. All data transferred through networks of a smart city may be threatened and susceptible to illegal actions such as violation, stealing, and inappropriate use. These security threats affect the privacy and security of users; where hackers can get access to user's data and gain control of their smart homes, cars, medical devices and might even gain control over city traffic lights. All the above enforce the need to have a security system that continuously monitors and tracks all data logs to detect any suspicious activity. In this paper, we propose a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) approach for smart cities by forwarding event logs generated by smart devices to a security operation center that works around the clock to detect security incidents and handle them. Such an approach aims to create a safe smart living environment.},

abstract = {Given N geo-located point instances (e.g., crime or disease cases) in a spatial domain, we aim to detect sub-regions (i.e., hotspots) that have a higher probability density of generating such instances than the others. Hotspot detection has been widely used in a variety of important urban applications, including public safety, public health, urban planning, and equity, among others. The problem is challenging because its societal applications often have low tolerance for false positives and require significance testing that is computationally intensive. In related work, the spatial scan statistic introduced a likelihood ratio--based framework for hotspot evaluation and significance testing. However, it fails to consider the effect of spatial non-determinism, causing many missing detections. Our previous work introduced a non-deterministic normalization--based scan statistic to mitigate this issue. However, its robustness against false positives is not stably controlled. To address these limitations, we propose a unified framework that can improve the completeness of results without incurring more false positives. We also propose a reduction algorithm to improve the computational efficiency. Experiment results confirm that the unified framework can greatly improve the recall of hotspot detection without increasing the number of false positives, and the reduction algorithm can greatly reduce execution time.},

abstract = {The main task of reinforcement learning is to enable the subject to obtain the most reward from the environment. Reinforcement learning has been proposed and achieved certain results. However, many reinforcement learning methods still have inefficiencies that result in inability to meet the demand in some applications. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposed a reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-subnet cluster (MSC-RL). The proposed network consists of multiple subnet clusters and the primary storage network. Each subnet cluster is composed of multiple subnets and one sub-storage network. In the subnet cluster, multiple subnets are used to explore the solution space simultaneously and saves the searched information to the sub-storage network. At regular intervals, the subnet cluster saves the searched information to the primary storage network. In traditional reinforcement learning, there is not enough interaction between the independent subnets. Insufficient information interaction between the independent subnets can cause the algorithm to fall into local optimum. MSC-RL can exchange information searched by each subnet through the sub-storage network to realize information interaction within the subnet cluster. Each cluster uses the primary storage network for information interaction. The method enhances the information interaction between subnets and improves the ability of the algorithm to optimize. This paper uses the Atari game to verify the performance of the proposed method and compared it with some mainstream reinforcement learning methods. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to some mainstream reinforcement learning methods in the performance of the Atari game.},

abstract = {Cities have entered the age of the sensor and located sensors everywhere over and under cities. The sensors monitor a host of factors that assess City operations and life such as air quality, noise, city services and traffic. Further, the sensors have “gone mobile” with announcements of situation aware mobile sensor platforms designed for city-level security and public safety. These wearable sensor platforms combine video, audio, and location data with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. However, the many sensors and functional platforms have not yet made the cities employing these many diverse sensors truly Smart. We are analyzing why the success toward the Smart city is limited, or late in coming. The explanations for the constrained effectiveness are assigned to many factors, but one of significance can be teased from a long-accepted explanation that associates data, information, and knowledge. Smart Cities need to effectively use the sensor data and the information assembled from these interpreted and organized data to create knowledge that serves the city and its people by answering and resolving key problems and questions. But the systems and analytic models needed to associate these data from many sensors have yet to be designed, constructed, and proven in the complex cities of today. Thus, the data (and information from the diverse sensors) lacks crucial integration and coordination for decisions and sense-making. While these sensor-based systems were, and in many cases are meeting some intended functionally discrete goals, they appear to be better described as data collection tools feeding centralized analytical engines. They are point solutions with specialized or targeted sensors feeding specialized solutions. This is a significant limiting factor in a city's drive to improve the quality of life and the efficiency of the services a city provides to its stakeholders. In this paper we present current trends in Smart City development, emerging issues with data and complexity growth, and proposes a mean to leverage the advancing technologies to address the integration problem.},

abstract = {The FI-CONTENT project aims at establishing the foundation of a European infrastructure for developing and testing novel smart city services. The Smart City Services Platform will develop enabling technology for SMEs and developer to create services offering residents and visitors to cities smart services that enhance their city visit or daily life. We have made use of generic, specific and common enablers to develop a reference implementation, the Smart City Guide web app. The basic information is provided by the Open City Database, an open source specific enabler that can be used for any city in Europe. Recommendation as a Service is an enabler that can be applied to lots use cases, here we describe how we integrated it into the Smart City Guide. The uses cases will be iteratively improved and upgraded during regular iterative cycles based on feedback gained in lab and field trials at the experimentation sites. As the app is transferable to any city, it will be tested at a number of experimentation sites.},

abstract = {Proliferation of IoT (Internet of Things) and sensor technology has expedited the realization of Smart City. To enable necessary functions, sensors distributed across the city generate a huge volume of stream data that are crucial for controlling Smart City devices. However, due to conditions such as wears and tears, battery drain, or malicious attacks, not all data are reliable even when they are accurately measured. These data could lead to invalid and devastating consequences (e.g., failed utility or transportation services). The assessment of data reliability is necessary and challenging especially for Smart City, as it has to keep up with velocity of big data stream to provide up-to-date results. Most research on data reliability has focused on data fusion and anomaly detection that lack a quantified measure of how much the data over a period of time are adequately reliable for decision-makings. This paper alleviates these issues and presents an online approach to assessing Big stream data reliability in a timely manner. By employing a well-studied evidence-based theory, our approach provides a computational framework that assesses data reliability in terms of belief likelihoods. The framework is lightweight and easy to scale, deeming fit for streaming data. We evaluate the approach using a real application of light sensing data of 1,323,298 instances. The preliminary results are consistent with logical rationales, confirming validity of the approach.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning is a promising paradigm in addressing complex sequential decision-making problems, which has attracted increasing attention from various domains. In this paper, we investigated the plausibility of employing reinforcement learning algorithms to address the task of rocket recycling on the offshore platform. It is widely acknowledged recycling rockets is a tough but significant control problem, and the promotion in recycling probability would directly reduce the expense in aerospace engineering. Considering the complexity of controlling the rocket dynamically, we formulated recycling problem and applied a series of reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize the recycling process. Based on the result of experiments in the simulated environment, we found DDPO and A3C algorithms outperformed other commonly used reinforcement learning algorithms. Besides, we respectively analyzed the algorithms and corresponding results and the superior performance with DDPO and A3C algorithms demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement algorithm in solving the recycling problem. In the future, we would design novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm to improve the performance of rocket recycling.},
