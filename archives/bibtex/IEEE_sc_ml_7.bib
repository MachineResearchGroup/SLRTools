abstract={As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications increases, the capacity of the IoT access networks is considerably stressed. This can create significant performance bottlenecks in various layers of an end-to-end communication path, including the scheduling of the spectrum, the resource requirements for processing the IoT data at the Edge and/or Cloud, and the attainable delay for critical emergency scenarios. Thus, it is required to classify or predict the time varying traffic characteristics of the IoT devices. However, this classification remains at large an open challenge. Most of the existing solutions are based on machine learning techniques, which nonetheless present high computational cost while non considering the fine-grained flow characteristics. To this end, in this paper we design a two-stage classification framework that utilizes both the network and statistical features to characterize the IoT devices in the context of a smart city. We firstly perform the data cleaning and preprocessing of the data and then analyze the dataset to extract the network and statistical features set for different types of IoT devices. The evaluation results show that the proposed classification can achieve 99% accuracy as compared to other techniques with Mathews Correlation Coefficient of 0.96.},

abstract={The increasing abuse of image editing software causes the authenticity of digital images questionable. Meanwhile, the widespread availability of online social networks (OSNs) makes them the dominant channels for transmitting forged images to report fake news, propagate rumors, etc. Unfortunately, various lossy operations, e.g., compression and resizing, adopted by OSNs impose great challenges for implementing the robust image forgery detection. To fight against the OSN-shared forgeries, in this work, a novel robust training scheme is proposed. Firstly, we design a baseline detector, which won the top ranking in a recent certificate forgery detection competition. Then we conduct a thorough analysis of the noise introduced by OSNs, and decouple it into two parts, i.e., predictable noise and unseen noise, which are modelled separately. The former simulates the noise introduced by the disclosed (known) operations of OSNs, while the latter is designed to not only complete the previous one, but also take into account the defects of the detector itself. We further incorporate the modelled noise into a robust training framework, significantly improving the robustness of the image forgery detector. Extensive experimental results are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared with several state-of-the-art competitors, especially in the scenarios of detecting OSN-transmitted forgeries. Finally, to promote the future development of the image forgery detection, we build a public forgeries dataset based on four existing datasets through the uploading and downloading of four most popular OSNs. The data and code of this work are available at https://github.com/HighwayWu/ImageForensicsOSN.},

abstract={In Machine Learning an ensemble refers to the combination of several classifiers with the objective of improving the performance of every one of its counterparts. To design an ensemble two main aspects must be considered: how to create a diverse set of classifiers and how to combine their outputs. This work focuses on the latter task. More specifically, we focus on the usage of aggregation functions based on fuzzy measures, such as the Sugeno and Choquet integrals, since they allow to model the coalitions and interactions among the members of the ensemble. In this scenario the challenge is how to construct a fuzzy measure that models the relations among the members of the ensemble. We focus on unsupervised methods for fuzzy measure construction, review existing alternatives and categorize them depending on their features. Furthermore, we intend to address the weaknesses of previous alternatives by proposing a new construction method that obtains the fuzzy measure directly evaluating the performance of each possible subset of classifiers, which can be efficiently computed. To test the usefulness of the proposed fuzzy measure, we focus on the application of ensembles for imbalanced datasets. We consider a set of 66 imbalanced datasets and develop a complete experimental study comparing the reviewed methods and our proposal.},

abstract={Crop health is the foundation for agricultural development. In some area, due to the lack of professional botanical experts, it is difficult to correctly diagnose the plant disease in the work of planting. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network structure that can reliably classify plant types and plant disease using a single image of plant leaf which enables the end-to-end diagnosis of plant disease. Our proposed model consists of two sub-models, a leaf segmentation model that employs a U-Net to separate the leaves in the original image from the background which effectively eliminates interference, and a plant disease classification model based on our proposed Two-head network that classifies plant diseases with the features extracted by various popular pre-trained models. We verified our model using the plant disease dataset with 8 plant species and 19 plant diseases provided by AI Challenger 2019. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model achieves a 0.9807 accuracy of plant classification and a 0.8745 accuracy of disease recognition. We believe that the technology in our model has great potential to become the basis of fully automatic reliable plant disease classification system which can be embedded into portable devices to assist farmers in the future.},

Hence, our focus in this paper is on object detection, which can potentially enhance autonomous driving and other types of automation in transportation systems. This impacts Smart Mobility in Smart Cities. We provide expanded analysis of recent object detection techniques including neural models, deep learning and related advances. We highlight a novel object detection system called YOLO (You Only Look Once) and conduct its performance evaluation on real-time data. We point out challenges in this field and then explore the use of Commonsense Knowledge (CSK) in object detection with neural models and deep learning, emphasizing the importance of CSK to capture intuitive human reasoning.

abstract={Proactive traffic management is a subset of smart mobility applications in which traffic control strategies are implemented in advance to respond to anticipated roadway conditions. Predicted traffic flows are a key input to proactive traffic control systems, such as proactive freeway ramp metering, proactive variable speed limits, and proactive incident management systems. This paper proposes a machine learning approach for short-term traffic flow prediction where prevailing conditions, such as the traffic volume, speed, and occupancy of roadway segments, are used to predict traffic flow in short-term intervals. Four categories of predictive methods for traffic flow prediction were investigated: deep neural networks, a distributed random forest, a gradient boosting machine, and a generalized linear model. Data from Interstate 64 in St. Louis, Missouri, in the United States were used to calibrate and evaluate the models. The results obtained by the four predictive methods were very similar, with the distributed random forest model slightly outperforming the models obtained by the other three methods. The case study showed that the inclusion of traffic flow, speed, occupancy, and time of day in the traffic prediction process reduces the traffic prediction error. However, the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test did not show a statistically significant benefit from the inclusion of upstream traffic data in the distributed random forest, and gradient boosting machine models.},

abstract={the task of road extraction from remote sensing imagery faces many challenges, traditional methods require complex extracting processes with relatively low precision. Deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network, VggNet, AlexNet, GoogleNet can obtain higher accuracy of road extraction, but requires lots of computing resources, training time and unsatisfactory real-time performance. Based on the reasons mentioned above, this paper proposes an optimized residual network with block-soft clustering (ORNBSC) for road extraction from remote sensing imagery. The block-soft clustering module aims at extracting essential features from satellite images and reducing the dimensionality, therefore accelerating the extraction speed. Meanwhile, the residual neural network module to improve the accuracy of extraction. Groups of experiments using Massachusetts roads dataset demonstrate that the ORNBSC model achieves better performance than traditional methods on precision of road extraction from remote sensing imagery.},

abstract={Urban commerce and its distribution have always been an important part of urban research. However, most previous studies were based on statistical data and did not reflect real street experience. Thanks to the Street View image and deep learning technology, researchers are able to carry out large scale studies from real human visual experience. In this article, we aim at sensing the commercial spaces in cities. In order to achieve this ultimate goal, deep learning is applied to process the raw data of Street View image. We disassemble the goal into three tasks: firstly, obtaining all the Street View images in a specific area; then classifying the Street View images according to the commercial facilities in it; and finally creating a visualization of the detected data into a map. For the first task, we get the road network coordinate information from the openstreetmap (OSM) website, set the sampling point on the road, and then download the Street View images of the sampling points' coordinate through the API provided by Baidumap. For the second task, we adopt a two-level learning strategy rather than directly using Deep Convolutional Neural Network for classification. For the final task, we choose the heat map as the expression of the results and draw the map by the existing GIS software. Furthermore, the results from this study can be conveniently combined with other data because of the use of street-network-based data structure. An application of this method combines with street-network data, the calculation of a city's 15-minute commercial service circle coverage is also shown in this study.},

abstract={Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is a significant part of smart city, and short-term traffic flow prediction plays an important role in intelligent transportation management and route guidance. A number of models and algorithms based on time series prediction and machine learning were applied to short-term traffic flow prediction and achieved good results. However, most of the models require the length of the input historical data to be predefined and static, which cannot automatically determine the optimal time lags. To overcome this shortage, a model called Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) is proposed in this paper, which takes advantages of the three multiplicative units in the memory block to determine the optimal time lags dynamically. The dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) is used for building the model and comparing LSTM RNN with several well-known models, such as random walk(RW), support vector machine(SVM), single layer feed forward neural network(FFNN) and stacked autoencoder(SAE). The results show that the proposed prediction model achieves higher accuracy and generalizes well.},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are integral parts of smart cities and critical to modern societies. Despite indisputable opportunities introduced by disruptor technologies, they proliferate the cybersecurity threat landscape, which is increasingly more hostile. The quantum of sensors utilised by ICS aided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables data collection capabilities to facilitate automation, process streamlining and cost reduction. However, apart from operational use, the sensors generated data combined with AI can be innovatively utilised to model anomalous behaviour as part of layered security to increase resilience to cyber-attacks. We introduce a framework to profile anomalous behaviour in ICS and derive a cyber-risk score. A novel super learner ensemble for one-class classification is developed, using overlapping rolling windows with stratified, k-fold, n-repeat cross-validation applied to each base-learner followed by majority voting to derive the best learner. Our approach is demonstrated on a liquid distribution sensor dataset. The experimental results reveal that the proposed technique achieves an overall F1-score of 99.13%, an anomalous recall score of 99% detecting anomalies lasting only 17 seconds. The key strength of the framework is the low computational complexity and error rate. The framework is modular, generic, applicable to other ICS and transferable to other smart city sectors.},

A drone detection and identification (DDI) system is one of the ways of detecting and identifying the presence of a drone in an area. DDI systems can employ different sensing techniques such as radio frequency (RF) signals, video, sounds, and thermal imaging for detecting an intruding drone. In this work, we propose a machine learning RF-based DDI system that uses low band RF signals from drone-to-flight controller communication. We develop three machine learning models using the XGBoost algorithm to detect and identify the presence of a drone, the type of the drone, and the operational mode of drones. For these three XGBoost models, we evaluated the models using 10-fold cross validation and we achieve average accuracy of 99.96%, 90.73%, and 70.09% respectively.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted much interest due to its wide applications, such as smart city, manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare. Social and cognitive IoT is capable of exploiting social networking characteristics to optimize network performance. Considering the fact that the IoT devices have different Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements [ranging from ultrareliable and low-latency communications (URLLCs) to minimum data rate], this article presents a QoS-driven social-aware-enhanced device-to-device (D2D) communication network model for social and cognitive IoT by utilizing social orientation information. We model the optimization problem as a multiagent reinforcement learning formulation, and a novel coordinated multiagent deep-reinforcement-learning-based resource management approach is proposed to optimize the joint radio block assignment and the transmission power control strategy. Meanwhile, the prioritized experience replay (PER) and the coordinated learning mechanisms are employed to enable communication links to work cooperatively in a distributed manner, which enhances the network performance and access success probability. The simulation results corroborate the superiority in the performance of the presented resource management approach, and it outperforms other existing approaches in terms of meeting the energy efficiency and the QoS requirements.},

The advances in the Internet of Things (IoTs) and social networking services help people understand the dynamics of cities. Traffic event detection is an important while complex task in transportation modeling and management of smart cities. In this paper, we address the task of detecting traffic events using two types of data, i.e. physical sensor observations and social media text. Unlike most existing studies focused on either analysing sensor observations or social media data, we identify traffic events with both types of data that may complement each other. We propose a Multi-modal Neural Network (MMN) to process sensor observations and social media texts simultaneously and detect traffic events. We evaluate our model with a real-world CPS dataset consisting of sensor observations, event reports, and tweets collected from Twitter about San Francisco over a period of 4 months. The evaluation shows promising results and provides insights into the analysis of multi-modal data for detecting traffic events.},

abstract={Digital twins are quickly becoming a popular tool in several domains, taking advantage of recent advancements in the Internet of Things, Machine Learning and Big Data, while being used by both the industry sector and the research community. In this paper, we review the current research landscape as regards digital twins in the field of smart cities, while also attempting to draw parallels with the application of digital twins in Industry 4.0. Although digital twins have received considerable attention in the Industrial Internet of Things domain, their utilization in smart cities has not been as popular thus far. We discuss here the open challenges in the field and argue that digital twins in smart cities should be treated differently and be considered as cyber-physical “systems of systems”, due to the vastly different system size, complexity and requirements, when compared to other recent applications of digital twins. We also argue that researchers should utilize established tools and methods of the smart city community, such as co-creation, to better handle the specificities of this domain in practice.},

abstract={Garbage disposal is a very important task in a healthy and green environment. With spreading awareness among the citizens of India regarding the importance of a clean environment to decrease the consumption of natural resources and garbage disposal, the recycling industry is booming. The quantity of generated trash in day-to-day life is affecting land, water, and air which causes a serious threat to the aquatic species and their surroundings and ultimately to humans if not managed properly. Conventional garbage disposal systems are on the rise and need accurate and efficient segmentation and recognition mechanisms. This demand coincides with the increase of computational capabilities of modern computer architectures and more effective algorithms for image recognition. To deal with this problem the garbage classification process is automated by building an image classifier using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and thereby decrease the time for the waste segregation and make it cost-effective. The idea behind making the process automated is to decrease human intervention and make this waste segregation process more productive. In this work, three different models are being tested for higher accuracy: Simple CNN, ResNet50, and VGG16 trained on various datasets of images, these are used to extract features from images and feed them into a classifier for dump/trash classification. The trained models are then fed to a mobile application that captures pictures in the real-time using camera. The experimental results conclude the performance of VGG16 using Transfer Learning being significantly higher than all other models for the purpose of Trash Classification and the performance of Simple CNN being better for Dump Classification.},

abstract={In future smart cities, understanding people flow is essential for a wide variety of applications such as urban planning and event detection. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate low of pedestrians walking on the sidewalks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy with wide area coverage at low cost. For this purpose, we use dashboard cameras (dashcams) recently wide-spreading for providing evidence on accidents, etc. Our method combines Deep Learning-based pedestrian detection and model-based tracking to overcome the challenges of frequent occlusion (overlaps of objects in images) and false positives. In pedestrian detection, faces and backs of heads are separately detected to understand moving directions of pedestrians as well as their existence by applying CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory). Then, the trajectories of the detected bounding boxes are estimated based on location and color similarities with the knowledge about moving speeds of vehicles and pedestrians. Through the evaluation using real dashcam videos, we have confirmed that our method works well, showing within ±13.6% mean absolute error rate of bi-directional people low estimation.},

abstract={In order to overcome the problems of high bit error rate of QPSK demodulation under low signal-to-noise ratio in traditional modulation pattern recognition methods, a new QPSK demodulation method under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio based on convolutional neural network is proposed. This method inputs the IQ signal into the denoise network, and then the convolution neural network is used for demodulation. The loss function is the cross entropy of the demodulated symbol sequence and the original symbol sequence multiplied by the transmitter RF signal and the denoise of the receiver. On the basis of the above, through this method, the bit error rate of QPSK demodulation when the signal-to-noise ratio is in a relatively low state can be effectively reduced. Simulation results show that this method can effectively reduce the bit error rate under the condition of low signal-to-noise ratio. When the SNR is -20dB, the average bit error rate is 6.98%, which is 38.85% lower than traditional coherent demodulation.},

abstract={The smart surveillance system is one of the most important services provided in a smart city. The smart surveillance applications are equipped with camera sensors to automatically detect and identify potential regions through automated object detection methods. Usually, such methods require high-complexity image processing techniques and algorithms. Hence, the design of low-complexity automated object detection algorithms becomes an important topic in this area. We consider a foreground extraction and deep learning to achieve these goals. A novel unified technique is proposed to detect a moving object from the surveillance videos based on CPU (central processing units). Unlike most of the existing methods that are relying on pixel information, we use a block-based texture and spatial-temporal information. We use this method to determine the area of the detected moving object(s) only. Furthermore, the area will be processed through a deep learning-based image classification in GPU (graphics processing units) in order to ensure high efficiency and accuracy. It cannot only help to detect object rapidly and accurately, but also can reduce big data volume needed to be stored in smart surveillance systems.},

abstract={Real-time, robust and reliable traffic surveillance is one of the important requirements to improve urban traffic control systems and eliminate congestions. One of the major drawbacks with the existing traffic surveillance infrastructure is the need for storing and transmitting the huge video data before processing it. In this paper, we focus to enable the intelligence of traffic system as well as eliminate the need for storing and transmitting big data. To achieve this, we propose a real-time system called traffic pattern collection and analysis model (TPCAM) that aims at collecting and generating the statistics of traffic data at intersections. The system employs deep learning models and real-time algorithms to process live traffic information on a resource constrained embedded platform. However, the achievable frame rate on the most advanced embedded systems (NVIDIA Jetson TX2) is only 3 FPS, which is too low to capture the full moving trace of the vehicles. To improve the frame rate, we further propose deep object tracking algorithm leveraging adaptive multi-modal models and make it robust to object occlusions and varying lighting conditions. Based on the deep learning based detection and tracking, we can achieve pseudo-30FPS via adaptive key frame selection.},

In this paper, we present a novel deep learning technique for detecting attacks within the IoT network using Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (BLSTM RNN). A multi-layer Deep Learning Neural Network is trained using a novel benchmark data set: UNSWNB15. This paper focuses on the binary classification of normal and attack patterns on the IoT network. The experimental outcomes show the efficiency of our proposed model with regard to precision, recall, f-1 score and FAR. Our proposed BLSTM model achieves over 95% accuracy in attack detection. The experimental outcome shows that BLSTM RNN is highly efficient for building high accuracy intrusion detection model and offers a novel research methodology.},

abstract={Advancements in deep neural networks has led to the extensive implementation of machine learning models for inferencing and analytics on data especially in smart city projects. Object detection algorithm is one of well-known application of deep neural network. Given how computationally expensive these operations are, there is a growing need for methods to reduce the effort of running these complex algorithms on resource-constrained embedded devices which are typically used in IoT applications. Recently, a computing paradigm called fog computing which extends the cloud computing paradigm to the network edge has captured the attention of researchers and industrial organizations alike. This paper investigates the possibilities of implementing Fog Computing using a novel layer-wise partitioning scheme as a solution to reduce the effort of running deep inferencing for object detection algorithms on embedded IoT devices. Results show that the proposed solution is potential in comparison with cloud and single node based system.},

abstract={Smart cities are a growing paradigm in the design of systems that interact with one another for informed and efficient decision making, empowered by data and technology, of resources in a city. The diffusion of information to citizens in a smart city will rely on social trends and smart advertisement. Online social networks (OSNs) are prominent and increasingly important platforms to spread information, observe social trends, and advertise new products. To maximize the benefits of such platforms in sharing information, many groups invest in finding ways to maximize the expected number of clicks as a proxy of these platform's performance. As such, the study of click-through rate (CTR) prediction of advertisements, in environments like online social media, is of much interest. Prior works build machine learning (ML) using user-specific data to classify whether a user will click on an advertisement or not. For our work, we consider a large set of Facebook advertisement data (with no user data) and categorize targeted interests into thematic groups we call conceptual nodes. ML models are trained using the advertisement data to perform CTR prediction with conceptual node combinations. We then cast the problem of finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes as an optimization problem. Given a certain budget k, we are interested in finding the optimal combination of conceptual nodes that maximize the CTR. We discuss the hardness and possible NP-hardness of the optimization problem. Then, we propose a greedy algorithm and a genetic algorithm to find near-optimal combinations of conceptual nodes in polynomial time, with the genetic algorithm nearly matching the optimal solution. We observe that simple ML models can exhibit the high Pearson correlation coefficients w.r.t. click predictions and real click values. Additionally, we find that the conceptual nodes of “politics”, “celebrity”, and “organization” are notably more influential than other considered conceptual nodes.},

abstract={Smart cities and societies are driving unprecedented technological and socioeconomic growth in everyday life albeit making us increasingly vulnerable to infinitely and incomprehensibly diverse threats. Short Message Service (SMS) spam is one such threat that can affect mobile security by propagating malware on mobile devices. A security breach could also cause a mobile device to send spam messages. Many works have focused on classifying incoming SMS messages. This paper proposes a tool to detect spam from outgoing SMS messages, although the work can be applied to both incoming and outgoing SMS messages. Specifically, we develop a system that comprises multiple machine learning (ML) based classifiers built by us using three classification methods -- Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes Multinomial (NBM)- and five preprocessing and feature extraction methods. The system is built to allow its execution in cloud, fog or edge layers, and is evaluated using 15 datasets built by 4 widely-used public SMS datasets. The system detects spam SMSs and gives recommendations on the spam filters and classifiers to be used based on user preferences including classification accuracy, True Negatives (TN), and computational resource requirements.},

abstract={Recycling waste is valuable waste due to its potential to be used as raw material. According to our observation and data collection at the Bangsaen Beach, Saensuk City, Chon Buri Province, Thailand, a lot of valuable waste is being thrown away instead of being collected and separated properly. This leads to not only the raw material problem but also the environmental pollution. We found out that the 2 main reasons cause people do not litter their waste appropriately are 1) they lack of basic knowledge how to separate the valuable waste correctly, and 2) they lack of motivation to separate the valuable waste. From this point of view, we designed a holistic waste management system that tries to tackle these problems using modern Information Technology. The system consists of 2 parts; the first one is the software design and implementation including web-based waste management application and mobile-application-based rewarding system; whereas the second one is the hardware design and implementation based on Internet of Things and Machine Learning technology. This part can recognize and separate 3 kinds of waste automatically, namely glass bottles, plastic bottles, and metal cans. The system is tested and it functions as expected. It can separate the mentioned 3 kinds of waste with good results. The rewarding system on mobile application allows the people to collect the points and get rewarded. This motivates them to litter their waste properly.},

abstract={With the massive deployment of 5G cellular infrastructures, traffic prediction has become an indispensable part of the cellular resource management system in order to provide reliable and fast communication services that can meet the increasing quality-of-service requirements of smart city. A promising approach for handling this problem is to introduce intelligent methods to implement a highly effective and efficient cellular traffic prediction model. Meanwhile, integrating the multiaccess edge computing framework in 5G cellular networks facilitates the application of intelligent traffic prediction models by enabling their implementation at the network edge. However, the data shortage and privacy issues may still be obstacles for training a robust and accurate prediction model at the edge. To address these issues, we propose a data-augmentation-based cellular traffic prediction model (ctGAN-S2S), where an effective data augmentation submodel based on generative adversarial networks is proposed to improve the prediction performance while protecting data privacy, and a long-short-term-memory-based sequence-to-sequence submodel is used to achieve the flexible multistep cellular traffic prediction. The experimental results on a real-world city-scale cellular traffic dataset reveal that our ctGAN-S2S model achieves up to 48.49% improvement of the prediction accuracy compared to four typical reference models.},

abstract={Bike sharing systems are widely operated in many cities as a green transportation means to solve the last mile problem and to reduce traffic congestion. One of the key challenges in operating high quality bike sharing systems is rebalancing bike stations from being full or empty. To this end, operators usually need to foresee the bike demands and schedule trucks to reposition bikes among stations. However, an accurate prediction of city-wide bike demands is not trivial due to the spatial correlation and temporal dependency of user mobility dynamics. Moreover, finding an optimal station rebalancing strategy from potentially enormous candidates is challenging given resource optimization objectives. In this work, we propose a two-phase framework to accurately predict city-wide bike demands and effectively rebalance bikes stations leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. First, we build a spatiotemporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) to model and predict city-wide bike demands, simultaneously capturing the spatial correlation by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and the temporal dependency by Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Then, we formulate the truck-based station rebalancing problem as an optimization problem with transportation cost objectives, and effectively solve the problem with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) algorithm. Experiments on real-world datasets from New York City validate the performance of the proposed framework, reducing 13% of prediction error and 5% of transportation cost compared with the baseline methods.},

Therefore, the ongoing trends consist in finding new methods which are less intrusive while being accurate and computer efficient. To that end, we introduce an ingenious way to assist the elderly and people with cognitive impairment in their daily life using emotions through facial expressions. Our hypothesis assumes the correlation between expressed emotions and the resulting errors in daily activities. In order to verify it, we introduce an experimentation protocol with neurotypical subjects. In this paper, we mainly focus on designing an approach for facial expression recognition using Convolutional Neural Network. The carried experiments with benchmark datasets provided promising results. In fact, the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods in terms of accuracy. Moreover, our approach has been implemented in an embedded system with limited resources. The main objective of this paper is to provide an effective approach recognizing facial expressions that will be used for our further experimentations.},

The SDN network comprises single point failure vulnerability mainly at central controller unit, the deployment of standalone legacy IDS sensors cannot guarantee for safeguard against intruders. Therefore, in the first stage of proposed work, a signature-based Snort IDS is implemented for malicious activity detection and traffic monitoring with traffic mirroring in Open vSwitch (OVS), then store in csv log file of Barnyard 2. In second stage, for the purpose of effective attack detection in the test-bed, a flowbased anomaly detection is deployed with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to improve the signature-based IDS limitation with higher detection rate with low false-positive triggers. To assess the efficacy of our proposed collaborative detection technique, a testbed is developed to simulate malicious and benign traffic. From the simulation results, our collaborative detection mechanism achieved more than 90% true positive rate with less than 5% of false alarms for all TCP, UDP and ICMP attacks in general, demonstrating effective malicious traffic detection method as compared to conventional signature based methodologies.},

However, reinforcement learning-based hybrid DVFS techniques for Mixed Task sets are hardly investigated, considering Linux operating systems targeted on embedded platforms. This paper illustrates an experimental analysis of an energy reduction technique using hybrid learning-based DVFS methodology for Mixed Task sets on Linux Embedded Platforms with ARM and Intel architectures. We analyze the hybrid DVFS approach using reinforcement learning to handle a Mixed Task set on Linux platforms and evaluate the algorithms on various real-time devices. Results show that we can successfully apply the extended hybrid DVFS technique on real-time Linux embedded platforms, i.e., Dell Laptop, Raspberry Pi, and Beagle Bone Platform, all focusing on energy saving. Over 3% energy savings can be achieved for a standard real-time scheduling mechanism without any penalty in application throughput. We believe that our implementation might potentially lead to a number of innovative applications that use Learning-based DVFS algorithms targeted on Linux real embedded hardware.},

abstract={Posing a threat to a large portion of the population on a worldwide scale, breast cancer is now a deleterious pandemic. Chances of survival greatly improve if detected early, giving us impetus to contribute to various methods of detection from a technical perspective. A tool used to detect and diagnose breast-related diseases is a digital mammogram. The main purpose of this paper is to detect the probability of early stage breast cancer detection using mammography images. These mammograms were pre-processed using CLAHE technique. In order to detect masses from the aforementioned mammograms, a hybrid approach has been employed: combining a neural network with a linear classifier. Deep Learning model VGG16, based on convolutional neural networks which are efficient for image processing, was used for feature extraction, which were then fed into linear classifiers. Linear classifiers are also efficient, especially for rich data in terms of training and testing. Using this approach, the results of the mammogram were classified as normal or abnormal, with normal indicating that no tumour was present, abnormal indicating that a tumour (benign or malignant), calcifications, circumscribed, spiculated or other masses, distortions, or asymmetry may be present. This method was fairly successful in classifying mammograms as normal or abnormal correctly.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Uber and Didi, car-hailing services have had significant societal impacts.

Researchers try to recognize human emotions effectively to protect the passenger's personal safety. Most of the current approaches are intrusive to passengers, e.g. using camera to capture passenger's facial expression or identifying conversation between passenger and driver. In this paper, we study the intonation and speed of speech signal to recognize three emotions, which are 'Neutrality', 'Happiness' and 'Anger'. Our proposed method contains two stages to make classification. In stage one, we distinguish between passenger and driver using unsupervised spectral clustering method. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our method is superior to representative off-the-shelf methods. In stage two, we propose a CNNs-based emotion recognition method. The results demonstrate that the model has the ability to effectively recognize different emotions, which the accuracy attains 78.14%.},

abstract={Road accidents and deaths has been a major concern all over the world. There is never a day where there is no news about road accidents and deaths.

The proposed system is a part of Intelligent Transport System(ITS) which can pave way as one of the dimension of a Smart City. The work here mainly focus on the challenges that could be tackled to avoid road accidents by introducing an alert system to detect the traffic signs while driving and also assist drivers with low vision.

As a sub-field o f s mart cities, waste management, and related waste transformations study and plan waste collection, disposal, and recycling. Especially, waste to energy transformation composes the major part of waste disposal. Predicting the energy to be obtained from waste and planning the energy supply accordingly depend on estimating the amount of waste and knowing its content. However, energy prediction from solid waste suffers from weak forecasting models, which lead to misguided management strategies in smart cities. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies like low-power, wide-area networking protocol (LoRaWAN) offer new opportunities to collect, monitor, and analyze data in smart cities, including waste management. In this study, we propose the LoRaWAN-aided Waste-to-Energy Concept Model to build the waste-to-energy prediction model with the provided smart city use case using LoRa network as an underlying data collection step. Consequently, we benefit from the pre-trained Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) model whose process details are provided in our previous study, to predict municipal solid waste using daily data along with other relevant variables such as temperature.},

We argue that the ability is mainly due to the incorporation of a scene prior knowledge and visible object-relational reasoning. In this study, we propose a target-driven model by incorporating ground truth prior knowledge to navigate in a human-inspired way. We realize this approach by constructing a scene graph, which provides scene object spatial relationships through object relation detection. To imitate human reasonability, we propose to incorporate the prior with Markov model for predicting next best action and concatenate it into policy network which improves model generalization in seen and unseen scenes. Moreover, we perform experiments on the AI2THOR virtual environment [1] and outperform the current most state-of-the-art both in success rate and SPL (Success weighted by Path Length) on average.},

abstract={The paper is motivated by the importance of the Smart Cities (SC) concept for future management of global urbanization and energy consumption. Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an efficient solution to utilize large amount of sensory data provided by the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure of the SCs for city-wide decision making and managing demand response. Conventional ModelFree (MF) and Model-Based (MB) RL algorithms, however, use a fixed reward model to learn the value function rendering their application challenging for ever changing SC environments. Successor Representations (SR)-based techniques are attractive alternatives that address this issue by learning the expected discounted future state occupancy, referred to as the SR, and the immediate reward of each state. SR-based approaches are, however, mainly developed for single agent scenarios and have not yet been extended to multi-agent settings. The paper addresses this gap and proposes the Multi-Agent Adaptive Kalman Filtering-based Successor Representation (MAKF-SR) framework. The proposed framework can adapt quickly to the changes in a multi-agent environment faster than the MF methods and with a lower computational cost compared to MB algorithms. The proposed MAKF-SR is evaluated through a comprehensive set of experiments illustrating superior performance compared to its counterparts.},

abstract={Studies on underwater target recognition have been making impressive progress recently due to the application of many deep learning methods. However, when the test set and training set contain different marine background noises, the performance of the trained model deteriorates. According to our observations, such problem cannot be solved by traditional noise reduction techniques and alleviating overfitting. Considering the complexity of marine background noise and the dissimilarity in transmission channels under different marine conditions, we first compare various marine conditions to different generalized channels so that this problem can be compared to channel mismatch in the field of speaker recognition. Inspired by domain adaptation and channel compensation, we propose a Generalized Channel-Invariant Network (GCIN), which uses a gradient reversal layer (GRL) and an adversarial training framework to eliminate the dissimilarity in the received data caused by various marine conditions and then a more robust model is obtained. Experiments on two multi-target and multi-marine-condition datasets confirmed that compared with other CNN-based methods that do not use GRL, GCIN can not only effectively alleviate the mismatch problem under marine conditions within given range, increase by 15% when the training set and test set are mismatched, but also improve the accuracy by at least 2.2% when two sets are matched.},

abstract={It is unclear whether socioeconomic factors affect the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases in China. This article uses generalized linear model and generalized additive model to analyze the relationship between socioeconomic factors and infectious diseases. Studies have shown that both models can reflect the relationship between socioeconomic factors and infectious diseases, but generalized additive model has better goodness of fit. Nationwide, considering the impact of a single economic and social factor on the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases, the GDP Per capita, age structure of population, local fiscal budgetary receipts and proportion of higher education have a significant impact on the incidence rate of five diseases (p<; 0.01). Considering the combined effects of multiple economic and social factors on the incidence, two diseases of pulmonary tuberculosis and cerebrospinal meningitis are significantly affected by various economic and social factors, which are significantly greater than scarlet fever, measles and pertussis. We believe that the incidence of infectious diseases is related to socioeconomic factors, but the influence curves between socioeconomic factors and disease incidence are not in the same direction, and are often nonlinear. In addition, we found that the impact of socioeconomic factors on diseases varies greatly among different regions.},

abstract={Due to the increase of the population and car ownership level, car-related problems which represented by traffic congestion and air pollution are caused. Parking problem is one of the most significant issues of them. Especially, long cruising time for parking spaces causes enormous economic cost. Thanks to recent IoT (Internet of Things) technology, it becomes possible to monitor availability of parking lots and some cities are providing monitored information to drivers. This system makes drivers to find parking spots easier than before. Nevertheless, there is a controversy over quality and quantity of availability information. Because of update interval and network delay, provided information is different from the real-time status (quality issues). Plus, there are still many unmonitored parking lots of which availability information couldn’t be read (quantity issues). In this paper, we propose two prediction models for qualitative and quantitative improvement of parking availability information. The proposed solution is evaluated using one month of occupancy rate data, publicly available from Seattle Department of Transportation.},

pages={1-6},
abstract={Deep neural networks have achieved near-human accuracy levels in various types of classification and prediction tasks including images, text, speech, and video data. However, the networks continue to be treated mostly as black-box function approximators, mapping a given input to a classification output. The next step in this human-machine evolutionary process - incorporating these networks into mission critical processes such as medical diagnosis, planning and control - requires a level of trust association with the machine output. Typically, statistical metrics are used to quantify the uncertainty of an output. However, the notion of trust also depends on the visibility that a human has into the working of the machine. In other words, the neural network should provide human-understandable justifications for its output leading to insights about the inner workings. We call such models as interpretable deep networks. Interpretability is not a monolithic notion. In fact, the subjectivity of an interpretation, due to different levels of human understanding, implies that there must be a multitude of dimensions that together constitute interpretability. In addition, the interpretation itself can be provided either in terms of the low-level network parameters, or in terms of input features used by the model. In this paper, we outline some of the dimensions that are useful for model interpretability, and categorize prior work along those dimensions. In the process, we perform a gap analysis of what needs to be done to improve model interpretability.},

The IoT allows articles to be detected or remotely controlled over existing system frameworks, opening doors for the unadulterated incorporation of the physical world into PC-based frameworks and providing improved efficiency, accuracy, and monetary advantage despite reduced human mediation. This breakthrough has various applications, such as urban communities focused on solar power, smart cities, micro matrices, and lights on Solar Road, etc. AI is when calculations decode gigantic knowledge arrangements to the PCs so that they can function without specific programming. This, for the most part, focuses on the development of different PC programs which may change when exposed to new information. During this period renewable vitality developed at a rate faster than some other time in history. These days people groups confronting the issue of confinement of non-sustainable power sources, so to take care of this issue the best arrangement is to utilize sustainable power sources like solar oriented vitality. Solar dependence is the planet's fastest-growing sustainable power source, steadily increasing by a standard of 40 percent in the overall limit. AI can be utilized in Probabilistic Energy Forecasting. The fundamental reason behind this is to gauge the likelihood appropriation of solar oriented power age from more than one solar-based ranch all the while. In this paper, we examined -the study on how IOT assumes a significant job in solar-powered vitality and how AI approaches are utilized in solar oriented vitality.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel approach for indoor point clouds quality evaluation, which works well without reference point clouds. In this paper, we mainly evaluate indoor point clouds quality in two aspects: the smoothness of the walls and the degree of occlusion of the walls and the floor. Our approach involves three steps. Firstly, with the S3DIS dataset, we use a deep learning method to train a detector to label walls and floor from indoor scenes. Next, we calculate the normal vector of the wall and the normal vector of each point on the wall. The degree of smoothness of the wall is judged according to the angle between the normal vector of the wall and the normal vectors of the points. Finally, according to the cause of occlusion (objects on the floor or in front of the wall), the occlusion degree of the wall and the floor is obtained. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable for non-reference indoor point cloud quality evaluation.},

abstract={For the existing repetitive motion generation (RMG) schemes for kinematic control of redundant manipulators, the position error always exists and fluctuates. This article gives an answer to this phenomenon and presents the theoretical analyses to reveal that the existing RMG schemes exist a theoretical position error related to the joint angle error. To remedy this weakness of existing solutions, an orthogonal projection RMG (OPRMG) scheme is proposed in this article by introducing an orthogonal projection method with the position error eliminated theoretically, which decouples the joint space error and Cartesian space error with joint constraints considered. The corresponding new recurrent neural networks (NRNNs) are structured by exploiting the gradient descent method with the assistance of velocity compensation with theoretical analyses provided to embody the stability and feasibility. In addition, simulation results on a fixed-based redundant manipulator, a mobile manipulator, and a multirobot system synthesized by the existing RMG schemes and the proposed one are presented to verify the superiority and precise performance of the OPRMG scheme for kinematic control of redundant manipulators. Moreover, via adjusting the coefficient, simulations on the position error and joint drift of the redundant manipulator are conducted for comparison to prove the high performance of the OPRMG scheme. To bring out the crucial point, different controllers for the redundancy resolution of redundant manipulators are compared to highlight the superiority and advantage of the proposed NRNN. This work greatly improves the existing RMG solutions in theoretically eliminating the position error and joint drift, which is of significant contributions to increasing the accuracy and efficiency of high-precision instruments in manufacturing production.},

Initially data is preprocessed with special focus and strategy for handling missing values. The performance of the model is fine-tuned by taking into account additional temporal and seasonal dependency of this type of data.

abstract={Most existing object detection algorithms are trained based upon a set of fully annotated object regions or bounding boxes, which are typically labor-intensive. On the contrary, nowadays there is a significant amount of image-level annotations cheaply available on the Internet. It is hence a natural thought to explore such “weak” supervision to benefit the training of object detectors. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to perform weakly supervised object localization, termed object-specific pixel gradient (OPG). The OPG is trained by using image-level annotations alone, which performs in an iterative manner to localize potential objects in a given image robustly and efficiently. In particular, we first extract an OPG map to reveal the contributions of individual pixels to a given object category, upon which an iterative mining scheme is further introduced to extract instances or components of this object. Moreover, a novel average and max pooling layer is introduced to improve the localization accuracy. In the task of weakly supervised object localization, the OPG achieves a state-of-the-art 44.5% top-5 error on ILSVRC 2013, which outperforms competing methods, including Oquab et al. and region-based convolutional neural networks on the Pascal VOC 2012, with gains of 2.6% and 2.3%, respectively. In the task of object detection, OPG achieves a comparable performance of 27.0% mean average precision on Pascal VOC 2007. In all experiments, the OPG only adopts the off-the-shelf pretrained CNN model, without using any object proposals. Therefore, it also significantly improves the detection speed, i.e., achieving three times faster compared with the state-of-the-art method.},

abstract={Crime situation forecasting has always been a challenging task for smart city security decision support system construction. Accurate crime dynamic capture can optimize the allocation efficiency of police resources to respond to various crime situations. Existing crime forecasting approaches mainly utilize some stochastic process modeling methods, some statistical learning models or some pixel-level deep learning models to capture spatio-temporal dynamic. Compared with traditional models, Graph Neural Network (GNN) obviously can better capture the spatial structural features other than Euclidean distance. In this paper, we address the crime situation forecast task with Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (T-GCN) approach, a graph deep learning approach for spatio-temporal dynamics capturing. Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are combined in T-GCN model to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics respectively.

abstract={In this paper, a methodology of object handling using deep learning based object recognition for cognitive robot is proposed. A cognitive robot using a sentential cognitive system expresses all experienced events as a sentential form and store in a memory to be retrieved for responding to order of human. For the case of an event dealing with objects, a deep learning is used for detecting labels and bounding boxes from the captured data from a RGB-D camera. The segmented 3D information of an object extracted from bounding box and depth data is stored in an object descriptor of the cognitive system for being used for object related conversation. The experimental results show the applicability of the proposed approach to more advanced human robot interaction.},

abstract={Scale-free network, as a type of complex network, is prone to various target attacks. Some researches characterize the attack and defense problem of complex network as a game problem, and design the optimal defense strategy from the perspective of achieving the game equilibrium. However, such a game problem in the scale-free network space is very difficult to solve because the strategy space is too large. An effective way to achieve the equilibrium is to train a growing population of player strategies and use heuristic methods to guide the population evolution. The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been used to guide the population evolution due to its strong ability to explore new strategies. Inspired by this fact, in this paper we apply an AI-aided game framework, Policy Space Response Oracle (PSRO), to solve the above game problem. We first abstract the scale-free network as a game environment and design a set of game rules. The confrontation game occurs between two agents acting as the attacker and the defender in the network, respectively. We then use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate values of actions in deep Q-network (DQN) and extract game states into tensor forms as CNN's inputs. To tackle the targeted attacks against the scale-free networks, we carefully design a specific action value for the defender combining the node weight and network connectivity parameters of a node in CNN. The simulation results show that the defender agent using CNN as strategies can delay the attacker's intrusions under equilibrium, and achieve a balance between protecting high-weight nodes and keeping the network connectivity.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are connected to the Internet through a gateway, which can host IoT analytics encapsulated in containers to convert raw sensor data into more condensed processed data. In this paper, we study two research problems to maximize the overall Quality-of-Service (QoS) level of all IoT analytics that run on both data center servers and gateways. The first problem is to select additional IoT analytics to deploy on a gateway to save upload bandwidth due to transmitting raw sensor data. The second problem is to allocate the residue upload bandwidth among all IoT analytics to maximize the overall QoS level. We propose several algorithms to solve these two research problems. We have implemented real testbeds to evaluate our proposed system and algorithms. Our experiment results reveal that the proposed algorithms: (i) capitalize the download bandwidth and storage space of the gateway for saving the upload bandwidth consumption and (ii) achieve high QoS levels without overloading the network and gateway.},

abstract={We propose a cognitive healthcare framework that adopts the Internet of Things (IoT)-cloud technologies. This framework uses smart sensors for communications and deep learning for intelligent decision-making within the smart city perspective. The cognitive and smart framework monitors patients' state in real time and provides accurate, timely, and high-quality healthcare services at low cost. To assess the feasibility of the proposed framework, we present the experimental results of an EEG pathology classification technique that uses deep learning. We employ a range of healthcare smart sensors, including an EEG smart sensor, to record and monitor multimodal healthcare data continuously. The EEG signals from patients are transmitted via smart IoT devices to the cloud, where they are processed and sent to a cognitive module. The system determines the state of the patient by monitoring sensor readings, such as facial expressions, speech, EEG, movements, and gestures. The real-time decision, based on which the future course of action is taken, is made by the cognitive module. When information is transmitted to the deep learning module, the EEG signals are classified as pathologic or normal. The patient state monitoring and the EEG processing results are shared with healthcare providers, who can then assess the patient's condition and provide emergency help if the patient is in a critical state. The proposed deep learning model achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract={Smoke detection in Internet of Things (IoT) environment is a primary component of early disaster-related event detection in smart cities. Recently, several smoke and fire detection methods are presented with reasonable accuracy and running time for normal IoT environment. However, these methods are unable to detect smoke in foggy IoT environment, which is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient system based on deep convolutional neural networks for early smoke detection in both normal and foggy IoT environments. Our method takes advantage of VGG-16 architecture, considering its sensible stability between the accuracy and time efficiency for smoke detection compared to the other computationally expensive networks, such as GoogleNet and AlexNet. Experiments performed on benchmark smoke detection datasets and their results in terms of accuracy, false alarms rate, and efficiency reveal the better performance of our technique compared to state-of-the-art and verifies its applicability in smart cities for early detection of smoke in normal and foggy IoT environments.},

abstract={Automatic building facade point cloud semantic segmentation is an important step in 3-D urban building reconstruction. How to correctly segment the components (e.g., windows, walls, and columns) from the building facade is still a challenging task. According to the characteristics of building facade point clouds, we introduce local fusion attention network (LFA-Net), an efficient neural network that learns LFA features from building facade point clouds, for better capturing the local neighborhood structure information of each point. The core of LFA-Net is the LFA module, which consists of three neural units: local graph attention (LGA), local aggregation attention (LAA), and fusion attention (FA). The LFA-Net is the standard encoder-decoder architecture. Experiments demonstrate that our LFA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the large-scale building facade point cloud dataset.},

abstract={Smart transportation network development with environmental issues into consideration has brought Industry 4.0 based solutions on priority. In this direction, battery-powered electric bus systems have been considered widely for ensuring flexibility, operation cost, and lesser pollutants emission. Industry 4.0 provides automation through a cyber-physical system (CPS), the interconnection of bus system entities with industrial internet-of-things (IIoT), remote information availability through cloud computing and scientific disciplines (human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc.) integration. In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions. In similar traffic conditions, total passenger's time in system (ticket booking to travel) varies between 41.6 minutes (for 24 hours) to 45.5 minutes (for 1 year). In the simulation, priorities are given to those dependent and independent variables which save the battery consumption and elongate the utilization of buses. Lastly, it is also observed that the proposed system is suitable for resource-constraint devices because Gate Equivalent (GE) calculation shows that the proposed system can be implemented between 1986 GEs (communicational cost without confidentiality and authentication) and 7939 GEs (computational cost with HMAC for authentication in data storage). This ensures varies security primitivs such as confidentiality, availability and authentication.},

In this context for a city, San Isidro, a business district of Lima, has been established as study case. The district has been divided into map sectors and subsectors, so that by using the GPS location service integrated in mobile devices, it is possible to identify areas that have the highest incidence of different types of incidents. This functionality will allow users to choose safer routes by taking into account the information provided for each sector. The data used in this application has been obtained from an Open Data platform managed by the San Isidro municipality. In this application, we have processed the data enabling the easy and friendly access to the information by the end user. The importance of this work is how we have used the machine learning algorithm for incident rates in real and future time, trying to make predictions that can not only provide safe routes to users, but also predict disasters and allow public authorities to act in advance, thus minimizing the impact of future incidents.},

In this research, the dataset from the Open Sourcing Mental Illness, LTD which began in 2016 was analyzed using data science techniques and using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN). The two algorithms were then compared to find the most accurate model to predict the risk of mental illness, especially among IT workers. This research found that for 864 data train and 371 data tests a final accuracy rate of 77.089% for the SVM and 76.011% for the FCNN was obtained. The dataset used has a target prediction that consists of data with a categorical data type, so it is categorized as multiclass classification.

abstract={The constant miniaturization of hardware and an increase in power efficiency, have made possible the integration of intelligence into ordinary devices. This trend of augmenting so-called non-intelligent everyday devices with computational capabilities has led to the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. With a wide variety of applications, such as home automation, smart grids/cities, and critical infrastructure management, the IoT systems make compelling targets for cyber-attacks. In order to effectively compromise these systems, adversaries employ different advanced persistent threat (APT) methods, with one such sophisticated method, being botnets. By employing a plethora of infected machines (bots), attackers manage to compromise the IoT systems and exploit them. Prior to the appearance of the IoT domain, specialized digital forensics mechanisms were developed, in order to investigate Botnet activities in small-scale systems. Since IoT enabled botnets are scalable, technologically diverse and make use of current high-speed networks, developing forensic mechanisms capable of investigating the IoT Botnet activities has become an important challenge in the cyber-security field. Various studies have proposed, deep learning as a viable solution for handling the IoT generated data, as it was designed to handle diverse data in large volumes, requiring near real-time processing. In this study, we provide a review of forensics and deep learning mechanisms employed to investigate botnets and their applicability in the IoT environments. We provide a new definition for the IoT, in addition to a taxonomy of network forensic solutions, that were developed for both conventional, as well as, the IoT settings. Furthermore, we investigate the applicability of deep learning in network forensics, the inherent challenges of applying network forensics techniques to the IoT, and provide future direction for research in this field.},

A group of these bins will help in efficient garbage collection and management starting from the origin of the waste itself. An Android application which is also a part of this system will assist the relevant authorities to manage the bins as per real time requirements.

The main objective of the paper is a comprehensive analysis of five well-known supervised machine learning algorithms on IoT datasets. The five classifiers are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Logistic Regression (LR). The feature reduction is performed using PCA algorithm. The performance of these five classifiers has been compared on the basis of six characteristics of IoT dataset such as size, number of features, number of classes, class imbalance, missing values and execution time. The classifiers have also been compared on various performance metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, kappa, and accuracy. As per our results, the DT classifier gives the best accuracy of 99% among all the algorithms for all datasets. The results also show the performance of RF and KNN as almost similar and the NB and LR perform the worst among all the classifiers},

abstract={According to results of a survey by Cisco, the largest networking company in the world, a high proportion of all network traffic is multimedia, and its proportion has increased daily. As a result, the importance of multimedia traffic processing has increased. There are two existing traffic processing techniques: unicast and multicast modes. The multicast mode is more efficient in terms of multimedia traffic processing. To process network traffic using the multicast mode, a multicast tree should be generated first, which in many cases, can be dealt with by the Steiner tree generation problem. The Steiner tree generation involves nondeterministic polynomial time problems, called NP-hard. There are a number of approximation algorithm studies to generate a Steiner tree. However, existing studies have not yet found the optimal Steiner tree, and the advancement of performance has also been minimal. Thus, this study proposes a multicast tree generation technique that applies reinforcement learning, which has not been discussed in previous studies. For reinforcement learning, the context of a problem has to be represented by the Markov decision process (MDP), which can be achieved by a software-defined networking (SDN) environment. This paper proposes a technique to represent a network context with MDP and shows how the learned policies are operated for multicast routing.},

Specifically, we design a novel traffic throttling model using reinforcement learning, and the reinforcement learning agent makes the traffic throttling strategy by receiving traffic data. The reward of the model is calculated based on the proportion of the legitimate traffic transmitted, and the action is considered while evaluating the payload of the network. The results of experiments show that the RL method converges quickly and can effectively identify and discard attack traffic after a period training. Furthermore, we compare our proposed approach against a baseline and a conventional port-based approach and we show the superiority of our approach.},

abstract={High-speed railway has developed rapidly in recent years. The overhead catenary system (OCS) that transmits electrical energy to the train has to be regularly inspected due to catenary-related defects might directly threaten the safe operation of high-speed railway. In this paper, we present a novel method for autonomous speed regulation of OCS inspection robot using reinforcement learning. To train the robot, we first build a simulation platform based on Unity3D for accurate reconstruction of the railway environment including the OCS, the rail track and the inspection robot. Next, we utilize the range data recorded by the LiDAR mounted on the robot to detect OCS components. Then we leverage the detection results to train the robot to learn speed regulation for shortening the inspection time through reinforcement learning. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed method, which can greatly improve inspection efficiency. Our work has immediate practical significance for high-speed railway automation and informatization.},

abstract={Route planning is an important service in the map navigation. However, most of commercial map applications provide an optimal path that only minimize a single metric such as distance, time or other costs, while ignoring a critical criterion: safety. When citizens or travellers walk in a city, they may prefer to find a safe walking route to avoid the potential crime risk and to have a short distance, which can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Many previous methods are proposed to solve the multi-objective route planning, however, most of them are not efficient or optimized in a large-scale road network. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based Multi-Objective Hyper-Heuristic (MOHH) approach to route planning in a smart city. We conduct experiments on the safety index map constructed based on the historical urban data of the New York city. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach is almost 34 and 1.4 times faster than the exact multi-objective optimization algorithm and the NSGA-II algorithm respectively. Moreover, it can obtain more than 80% Pareto optimal solutions in a large-scale road network.},

abstract={The pressures exerted by the scarcity of resources and the respect to the environment, among other reasons, have led to the enormous current importance of the Water Demand Management. This means satisfying the demand using the least amount of resources, so that a fundamental aspect is the hourly forecast of this variable. This paper applies modern Artificial Intelligence techniques in solving this problem. More specifically, we have developed a Multiagent System aimed at decision-making in the management, such that it determines the optimal hourly quantity of pumped water that minimizes the management cost. The developed structure relies on complex forecasting methods, such as ARIMA techniques and Neural Networks, coordinated with other intelligent agents. According to the results achieved, this is an interesting alternative to face the problem.},

abstract={Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based classifiers improve the accuracy of diagnosis and prediction for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, exploiting specific brain regions with the AD is essential to understand pathological alteration in the AD and monitor its progression. This paper aims to construct novel AD classification models which have a good performance and interpretation on AD diagnosis. We propose the three classifiers including a simple broaden plain CNNs (SBPCNNs), a major slice-assemble CNNs (SACNNs) and a multi-slice CNNs (MSCNNs), which record the slice positions but have fewer parameters. Specifically, we integrate the ranking and the random forest methods to find the discriminative region that is consistent with domain knowledge about the AD. The results of the visualization explanation of pixel and slice level deliver a clearer understanding of the AD to specialists. The experimental results indicate that the proposed models are meaningful for AD classification.},

abstract={Conventional surveillance systems such as CCTV still have limitations that merely viewing and recording. This limitation causes its function to only be passive monitoring and unable to provide real-time early warning systems as an effort to anticipate security threats or violations of regulations. The increasing need in the security sector, especially in public area, requires a solution in the form of a system that can detect suspicious objects through video surveillance systems. The integration of artificial intelligent, machine learning, image processing and computer vision become the latest study in surveillance system development innovation. Although there are many datasets, methods and frameworks available in previous research, there are still few papers that discuss the use of intelligent video analytics in detecting suspicious objects. This paper will comprehensively and systematically review the literature on applying machine learning for object detection and video surveillance systems published between 2010 and 2020. The literature extraction process is carried out by identifying and analyzing papers to describe the scope of research to detect suspicious objects using intelligent video analytics, frameworks, methods, datasets and identifying suspicious characteristics. At the end of this paper, conclusions have been outlined regarding the challenges and opportunities for suspicious object detection research using video analytics in the future.},
