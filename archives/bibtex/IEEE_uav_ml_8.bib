abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm, also named drone swarm, has been the study object of many types of research due to its potential to improve applications such as monitoring, surveillance, and search missions. With several drones flying simultaneously, the challenge is to increase their level of automation and intelligence while avoiding collision, reducing communication level with these entities, and improving strategical organization to accomplish a specific task. In this sense, we propose a solution to coordinate a UAV swarm using bivariate potential fields with autonomous and distributed intelligence among drones for a cooperative target search application. Results have shown an improvement in the swarm effectiveness by reducing the number of UAVs blocked at local minima by using distributed decision-making methods, proving to be an effective approach to solve this frequent problem in potential fields.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been used widely since they can be applied in various missions. Using a single UAV may not be able to carry out the mission thoroughly and efficiently for current operational demandings. Therefore, we are interested in designing a flight formation controller of a small fleet of four micro UAVs, called crazyflie, using a kinect motion capture together with an indoor local positioning system. The flight test results show that the crazyflie swarm can fly in a formation within the designated area using the centralized control approach. Moreover, the flight formations of the swarm such as a triangle pattern, a square pattern and a line pattern can be controlled using the movements of the body.},

abstract={The universal availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has resulted in many applications where the same make/model can be deployed by multiple parties. Thus, identifying a specific UAV in a given swarm, in a manner that cannot be spoofed by software methods, becomes important. We propose RF fingerprinting for this purpose, where a neural network learns subtle imperfections present in the transmitted waveform. For UAVs, the constant hovering motion raises a key challenge, which remains a fundamental problem in previous works on RF fingerprinting: Since the wireless channel changes constantly, the network trained with a previously collected dataset performs poorly on the test data. The main contribution of this paper is to address this problem by: (i) proposing a multi-classifier scheme with a two-step score-based aggregation method, (ii) using RF data augmentation to increase neural network robustness to hovering-induced variations, and (iii) extending the multi-classifier scheme for detecting a new UAV, not seen earlier during training. Importantly, our approach permits RF fingerprinting on manufacturer-proprietary waveforms that cannot be decoded or altered by the end-user. Results reveal a near two-fold accuracy in UAV classification through our multi-classifier method over the single-classifier case, with an overall accuracy of 95% when tested with data under unseen channel. Our multi-classifier scheme also improves new UAV detection accuracy to a near perfect 99%, up from 68% for a single neural network approach.},

abstract={There has been significant expansion in the functionality and differentiation of modern remote sensing applications due to the exponential growth in adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). With recent advancements of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning (AI-ML) and Cloud Computing, many opportunities have emerged to significantly evolve UAV based remote sensing applications. This paper presents a novel approach to evolve remote sensing application as a System-of-Systems (SoS). Bringing in the SoS perspective provides additional insights into the dynamics of the interactions between the various constituent systems (e.g. swarm UAVs, Ground stations) and the impact on the overall remote sensing application. Systematically analyzing the relationships between the various Measures-of-Effectiveness (MOEs) of the SoS vis-a-vis the constituent systems, in tandem with the evolution of the MOEs, would enable optimal leverage of the recent technology advancements for remote sensing applications},

abstract={In modern networks, edge computing will be responsible for processing and learning from the critical network- and user-generated data, such as wireless link usage, mobility information, application requests, and many others. The presence of Artificial Intelligence-based (AI) applications at the edge of the network will enable the network to predict necessary user behavior and its impact on network infrastructure, such as base station overloading. One of the main strategies for offloading users and base stations is to deploy UAV base stations, or flying base stations, which can dynamically provide service and connectivity. In this article, we introduce a framework for distributed learning over Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which manages data applications in a fully distributed setting across edge servers, thus reducing the cost of collecting user information in a centralized server. We couple the proposed distributed learning with a novel similarity metric for user trajectories, which can aggregate neural network models with similar costs as other model aggregation techniques. However, the aggregation technique can achieve much higher accuracy. Furthermore, we apply the proposed distributed learning scheme to manage and deploy flying base stations to areas that experience high demand or poor user connectivity, thus optimizing connectivity in terms of user satisfaction, delay, and network throughput.},

abstract={The ambitious high data-rate applications in the envisioned future beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless networks require new solutions, including the advent of more advanced architectures than the ones already used in 5G networks, and the coalition of different communications schemes and technologies to enable these applications requirements. Among the candidate communications schemes for future wireless networks are non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes that allow serving more than one user in the same resource block by multiplexing users in other domains than frequency or time. In this way, NOMA schemes tend to offer several advantages over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes such as improved user fairness and spectral efficiency, higher cell-edge throughput, massive connectivity support, and low transmission latency. With these merits, NOMA-enabled transmission schemes are being increasingly looked at as promising multiple access schemes for future wireless networks. When the power domain is used to multiplex the users, it is referred to as the power domain NOMA (PD-NOMA). In this paper, we survey the integration of PD-NOMA with the enabling communications schemes and technologies that are expected to meet the various requirements of B5G networks. In particular, this paper surveys the different rate optimization scenarios studied in the literature when PD-NOMA is combined with one or more of the candidate schemes and technologies for B5G networks including multiple-input-single-output (MISO), multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO), massive-MIMO (mMIMO), advanced antenna architectures, higher frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications, advanced coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission and reception schemes, cooperative communications, cognitive radio (CR), visible light communications (VLC), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted communications and others. The considered system models, the optimization methods utilized to maximize the achievable rates, and the main lessons learnt on the optimization and the performance of these NOMA-enabled schemes and technologies are discussed in detail along with the future research directions for these combined schemes. Moreover, the role of machine learning in optimizing these NOMA-enabled technologies is addressed.},

abstract={In order to expand the application fields of micro-UAVs, the ability of land mark recognition and autonomous landing is one of the key technologies for UAVs flighting in complex environment. For achieving more robust and precise relative pose estimation, we propose to apply an ellipse feature-based pose estimation method instead of QR code features. Considering the poor calculating ability on-board, the land mark recognition algorithms based on deep learning are difficult to be used in micro-UAVs. Hence, we put forward a new strategy for target recognition by taking advantage of incremental learning. Concretely, we select to use broad learning system (BLS) to replace the classification layer of MobileNetV3, and design a new target recognition network that may be named as MobileNetV3-BLS. To verify the effectiveness of proposed MobileNetV3-BLS, we use PASCAL VOC2007 and data set collected in our university, and carry out a series of comparative experiments on Nvidia TX2. Results of experiments show that MobileNetV3-BLS can progressively increase the accuracy of landmark recognition online. In addition, the proposed MobileNetV3-BLS does meet the need of deployment on Nvidia TX2 and the real-time requirement of on-board calculation in mirco-UAV avionics systems.},

abstract={This paper considers the problem of 3D city map reconstruction. The key novelty here lies in the sole exploitation of UAV-bound radio measurements as a way to recover the map data, i.e. no image of the city is taken or processed. The proposed approach relies on the unique ability for a UAV- to-ground communication system to detect and classify line-of-sight (LoS) vs. non line-of-sight (NLoS) channels towards ground users using machine learning tools. Once classification is carried out, the LoS vs. NLoS data is fed as input to a building position and height reconstruction algorithm. The map reconstruction quality is analyzed as a function of user density and UAV altitude, revealing the notion of an optimal height for the UAV which is predicted using an analytical model.},

abstract={Real-time detection of small unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAV) targets in SUAV surveillance systems has become a challenge due to their high mobility, sudden bursts, and small sizes. In this study, we used infrared sensors and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based detectors to achieve the real-time detection of SUAV targets. Existing object detectors generally suffer from a computational burden or low detection accuracy on small targets, which limits their practicality and further application in SUAV surveillance systems. To solve these problems, we developed a real-time SUAV target detection algorithm based on deep residual networks. In order to improve the sensitivity to small targets, a laterally connected multi-scale feature fusion approach was proposed to fully combine the context features and semantic features. A densely paved pre-defined box with geometric analysis was used for single-stage prediction. Compared with the state-of-the-art object detectors, the proposed method achieved superior performance with respect to average-precision and frames-per-second. As the training set was limited, to improve generalization, we investigate the benefits introduced by data augmentation and data balance, and proposed a weighted augmentation approach. The proposed approach improved the robustness of the detector and the overall accuracy.},

pages={68798-68813},
abstract={The localization system has been extensively studied because of its diverse applicability, for example, in the Internet of Things, automatic management, and unmanned aerial vehicle services. There have been numerous studies on localization in two-dimensional (2D) environments, but those in three-dimensional (3D) environments are scarce. In this paper, we propose a novel localization method that utilizes the gated recurrent unit (GRU) and ultra-wideband (UWB) signals. For the purpose of this study, we considered that the UWB transmitter (Tx) and many UWB receivers (Rx) were placed inside a confined space. The input of the proposed model was generated from the UWB signals that are sent from the Tx to the Rxs, and the output was the location of the Tx. The proposed GRU-based model converts the localization problem into a regression problem by combining the ranging and positioning phase. Thus, the proposed model can directly estimate the location of the Tx. Our proposed GRU-based method achieves 15 and four times shorter execution times for the training and testing, respectively, compared to the existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based localization methods. The input data can also be easily generated with low complexity. The rows of the input matrix are the downsampled version of the UWB received signal. Throughout numerous simulation results, our novel localization method can achieve a lower root-mean-squared error up to 0.8 meters compared to the recently proposed existing CNN-based method. Furthermore, the proposed method operates well inside a confined space with fixed volume but varying width, height, and depth.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely used in military and civil fields, and the collaborative multi-UAV network becomes increasingly popular. Cognitive radio (CR) is a feasible way to solve the problem that there is no authorized frequency band for UAV communication. However, the sensing performance of traditional algorithm based on a single artificial design feature is poor in the complex electromagnetic environment including low SNR, high noise-uncertainty, etc., which can not meet the requirement of the cognitive multi-UAV network. Spectrum sensing algorithms based on machine learning can obtain better performance and higher spectral efficiency (SE) by learning the potential feature and rules. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is widely accepted as naturally suitable for processing time series because of its structural characteristics. But the complexity of the algorithm based on LSTM is high due to its redundant structure, which is unsuitable for UAVs as the energy of UAV is always limited. In this paper, we propose a spectrum sensing algorithm based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU). We prove by theoretical derivation and simulation experiments separately that it can not only consume about 1/4 less energy for computation but also achieve slightly better sensing performance compare to the LSTM-based algorithm, which is meaningful. As cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) can obtain better performance and is suitable for multi-UAV scenarios, we combine the proposed algorithm with a collaborative model which can improve system stability and reach a longer working time than the traditional collaboration model. In general, we propose a high-efficiency CSS scheme based on GRU for a multi-UAV network, which has higher sensing performance, less implementation complexity, and we verify it by theory or simulation.},

abstract={Flower load is one of the earlier indicators of potential yield in fruit orchards. Usually, a higher flower clusters number are present on a tree than needed for an optimal production. The most used techniques to manage the flower load are manual, mechanical, and chemical thinning. The main issue is to calibrate these techniques on the base of the desired yield. Drone imagery, being able to collect highly detailed information, could offer a solution to automate flower counting since manual flower counting would be too laborious. The main goals of this study were to test an easy to use and quick be analyzed data acquisition for sudden field interventions, short computing time and reliability. This was achieved by applying and comparing two methodologies that allow to map apple’s flower clusters density at full bloom stage by processing Unmanned aerial Vehicle’s (UAV) imagery with binary classification and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, respectively. A comparison between the flower cluster estimation and the actual cluster load analysis highlighted that mapping flower clusters by binary classification is more suitable than machine learning in terms of image processing because it allowed to have a quicker (8 minutes) , easier and less noise - affected image analysis with R2 values ranging from 0,60 to 0,71. Furthermore, the proposed methodology seemed to be able to manage with a high spatial variability since it produced a map that clearly corresponded with zonal field conditions.},

abstract={The flapping wing aerial vehicle (FWAV) is an unmanned aerial vehicle that is greatly affected by aerodynamic changes. The uncertainties of its aerodynamic model and the complicated external airflow disturbances make the existing controllers unable to meet the system performance requirements. Therefore, this paper presents a novel adaptive sliding mode controller framework based on cascade control and online learning. First, a virtual guided sliding surface was established to smooth the unstable output of the control quantity and eliminate chattering to avoid aggravating the airflow disturbances caused by the FWAV attitude changes. Then, a reinforcement learning method is designed to optimize the guided process established online, and actively compensates for unknown external disturbances and model uncertainties. Finally, this paper designs an attitude control system including an FWAV approximation model and unknown disturbances to verify the effectiveness of this adaptive framework. Compared with conventional controller optimization methods, simulation results show that the adaptive framework presented has better robustness and control accuracy, which can reduce the sensitivity of an FWAV to aerodynamic changes and attenuate chattering.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) specifically drones have been used for surveillance, shipping and delivery, wildlife monitoring, disaster management etc. The increase on the number of drones in the airspace worldwide will lead necessarily to full autonomous drones. Given the expected huge number of drones, if they were operated by human pilots, the possibility to collide with each other could be too high. In this paper, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architecture is proposed to make drones behave autonomously inside a suburb neighborhood environment. The environment in the simulator has plenty of obstacles such as trees, cables, parked cars and houses. In addition, there are also another drones, acting as moving obstacles, inside the environment while the learner drone has a goal to achieve. In this way the drone can be trained to detect stationary and moving obstacles inside the neighborhood and so the drones can be used safely in a public area in the future. The drone has a front camera and it can capture continuously depth images. Every depth image is part of the state used in DRL architecture. Also, another part of the state is the distance to the geo-fence (a virtual barrier on the environment) which is added as a scalar value. The agent will be rewarded negatively when it tries to overpass the geo-fence limits. In addition, angle to goal and elevation angle between the goal and the drone will be used as information to be added to the state. It is considered that these scalar values will improve the DRL performance and also the reward obtained. The drone is trained using Q-Network and its convergence and final reward are evaluated. The states containing image and several scalars are processed by a neural network that joints the two state parts into a unique flow. This neural network is named as Joint Neural Network (JNN) [1]. The training and test results show that the agent can successfully learn to avoid any obstacle in the environment. The results for three scenarios are very promising and the learner drone reaches the destination with a success rate 100% in first two tests and with a success rate 98% in the last test, this one with a total of three drones.},

abstract={Motivated by Industry 4.0, 5G-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones) are widely applied in various industries. However, the open nature of 5G networks threatens the safe sharing of data. In particular, privacy leakage can lead to serious losses for users. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) avoids privacy leakage by allowing data models to be shared instead of raw data. Unfortunately, the traditional FL framework is strongly dependent on a centralized aggregation server, which will cause the system to crash if the server is compromised. Unauthorized participants may launch poisoning attacks, thereby reducing the usability of models. In addition, communication barriers hinder collaboration among a large number of cross-domain devices for learning. To address the above issues, a blockchain-empowered decentralized horizontal federated learning (BE-DHFL) framework is proposed. The authentication of cross-domain UAVs is accomplished through multisignature smart contracts. Global model updates are computed by using these smart contracts instead of a centralized server. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves high efficiency of cross-domain authentication and good accuracy.},

abstract={The bird's nest on the transmission line tower has a bad impact on the transmission equipment, and even threaten the safe and stable operation of the power grid. In recent years, the number of bird pest in transmission line is increasing year by year, resulting in increasing economic losses. The traditional bird's nest identification method of transmission line is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and its security level is low. Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic detection method of bird's nest on transmission line tower based on Faster_RCNN convolution neural network. This method can automatically identify the location of the bird's nest on the transmission line tower by using the image collected by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The problem of insufficient training samples and overfitting of neural network classifier is solved by enlarging the bird's nest image. The experimental results show that this method can effectively detect bird's nest targets in complex environment, and the highest recall rate can reach 95.38%, the highest F1 score can reach 96.87%, and the detection time of each image can reach 0.154s. Compared with the traditional nest detection method, this method has stronger applicability and generalization ability. It provides technical support for analyzing bird activities and taking effective preventive measures.},

abstract={This article provides a literature review of state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms for disaster and pandemic management. Most nations are concerned about disasters and pandemics, which, in general, are highly unlikely events. To date, various technologies, such as IoT, object sensing, UAV, 5G, and cellular networks, smartphone-based system, and satellite-based systems have been used for disaster and pandemic management. ML algorithms can handle multidimensional, large volumes of data that occur naturally in environments related to disaster and pandemic management and are particularly well suited for important related tasks, such as recognition and classification. ML algorithms are useful for predicting disasters and assisting in disaster management tasks, such as determining crowd evacuation routes, analyzing social media posts, and handling the post-disaster situation. ML algorithms also find great application in pandemic management scenarios, such as predicting pandemics, monitoring pandemic spread, disease diagnosis, etc. This article first presents a tutorial on ML algorithms. It then presents a detailed review of several ML algorithms and how we can combine these algorithms with other technologies to address disaster and pandemic management. It also discusses various challenges, open issues and, directions for future research.},

abstract={GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is a consolidated remote sensing technique that exploits the back-scattered GNSS signals to retrieve information about the Earth surface. By the use of GNSS-R sensors onboard UAVs, this tool can bring significant advantages in agriculture, especially for the detection of the presence of water/moisure in specific rural areas. However, to perform this detection, GNSS-R needs a priori calibration of a threshold on the received reflected power in order to distinguish the presence/no prence of water. This is a limitation for the adoption of this approach at large scale. The work presented in this paper aims at overcoming such a limitation, proposing a novel approach based on artificial intelligence for the automatic water detection on the Earth surface, avoiding a priori, empirical, thresholding.},

abstract={Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems with high-resolution cameras have been found to be useful for operations such as disaster management and smart farming. These systems feature Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) that connect the computation edge with UAVs and a Ground Control Station (GCS) through air-to-ground network links. Leveraging the edge computation resources effectively with energy-awareness, and dealing with intermittent failures of FANET links are the major challenges in supporting video processing applications. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-aware dynamic computation offloading scheme for UAV systems, which provides the ability to intelligently share tasks among individual UAVs and allows for parallel execution of tasks while evenly distributing energy consumption. Intelligence gathering is performed using machine learning to create resource consumption profiles for a given set of video processing tasks prior to scheduling. Our scheme handles the problem of computation offloading tasks as a job-shop scheduling problem where we aim to minimize the total energy consumption in the edge resources while minimizing video processing times to meet application requirements. Our experimental results show our energy-aware dynamic offloading scheme enables lower processing time for low drone-to-ground server ratios and consumes less energy when compared to other offloading schemes. Notably, these results also hold in various other multi-UAV scenarios involving largely different number of detected objects.},

Despite their common commercial use, drones have been recently used with malicious intent, such as airline disruptions at Gatwick Airport. With the emerging issue of safety concerns for the public and other airspace users, detecting and monitoring active drones in an area is crucial. This paper introduces a recurrent convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically designed for drone detection. This CNN can detect drones from down-sampled images by exploiting the temporal information of drones in flight and outperforms a state-of-the-art conventional object detector. Due to the lightweight and low resolution nature of this network, it can be mounted on a small processor and run at near real-time speeds.},

pages={1-10},
abstract={Human-machine teaming (HMT) operates in a context defined by the mission. Varying from the complexity and disturbance in the cooperation between humans and machines, a single machine has difficulty handling work with humans in the scales of efficiency and workload. Swarm of machines provides a more feasible solution in such a mission. Human-swarm teaming (HST) extends the concept of HMT in the mission, such as persistent surveillance, search-and-rescue, warfare. Bringing the concept of HST faces several scientific challenges. For example, the strategies of allocation on the high-level decision making. Here, human usually plays the supervisory or decision making role. Performance of such fixed structure of HST in actual mission operation could be affected by the supervisor’s status from many aspects, which could be considered in three general parts: workload, situational awareness, and trust towards the robot swarm teammate and mission performance. Besides, the complexity of a single human operator in accessing multiple machine agents increases the work burdens. An interface between swarm teammates and human operators to simplify the interaction process is desired in the HST.In this paper, instead of purely considering the workload of human teammates, we propose the computational model of human swarm interaction (HSI) in the simulated map surveillance mission. UAV swarm and human supervisor are both assigned in searching a predefined area of interest (AOI). The workload allocation of map monitoring is adjusted based on the status of the human worker and swarm teammate. Workload, situation awareness ability, trust are formulated as independent models, which affect each other. A communication-aware UAV swarm persistent surveillance algorithm is assigned in the swarm autonomy portion. With the different surveillance task loads, the swarm agent’s thrust parameter adjusts the autonomy level to fit the human operator’s needs. Reinforcement learning is applied in seeking the relative balance of workload in both human and swarm sides. Metrics such as mission accomplishment rate, human supervisor performance, mission performance of UAV swarm are evaluated in the end. The simulation results show that the algorithm could learn the human-machine trust interaction to seek the workload balance to reach better mission execution performance. This work inspires us to leverage a more comprehensive HST model in more practical HMT application scenarios.},

abstract={Automatic generation of feasible trajectory is one of the key technologies for autonomous flying of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The existing path planning methods, such as swarm intelligence algorithm and graph-based algorithm, cannot incorporate the flying time and UAV dynamic model into evolution. To overcome such disadvantages, a hierarchical trajectory optimization scheme consisted by improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Gauss pseudo-spectral method (GPM) is investigated in this paper. Firstly, considering that traditional GPM is sensitive to initial values, we design an improved PSO for path planning in the first layer. By introducing adaptive parameter adjustment strategy and position mutation updating strategy, the rapidity and optimality of the improved PSO is enhanced. Then in the second layer, a fitted curve based on the path waypoints generated by improved PSO is constructed and served as the initial values for GPM. Comparing with random initial values, the designed curve can significant improve GPM efficiency. A multi-segment strategy is also put forward to further improve the efficiency. Finally, with the consideration of dynamic model and state constraints, the time minimum trajectory planning for quadrotor UAVs is solved. Plenty of simulations are carried out and the results illustrate that the proposed scheme guarantees much better efficiency.},

The videos have been acquired in a closed university campus, and fine annotation is provided for four background classes viz. constructions, greeneries, roads, and waterbodies. Also, the performance of four semantic segmentation approaches: Conditional Random Field (CRF), U-Net, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and DeepLabV3+ are analysed on ManipalUAVid dataset.

abstract={The overall cellular network performance can be optimized for both ground and aerial users, if different treatment is given for the two user classes. Airborne UAVs experience different radio conditions that terrestrial users due to clearance in the radio path, which leads to strong desired signal reception, but at the same time increases the interference. Based on this, one can for instance use different interference coordination techniques for aerial users as for terrestrial user and/or use specific mobility settings for each class. This paper compares three different classification algorithms, which use standard LTE measurements from the UE as input, for detecting the presence of airborne users in the network. The algorithms are evaluated based on measurements done with mobile phones attached under a flying drone and on a car. Results are discussed showing the advantages and drawbacks for each option regarding different use cases, and the compromise between specificity and sensibility. For the collected data results show reliability close to 99% in most cases and also discuss how waiting for the final decision can even improve this accuracy to values close to 100%.},

abstract={Main purpose of UAV path planning are shorten the distance, avoid flight threats and obstacles. Planning feasible path intervals is the basis of path planning.

Using wolf pack intelligence algorithm as validation algorithm, this paper compares the effectiveness of elastic track correction mechanism with that of general planning method, which proves that adding elastic correction mechanism to track planning algorithm can effectively improve the reliability of track planning, and can get a feasible solution of lower cost function.},

abstract={In this paper, a rail recognition scheme is presented to pilot UAV autonomous flying along the track rail. Firstly, the pulse coupled neural network is used to iteratively process the single-channel brightness image and the binary image of the track contour is obtained. Here, the image entropy is adopted as the judgment basis for the stop of iterative processing. Then, the third order Bézier curve is used to fit the contour, and the vanishing point is obtained. Based on the vanishing point and the inverse perspective transformation method, the local flight target point is calculated. Then the yaw and pitch are calculated based on the vanishing point for the next step of inverse perspective transformation to calculate the local flight target point. Finally, the angle between flight direction and target point is calculated to pilot the UAV flying along the track. To speed the processing, CUDA based parallel programming in NVIDIA TX2 is adopted. In the end, various scene images, including forward flight, side flight, height change of UAV and the influence of invasion objects, are used to test the effective of the scheme presented in this paper. Experiments show that the rail recognition rate is 96.08% and the false alarm rate is 1.80%.},

While solutions have been proposed for static obstacle avoidance, systems enabling avoidance of dynamic objects, such as drones, are hard to implement due to the detection range and field-of-view (FOV) requirements, as well as the constraints for integrating such systems on-board small UAVs. In this work, a dataset of 6k synthetic depth maps of drones has been generated and used to train a state-of-the-art deep learning-based drone detection model. While many sensing technologies can only provide relative altitude and azimuth of an obstacle, our depth map-based approach enables full 3D localization of the obstacle. This is extremely useful for collision avoidance, as 3D localization of detected drones is key to perform efficient collision-free path planning. The proposed detection technique has been validated in several real depth map sequences, with multiple types of drones flying at up to 2 m/s, achieving an average precision of 98.7 %, an average recall of 74.7 % and a record detection range of 9.5 meters.},

abstract={By taking full advantage of Computing, Communication and Caching (3C) resources at the network edge, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is envisioned as one of the key enablers for next generation networks. However, current fixed-lo-cation MEC architecture may not be able to make real-time decision in dynamic environments, especially in large-scale scenarios. To address this issue, in this article, a Heterogeneous MEC (H-MEC) architecture is proposed, which is composed of fixed unit, i.e., Ground Stations (GSs) as well as moving nodes, i.e., Ground Vehicles (GVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), all with 3C resource enabled. The key challenges in H-MEC, i.e., mobile edge node management, real-time decision making, user association and resource allocation along with the possible Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions, are discussed. In addition, the AI-based joint Resource schEduling (ARE) framework with two different AI-based mechanisms, i.e., Deep neural network (DNN)-based and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based architectures, are proposed. DNN-based solution with online incremental learning applies the global optimizer and therefore has better performance than the DRL-based architecture with online policy updating, but requires longer training time. The simulation results are given to verify the efficiency of our proposed ARE framework.},

abstract={In the context of Fifth Generation mobile networks (5G), Search and Rescue (SAR) missions using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can benefit from a dynamic, intelligent, and autonomous placement of both Network Functions (NFs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to quickly adapt in minimal human intervention scenarios. This article examines current 5G architectures and timely standardization efforts within this context. The contribution of this work is to identify associated 5G components and propose AI modules that enable efficient UAV-based SAR missions: the System Intelligence (SI) and Edge Intelligence (EI) concepts. SI is conceived as the entity responsible for defining and orchestrating the placement and processing tasks of NFs and AI systems, while EI is responsible for the optimization of AI-based end-user applications. The article also presents an open-source virtualized testbed that enables a concrete example of SI and EI roles in a SAR mission based on object detection with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this proof-of-concept, the DNN layers are partitioned and the tradeoffs between communication and computational costs are highlighted. For instance, the results indicate that the latency can severely degrade the UAV trajectory and different DNN partitioning options can reduce the required bit rate to transmit DNN scores by more than three times.},

abstract={UAVs offer many advantages over manned vehicles and their application area expands in time passes. Particularly, interest in UAVs with rotary wing types is increasing. Increasing interest in these vehicles has spawned many different controller designs. In this study, estimating the pose of the vehicle according to the image features with the help of a single camera mounted on the quadrotor and then positionbased visual servoing, a technique that allows the vehicle to be controlled by using the image features, was used. In this study position-based visual servoing (PBVS); 3D parameter estimates of the vehicle pose were implemented with artificial neural networks.},

abstract={Clustering is one of the most important unsupervised machine learning tasks. It is widely used to solve problems of intrusion detection, text analysis, image segmentation etc. Subspace clustering is the most important method for high-dimensional data clustering. In order to solve the problem of parallel subspace clustering for high-dimensional big data, this paper proposes a parallel subspace clustering algorithm based on spark named PSubCLUS which is inspired by SubCLU, a classical subspace clustering algorithm. While Spark is the most popular big data parallel processing platform currently, PSubCLUS uses the Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) provided by Spark to store data points in a distributed way. The two main performing stages of this algorithm, one-dimensional subspace clustering and iterative clustering, can be executed in parallel on each worker node of cluster. PSubCLUS also uses a repartition method based on the number of data points to achieve load balancing. Experimental results show that PSubCLUS has good parallel speedup and ideal load balancing effect, which is suitable for solving the parallel subspace clustering of high-dimensional big data.},

We propose a framework which is based on the likelihood of mobile users presence in a grid with respect to their probability distribution.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as wireless relays or aerial base stations to improve network connectivity and coverage in cellular networks. UAVs can also be used to significantly enhance the performance of mobile ad-hoc networks and wireless sensor networks. In the future, UAVs are expected to become an integral part of the fifth generation wireless networks as well as key enablers of the coming massive Internet of Things. However, there are still many challenging issues in designing architectures and deployment of UAV-based networks. To address the issues, game theory has recently been adopted as an effective tool for modeling and analyzing problems in UAV-aided networks. In this paper, we survey the applications of game theory in solving various UAV-assisted networks challenges. We first provide a brief introduction to wireless communications with UAVs and then introduce basic game theory concepts and their relation to wireless networks. We further present the classification and brief introduction to the games applied to solve problems in UAV-aided networks. We then provide a comprehensive literature review on game-theoretic techniques utilized in dealing with challenges in the UAV-based wireless networks. Finally, we introduce advanced distributed schemes for interference management in large UAV-assisted communication networks. This paper aims to provide readers with an understanding of UAV-aided networks in terms of their architecture, benefits, challenges, and various game theoretical solutions applied to these communications networks.},

abstract={This paper details about training a convolutional neural network for object detection and classification of a custom generated dataset from google earth satellite images. The objects of interest in satellite images are strategic targets such as nuclear power plants and oil refineries. The deep learning network is YOLO version 3 which has shown significant improvement in detecting smaller objects. YOLO v3 is three times faster than SSD and its AP metric for COCO dataset is on par with SSD. Hence YOLO v3 is a faster detector in comparison to SSD. But AP0.75 is low when compared with RetinaNet due to higher localization error. On the other hand, the simpler network of YOLO, Tiny YOLO v3 takes lesser detection time. The objective of experimentation is to evaluate the performance of YOLO v3 and Tiny YOLO v3 for objects from satellite imagery. Google earth satellite images consumes less time and provides cost effective solution rather than acquiring the overhead images through unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones. The objects size varies from 120 pixels to 1250 pixels. The experimental results demonstrate its detection capability, metrics results. GeForce RTX GPU was used for training the network.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection has gradually replaced manual inspection of transmission tower, which produces large quantity of images. While it is laborious and time-consuming to manually analyze these images, there are also challenges in automatically detecting small-size defective components such as bolts in transmission tower images, due to problems including complex background, small size, and many similar objects of bolts. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network named Camp-Net (Context Information and Multi-Scale Pyramid Network) to identify bolts defect in transmission tower images. First, multi-scale feature fusion combines deep features and shallow features in convolutional networks to detect small-size bolts. Second, context information fusion puts the information around bolts into the detection network to remove the disturbance of complex background and similar objects. Experimental results on a dataset with over 30,000 field-collected images containing both defective bolts and normal bolts show the proposed model can accurately identify bolts with loose pins and bolts without pins among fittings in transmission tower. The Average Precision (AP) of defective bolts detection of this model can be 11.4% higher than that of Faster R-CNN, the commonly used high performance model.},

abstract={This paper proposes a path-planning approach to enable a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to efficiently conduct surveillance of sensitive areas. The proposed approach, termed PARCov (Planner for Autonomous Risk-sensitive Coverage), seeks to maximize the area covered by the sensors mounted on each UAV while maintaining high sensor data quality and minimizing detection risk. PARCov leverages from swarm intelligence the idea of using simple interactions among UAVs to promote an emergent behavior that achieves the desired objectives. PARCov uses a dynamic grid to keep track of the parts of the space that have been surveyed and the times that they were last surveyed. This information is then used to move the UAVs toward areas that have not been covered in a long time. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization formulation is used to determine the altitude at which each UAV flies. The efficiency and scalability of PARCov is demonstrated in simulation using complex environments and an increasing number of UAVs to conduct risk-sensitive surveillance.},

abstract={The coordination of cooperating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has become an active area of research. The approaches to coordinate these so-called swarms generally include a solution to a class of problems called Area Coverage as a building block. Area coverage problems consist in obtaining information about a certain interest area (commonly a polygon or a polyhedron) using a set of UAVs, generally with decentralized coordination and minimal human intervention. This problem models the requirements of different types of applications, such as in the case of emergencies and disasters, gas leak detection, seeking lost people, among many others. In this paper we describe a specific strategy to coordinate dynamic sets of UAVs to solve a specific area coverage problem. Existing solutions to the problem typically consider a fixed set of UAVs. In dynamic sets, UAVs might enter or leave the set. Beyond describing a specific strategy to the problem, we introduce the framework we are building on top of ROS/Gazebo to implement it. This framework eases the implementation of different strategies for multiple UAVs coordination and the assessment of their quality.},

abstract={The objective is to develop a new control strategy for quadrotor types of unmanned aerial systems that assist in closing the existing research gaps between the undesired uncertainties and current control systems. This paper investigates two modeling systems and the accuracy of error elimination and adaptation in the change of the plant/system's output. The Model Reference Adaptive Controller is a high order of adaptive control. This common fixed parameter has a proportional-integral-derivative for aircraft pitch attitude control. The Model Reference Neural Network Controller is used to the aircraft height altitude control. A disturbance in the system is introduced to test and evaluate the response performance by using the Model Reference Adaptive Controller to observe high-performance tracking in the presence of uncertainties. MATLAB System Identification Tool is used to attain the height altitude model, without disturbance, for the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. System identification uses a neural network to capture the behavior of system dynamics, which assists the neural network to train itself to act as a controller. Moreover, the performance of the controllers were tested using simulations to demonstrate and to improve the speed and stability of the response for the two dynamic systems.},

abstract={Remotely sensed multispectral (MS) images have been widely used in different areas of research in recent years, allowing their exploitation in many domains like precision agriculture. This study uses high-resolution RGB data, collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV/drone), equipped with a camera sensor and flown over an olive tree field in Extremadura (Spain), for land-cover classification purposes. Drone flights over large agricultural areas, collecting high spatial resolution images such as the scenario studied, can be tedious to process, requiring a large amount of random-access memory (RAM). To solve this issue, a new olive tree cover mapping approach is proposed by applying a spatial partitioning methodology that consists of splitting the image automatically, before processing. Each part (known as the raster window) is classified by using machine learning methods. Finally, a classification map is obtained after processing all windows. Among different supervised spectral classification methods, the following classifiers are considered: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN), with the ultimate goal of detecting olive trees and distinguishing them from other land-cover types available in the scene, such as soil, shadows, and weeds. In addition, our experimental results demonstrate that these classifiers can be used to avoid time-consuming fieldwork tasks, facilitating the analysis of agricultural fields with “a la carte” UAV flights resulting in high classification accuracy.},

volume={},

abstract={Aerial tracking of dispersed crowd groups with a single target window is a novel and one of the most challenging problems in Computer Vision and Robotics. Considering crowd group as a multi-object tracking problem can often lead to computational burden and frequent target mismatch due to numerous occlusions, whereas a single window can efficiently focus on the target. Recent progress on single object tracking (SOT) algorithms is achieved by learning a generic discriminator model from object tracking datasets, continuously updated during the testing steps. However, while tracking a group of crowd with a single window, the rigid discriminator can not generalize frequent group reformation, binomial dispersion, and crowd shape changes due to less knowledge about human-to-human interactions. To alleviate the issues, we propose a novel photo-realistic Unreal UAV Crowd Tracking (UUCT) dataset, which benchmarks aerial crowd group movements into several attributes. Second, we formulate a novel algorithm, Hybrid Motion Pooling (HyMP), which extends the existing SOT algorithm, DiMP, by exploiting graph convolutional networks for learning human groups and low-rank bilinear pooling for capturing temporal group reformations end-to-end. Then, we compare HyMP with state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers on UUCT to demonstrate HyMP's effectiveness in group tracking. Also, we illustrate the generalizability of HyMP by evaluating on the existing benchmarks. On average, HyMP outperforms SOTA approaches by 7.5% on UUCT and 4.3% on related datasets.},

abstract={Over the last decade, object-based image classification (OBIC) has become a mainstream method in remote sensing land-use/land-cover applications. Many supervised classification methods have been proposed in the OBIC framework. However, most did not use deep learning methods. In this paper, a new deep-learning-based OBIC framework is introduced. First, we segment the original image into objects by graph-based minimal-spanning-tree segmentation algorithm. Second, we extract the spectral, spatial, and texture features for each object. Then we put all features into stacked autoencoders (SAE) or stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) network, and trained the parameters of the network using training samples. Finally, all objects were classified by the network. Based on our SAE/SDAE OBIC framework, we achieved 97% overall accuracy when classifying an UAV image into five categories. In addition, our experiment shows that our framework increases overall accuracy by approximately 6% when compared to the linear support vector machine (linear SVM) and radial basis function kernel support vector machine (RBF SVM) algorithms when sufficient training samples are lacking.},

abstract={Since outdoor events are gradually allowed within the current pandemic situation, a close monitoring of the crowd activity is needed to avoid undesired contact and disease transmission. In this context, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be occasionally used to watch these activities, to ensure that health measures are applied, and to trigger alerts when an anomaly is detected. Consequently, we propose in this paper a complete UAV framework for intelligent monitoring of post COVID-19 outdoor activities. Specifically, we propose a three-step approach. In the first, captured images are analyzed using machine learning to detect and locate individuals. The second step consists of a novel coordinates mapping approach to evaluate distances among individuals and cluster them, while the third step provides an energy-efficient and reliable UAV trajectory to further inspect clusters for restrictions violation. Obtained results provide important insights towards the efficient design of the framework: 1) Efficient detection of individuals depends on the angle from which the images were captured, 2) coordinates mapping is very sensitive to estimate errors in individuals’ bounding boxes, and 3) UAV trajectory design algorithm 2-Opt is recommended for practical real-time deployments due to its low-complexity and near-optimal performance.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an integral part of wireless networks, and determining collision-free trajectories for multiple UAVs while satisfying requirements of connectivity with ground base stations (GBSs) is a challenging task. In this paper, we first reformulate the multi-UAV trajectory optimization problem with collision avoidance and wireless connectivity constraints as a sequential decision making problem in the discrete time domain. We, then, propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is developed to encode the expected time to destination given the agent’s joint state (including the agent’s information, the nearby agents’ observable information, and the locations of the nearby GBSs). An SINR-prediction network is also designed, using accumulated SINR measurements obtained when interacting with the cellular network, to map the GBSs’ locations into the SINR levels in order to predict the UAV’s SINR. Numerical results show that with the value network and SINR-prediction network, real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed in various environments with high success rate.},

abstract={Nowadays, wilderness monitoring provides massive data output for supporting agricultural production, environmental protection, and disaster monitoring. However, smart upgrading alone for these wireless nodes cannot meet the softwarized network needs today, relating to the explosion of multi-dimensional data and multi-species equipment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive solution for the UAV based data collection strategy in an “air-to-ground” intelligent softwarized collection system. The innovation in this article is that after using the IoT nodes to complete the data collection process through the proposed bandwidth-weighted traffic pushing optimization (BWPTO) algorithm, the system infers the future changes according to the current network state using a deep Q-learning (DQL) network. Then, by developing the proposed AIIPO (Air-to-Ground Intelligent Information Pushing Optimization) algorithm, the entire network can “forward-looking” the uploaded information to potentially idle nodes in the future, thus achieve the optimized system performance. Through the final mathematical experiments, we prove the optimality of our proposed routing algorithm and forwarding strategy, which are more applicable in the dynamic “air-to-ground” distributed data collection system than other benchmark solutions.},

abstract={This article presents an online learning method for improved control of nonlinear systems by combining deep learning and fuzzy logic. Given the ability of deep learning to generalize knowledge from training samples, the proposed method requires minimum amount of information about the system to be controlled. However, in robotics, particularly in aerial robotics where the operating conditions may vary, online learning is required. In this article, fuzzy logic is preferred to provide supervising feedback to the deep model for adapting to variations in the system dynamics as well as new operational conditions. The learning method is divided into two phases: offline pretraining and online posttraining. In the former, the system is controlled by a conventional controller and a deep fuzzy neural network (DFNN) is pretrained based on the recorded input-output dataset, in order to approximate the inverse dynamical model of the system. In the latter, only the pretrained DFNN is used to control the system. In this phase, the fuzzy logic, which encodes the expert knowledge, is utilized to observe the behavior of the system and to correct the action of DFNN instantaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed online learning-based approach improves the trajectory tracking performance of the unmanned aerial vehicle.},

abstract={Confidentiality of information flowing over the air is becoming a critical issue in cognitive radio (CR) towards future 5G networks. In this paper, we employ an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay to enhance information security in an underlay CR network without direct links. We propose a deep $Q$ network (DQN)-based secure transmission scheme which jointly optimizes the jamming power of secondary receiver (SR) and the deployment of UAV to maximize secrecy rate. Due to the nonconvex nature of the formulated problem, we decompose it into two-layer sub-problems where the inner layer is to optimize the jamming power while the outer layer is to design the deployment of the UAV. A bi-section search algorithm is developed to solve the inner layer jamming sub-problem and a deep $Q$-learning algorithm is designed to approximate the optimal UAV deployment as the outer problem. Finally, numeric simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance superiorities of our proposal in terms of secrecy rate as compared with the baselines.},

Often, UAV resources are developed as web services so that they can be accessed anywhere on the Internet through the World Wide Web. However, this makes them vulnerable to phishing activities of criminals who may try to access these resources and other sensitive information. Therefore, the development of a phishing detection tool based on data mining is presented in this paper. It consists of a browser extension monitoring visited webpages and a backend communicating with the browser extension for the purposes of executing some specific tasks. The browser extension is implemented in JavaScript and the ReactJS framework, and it contains an implementation of classifications with a Bayesian network, decision tree, nearest neighbor classifier and neural network. The backend uses PHP, Python scripts and the Apache HTTP Server. In addition, a browser extension is implemented so that data about webpages can be collected and this data is used for the creation of data mining models. Experimental validation with 10-fold cross-validation and through the browsing of real-world websites show promising results in phishing detection.},

Among these robotic systems, we have the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that allow reaching difficult access places permitting better inspection. In this work, we propose using convolutional neuronal networks for crack recognition from images captured by an UAV. To carry out the training task of the network, a database of cracks in walls was built from images collected from the Internet. The training of the network prompted encouraging results with a 95% accuracy over the training set. Experimental results of crack recognition in images were carried out validating the application of the proposal.},

abstract={LSS (Low, Small and Slow) targets have characteristics of low cost, simple operation, easy to carry, low take-off requirements, strong sudden takeoff, and difficult to find and handle. With the development of aviation industry, the cases of LSS flying illegally and used in terrorist attacks are increasing day by day. It will not only cause great negative effects on economy, but also have serious influence on the national security and the normal development of the national economy. In order to eliminate the threat of illegal flight of UAV in the airport clearance area to the safe operation of airport, a LSS recognition algorithm based on the deep learning was proposed in the paper. Compared with other detection types, the video detection was used in the algorithm, which has many advantages such as strong visualization, low cost and fast detection speed. By using the Yolov3 object detection model, one of the most popular deep learning methods, the problem of low accuracy of small objects such as LSS can be solved. The experiments show that the Yolov3 model can improve the accuracy for small objects and can effectively detect the LSS. Thus, the necessary precondition for the subsequent LSS countermeasures can be provided, and the safe operation of the airport can be ensured.},

abstract={Due to a lack of environment awareness, today's low-altitude fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are limited to primitively follow user-defined waypoints. All high-level decision making is still performed by a human user. Fully-autonomous remote missions in complex environments however require true environment awareness both with respect to terrain and wind. While terrain-aware navigation is covered in existing literature, the real-time estimation and consideration of complex wind patterns onboard UAVs is not. This paper therefore presents the literature's first-ever local 3D wind field prediction method which can run in real time onboard a UAV. The selected method is a simple downscaling approach which retrieves low-resolution data from global weather models and then adjusts the wind field via potential flow theory such that terrain boundaries, mass conservation, and the atmospheric stratification are observed. Typical 3D wind fields of 1 km3 volume are calculated in below 10 seconds. Synthetic test cases such as the flow around a semi-cylinder, through a valley and over a ramp yield good results. A comparison with 3D LIDAR wind data collected over 10 days in the Swiss Alps shows an overall wind error reduction of 23% with respect to the zero-wind assumption that is mostly used for UAV path planning today. Overall, our initial research demonstrates the feasibility of real-time 3D wind field prediction onboard a UAV. However, the focus on low computation time means that the vertical wind prediction lacks accuracy. The paper therefore ends with a research outlook into real-time 3D wind field prediction through the fusion of machine learning techniques with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods.},

Our first contribution is to address the computational complexity of raw image matching, which can be time/space intractable due to the high dimensionality of raw image data. We propose to exploit raw image matching, not for the direct matching between query and database images, but for mining an available visual experience to find discriminative visual landmarks. The mined library images are then compared between query and database images using a naive Bayes nearest neighbor (NBNN) distance metric that has proven to be successful in cross domain (i.e., cross-view) image comparison. We developed a practical localization system consisting of a pipeline of two stages: (1) image retrieval using the NBNN distance metric, and (2) post verification of image matches using CNN feature. Experimental results show that our proposed framework tends to produce stable localization results despite the fact that our approach is significantly space/time efficient.},

abstract={Applications of UAVs have attracted attention recently. Some operations are subject to a low-latency constraint due to high-speed UAVs in 3D space. As a result, low-latency and directional mmWave communications can be taken into account in UAV communications. To overcome mmWave hardware limitations and severe environmental conditions, UAVs can exploit hybrid analog-digital beamforming to improve data rates. For the purpose of being flexible in mission-oriented deployment, the movement of UAVs in 3D space is common but makes beamforming more challenging. The beamforming problem can be solved into two steps: predicting analog beams and then optimizing the corresponding digital weights in terms of SINR maximization. Borrowing the idea of machine learning (especially Q-learning) that uses experience to solve the prediction problem, we implement Q-learning-based beam prediction using coupling coefficients. Compared with other beam tracking methods given knowledge of channel or SINR, using coupling coefficients as observations is a more feasible and efficient solution to rapid beam tracking. The coupling coefficients can be further used to approximate SINR measurements given the selected analog beams. Using the proposed relationship between the SINR measurements and digital weights, we can easily obtain the optimal digital weights.},

abstract={Every year, forest fire causes heavy death toll and destruction around the world. The number of forest fires is increasing each year along with the damages associated with it. At this point, traditional forest fire detection methods such as point sensors, thermal sensors, watch tower, human patrol and satellite imagery are not being enough to provide early detection and continuous monitoring. Recent developments in electronics and control systems have made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) more readily available and created an opportunity to utilize them for continuous forest monitoring with higher flexibility, maneuverability and precision. Early level experiments show that the limitations of the previous methods could be overcome by UAV-facilitated forest fire monitoring strategies. This paper highlights the basic idea of UAV-based forest fire monitoring and relevant researches and operations that have been conducted in this field thus far. The future of forest fire monitoring relies more on the use of UAVs and their onboard mission payloads, and the main motivation of this paper is to help for identifying the methodologies behind the existing systems and to find new methods of improving the UAV systems to fight this dreadful calamity.},

A reinforcement learning dissemination strategy is implemented in the framework. ADDSEN uses online learning techniques to adaptively balance the broadcast rate and knowledge loss rate periodically. The learned broadcast rate is adapted by executing state transitions during the process of online learning. A strategy function guides state transitions, incorporating a set of variables to reflect changes in link status. In addition, we design a cooperative dissemination method for the task of balancing storage and energy allocation in drone swarms. We implemented ADDSEN in our cyber-physical sensing framework, and evaluation results show that it can achieve both maximal adaptive data processing and dissemination performance, presenting better results than other commonly used dissemination protocols such as periodic, uniform and neighbor protocols in both single-swarm and multi-swarm cases.},

One of the emerging technologies for fire monitoring is deploying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, due to their high flexibility and maneuverability, less human risk, and on-demand high quality imaging capabilities. In order to realize a real-time system for fire detection and expansion analysis, fast and high-accuracy image-processing algorithms are required. Several studies have shown that deep learning methods can provide the most accurate response, however the training time can be prohibitively long, especially when using online learning for constant refinement of the developed model. Another challenge is the lack of large datasets for training a deep learning algorithm. In this respect, we propose to use a pretrained mobileNetV2 architecture to implement transfer learning, which requires a smaller dataset and reduces the computational complexity while not compromising the accuracy. In addition, we conduct an effective data augmentation pipeline to simulate some extreme scenarios, which could promise the robustness of our approach. The testing results illustrate that our method maintains a high identification accuracy in different situations - original dataset (99.7%), adding Gaussian blurred (95.3%), and additive Gaussian noise (99.3%).12},

abstract={In this paper, we demonstrate that computer vision pipelines utilising deep neural architectures are well-suited to perform automated Holstein Friesian cattle detection as well as individual identification in agriculturally relevant setups. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply deep learning to the task of automated visual bovine identification. We show that off-the-shelf networks can perform end-to-end identification of individuals in top-down still imagery acquired from fixed cameras. We then introduce a video processing pipeline composed of standard components to efficiently process dynamic herd footage filmed by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We report on these setups, as well as the context, training and evaluation of their components. We publish alongside new datasets: FriesianCattle2017 of in-barn top-down imagery, and AerialCattle2017 of outdoor cattle footage filmed by a DJI Inspire MkI UAV. We show that Friesian cattle detection and localisation can be performed robustly with an accuracy of 99.3% on this data. We evaluate individual identification exploiting coat uniqueness on 940 RGB stills taken after milking in-barn (89 individuals, accuracy = 86.1%). We also evaluate identification via a video processing pipeline on 46,430 frames originating from 34 clips (approx. 20 s length each) of UAV footage taken during grazing (23 individuals, accuracy = 98.1%). These tests suggest that, particularly when videoing small herds in uncluttered environments, an application of marker-less Friesian cattle identification is not only feasible using standard deep learning components - it appears robust enough to assist existing tagging methods.},

abstract={A disaster is something which occurs suddenly and causes enormous destruction. Disaster may be accidental or natural, but however both of these cannot be predicted. They are known as disaster because of their sudden and volatile nature. During a disaster the destruction is huge, while rescue and relief are always lagging due to the unpredictability and the destruction caused could only be identified after the disaster has shown its full rage. In order to get the information about the damage caused and other information about the disaster, we send a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which are a swarm of aerial robots (drones) that work together to achieve a particular target. Each drone in the swarm will VOTL, or vertically hover, take off, and land. Every drone has a particular number of rotors that propel it forward. Swarm intelligence is the collective behavior of decentralized, natural or artificial self- organized systems. This behavior tends to work by leaning with artificial intelligence. A flood scenario is simulated. Drone swarm will investigate the affected place in clusters and give us collective information, about the amount of damage caused by the disaster.},

abstract={With the continuous expansion of the scale of the power grid and the gradual maturity of the application of drones, drones with the advantages of flexibility and convenience can overcome terrain constraints while reducing manpower and safety risks and can be well qualified for the power inspection work under the large-scale development of the power grid and improve the inspection efficiency. However, the massive amount of data collected by UAV power line inspection relies on the human judgment through the naked eyes of staff, and the recognition efficiency is very low and the accuracy rate is subjectively influenced. In recent years, the gradual introduction of traditional machine learning and deep learning has led to significant improvements in inspection efficiency and accuracy. The autonomous obstacle avoidance technology based on the inherent electromagnetic field characteristics of power lines makes it possible for UAVs to cruise autonomously. Based on a systematic summary of the achieved results, this paper briefly reviews the overall development of both power component detection and autonomous cruise in UAV power line inspection. At the same time, the current problems and future research trends are described, expecting to provide references for further research in this field.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are increasingly used for a wide variety of novel tasks, including drone-based cinematography. However, flying drones in such setting requires the coordination of several people, increasing the cost of using drones for aerial cinematography and limiting the shooting flexibility by putting a significant cognitive load on the director and drone/camera operators. To overcome some of these limitation, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (RL) method for performing autonomous frontal view shooting. To this end, a realistic simulation environment is developed, which ensures that the learned agent can be directly deployed on a drone. Then, a deep RL algorithm, tailored to the needs of the specific application, is derived building upon the well known deep Q-learning approach. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is experimentally demonstrated using several quantitative and qualitative experiments.},

For this purpose, several systems have been used, among them, image processing, that is an alternative to the Global Positioning System. The employment of images in an autonomous navigation system has challenges, among them, the night flight. In this context, this article presents a study to estimate the UAV's geographical position with use of infrared images. From this image, a search is made in a georeferenced satellite image in the visible band. To automatically register between aerial and satellite images, edge information extracted by Artificial Neural Networks are used.

abstract={Drones, typically unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have many purposes. However, simultaneous operation of multiple drones is challenging, considering the real-time interactions and the environment; the drone must avoid collision with the other drones or obstacles. The proposed Advanced TD3 model performs energy-efficient path planning at the edge-level drone. We modify the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), which is the state-of-the-art policy gradient reinforcement learning. The frame stacking technique considers the continuous action space of the drone to the TD3 model. During the training, we gradually increase the observation range of agents for fast and stable convergence. We train the modified TD3 model through Offline RL to reduce the overhead for the RL model training. Drones mount the converged RL model on their onboard computer. The Advanced TD3 model in the drones selects an energy-efficient path without the overhead of the training process of the RL model in real-time, considering external factors such as wind or another drone. The total energy consumption of drones in flight along with online path planning is approximately 106% of the total energy consumption of drones that follow offline path planning, even though the trained TD3 model does not require complex computations for real-time execution.},

First, it is difficult to determine the optimal size of spatial patches for different hyperspectral images (HSIs). Second, this operation only exploits spatial features locally but not globally. In this paper, we propose a novel spectral patching network (SPNet) with an end-to-end deep learning architecture for HSI classification. SPNet uses "spectral patching" and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to fully preserve the local and global spatial contextual information of original HSIs. The experimental results with UAV-borne hyperspectral dataset demonstrate that the SPNet achieved state-of-the-art accuracy and visualization performance in.},

abstract={It is one of the significant tasks of power inspection by multi rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to recognize engineering vehicles in aerial images. If there are engineering vehicles working near or below the high-voltage power line, the UAV would give out the important early warning message to avoid the situation that the bucket or boom of the engineering vehicle enters the safe distance from the high-voltage power line, and reduce accidents such as short circuit breakdown. Aiming at the problem of recognition of engineering vehicles in aerial images of UAV inspection, this paper proposed an improved capsule network method. First, the structure of original capsule network is replaced with a multi-layer densely connected capsule network. Next, the dynamic routing algorithm of the capsule network is improved. As the results of experiments have shown, (1) the improved capsule network method gets a mAP of 93.74% for the recognition of engineering vehicles, and its parameter scale is smaller than other methods. (2) The number of network layers influences the recognition precision greatly. Their relationship is non-monotonic and nonlinear. In addition, whether or not to improve the dynamic routing algorithm does not affect the trends of recognition mAP. The overall performance of the improved capsule network method is obviously better than YOLOv5 and other artificial feature extraction methods.},

abstract={The widespread Pomacea canaliculata and Pomacea maculata in North America and Asia have caused significant adverse effects on the local ecological environment and residents’ health. Timely knowledge of the distribution of eggs from the two Pomacea spp. in a certain region can effectively reduce the cost of treatment and improve prevention effectiveness. Most of the existing methods are only able to identify eggs from the two Pomacea spp. or detect them in specific but not natural environments while they cannot achieve good results in the face of a complex real-world scene. This letter proposes a model for detecting eggs from the two Pomacea spp. based on dynamic convolution and multiscale feature fusion. The model can identify and locate the eggs of the two Pomacea spp. effectively. At the same time, we combined the proposed model with scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm to design a system for counting eggs of the two Pomacea spp., which can automatically identify the eggs in the actual natural environment and alleviate duplicate counting caused by image acquisition. Besides, we also built a dataset of 20 000 images of Pomacea canaliculata eggs and Pomacea maculata eggs from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial photography. Experimental results showed that the proposed deep learning model has a better performance than others, and the proposed computer vision system can be successfully applied to support Pomacea spp. disease management.},

In our study, two complementary techniques are proposed within the framework of deterministic policy gradient (DPG). First, the advantage function is introduced in the critic network to improve the performance of the learning process. The proposed representation of the action value function consists of two parts: the low-frequency part and the high-frequency one. Second, a two-stream network is developed to tackle with the issue of partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The architecture synthesizes past experiences to perform policy evaluations and policy improvements, which has successfully improved the robustness of the learned policy.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image stitching techniques based on position and attitude information have shown clear speed superiority over feature-based counterparts. However, how to improve stitching accuracy and robustness remains a great challenge since position and attitude parameters are sensitive to noise introduced by sensors and external environment. To mitigate this issue, this work presents a simple yet effective stitching algorithm for UAV images based on a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, we first conduct coarse registration using the position and attitude information obtained from GPS, IMU and altimeter. Then, we introduce a novel offline calibration phase that is designed to regress the obtained global transformation matrix to the optimal one computed from feature-based algorithms, by using multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for fast correction. Consequently, the proposed method well integrates the complementary strengths of both parameter and feature based methods, achieving an ideal speed-accuracy trade-off. Moreover, to facilitate research on this topic, we establish a new dataset, named UAV-AIRPAI, that comprises of over 100 UAV image pairs with position and attitude annotations to the community, opening up a promising direction for UAV image stitching. Extensive experiments on the UAV-AIRPAI dataset show that our method achieves superior accuracy compared to priors while running at a real-time speed of 0.0124 second per image pair. Code and data will be available at https://github.com/dededust/UAV-AIRPAI.},

By adding an encoder in front of the generator, the disaster area image transmitted by UAV is compressed to meet the requirements of the generator. After the compressed image is trained together with the real image through the discriminator, the quality of the compressed image is constantly improved. This image compression algorithm can fully synthesize the codes of non-major areas such as trees and rivers in the image, and try to retain the codes of important areas such as houses and roads. The experimental results show that the proposed compression method in this paper has a higher compression ratio than the traditional compression method for the disaster area image, and can obtain images with strong sense of hierarchy.},

A single layer radial basis neural network is used to approximate the unmodeled dynamics and vehicle stability is guaranteed through Lyapunov synthesis. For simulation study six degree of freedom model (6-DOF) is implemented in MATLAB along with the proposed control approach. The performance of the controller is evaluated using nonlinear bop-up maneuver and the necessary stability and tracking performance of the UAV have been investigated.},

abstract={Traditional approaches to sensor fault tolerance for flight control systems have been based on triple or quadruple physical redundancy. However, recent events have highlighted the criticality of "common mode" failures on the Air Data System (ADS). In fact, since the parameters of flight control laws are typically scheduled as a function of airspeed, incorrect readings from the ADS can lead to potentially catastrophic conditions. In this paper, we describe the evaluation of an analytical redundancy-based approach to the problem of Sensor Failure Accommodation following simulated failures on the ADS of a research UAV, using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Specifically, two different neural networks are evaluated - the Extended Minimal Resource Allocating Network and a Multilayer Feedforward NN. These neural networks are trained and validated using experimental flight data from the WVU YF-22 research aircraft which was designed, manufactured, instrumented, and flight tested by researchers at the Flight Control Systems Laboratory at West Virginia University. The performance of the two approaches is evaluated in terms of the statistics of the tracking error in the estimation of the airspeed, as compared to actual measurements from the ADS, operating under nominal conditions.},

abstract={This paper presents experimental results of a high-level trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous quadrotors based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) tuned with machine learning. Time-varying planar inequality constraints are used to avoid obstacles. The nonlinear plant dynamics are linearized around a hover condition. Learning Automata is used to select the relative weights of the objective function and compensate for nonlinearities lost during this linearization. The proposed technique successfully guides a quadcopter to a target while avoiding a spherical obstacle placed in its path. These results demonstrate the potential application for MPC-based techniques in unmanned aerial vehicle operations that involve obstacles. Furthermore, they demonstrate that machine learning can be used to tune parameters in an MPC formulation.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel tracking method based on structured metric learning, which takes the advantages of both structured learning and distance metric learning. In our method, tracking is formulated as a structured metric learning problem, which not only considers the importance of different samples, but also improves the discriminability by learning a specific distance metric for matching. Specifically, a concrete structured metric learning method is realized by making use of the constraints from the target and its neighbour training samples under the above framework. Besides, a closed-form solution is derived for the structured metric learning problem. To improve the matching robustness, the K-nearest neighbours (KNN) distance is employed to determine the final tracking result. Experimental results in the benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed structured metric learning based tracking method can achieve desirable performance.},

abstract={Phenotyping is the process of estimating the physical and chemical properties of a plant. Traditional phenotyping is labor intensive and time consuming. These measurements can be obtained faster by collecting aerial images with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and analyzing them using modern image analysis technologies. We propose a method to estimate plant centers by classifying each pixel as a plant center or not a plant center. We then label the center of each cluster as the plant location. We studied the performance of our method on two datasets. We achieved 84% precision and 90% recall on one dataset consisting of early stage plants and 62% precision and 77% recall on another dataset consisting of later stage plants.},

abstract={Person re-identification (re-ID) aims to query or match the identical individuals across multiple non-overlapping surveillance cameras and has become an important visual task in various applications such as pedestrian security and video surveillance. Although much recent progress has been made to address the problem of person re-ID, the blind areas without surveillance cameras are not considered, which are usually the hiding places of criminals or suspects. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we apply data link technology to person re-ID, and propose a person re-ID model based on data link technology, which can realize all-round, continuous and real-time monitoring and tracking of target persons, and even achieve the identifying and attacking of partial key target persons.},
