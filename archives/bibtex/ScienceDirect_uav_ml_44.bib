abstract = {On the one hand, vertiports in economically developed areas will present the operation mode of multi-vertiport, and the contradiction between the development of urban air mobility and limited operating resources is very serious. On the other hand, unlike fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have different operating processes and limited battery energy supply. Long flight times in the terminal area pose a risk of exhaustion and great safety challenges. Given the terminal area of the multi-vertiport system (MVS-TA), this paper investigates the adaptive control system (ACS), which includes the design of the operating environment and the integrated scheduling model. The design of the operating environment is the basis of adaptive management, which consists of the concept of multi-ring structure and the junction control rules based on backpressure policy. Considering the power constraint and dynamic priority, an integrated model including path planning model and distributed sequencing model is constructed to solve the cooperative scheduling problem of approach-departure flights. Results from numerical analyses reveal that: First, in the case of large flight flow, ACS can achieve the efficiency and safety of MVS-TA operation better than the traditional control system. Secondly, the flight density into the terminal area has a greater impact on ACS performance relative to flight volume. With a density of less than 120 flights/hour, the operating efficiency of MVS-TA under ACS varies within 10.3% with the number of flights or density.}

abstract = {Over the last few years, an extensive set of technologies have been systematically included in precision agriculture (PA) and also in precision viticulture (PV) practices, as tools that allow efficient monitoring of nearly any parameter to achieve sustainable crop management practices and to increase both crop yield and quality. However, many technologies and standards are not yet included on those practices. Therefore, potential benefits that may result from putting together agronomic knowledge with electronics and computer technologies are still not fully accomplished. Both emergent and established paradigms, such as the Internet of Everything (IoE), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing, together with increasingly cheaper computing technologies – with very low power requirements and a diversity of wireless technologies, available to exchange data with increased efficiency – and intelligent systems, have evolved to a level where it is virtually possible to expeditiously create and deploy any required monitoring solution. Pushed by all of these technological trends and recent developments, data integration has emerged as the layer between crops and knowledge needed to efficiently manage it. In this paper, the mySense environment is presented, aimed to systematize data acquisition procedures to address common PA/PV issues. mySense builds over a 4-layer technological structure: sensor and sensor nodes, crop field and sensor networks, cloud services and support to front-end applications. It makes available a set of free tools based on the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) concept and enables the use of Arduino® and Raspberry Pi (RPi) low-cost platforms to quickly prototype a complete monitoring application. Field experiments provide compelling evidences that mySense environment represents an important step forward towards Smart Farming, by enabling the use of low-cost, fast deployment, integrated and transparent technologies to increase PA/PV monitoring applications adoption.}

abstract = {Land conversion and fragmentation threaten the resilience and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems which makes the future of their services to humans uncertain. Remote sensing can provide frequent and consistent data to facilitate wetland monitoring from regional to national scales and support their conservation and adaptive management. However, unique characteristics of wetlands, particularly land cover heterogeneity and background reflectance from soil, water and dead biomass, limit the efficacy of remote-sensing based metrics developed for terrestrial ecosystems. To identify the factors impacting satellite-based measurements of wetland greenness, we tested how six spectral vegetation indices responded to the land surface characteristics and regional climatic and edaphic context of 1,138 wetlands sites surveyed by the U.S EPA's National Wetland Condition Assessment. Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were estimated using all cloud-free surface reflectance data captured in 2011 by Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM+. We tested two annually aggregated metrics —maximum and median greenness— for each SVI to facilitate the analysis of such a large dataset of satellite images. Using univariate and multivariate ordinary least square regression, we assessed how the annual maximum and median of each SVI responded to indicators of vegetation structure and composition, presence of dead biomass, open water, bare soil, and climatic/edaphic variables. Results show that, in the full national-scale dataset, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) were most responsive to field-based metrics of vegetation structure and composition. However, the responses of SVIs differed significantly among wetland types, suggesting that their use should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the monitored wetlands. Annually aggregated metrics showed different sensitivity in multivariate models, with median greenness being more sensitive to structure and composition, but also to confounding site variables including litter, open water, and bare soil. This study represents a first-time effort to study relationships between the on-site properties of wetlands and their spectral characteristics at a national scale.}

abstract = {The study of mass and energy transfer across landscapes has recently evolved to comprehensive considerations acknowledging the role of biota and humans as geomorphic agents, as well as the importance of small-scale landscape features. A contributing and supporting factor to this evolution is the emergence over the last two decades of technologies able to acquire high resolution topography (HRT) (meter and sub-meter resolution) data. Landscape features can now be captured at an appropriately fine spatial resolution at which surface processes operate; this has revolutionized the way we study Earth-surface processes. The wealth of information contained in HRT also presents considerable challenges. For example, selection of the most appropriate type of HRT data for a given application is not trivial. No definitive approach exists for identifying and filtering erroneous or unwanted data, yet inappropriate filtering can create artifacts or eliminate/distort critical features. Estimates of errors and uncertainty are often poorly defined and typically fail to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the dataset, which may introduce bias or error for many analyses. For ease of use, gridded products are typically preferred rather than the more information-rich point cloud representations. Thus many users take advantage of only a fraction of the available data, which has furthermore been subjected to a series of operations often not known or investigated by the user. Lastly, standard HRT analysis work-flows are yet to be established for many popular HRT operations, which has contributed to the limited use of point cloud data. In this review, we identify key research questions relevant to the Earth-surface processes community within the theme of mass and energy transfer across landscapes and offer guidance on how to identify the most appropriate topographic data type for the analysis of interest. We describe the operations commonly performed from raw data to raster products and we identify key considerations and suggest appropriate work-flows for each, pointing to useful resources and available tools. Future research directions should stimulate further development of tools that take advantage of the wealth of information contained in the HRT data and address the present and upcoming research needs such as the ability to filter out unwanted data, compute spatially variable estimates of uncertainty and perform multi-scale analyses. While we focus primarily on HRT applications for mass and energy transfer, we envision this review to be relevant beyond the Earth-surface processes community for a much broader range of applications involving the analysis of HRT.}

Like any software ecosystem, ROS must evolve in order to keep meeting the requirements of its users. In practice, packages may end up being abandoned between releases: no one may be available to update a package, or newer packages offer similar functionality. As such, we wanted to identify and understand the evolution challenges faced by the ROS ecosystem. In this article, we report our findings after interviewing 19 ROS developers in depth, followed by a focus group (4 participants) and an online survey of 119 ROS community members. We specifically focused on the issues surrounding package reuse and how to contribute to existing packages. To conclude, we discuss the implications of our findings, and propose five recommendations for overcoming the identified issues, with the goal of improving the health of the ROS ecosystem.}

A consensus protocol is proposed by using the centrality measure for agent which is determined by the information flow through multi-agent systems. In analyzing multi-agent systems, a graph representation is used. The concept of centrality measure which was introduced in the field of social network analysis is attempted to find the most central node within the graph. This work is intended to observe the Katz-centrality that is one of centrality measures. Here, the advantage of Katz-centrality is that a node’s centrality depends not only on how many others the node is connected to (its degree), but also on their centrality. The alternative consensus protocol will be applied to the leader-following formation problems for discrete-time multi-agent systems with second-order dynamics and time-varying communication delay. To achieve this, sufficient conditions for the aforementioned problems will be established in terms of linear matrix inequality by utilizing the Lyapunov method and some mathematical techniques. Finally, the discrete-time multi-agent systems modeled with a point-mass dynamics of motion for aircraft and its simulation results are given to illustrate the advantages of the alternative consensus protocol in point of the robustness on time delay and H∞ performance.}

To create a successful ubiquitous manufacturing system, an efficient material handling system is essential. In accordance with this reason, mobile robots have been used for transporting materials. This paper aims at developing a methodology for scheduling the material supply for a single mobile robot in a ubiquitous manufacturing environment. In this type of environment, the processing rate of the materials along with supply quantity corresponds to the cycle of material supply. The carrying capacity of the robots are limited and thus the problem of determining the material supply quantity and material supply schedule without lack of materials for production or service processes becomes complicated. In this work, a nonlinear program is formulated to schedule the supply of material and determine the required material quantity. A heuristic algorithm based on genetic algorithm is developed to solve the problem. From the numerical experiments conducted in this study, it is observed that the proposed algorithm shows good performance and can also be implemented to solve large scale problems.}

Herein, an optimisation framework of a full-scale wing-box structure with VAT-fibre composites is presented, aiming at minimised mass and optimised local buckling performance under realistic aeroelastic loading conditions. Local buckling analyses on individual subsections of the wing are performed with refined finite-element models by extracting running loads from an aeroelastic analysis of the entire wing structure. Using this global–local approach, an optimisation is conducted with static failure, aeroelastic, buckling and manufacturing constraints to obtain optimised structural parameters for straight- and VAT-fibre composite wing-box architectures. By optimising wing-skin thicknesses, fibre paths and wing-spar geometry simultaneously via a genetic algorithm, the potential benefit of a VAT design is explored. In addition, the continuous tow shearing (CTS) manufacturing process, which introduces layer thickness variations as tows are steered, is explored. A mass reduction of 12.5% and 13.2% is obtained by using the constant-thickness VAT and variable-thickness CTS designs, respectively, compared to a baseline quasi-isotropic straight-fibre design. The optimised wing-skin thickness distribution also suggests that local buckling is the critical failure mode in specific regions, and therefore needs to be included during aeroelastic optimisation.}

The flapping dynamics of the main rotors is taken into consideration in the modeling process. The adaptive method is employed to handle the unknown bounded disturbances. A novel fault tolerant control (FTC) strategy is proposed to cope with actuator faults, which can effectively overcome the singularity problem in many adaptive estimation approaches by using projection function. Meanwhile, a suitable barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is constructed to refrain from the violation of the state constraints. Combining with the backstepping technique, the four control inputs of the medium-scale UAH system are designed in sequence. Via the Lyapunov analysis, it is proved that all error signals in the closed-loop system converge to a small neighborhood around zero. Simulation studies are carried out to reveal the validity of the presented approach.}

Distance and thermal information contain independent information on canopy growth, plant structure and the physiological status. In a four-years′ study hyperspectral, distance and thermal high-throughput measurements were obtained from different sets of drought stressed spring barley cultivars. All possible binary, normalized spectral indices as well as thirteen spectral indices found by others to be related to biomass, tissue chlorophyll content, water status or chlorophyll fluorescence were calculated from hyperspectral data and tested for their correlation with grain yield. Data were analysed by multiple linear regression and partial least square regression models, that were calibrated and cross-validated for yield prediction. Overall partial least square models improved yield prediction (R2=0.57; RMSEC=0.63) compared to multiple linear regression models (R2=0.46; RMSEC=0.74) in the model calibration. In cross-validation, both methods yielded similar results (PLSR: R2=0.41, RMSEV=0.74; MLR: R2=0.40, RMSEV=0.78). The spectral indices R780/R550, R760/R730, R780/R700, the spectral water index R900/R970 and laser and ultrasonic distance parameters contributed favourably to grain yield prediction, whereas the thermal based crop water stress index and the red edge inflection point contributed little to the improvement of yield models. Using only more uniform modern cultivars decreased the model performance compared to calibrations done with a set of more diverse cultivars. The partial least square models based on data fusion improved yield prediction (R2=0.62; RMSEC=0.59) compared to the partial least square models based only on hyperspectral data (R2=0.48; RMSEC=0.69) in the model calibration. This improvement was confirmed by cross-validation (data fusion: R2=0.39, RMSEV=0.76; hyperspectral data only: R2=0.32, RMSEV=0.79). Thus, a combination of spectral multiband and distance sensing improved the performance in yield prediction compared to using only hyperspectral sensing.}

Aerial imaging based plant counting is a widely studied topic in remote sensing. Nevertheless, existing methodologies are not applicable for in-field nurseries tree counting due to the complexity in canopy shapes, irregular plant spacing and growth, and diverse textures captured on the images. In this study, a new algorithm has been developed in accordance to the specific requirements of apple nurseries images. Algorithm composed of two key steps, i.e. a raster processing followed by a vector analyses. First step attempt to isolate apple plant pixels using spatial, spectral, and radiometric enhancements. In vector processing, filters based on the size and location of the polygons were applied to isolate the areas resulting from earlier step to represent apple plants. Algorithm was evaluated to estimate number of apple trees in an young nursery imaged with low altitude multispectral imaging system at four altitudes of 10, 25, 40, and 50 m. Multispectral imaging sensor consisted of near-infrared (NIR), green and blue as three bands. For 10- and 25-m images, algorithm performance was evaluated in individual as well as in mosaic images. Low altitude images with ≤ 25 m above ground level were ideally suited for young apple nursery tree count with 5% or less estimation error. Tree count accuracy was 97% and 95% for 10-m altitude individual and mosaic images, respectively. Similarly, those values were 92% and 88% for 25-m altitude images. Based on the results, images at 40 m are recommended only when the methodology include four extra steps added to the base algorithm to have tree count accuracies of about 88%. Images at 50 m are not recommended in any case due to the low accuracy obtained (~ 75%). Overall, the low altitude multispectral imaging integrated with image processing algorithm developed in this study will aid nursery growers in low-cost and timely tree count needed for inventory mapping and management.}

Assuming the alarms and the actions of the standard operating procedure as discrete events, the diagnosis step relies on situation recognition to provide the operators with relevant information on the failures inducing the alarm flows. The situation recognition is based on chronicle recognition where we propose to use the hybrid causal model of the system and simulations to generate the representative event sequences from which the chronicles are learned using the Heuristic Chronicle Discovery Algorithm Modified (HCDAM). An extension of this algorithm is presented in this article where the expertise knowledge is included as temporal restrictions which are a new input to HCDAM. An illustrative example in the field of petrochemical plants is presented.}

While regular Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be used to model operator behavior, HSMMs are particularly suited to time-critical supervisory control domains due to their explicit representation of state duration. Using HSMMs, we demonstrate in an unmanned vehicle supervisory control environment that such models can accurately predict future operator behavior both in terms of states and durations.}

This study developed and evaluated a novel method for analysis of multispectral data to map the relative cover of spotted knapweed in a heterogeneous grassland community. The method developed in this work, termed metapixel-based image analysis, segments the image into a grid of metapixels for which grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based statistics can be computed as descriptive features. Using RPAS-acquired multispectral imagery and plant species inventories performed on 1m2 quadrats, a random forest classifier was trained to predict the qualitative degree of spotted knapweed ground cover within each metapixel. The best mean cross-validation score achieved was 71.3% when describing relative ground cover of spotted knapweed, with an accuracy of 66.0% when applied to an independent validation dataset. Analysis of the performance of metapixel-based image analysis on this study site suggests that feature optimization, including feature subset selection, and the use of GLCM-based texture features is of critical importance for achieving an accurate classification.}

abstract = {The paper Cyber Physical Systems integrated in VIPRO- Platform through intelligent control interfaces and genetic algorithms to build “digital-twins” robots vectors tools for cyber-physical manufacturing presents. Intelligent control interfaces are useful for simulating robots vectors’ capabilities in a safe and cost-effective way, but it is challenging to accurately emulate the behavior of the physical tools. When an unmanned autonomous vehicles breaks down or malfunctions, engineers can always go back to check the digital traces using the “digital-twins” VIPRO- Platform for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper presents an integration of Cyber Physical Systems using intelligent control interfaces and genetic algorithms into developing “digital-twins” VIPRO- Platform in 5G Digital era to improve their accountability and capabilities for cyber-physical manufacturing. The intelligent control interfaces data are used to extract the machining characteristics profiles of a digital-twins machine tool, with which the tool can better reflect the actual status of its physical counterpart in its various applications. The modelling techniques and decision making in complex systems for controlling the position of a unmanned autonomous vehicles engaged in a mission are discussed, and analytical techniques of data and genetic algorithms are presented for modeling and developing “digital-twins ”VIPRO- Platform.}

Water security exists when all people have physical and economical access to sufficient, safe, and clean water that meets basic needs. However, water security is threatened by growing human population, episodic environmental disasters, indiscriminate land management practices, contaminants, and escalation in geopolitical conflicts. <3% of the estimated 1.4 billion cubic kilometers of water on earth is available for consumption. Although there exist a range of laboratory and field methods for measuring the chemical, physical and biological properties of water, the information available to the public remains inconsistent and patchy. To this end, we advance a new theory of a single-value objective water quality index (WQI) that considers the interaction between the above properties, to provide concise information for source water quality surveillance and monitoring. Although geospatial technologies such as remote sensing is credited as a high frequency spatiotemporal mapping tool, exiguous information is available on its application for constructing single-value WQIs. Besides, no remote sensing device exists that directly measures water quality, which must indirectly be inferred through modeling sensed remote sensing signals with measured water properties. This review not only highlights the water security conundrum but also provides an overview of methods for integrating geolocated qualitative (e.g., management data) with quantitative (i.e., measured water constituent properties) into a WQI.}

This paper presents a method based on probabilistic and stochastic approaches to estimate system RUL for periodically monitored degradation processes with dynamic time-varying operational conditions and condition-specific failure zones. The method assumes that the degradation rate is influenced by specific operational condition and moreover, the transition between different operational conditions plays the most important role in affecting the degradation process. These operational conditions are assumed to evolve as a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). The failure thresholds are also determined by specific operational conditions and described as different failure zones. The 2008 PHM Conference Challenge Data is utilized to illustrate our method, which contains mass sensory signals related to the degradation process of a commercial turbofan engine. The RUL estimation method using the sensor measurements of a single sensor was first developed, and then multiple vital sensors were selected through a particular optimization procedure in order to increase the prediction accuracy. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are presented in a comparison with existing methods for the same dataset.}

Walsh basis functions are used to capture the non-smooth fast varying dynamics. The piecewise time-varying frequency response function (TV-FRF) is approximated by the sum of a series of LTI FRFs multiplied with a set of Walsh functions. The best linear time invariant approximation (BLTIA) of the TV-FRF is estimated with small uncertainty. Besides the BLTIA, the two methods are capable of estimating the noise power spectrum and the TV-FRF. The error analysis shows that ATIRMM delivers more accurate TV-FRF and BLTIA estimations, while ALPM has better performance in noise power spectrum estimation. The conclusions are illustrated by simulations.}

abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) data acquired from airborne or spaceborne platforms have revolutionized measurement and mapping of forest attributes. Airborne data are often either acquired using multiple overlapped flight lines to provide complete coverage of an area of interest, or using transects to sample a given population. Spaceborne lidar datasets are unique to each sensor and are sample- or profile-based with characteristics driven by acquisition mode and orbital parameters. To leverage the wealth of accurate vegetation structural data from these lidar systems, a number of approaches have been developed to extend these observations over broader areas, from local landscapes to the globe. In this review we examine studies that have utilised modelling approaches to extend air- or space-based lidar data with the aim of communicating methods, outcomes, and accuracies, and offering guidance on linking lidar metrics and lidar-derived forest attributes with broad-area predictors. Modelling approaches are developed for a variety of applications. In some cases, generation of spatially-exhaustive layers may be useful for forest management purposes, driving management and inventory decisions over smaller focus areas or regions. In other cases, outputs are designed for monitoring at regional or global scales, and may be – due to the spatial grain of the structural estimates – insufficiently accurate or reliable for management. From the reviewed studies, we found height, aboveground biomass and volume, derived from either upper proportions of a large-footprint full-waveform lidar profiles, or statistically modelled from discrete return small-footprint lidar point clouds, to be the most commonly extended forest attributes, followed by canopy cover, basal area and stand complexity. Assessment of the accuracy and bias of the extrapolated forest attributes varied with both independent and model-derived estimates. The coefficient of determination (R2) was the most often reported, followed by absolute and relative (i.e., as a proportion of the mean) root mean square error (RMSE and RMSE% respectively). Compilation of the stated accuracies suggested that the variance explained in predictions of forest height ranged from R2 = 0.38 to 0.90 (mean = 0.64), RMSE from 2 to 6m and RMSE% from 12 to 34%. For volume, R2 ranged from 0.25 to 0.72 (mean = 0.53) and RMSE from 60 to 87 m3/ha and for aboveground biomass (AGB) R2 ranged from 0.35 to 0.78 (mean = 0.55) and RMSE from 28 to 44 Mg/ha. There was no consensus on the level of accuracy required to support successful extension over larger areas. Ultimately, the review suggests that the information need motivating the spatial extension over larger areas drives the choice of the type of lidar data, spatial datasets and related grain. We conclude by discussing future directions and the outlook for new approaches including new lidar-derived response variables, advances in modelling approaches, and assessment of change.}

In order to accomplish this, network layer has attained significant attention; therefore, abundant routing protocols have been proposed. In VANET, frequent movement and rapid topological variation lead to repeated link breakage, causing loss in packet and delay. As compared to other VANET routing protocols proposed so far, location based routing methods provide one of the best solutions, by not relying on pre destination route entries. However, location based routing protocol also encounters several challenges such as local optimum problem, inaccurate positioning, optimum forwarder selection and broadcasting overheads. This paper analyzes these challenges in brief, and critically compares the existing solutions proposed so far. It also presents brief description of emerging WAVE+LTE based technology along with some viable direction for future improvement related to location based routing protocols.}

abstract = {Microplastics have been predominantly studied in marine environments compared to freshwater systems. However, the number of studies analyzing microplastic concentrations in water and sediment within lakes and rivers are increasing and are of utmost importance as freshwaters are major pathways for plastics to the oceans. To allow for an adequate risk assessment, detailed knowledge concerning plastic concentrations in different environmental compartments of freshwaters are necessary. Therefore, the major aim of this study was the quantification and analysis of temporal and spatial distribution of microplastics (<5 mm) in freshwater shore and bed sediments at Lake Tollense, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. Likewise, it addresses the hypothesis that lakes may serve as long-term storage basins for microplastics. Concentrations were investigated semi-annually over a two-year period at four sandy bank border segments representing different expositions and levels of anthropogenic influence. In addition, lakebed samples were taken along the longitudinal dimension of Lake Tollense. Mean microplastic abundances were 1,410 ± 822 particles/kg DW for lakeshore sediments and 10,476 ± 4,290 particles/kg DW for lakebed sediments. Fragments were more abundant compared to fibers in both sediment compartments. Spatial and temporal variation was especially recognized for lakeshore sediments whereas microplastic abundances in lakebed sediments did not differ significantly between sampling points and sampling campaigns. This can be related to long-term accumulation at the lakebed. Lower microplastic abundances were found within the intertidal zone at lake beaches where constant wave action reduces accumulation. Increased microplastic abundances were recognized at the beach with least anthropogenic influence but in proximity to a tributary, which may serve as microplastic input pathway into Lake Tollense due to its catchment comprising mainly agricultural areas. Furthermore, spatial variations in microplastic concentrations were related to the abundance of macroplastic items at beaches and correlated with pedologic sediment characteristics, namely the content of organic matter.}

The objective was to link the satellite spectro-temporal data to the plant diversity indices. Among the several diversity indices tested, Simpson and Shannon indices were best predicted with a coefficient of determination around 0.4 using a Random Forest predictor and Sentinel-2 data. The use of Sentinel-1 data was not found to improve significantly the prediction accuracy. Using the Random Forest algorithm and the Sentinel-2 time series, the prediction of the Simpson index was performed. The resulting map highlights the intra-parcel variability and demonstrates the capacity of satellite image time series to monitor grasslands plant taxonomic diversity from an ecological viewpoint.}

First, a double-layer independent position-velocity fixed topology is adopted to overcome the drawback of narrow bandwidth of underwater communication. Then, an extended high-gain observer (EHGO) is utilized to provide compensation to uncertain nonlinearities and environmental disturbances. Moreover, the consensus theory is incorporated with an integral sliding mode controller to guarantee that the multi-underactuated AUV system can track the desired trajectory while maintaining the predefined formation. In addition, based on the analysis for the whole formation control system, the extended high-gain observer is on the ultra-fast time scale, the integral sliding mode controller is on the fast time scale, and the system state converges to the desired state on the slow time scale. Such multi-time scale structure allows independent analysis of the dynamics in each time scale, and the singular perturbation method is effectively utilized to establish the exponential stability of the equilibrium. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the control performance.}

abstract = {In emergency situations like the recent Australian bushfires, it is crucial for civilians and firefighters to receive critical information such as available escape routes with guarantees on accuracy, timeliness, reliability, and completeness. Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) can provide communications in bushfires but guaranteeing information delivery that meets user needs is not easy with current MANET forwarding solutions. Quality of Information (QoI) based source selection has recently been developed in MANETs for this purpose. The most popular QoI scheme uses the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), an intensive pairwise comparison procedure to score sources using a linear combination of low-level network metrics in a hierarchical two-step process. Current QoI-AHP, by directing traffic to a single high scoring source, often creates additional bottlenecks and does not guarantee the higher-level information needs of users. In this work, we develop a novel low overhead source selection scheme, QoI with Thresholds (QoIT), that is designed to deliver the required target performance thresholds for users. QoIT introduces two modifications to QoI-AHP. Firstly, it replaces the raw network performance value by the ratio of the network metric value to the user’s demand for that performance, a goodness measure of how far the value of the network metric is from meeting the user’s demand. The ratios are fed into QoIT’s process for assigning multi-dimensional scores to each source. Secondly, QoIT uses new source selection criteria to choose the source that best delivers the information that meets the user needs. To evaluate QoIT and QoI-AHP performances in emergency communications, we develop a novel simulation software with realistic models across multiple network layers. Our QoIT algorithm works with any combination of quality thresholds for any subset of network metrics. Simulation results show that QoIT out-performs QoI-AHP by increasing user usability by 57%, ensuring high priority requirements are met, reducing source bottlenecks, and decreasing the source selection time by 62.5%.}

abstract = {Recent advances in multimedia technology have led to tremendous increases in the available volume of video data, thereby creating a major requirement for efficient systems to manage such huge data volumes. Video summarization is one of the key techniques for accessing and managing large video libraries. Video summarization can be used to extract the affective contents of a video sequence to generate a concise representation of its content. Human attention models are an efficient means of affective content extraction. Existing visual attention driven summarization frameworks have high computational cost and memory requirements, as well as a lack of efficiency in accurately perceiving human attention. To cope with these issues, we propose a divide-and-conquer based framework for an efficient summarization of big video data. We divide the original video data into shots, where an attention model is computed from each shot in parallel. Viewer's attention is based on multiple sensory perceptions, i.e., aural and visual, as well as the viewer's neuronal signals. The aural attention model is based on the Teager energy, instant amplitude, and instant frequency, whereas the visual attention model employs multi-scale contrast and motion intensity. Moreover, the neuronal attention is computed using the beta-band frequencies of neuronal signals. Next, an aggregated attention curve is generated using an intra- and inter-modality fusion mechanism. Finally, the affective content in each video shot is extracted. The fusion of multimedia and neuronal signals provides a bridge that links the digital representation of multimedia with the viewer’s perceptions. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed shot-detection based divide-and-conquer strategy mitigates the time and computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed attention model provides an accurate reflection of the user preferences and facilitates the extraction of highly affective and personalized summaries.}

Firstly, the typical identification method of combination modeling was selected to establish the model, and then the corresponding experiments were designed to determine the transfer function parameters and models of the combined modeling. Based on these, through further simplification and indirect methods, with the help of MATLAB toolbox, a fast system identification method was established by calculating the transmission ratio of the pump motor system through the output speed of the gearbox, the engine speed and the drive ratio of the front gear of the pump, as well as the transmission ratio of the gearbox. Filter was used to remove the influence of noise during the experiment. Compared with the test data, the models established by the two identification methods have higher accuracy. The positive and negative fitting rates of the fast identification method are 91.85 and 91.13, respectively, which can meet the needs of subsequent research. This study can be used as a reference for the subsequent control design of transmission and the study on the quality of the transmission.}

We present a stochastic control algorithm based on two biological mechanisms–stigmergy and templates–that takes advantage of compliant pockets for autonomous construction with single and multiple robots. The control algorithm guides the robot(s) to build the protective barrier without relying on a central planner, an external computer, or a motion capture system. We propose a statistical model to represent the structures built with the compliant pockets, and we provide a set of criteria for assessing the performance of the proposed system. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, real-robot and simulation experiments were carried out. The results show the viability of the proposed autonomous construction system.}

abstract = {Bananas and plantains provide food and income for more than 50 million smallholder farmers in East and Central African (ECA) countries. However, banana productivity generally achieves less than optimal yield potential (<30%) in most regions, including Uganda. Numerous studies have been undertaken to identify the key challenges that smallholder banana growers face at different stages of the banana value chain, with one of the main constraints being a lack of policy-relevant agricultural data. The World Bank (WB) initiated a methodological survey design aimed at identifying the distribution of banana varieties across a number of key Ugandan growing regions, at the individual household scale. To achieve this outcome a number of approaches including ground-based surveys, DNA tissue collection of selected banana plants and remote sensing were evaluated. For the remote sensing component, the set objectives were to develop statistical models from the hyperspectral reflectance properties of individual leaves that could differentiate typical ECA banana varieties, as well as their parentage (usage). The study also explored the potential of extrapolating the ground-based hyperspectral measures to high-resolution WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite imagery, therefore creating the potential of mapping the distribution of banana varieties at a regional scale. The DNA testing of 43 banana varieties propagated at the National Banana Research Program site at National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) research station in Kampala, Uganda, identified 12 genetically different varieties. A canonical powered partial least square (CPPLS) model developed from hyperspectral reflectance properties of the sampled banana leaves successfully differentiated BLU, BOG, GON, GRO and KAY genotypes. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm was also evaluated to determine if spectral bands coinciding with those provided by WV3 data could segregate banana varieties. The results suggested that this was achievable and as such presents an opportunity to extrapolate the hyperspectral classifications to broader areas of land. The ability to spectrally differentiate these five genotypes has merit as they are not typical east African varieties. As such, identifying the distribution and density of these varieties across Uganda provides vital information to the banana breeders of NARO of where their new varieties are being disseminated too, data that has been previously difficult to obtain. Although the results from this pilot study indicated that not all banana varieties could be spectrally differentiated, the methodology developed and the positive results that were achieved do present remote sensing as a complimentary technology to the ongoing surveying of banana and other crop types grown within Ugandan household farming systems.}

Different failure mechanisms may be possible depending on the influence of the engineering properties of the rock mass (including the fracture network), the persistence and type of discontinuity and the relative aspect or orientation of the coastline. Using a section of the North Coast of Cornwall, UK, as an example we present a multi-disciplinary approach for characterizing landslide risk associated with coastal instabilities in a blocky rock mass. Remotely captured terrestrial and aerial LiDAR and photogrammetric data were interrogated using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to provide a framework for subsequent analysis, interpretation and validation. The remote sensing mapping data was used to define the rock mass discontinuity network of the area and to differentiate between major and minor geological structures controlling the evolution of the North Coast of Cornwall. Kinematic instability maps generated from aerial LiDAR data using GIS techniques and results from structural and engineering geological surveys are presented. With this method, it was possible to highlight the types of kinematic failure mechanism that may generate coastal landslides and highlight areas that are more susceptible to instability or increased risk of future instability. Multi-temporal aerial LiDAR data and orthophotos were also studied using GIS techniques to locate recent landslide failures, validate the results obtained from the kinematic instability maps through site observations and provide improved understanding of the factors controlling the coastal geomorphology. The approach adopted is not only useful for academic research, but also for local authorities and consultancy's when assessing the likely risks of coastal instability.}

Although identification and analysis of crane safety risk factors and accident causes have been targeted in some studies, a systematic review that reveals the status of current literature on crane safety issues and the extent to which solutions to crane risk factors have been addressed by existing scholarly works is missing. This paper aims to bridge this gap through conducting a systematic review of the available literature since the turn of the century. The systematic analysis of publications proposing crane safety solutions is conducted using the 59 risk factors comprising the Crane Operation Risk Directory (CORD) utilized in this review. In brief, this study attempts to contrast the risk factors that have predominantly been studied in the literature against those that received limited or no attention from scholars. Our results pinpoint eight overlooked areas within the crane safety body of knowledge that are critical to proper implementation of the crane management system prescribed by the AcciMap framework. Our survey of the literature informs the research community and the industry practitioners of the future directions to study the less understood elements of crane safety.}

This paper describes the team management elements of a framework for coordinating a changing collection of heterogeneous robots operating in complex and dynamic environments such as disaster zones. Our framework helps a team to reshape itself to compensate for lost or failed robots, including adding newly-encountered robots or additions from other teams, and also allows new teams to be formed dynamically starting from an individual robot. We evaluate our framework through an example implementation where robots perform exploration in order to locate victims in a simulated disaster environment.}

In response, this study suggests a systematic and concrete framework to develop data-driven technology roadmaps. The data-driven roadmapping is consist of three phase: layer mapping, contents mapping, and opportunity finding. The first phase, layer mapping, deals with identifying sub-layers for the technology roadmap using topic modeling. Then, contents mapping is conducted using the keyword network analysis. Third, opportunity finding is conducted to anticipate future possible innovation chances, with the help of link prediction.

Doctors and patients are now using their smart-phones to control and monitor implantable medical devices (IMDs) such as cardiac implants, insulin pumps, deep brain neurostimulators, etc. via the Internet or Bluetooth connections. Although such connectivity expands the devices’ ability to fulfill healing and diagnostic functions in a quick and cost-effective manner and can help save many lives, too much reliance on software also results in exposure to several security threats. Control of such devices via the underlying communication network may allow attackers to exploit the critical system vulnerabilities of these devices. Attackers could manipulate the settings of these devices and may try to harm the patients and these malicious attacks can originate from anywhere in the world. However, there have been very few real attempts to hack such devices and harm patients. We investigate the practical security risks involved with the use of IMDs and the motivations for an attacker to hack these devices. While some risks discussed in research are genuine and can be prevented using various security measures, it seems that quite a few risks are mere exaggerations. In our paper, we review the aspects mentioned above of IMDs and also outline some practical security measures that can further enhance the security and privacy for patients using IMDs.}

Issues were identified by firstly defining the methods that are common used for marine habitat mapping and then by identifying the ‘methodological variables’ (i.e. decision points within a map production methodology) within each method that entrained error, and ultimately contribute to inaccuries in end products. Following the identification of issues, potential solutions for addressing the methodological variables that were subsequently ranked by efficacy and cost-effectiveness. A total of 56 marine habitat mapping methods for were constructed using combinations of 18 common mapping techniques and platforms (e.g. ship, UAV). A total of 39 significant methodological variables were identified for all of the methods with individual methods having between 6 and 18 methodological variables each. The error analysis requires that the potential of each methodological variable to influence the overall accuracy of a map be estimated. These estimates of influence were taken from published studies that have compared different approaches within a methodological variable, and subsequently compared the accuracy of the resulting maps (typically via cross-validation). Sometimes it was necessary to use expert judgement to estimate the contribution of a methodological variables to changes in map accuracy when other forms of information were not available. Recommended work packages to reduce the influence of each of the 39 methodological variables (termed error reduction solutions here) are listed and prioritised. Error reduction solutions relevant to: (i) classification analysis (also referred to as segmentation); (ii) matching sampling resolution to the habitat resolution (via a habitat resolution catalogue); (iii) improving the positional error of ground-truthing sampling; (iv) increasing the replication and improving distribution of ground-truthing; and (v) reducing reader error during the processing of benthic footage were particularly important for reducing error within the final mapped outputs across multiple methods.}

abstract = {Land cover mapping over large areas is essential to address a wide spectrum of socio-environmental challenges. For this reason, many global or regional land cover products are regularly released to the scientific community. Yet, the remote sensing community has not fully addressed the challenge to extract useful information from vast volumes of satellite data. Especially, major limitations concern the use of inadequate classification schemes and “black box” methods that may not match with end-users conceptualization of geographic features. In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-driven methodological approach to automatically process Sentinel-2 time series in order to produce pre-classifications that can be adapted by end-users to match their requirements. The approach relies on a conceptual framework inspired from ontologies of scientific observation and geographic information to describe the representation of geographic entities in remote sensing images. The implementation consists in a three-stage classification system including an initial stage, a dichotomous stage and a modular stage. At each stage, the system firstly relies on natural language semantic descriptions of time series of spectral signatures before assigning labels of land cover classes. The implementation was tested on 75 time series of Sentinel-2 images (i.e. 2069 images) in the Southern Brazilian Amazon to map natural vegetation and water bodies as required by a local end-user, i.e. a non-governmental organization. The results confirmed the potential of the method to accurately detect water bodies (F-score = 0.874 for bodies larger than 10 m) and map natural vegetation (max F-score = 0.875), yet emphasizing the spatial heterogeneity of accuracy results. In addition, it proved to be efficient to provide rapid estimates of degraded riparian forests at watershed level (R2 = 0.871). Finally, we discuss potential improvements both in the system's implementation, e.g. considering additional characteristics, and in the conceptual framework, e.g. moving from pixel- to object-based image analysis and evolving towards a hybrid system combining data- and knowledge-driven approaches.}

Since the number of events could increase only linearly w.r.t. the system scale, EDP provides a computationally feasible way for many problems, which are time-consuming to solve in the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. Because the event sequence usually is not Markovian, policies that only depend on the current observable event usually are not optimal. In this paper, we develop a rollout method for finite-stage EDP, which uses simulation under a base policy to estimate the performances of action candidates. We show that this leads to a policy better than the base policy. This rollout method is easy to implement. The advantage is also demonstrated through a node activation policy optimization problem in wireless sensor network.}

Specifically, an individual vehicle is controlled only by its local noisy information measured from a local sensor in order to follow the average behavior (mean field) of the entire population while achieving the overall optimal control performance. We solve the partially-observed linear-quadratic mean field game to obtain decentralized optimal controls for two-wheeled vehicles. These controls are decentralized since they are functions of the local estimated state from the local Kalman filter. We show that the set of the decentralized optimal controls constitutes an ϵ-Nash equilibrium, where ϵ converges to zero as the number of vehicles becomes large. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through simulations and experiments with various operation scenarios for a large population of two-wheeled vehicles.}

In this paper, given the real-time performance requirements, we consider a single-hop network supporting 2-Successive Interference Cancellation, and study how to maximize the reliabilities of uplink transmissions by the joint user pairing and power allocation. We show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time by an optimal algorithm with complexity of O(nlogn), where n is the number of users. The performance evaluations reveal that the transmission reliabilities will increase exponentially with the linear degradation of the guaranteed real-time performance.}

abstract = {This paper investigates a novel distributed fusion system for target tracking in three dimensional surveillance using multiple asynchronous BO sensors by simultaneously addressing the problems of target mis-detection and clutter disturbance as well as the out-of-sequence (OOS) information fusion. The proposed distributed fusion architecture consists of the local tracking and distributed fusion, wherein, the refined BO measurements output from the local tracking in each BO sensor are transmitted to the fusion center for subsequent distributed fusion. In the local tracking, instead of kinematic state, the target pseudo state is defined and tracked by operating the proposed pseudo state-integrated probabilistic data association (PS-IPDA) algorithm with an approximately linear pseudo state evolution model, resulting in greatly refined BO sensor measurements. In the fusion center, the sequential asynchronous IPDA-general one-step retrodiction update (SAIPDA-GORU) algorithm is proposed to effectively fuse the transmitted origin-unknown OOS refined measurements (OOSRMs) with the central tracks. The SAIPDA-GORU propagates the central track hybrid state to the OOS time by deploying a general one-step retrodiction technique, and mathematically formulates the OOSRMs-to-retrodicted central track association probabilities utilized to facilitate the fusing of currently filtered central track with OOSRMs. Numerical results show that the proposed PS-IPDA algorithm reduces the errors of target bearings measurement by around a half and eliminates more than 60% of the clutter measurements contained in raw detections, saving significant communication bandwidth between local sensors and fusion center. Furthermore, the proposed SAIPDA-GORU method tangibly improves the estimation accuracy and false track discrimination over the existing discarding method, with the potential to be implemented in real-time.}

To address the challenges of offshore food and energy production, leveraging the benefits of co-location, vertical integration, infrastructure and shared services, will be enabled through the development of novel Multi-Purpose Offshore-Platforms (MPOP). The structural integrity of the designed systems when being deployed in the harsh offshore environment is one of the main challenges in developing the MPOPs. Employing structural reliability analysis methods for assessing the structural safety of the novel aquaculture-MPOPs comes with different limitations. This review aims at shedding light on these limitations and discusses the current status and future directions for structural reliability analysis of a novel aquaculture-MPOP considering Australia’s unique environment. To achieve this aim, challenges which exist at different stages of reliability assessment, from data collection and uncertainty quantification to load and structural modelling and reliability analysis implementation, are discussed. Furthermore, several solutions to these challenges are proposed based on the existing knowledge in other sectors, and particularly from the offshore oil and gas industry. Based on the identified gaps in the review process, potential areas for future research are introduced to enable a safer and more reliable operation of the MPOPs.}

In this context, “segmentation” refers to the process of classifying an image into plant and non-plant pixels. Good performance in this process is crucial for further analysis of the plant such as plant classification (i.e. identifying the plant as either crop or weed), and effective action based on this analysis, e.g. precision application of herbicides in smart agriculture applications. The survey briefly discusses pre-processing of images, before focusing on segmentation. The segmentation stage involves the segmentation of plant against the background (identifying plant from a background of soil and other residues). Three primary plant extraction algorithms, namely, (i) colour index-based segmentation, (ii) threshold-based segmentation, (iii) learning-based segmentation are discussed. Based on its prevalence in the literature, this review focuses in particular on colour index-based approaches. Therefore, a detailed discussion of the segmentation performance of colour index-based approaches is presented, based on studies from the literature conducted in the recent past, particularly from 2008 to 2015.

In addition, the influences of variant scales and multiplicative noises will also have an adverse effect on the matching accuracy. In this paper, a combination of feature descriptor called “histogram of angle and maximal edge orientation distribution” (HAED) is proposed for multi-source image matching. First, the contour segment feature, which extracts the image information using both the angle and edge orientation distribution, presents the accurate correspondence between multi-source images. Second, the similarity calculated by using Fréchet distance metric between curves is defined as a weight parameter of each contour segment histogram to improve the matching performance. Finally, a precise bilateral matching rule is used to perform the matching between the corresponding contour segments. Infrared–visible image data sets in different environments are used for experiments. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves a more accurate matching performance than other multi-source image matching algorithms.}

Because of this variation in the inspection methods, extra finishing operations are often prescribed; much of this is over processing in attempt to avoid rework or customer rejection. Additionally, defective castings may pass inspection and be delivered to the customer. Given the importance of ensuring that customers receive high-quality castings, this article analyzes and quantifies the probability of Type I and II errors, where a Type I error is a false alarm, and a Type II error misses a present defect. A probabilistic model frequently used in risk analysis, called an influence diagram, is developed to incorporate different factors impacting the chances of Type I and II errors. These factors include: training for inspectors, the type of judgment used during the inspection process, the percentage of defective castings, environmental conditions, and the inspectors’ capabilities. The model is populated with inputs based on prior experimentation and the authors’ expertise. The influence diagram calculates the probability of a Type I error at 0.35 and the probability of a Type II error at 0.40. These results are compared to a naïve Bayes model. A manufacturer can use this analysis to identify factors in its foundry that could reduce the probability of errors. Even under the best-case scenario, the probability of Type I error is 0.18 and the probability of Type II error is 0.30 for visual inspection. This indicates improvements to the inspection process for cast metal surfaces is required.}

Besides, it can give out feasible domains of mechanical properties when considering mutual uncertainties for uncertainty propagation analysis.

Among the rich body of literature, the majority of the results are proposed for linear time invariant systems despite the fact that most practical processes are inherently time-varying by nature and discretized for online implementations. Recently, with the ever-increasing system complexity and scale, the model-based fault diagnosis issue for linear discrete time-varying (LDTV) systems has become a hot research topic of both theoretical importance and practical significance, and a great number of results have been reported with many open problems deserving further investigation. To reflect the latest progress in this emerging research branch, this survey aims to provide a timely reference to readers interested in this topic. More specifically, in this survey, the techniques for model-based fault diagnosis for LDTV systems are classified into observer-based methods, parity space-based approaches and parameter estimation schemes, which constitute the three main parts of this survey. The background and the latest progress for each class of these techniques are comparatively discussed with particular focuses on the fault detection and the fault estimation issues. Additionally, an overview on their practical applications to specific industrial plants is provided. Furthermore, the possible future research directions concerning the model-based fault diagnosis for LDTV processes are pointed out, followed by comprehensive concluding remarks.}

We present a novel approach to feature construction for object detection called Evolution-COnstructed Features (ECO features). Most current approaches rely on human experts to construct features for object recognition. ECO features are automatically constructed by uniquely employing a standard genetic algorithm to discover multiple series of transforms that are highly discriminative. Using ECO features provides several advantages over other object detection algorithms including: no need for a human expert to build feature sets or tune their parameters, ability to generate specialized feature sets for different objects, no limitations to certain types of image sources, and ability to find both global and local feature types. We show in our experiments that the ECO features compete well against state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms.}

Surveys of diurnal DO were completed in 2015 and 2016, and various mass transfer rates were quantified including macrophyte photosynthesis and respiration, macrophyte density, sediment oxygen demand, and reaeration. A DO mass balance model was then developed in QUAL2K, where oxygen equivalents of macrophytes were incorporated as closely spaced diurnally varying point sources (sinusoids). Overall, diurnal DO swings and longitudinal oxygen profiles were reasonably replicated in the pre- and post-upgrade synoptic surveys and models, and the facility upgrade greatly enhanced DO concentrations in the stream. Improvements, however, were not enough to meet the minimum DO criterion for the waterbody. The results above have important implications for assessing DO responses and impairment status in macrophyte-rich streams. Moreover, they suggest wastewater treatment upgrades may not always achieve desired results and that modeling should be conducted a priori to understand receiving-water responses.}

Action selection is interpreted as an n-player cooperative game. The approach presented can be seen as part of the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) framework, also can address the problem of cooperative, legal, safe, considerate and emphatic decisions by robots if their individual and group rewards are suitably defined. After theoretical analysis the performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on four simulation scenarios. The first one is a coordination game between two material handling robots, the second one is a warehouse patrolling task by a team of robots, the third one presents a coordination mechanism between two robots that carry a heavy object on a corridor and the fourth one is an example of coordination on a sensors network.}

abstract = {In recent years, Discriminative Correlation Filters (DCFs) based trackers have achieved continuous performance improvement due to sophisticated learning models (e.g. HCF [1]) or multiple feature integration (e.g. CCOT [2]). However, the increasingly complex model introduces a massive number of trainable parameters in the correlation filter. This significantly slows down the tracking speed and increases the risk of over-fitting. In this work, we tackle the problems of model complexity and over-fitting by introducing Lightweight Convolution Operators (LCO). Our LCO tracker performs dimensionality reduction and spatial constraints on the correlation filters to reduce the model complexity and accelerate the tracking speed. Compared with the baseline method, LCO reduces over 90% of the redundant trainable parameters in the tracking model. We perform experiments on three benchmarks: OTB2013, OTB100 and VOT2016. On OTB100, LCO runs at 24 fps with hand-crafted features on CPU and at 30 fps with shallow convolutional features on GPU. With shallow convolutional features, LCO obtains 65.8% in AUC of the success plots on OTB100. On VOT2016, our tracker ranks second in Expected Average Overlap (EAO) and first in Equivalent Filter Operations (EFO) compared with the top 5 trackers.}

abstract = {In this article, a robust control scheme for trajectory tracking of very lightweight single-link flexible arms is discussed. Since the payload is one of the most variable parameters in a manipulator, the control is designed to achieve an accurate tracking of the desired tip trajectory for any value of the robot tip mass, or even for a tip mass changing during the maneuver. The proposed controller also guarantees stability for small uncertainties in parameters such as stiffness or motor friction. In addition, the effect of spillover on the performance of the controlled system is analyzed, and it is proven that stability and a good performance are preserved independently from the non-modeled high-order dynamics. The control scheme is based on a two nested loops structure. Each of these loops implements a Generalized Proportional Integral (GPI) controller. Moreover, the outer loop includes a disturbance compensation term based on a disturbance observer, which achieves the required insensitivity to payload changes. The theoretical analysis is supported by an extensive set of numerical simulations which shows controlled system response when variations in the robot payload, or dynamics neglected in the controller design, are considered. Finally, some experiments have been carried out in order to test the performance of the tip trajectory tracking of the proposed control system.}

abstract = {Explicit MPC represents one of the fastest ways of real-time MPC implementation. As the explicit MPC policy is optimization-free in real-time control, its efficiency is determined by solving a point location problem. This paper proposes the novel concept of accelerating explicit MPC that significantly speeds up the real-time evaluation of the point location problem. The introduced strategy has two layers: (i) an offline phase determines a smart order of the regions to be explored, and (ii) an online phase removes further regions to be explored on the fly based on the current value of the value function. The main advantage of layer (i) is that the order is evaluated offline, therefore, it does not increase the real-time implementation of explicit MPC. The implementation of layer (ii) slightly increases the real-time evaluation but leads to further speed-up of the point location problem. As the proposed layers are based just on the evaluation of some appropriate value function, the main benefit is that these layers are fully applicable also for higher-dimensional systems. Although the accelerated explicit MPC variant does not reduce the worst-case time of solving the point location problem, an extensive case study demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed strategy.}

abstract = {High-speed, low latency, and heterogeneity features of 5G, as the common denominator of many emerging and classic wireless applications, have put wireless technology back in the spotlight. Continuous connectivity requirement in low-power and wide-reach networks underlines the need for more efficient routing over scarce wireless resources, in multi-hp scenarios. In this regard, Opportunistic Routing (OR), which utilizes the broadcast nature of wireless media to provide transmission cooperation amongst a selected number of overhearing nodes, has become more promising than ever. Crucial to the overall network performance, which nodes to participate and where they stand on the transmission-priority hierarchy, are decided by user-defined OR metrics embedded in OR protocols. Therefore, the task of choosing or designing an appropriate OR metric is a critical one. The numerousness, proprietary notations, and the objective variousness of OR metrics can cause the interested researcher to lose insight and become overwhelmed, making the metric selection or design effort-intensive. While there are not any comprehensive OR metrics surveys in the literature, those who partially address the subject are non-exhaustive and lacking in detail. Furthermore, they offer limited insight regarding related taxonomy and future research recommendations. In this paper, starting with a custom tutorial with a new look to OR and OR metrics, we devise a new framework for OR metric design. Introducing a new taxonomy enables us to take a structured, investigative, and comparative approach to OR metrics, supported by extensive simulations. Exhaustive coverage of OR metrics, formulated in a unified notation, is presented with sufficient details. Self-explanatory, easy-to-grasp, and visual-friendly quick references are provided, which can be used independently from the rest of the paper. Finally, a new insightful framework for future research directions is developed. This tutorial-survey has been organized to benefit both generalists and OR specialists equally, and to be used not only in its entirety but selectively as well.}

One of the major advantages of the DIHM is its capability to handle changing density over time. Moreover, the DIHM avoids oversegmentation and thus achieves refined coherency detection. In the proposed DIHM, we first extract a motion flow field from the input video through particle initialization and dense optical flow. The particles of interest are then collected to retain only the most motile and informative particles. To represent each particle, we accumulate the contribution of each particle in a weighted form, based on a kernel function. Next, the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is adopted to detect coherent regions. Finally, the detected coherent regions are refined to remove the effects of oversegmentation. We perform extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and compare the results with 10 state-of-the-art coherency detection methods. Our results show that DIHM achieves superior coherency detection and outperforms the compared methods in both pixel level and coherent region level average particle error rates (PERs), average coherent number error (CNE) and F-score.}

Water quality monitoring or cage inspection is an indispensable part in aquaculture and is usually done manually. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly being used in aquaculture as technology advances and the cost reduction. Autonomous navigation is considered as a basic function of AUVs but is a challenging issue primarily due to the attenuated nature of electromagnetic waves in water and unstructured underwater environments. An inertial navigation system (INS) is usually selected as the core navigation equipment for AUV navigation because it never fails to measure. This paper reviews and surveys the latest advances in integrated navigation technologies for AUVs and provides a comprehensive reference for researchers who intend to apply AUVs to autonomous monitoring of aquaculture. Pure INS has difficulty obtaining long-range precision navigation due to the inherent error accumulation of inertial sensors over time; aiding inertial navigation systems with auxiliary sensors are common means to improve the navigation accuracy of an INS for AUVs. The survey is conducted according to different assisted navigation technologies for inertial navigation. Finally, the future challenges of the AUV navigation are also presented.}

A pipe-like path consisting of closely coupled links (forming a bundle) is more suitable to big data transmissions. The queuing model for such a coupled routing pipe is important to network congestion diagnosis and avoidance. Particularly, the queuing analysis between neighboring hops can help to analyze the pipe traffic accumulation dynamics. Our pioneering work presented here first develops a queuing model for a single node of the pipe. We design a full Markov-Chain-based queuing model for bulk arrival, bulk service queues with multiple vacations. We then extend such a single node queuing model to the pipe-based queuing scenarios, and deduce the closed-form equations for the typical queue statistics such as the service delay. The numerical results can serve as the guidelines for big data transmission protocols. Comprehensive, accurate simulations have been conducted to verify the correctness of our proposed pipe queuing models.}

Sustainable exploration requires a combination of innovative thinking and new technologies. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a rapidly developing technology and allows for fast and systematic mineral mapping, facilitating exploration of the Earth's surface at various scales on a variety of platforms. Newly available sensors allow data capture over a wide spectral range, and provide information about the abundance and spatial location of ore and pathfinder minerals in drill-core, hand samples and outcrops with mm to cm precision. Conversely, the complex geometries of the imaged surfaces affect the spectral quality and signal-to-noise ratio (SnR) of HSI data at these very narrow spatial samplings. Additionally, the complex mineral assemblages found in hydrothermally altered ore deposits can make interpretation of spectral results a challenge. In this contribution, we propose an innovative approach that integrates multiple sensors and scales of data acquisition to help disentangle complex mineralogy associated with lithium and tin mineralisation in the Uis pegmatite complex, Namibia. We train this method using hand samples and finally produce a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud for mapping lithium mineralisation in the open pit. We were able to identify and map lithium-bearing cookeite and montebrasite at outcrop scale. The accuracy of the approach was validated by drill-core data, XRD analysis and LIBS measurements. This approach facilitates efficient mapping of complex terrains, as well as important monitoring and optimisation of ore extraction. Our method can easily be adapted to other minerals relevant to the mining industry.}

The shipboard landing missions are divided into two phases including the position approaching phase and the vertical landing phase. Relative pose kinematics and dynamics are modeled in the quadrotor’s body-fixed frame, where the kinematic couplings resulted from the difference between ship’s centre of mass and desired landing site and the unknown external disturbances of two vehicles are considered in the modeling and control design. In the position approaching phase, because of the under-actuated property of quadrotors, the adaptive backstepping technique is combined with an auxiliary system and a command filter to develop the guidance and control laws. Subsequently, the relative altitude-attitude controller is designed for the vertical landing phase. Stability analysis shows that the position approaching errors in the first phase and the landing errors in the second phase ultimately converge to small neighborhoods of zero, and numerical simulation validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.}

abstract = {Hydrogen storage systems (HSSs), are the backbone of feasible hydrogen economy. To provide a reliable renewable energy system, safe, cost effective and compact HSS is due. Physical storage systems involve the compressed gas, liquid and cryo-compressed techniques while material based one involves adsorptive materials, metal hydrides and chemical storage materials. In this paper, the features of a variety of HSSs are impartially discussed. The technical comparative analysis of the different physical and material based types of HSSs illustrates the paradoxical inherent features, including gravimetric and volumetric storage densities and parameters associated with storage and release processes, among these systems. Accordingly, no ideal hydrogen storage technique can be considered the best-fit for all stationary and automotive applications. Therefore, not only a unique HSS solution can properly provide the needs, but a set of complementary HSS solutions which may offer the system designer several options. This set of options can be hardly interpretable in case of the unclear definition of the application needs which may be time variant. Inside this review, the critical insights and recommendations about suitable applications for storage systems are provided. Different standards and codes alongside the corresponding tests are demonstrated for the different storage technologies. Moreover, storage vessels research work is overviewed for the different hydrogen storage technologies. In addition, the failure behaviour, criteria and prediction models are investigated for composite vessels subjected to high pressures and extreme temperatures degrading their mechanical behaviour and failure resistance.}

A two-layered framework synthesizing the 3D guidance law and heuristic fuzzy control is proposed to achieve robust adaptive following along a predefined path. In the first layer, a 3D guidance controller for underactuated AUV is presented to guarantee the stability of path following in the kinematics stage. In the second layer, a heuristic adaptive fuzzy algorithm based on the guidance command and feedback linearization Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller is developed in the dynamics stage to account for the nonlinear dynamics and system uncertainties, including inaccuracy modelling parameters and time-varying environmental disturbances. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of the heuristic fuzzy controller is presented. Against most existing methods for 3D path following, the proposed robust fuzzy control scheme reduces the design and implementation costs of complicated dynamics controller, and relaxes the knowledge of the accuracy dynamics modelling and environmental disturbances. Finally, numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control framework and illustrate the outperformance of the proposed controller as well.}

We observed a high degree of spatial variability in Cladophora deposition among beaches on Lake Michigan, even within local regions, with no clear regional pattern in the intensity of Cladophora deposition. A strong seasonal pattern in Cladophora deposition was observed, with the heaviest deposition occurring during mid-summer. Several beaches exhibited high temporal variability in Cladophora deposition over short time scales, suggesting that drifting algal mats may be extremely dynamic in nearshore environments of the Great Lakes. Cladophora deposition on Lake Michigan beaches was primarily related to the presence of nearshore structures, local population density, and nearshore bathymetry. There was relatively little evidence that waves, winds, or currents were associated with Cladophora deposition on beaches, but this may be due to the relatively poor resolution of existing nearshore hydrodynamic data. Developing a predictive understanding of beach-cast Cladophora dynamics in Great Lakes environments may require both intensive Cladophora monitoring and fine-scale local hydrodynamic modeling efforts.}

The primary advantage of this off-policy Q-learning method is that it can work for the linear discrete-time systems with inaccurate system model, unmeasurable system states and network-induced delays. To this end, an optimization problem for networked control systems composed of a plant, a state observer and a Smith predictor is formulated first. The Smith predictor is employed to not only compensate network-induced delays, but also make the separation principle hold, thus the observer and controller can be designed separately. Then, the off-policy Q-learning is implemented for learning the optimal observer gain and the optimal controller combined with the Smith predictor, such that a novel off-policy Q-learning algorithm is derived using only input, output and delayed estimated state of systems, not the inaccurate system matrices. The convergences of the iterative observer gain and the iterative controller gain are rigorously proven. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

This paper addresses the problem of output regulation for nonlinear nonaffine-in-control systems in the presence of a high-frequency pulse-width modulation (PWM) in feedback loop. The problem of controller design is reduced to the continuous-time controller design based on Filippov's average model which is affine-in-control system. The proposed controller is an extension of PI/PID control scheme. The presented design methodology guarantees desired output transient performance indices by inducing of two-time-scale motions in the closed-loop system. The analysis of the closed-loop system properties is provided via the singular perturbation method. Stability conditions imposed on the fast and slow modes and sufficiently large mode separation rate between fast and slow modes can ensure that the full-order closed-loop nonlinear system achieves the desired properties in such a way that the output transient performances are desired and insensitive to external disturbances and plant's parameter variations. Numerical example and simulation results are presented.}

BAV arises during valvulogenesis when 2 of the 3 leaflets/cusps of the AOV are fused together. Ensuing asymmetric BAV morphologies alter downstream ejection jet flow-trajectories. Based on BAV morphologies, ejection-flows exhibit different wall-impingement and scouring patterns in the proximal aorta, with excessive hydrodynamic wall-shear that correlates closely with mural vascular smooth muscle cell and extracellular matrix disruptions, revealing hemodynamic participation in the pathogenesis of BAV-associated aortopathies. Since the embryologic regions implicated in both BAV and aortopathies derive from neural crest cells and second heart field cells, there may exist a common multifactorial/polygenic embryological basis linking the abnormalities. The use of Electronic Health Records – encompassing integrated NGS variant panels and phenotypic data – in clinical studies could speed-up comprehensive understanding of multifactorial genetic–phenotypic and environmental factor interactions.

This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by analysing state-of-the-art local feature detectors and descriptors with a taylor-made synthetic dataset emulating a Non-Cooperative Rendezvous (NCRV) with a complex spacecraft, featuring variations in illumination, rotation, and scale. Furthermore, the performance of the algorithms on the Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) is investigated as a possible solution to the challenges inherent to on-orbit imaging in the visible, such as diffuse light scattering and eclipse conditions. The Harris, GFTT, DoG, Fast-Hessian, FAST, CenSurE detectors and the SIFT, SURF, LIOP, ORB, BRISK, FREAK descriptors are benchmarked for images of Envisat. It was found that a combination of Fast-Hessian with BRISK was the most robust, while still capable of running on a low resolution and acquisition rate setup. For large baselines, the rate of false-positives increases, limiting their use in model-based strategies.}

However, the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain field is still in its infancy, which limits an understanding of its potential. This article uses descriptive and content analysis to review publications related to blockchain-based supply chains between 2017 and 2020 inclusive. To fully explore research on blockchain-based supply chains, four well-designed questions are proposed and addressed, namely, the value of blockchain in supply chains, the attraction of scholars to particular supply chain themes, the development of research methodologies and illustration types in adopting blockchain in supply chains, and the types of industries involved in blockchain-based supply chains. The results reveal that there is growing interest in applying blockchain technology to supply chain operations. A detailed analysis of findings is provided to identify the future opportunities of blockchain-based supply chains, including prospects for tertiary industries and concerted efforts that are necessary to explore sustainability themes.

The common goal of any SHM system, whatever the specific application is, may be synthesized in three main points: identify structural deterioration stage, recognize its severity and evaluate the necessity to make a more detailed inspection or proceed to maintenance on condition, based on a potential hazard that may lead to a catastrophic failure. The implementation of such a system leads to making normal operations with the same safety levels but with more efficient maintenance procedures. In addition, it allows avoiding the oversizing of structural components extending the inspection and maintenance intervals. Both these results help to reduce the life-cycle cost of the specific engineered system as it is possible to perform maintenance when it is necessary, i.e. on-condition.

Real time monitoring of important intrinsic and extrinsic factors that are known to affect the time and quality of the aging process are important to optimize and to manage the natural variability between wines aged in different long-used wood barrels. For this study, a distributed monitoring system was installed in sixteen oak barrels, placed in two adjacent wineries – one of them with controlled temperature – in the Douro Demarcated Region, Portugal. The monitoring process was performed using a RS-485 industrial network, which interconnects sensors that continuously measure wine temperature, pH, redox potential and wine’s dissolved oxygen, as well as other sensors that measure parameters related to the barrels’ environmental context, such as room temperature and relative humidity. This work presents the design, development and implementation of a remote distributed system to monitor such parameters, aiming to determine the existence of behaviour models for Port Tawny wine during aging in long-used oak barrels, depending on their storage history and to understand the evolution of wine pH, dissolved oxygen and redox potential in real winery conditions as well as their dependence on the wine’s storage temperature.

Due to the limited energy, only a part of agents can use high energy to transmit information infallibly, and the remaining agents are randomly allocated low energy with several levels, which may lead to packet loss in some sense. Different levels result in different packet dropout probability. The purpose of this paper is to design a probability-dependent controller such that, for all probabilistic energy allocation and packet dropout, the H∞ consensus performance can be guaranteed for multi-agent systems over a finite horizon. To this end, a stochastic and high-availability energy allocation method is first presented via stratified multi-objective optimization methods and stochastic analysis methods. Based on this novel allocation, a H∞ consensus controller depending on the varying energy allocation is established. Furthermore, in terms of the probability information of both energy allocation and packet dropout, important results are obtained to guarantee the desired performance of the designed probability-dependent controller, and the controller are explicitly parameterized by means of the solutions to a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a simulation example is utilized to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed controller design method.}

The safe operation of drones in the urban airspace is critical to ensure a reliable and high-efficient urban air traffic system. This work presents a fusion scheme to achieve autonomous drone collision-free path planning considering static obstacles and dynamic threats detected. Firstly, a 3D voxel jump point search (JPS) based path planning model is developed to generate the static collision-free reference path. With the optimization, the reference path is then de-diagonalized, reconstructed, and smoothed to obtain the desired path. Subsequently, a local collision resolution method is proposed to avoid near mid-air collision of the dynamic threats. The method is based on the Markov decision process (MDP) to implement real-time dynamic collision avoidance. Simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed model. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model is effective to achieve the autonomous path planning and real-time collision resolution of multirotor drones.}

abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been proposed to significantly reduce the response time of service invocations for end users. In MEC environment, a service provider can create multiple instances from a service and deploy them to different hired edge servers, where the deployed instances can be selected and invoked to decrease the network latency by nearby users. However, service instance selection in MEC is a challenging research problem from threefold aspects. First, the limitations of an edge server in terms of computation capacity and coverage range result in serving for only a certain number of users at the same time. Second, due to variable geographical locations from user mobility paths in MEC, the mobility of edge users is highly related to data transmission rate and affects the delay of service invocations. Furthermore, when many users in an edge server covered region request the same service instance at the same time, they interfere with each other and may reduce the experience of service invocations if there is no effective strategy to distribute these requests to appropriate instances deployed on different edge servers. To improve the user experience on service invocations with a lower response time, we take the above three factors into account and model the service instance selection problem (SISP) in MEC as an optimization problem, and propose a novel genetic algorithm-based approach with a response time-aware mutation operation with normalization for service instance selection called GASISMEC to find approximately optimal solution. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely-used real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the six baseline competing approaches.}
