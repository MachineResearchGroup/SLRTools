abstract = {Integration of embedded multimedia devices with powerful computing platforms, e.g., machine learning platforms, helps to build smart cities and transforms the concept of Internet of Things into Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT). To provide different services to the residents of smart cities, the IoMT technology generates big multimedia data. The management of big multimedia data is a challenging task for IoMT technology. Without proper management, it is hard to maintain consistency, reusability, and reconcilability of generated big multimedia data in smart cities. Various machine learning techniques can be used for automatic classification of raw multimedia data and to allow machines to learn features and perform specific tasks. In this survey, we focus on various machine learning platforms that can be used to process and manage big multimedia data generated by different applications in smart cities. We also highlight various limitations and research challenges that need to be considered when processing big multimedia data in real-time.},

abstract = {Recent global smart city efforts resemble the establishment of electricity networks when electricity was first invented, which meant the start of a new era to sell electricity as a utility. A century later, in the smart era, the network to deliver services goes far beyond a single entity like electricity. Supplemented by a well-established Internet infrastructure that can run an endless number of applications, abundant processing and storage capabilities of clouds, resilient edge computing, and sophisticated data analysis like machine learning and deep learning, an already-booming Internet of Things movement makes this new era far more exciting.In this article, we present a multi-faceted survey of machine intelligence in modern implementations. We partition smart city infrastructure into application, sensing, communication, security, and data planes and put an emphasis on the data plane as the mainstay of computing and data storage. We investigate (i) a centralized and distributed implementation of data plane’s physical infrastructure and (ii) a complementary application of data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization to implement robust machine intelligence in a smart city software core. We finalize our article with pointers to open issues and challenges.},

abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICT) can be instrumental in progressing towards smarter city environments, which improve city services, sustainability, and citizens’ quality of life. Smart City software platforms can support the development and integration of Smart City applications. However, the ICT community must overcome current technological and scientific challenges before these platforms can be widely adopted. This article surveys the state of the art in software platforms for Smart Cities. We analyzed 23 projects concerning the most used enabling technologies, as well as functional and non-functional requirements, classifying them into four categories: Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things, Big Data, and Cloud Computing. Based on these results, we derived a reference architecture to guide the development of next-generation software platforms for Smart Cities. Finally, we enumerated the most frequently cited open research challenges and discussed future opportunities. This survey provides important references to help application developers, city managers, system operators, end-users, and Smart City researchers make project, investment, and research decisions.},

abstract = {Smart cities (SCs) are becoming highly sophisticated ecosystems at which innovative solutions and smart services are being deployed. These ecosystems consider SCs as data production and sharing engines, setting new challenges for building effective SC architectures and novel services. The aim of this article is to “connect the pieces” among Data Science and SC domains, with a systematic literature review which identifies the core topics, services, and methods applied in SC data monitoring. The survey focuses on data harvesting and data mining processes over repeated SC data cycles. A survey protocol is followed to reach both quantitative and semantically important entities. The review results generate useful taxonomies for data scientists in the SC context, which offers clear guidelines for corresponding future works. In particular, a taxonomy is proposed for each of the main SC data entities, namely, the “D Taxonomy” for the data production, the “M Taxonomy” for data analytics methods, and the “S Taxonomy” for smart services. Each of these taxonomies clearly places entities in a classification which is beneficial for multiple stakeholders and for multiple domains in urban smartness targeting. Such indicative scenarios are outlined and conclusions are quite promising for systemizing.},

abstract = {Evolutionary Computation (EC) approaches are inspired by nature and solve optimization problems in a stochastic manner. They can offer a reliable and effective approach to address complex problems in real-world applications. EC algorithms have recently been used to improve the performance of Machine Learning (ML) models and the quality of their results. Evolutionary approaches can be used in all three parts of ML: preprocessing (e.g., feature selection and resampling), learning (e.g., parameter setting, membership functions, and neural network topology), and postprocessing (e.g., rule optimization, decision tree/support vectors pruning, and ensemble learning). This article investigates the role of EC algorithms in solving different ML challenges. We do not provide a comprehensive review of evolutionary ML approaches here; instead, we discuss how EC algorithms can contribute to ML by addressing conventional challenges of the artificial intelligence and ML communities. We look at the contributions of EC to ML in nine sub-fields: feature selection, resampling, classifiers, neural networks, reinforcement learning, clustering, association rule mining, and ensemble methods. For each category, we discuss evolutionary machine learning in terms of three aspects: problem formulation, search mechanisms, and fitness value computation. We also consider open issues and challenges that should be addressed in future work.},

We split existing solutions into two main classes: occupant-centric versus energy/devices-centric. The first class groups solutions that use ML for aspects related to the occupants, including (1) occupancy estimation and identification, (2) activity recognition, and (3) estimating preferences and behavior. The second class groups solutions that use ML to estimate aspects related either to energy or devices. They are divided into three categories: (1) energy profiling and demand estimation, (2) appliances profiling and fault detection, and (3) inference on sensors. Solutions in each category are presented, discussed, and compared; open perspectives and research trends are discussed as well. Compared to related state-of-the-art survey papers, the contribution herein is to provide a comprehensive and holistic review from the ML perspectives rather than architectural and technical aspects of existing building management systems. This is by considering all types of ML tools, buildings, and several categories of applications, and by structuring the taxonomy accordingly.

Existing surveys focus on single tasks, data sources, mechanistic or traditional machine learning approaches, while a comprehensive description of deep learning solutions is missing. This survey provides a taxonomy of mobility tasks, a discussion on the challenges related to each task and how deep learning may overcome the limitations of traditional models, a description of the most relevant solutions to the mobility tasks described above, and the relevant challenges for the future. Our survey is a guide to the leading deep learning solutions to next-location prediction, crowd flow prediction, trajectory generation, and flow generation. At the same time, it helps deep learning scientists and practitioners understand the fundamental concepts and the open challenges of the study of human mobility.},

abstract = {Resource-constrained IoT devices, such as sensors and actuators, have become ubiquitous in recent years. This has led to the generation of large quantities of data in real-time, which is an appealing target for AI systems. However, deploying machine learning models on such end-devices is nearly impossible. A typical solution involves offloading data to external computing systems (such as cloud servers) for further processing but this worsens latency, leads to increased communication costs, and adds to privacy concerns. To address this issue, efforts have been made to place additional computing devices at the edge of the network, i.e., close to the IoT devices where the data is generated. Deploying machine learning systems on such edge computing devices alleviates the above issues by allowing computations to be performed close to the data sources. This survey describes major research efforts where machine learning systems have been deployed at the edge of computer networks, focusing on the operational aspects including compression techniques, tools, frameworks, and hardware used in successful applications of intelligent edge systems.},

abstract = {Large-scale software systems are currently designed as distributed entities and deployed in cloud data centers. To overcome the limitations inherent to this type of deployment, applications are increasingly being supplemented with components instantiated closer to the edges of networks—a paradigm known as edge computing. The problem of how to efficiently orchestrate combined edge-cloud applications is, however, incompletely understood, and a wide range of techniques for resource and application management are currently in use.This article investigates the problem of reliable resource provisioning in joint edge-cloud environments, and surveys technologies, mechanisms, and methods that can be used to improve the reliability of distributed applications in diverse and heterogeneous network environments. Due to the complexity of the problem, special emphasis is placed on solutions to the characterization, management, and control of complex distributed applications using machine learning approaches. The survey is structured around a decomposition of the reliable resource provisioning problem into three categories of techniques: workload characterization and prediction, component placement and system consolidation, and application elasticity and remediation. Survey results are presented along with a problem-oriented discussion of the state-of-the-art.

Environmental audio scene and sound event recognition are the fundamental tasks involved in many audio surveillance applications. Although numerous approaches have been proposed, robust environmental audio surveillance remains a huge challenge due to various reasons, such as various types of overlapping audio sounds, background noises, and lack of universal and multi-modal datasets. The goal of this article is to review various features of representing audio scenes and sound events and provide appropriate machine learning algorithms for audio surveillance tasks. Benchmark datasets are categorized based on the real-world scenarios of audio surveillance applications. To have a quantitative understanding, some of the state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated based on two benchmark datasets for audio scenes and sound event recognition tasks.

The emergence of advanced technologies such as cloud-based services, internet of things (IoT), and big data analytics has augmented the growth of global data centers, leading to high energy consumption. This upsurge in energy consumption of the data centers not only incurs the issue of surging high cost (operational and maintenance) but also has an adverse effect on the environment. Dynamic power management in a data center environment requires the cognizance of the correlation between the system and hardware-level performance counters and the power consumption. Power consumption modeling exhibits this correlation and is crucial in designing energy-efficient optimization strategies based on resource utilization. Several works in power modeling are proposed and used in the literature. However, these power models have been evaluated using different benchmarking applications, power-measurement techniques, and error-calculation formulas on different machines. In this work, we present a taxonomy and evaluation of 24 software-based power models using a unified environment, benchmarking applications, power-measurement techniques, and error formulas, with the aim of achieving an objective comparison. We use different server architectures to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the models’ comparison. The performance analysis of these models is elaborated in the article.},

A vast amount of research work has been done in the multimedia area, targeting different aspects of big data analytics, such as the capture, storage, indexing, mining, and retrieval of multimedia big data. However, very few research work provides a complete survey of the whole pine-line of the multimedia big data analytics, including the management and analysis of the large amount of data, the challenges and opportunities, and the promising research directions. To serve this purpose, we present this survey, which conducts a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research work on multimedia big data analytics. It also aims to bridge the gap between multimedia challenges and big data solutions by providing the current big data frameworks, their applications in multimedia analyses, the strengths and limitations of the existing methods, and the potential future directions in multimedia big data analytics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that targets the most recent multimedia management techniques for very large-scale data and also provides the research studies and technologies advancing the multimedia analyses in this big data era.},

abstract = {Today’s mobile phones are far from the mere communication devices they were 10 years ago. Equipped with sophisticated sensors and advanced computing hardware, phones can be used to infer users’ location, activity, social setting, and more. As devices become increasingly intelligent, their capabilities evolve beyond inferring context to predicting it, and then reasoning and acting upon the predicted context. This article provides an overview of the current state of the art in mobile sensing and context prediction paving the way for full-fledged anticipatory mobile computing. We present a survey of phenomena that mobile phones can infer and predict, and offer a description of machine learning techniques used for such predictions. We then discuss proactive decision making and decision delivery via the user-device feedback loop. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of anticipatory mobile computing.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, the next generation of vehicular networks is envisioned to play an essential part in autonomous driving, traffic management, and infotainment applications. The next generation of intelligent vehicular networks enabled by 5G systems will integrate various heterogeneous wireless techniques to enable time-sensitive services with guaranteed quality of service and ultimate bandwidth usage. However, to allow the dense diversity of wireless technologies, seamless and reliable wireless communication protocols need to be thoroughly investigated in vehicular networks environment. Henceforth, efficient mobility management protocols that mitigate the challenges of vehicles’ mobility is essential to support massive data loads throughout various applications. In this article, we review different mobility management protocols and their ability to address issues related to 5G-enabled vehicular networks within the related works. First, we provide a broad view of existing models of vehicular networks and their applicability to the next generation of wireless networks. Next, we propose a classification of several vehicular network models that suit the 5G wireless network, followed by a thorough discussion of the mobility management challenges in each of these network models that need to be addressed and then discuss each of their benefits and drawbacks accordingly.},

abstract = {Mobile devices (MDs) face resource scarcity challenges owing to limited energy and computational resources. Mobile cloud computing (MCC) offers a resource-rich environment to MDs for offloading compute-intensive tasks encountering resource scarcity challenges. However, users are unable to exploit its full potential owing to challenges of distance, limited bandwidth, and seamless connectivity between the remote cloud (RC) and MDs in the conventional MCC model. The cloudlet-based solution is widely used to address these challenges. The response of the cloudlet-based solution is faster than the conventional mobile cloud-computing model, rendering it suitable for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Cities (SC). However, with the increase in devices and workloads, the cloudlet-based solution has to deal with resource-scarcity challenges, thus, forwarding the requests to remote clouds. This study has been carried out to provide an insight into existing cloudlet-based mobile augmentation (CtMA) approaches and highlights the underlying limitations for resource optimization. Furthermore, numerous performance parameters have been identified and their detailed comparative analysis has been used to quantify the efficiency of CtMA approaches.},

abstract = {Object segmentation and object tracking are fundamental research areas in the computer vision community. These two topics are difficult to handle some common challenges, such as occlusion, deformation, motion blur, scale variation, and more. The former contains heterogeneous object, interacting object, edge ambiguity, and shape complexity; the latter suffers from difficulties in handling fast motion, out-of-view, and real-time processing. Combining the two problems of Video Object Segmentation and Tracking (VOST) can overcome their respective difficulties and improve their performance. VOST can be widely applied to many practical applications such as video summarization, high definition video compression, human computer interaction, and autonomous vehicles. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art VOST methods, classify these methods into different categories, and identify new trends. First, we broadly categorize VOST methods into Video Object Segmentation (VOS) and Segmentation-based Object Tracking (SOT). Each category is further classified into various types based on the segmentation and tracking mechanism. Moreover, we present some representative VOS and SOT methods of each time node. Second, we provide a detailed discussion and overview of the technical characteristics of the different methods. Third, we summarize the characteristics of the related video dataset and provide a variety of evaluation metrics. Finally, we point out a set of interesting future works and draw our own conclusions.},

abstract = {One of the main characteristics of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is the constrained energy resources of their wireless sensor nodes. Although this issue has been addressed in several works and received much attention over the years, the most recent advances pointed out that the energy harvesting and wireless charging techniques may offer means to overcome such a limitation. Consequently, an issue that had been put in second place now emerges: the low availability of spectrum resources. Because of it, the incorporation of the WSNs into the Internet of Things and the exponential growth of the latter may be hindered if no control over the data generation is taken. Alternatively, part of the sensed data can be predicted without triggering transmissions that could congest the wireless medium. In this work, we analyze and categorize existing prediction-based data reduction mechanisms that have been designed for WSNs. Our main contribution is a systematic procedure for selecting a scheme to make predictions in WSNs, based on WSNs’ constraints, characteristics of prediction methods, and monitored data. Finally, we conclude the article with a discussion about future challenges and open research directions in the use of prediction methods to support the WSNs’ growth.},

Traditional cybersecurity approaches are based on old threat-knowledge databases and need to be updated on a daily basis to stand against new generation of cyber-threats and protect underlying network-based systems. Along with updating threat-knowledge databases, there is a need for proper management and processing of data generated by sensitive real-time applications. In recent years, various computing platforms based on representation learning algorithms have emerged as a useful resource to manage and exploit the generated data to extract meaningful information. If these platforms are properly utilized, then strong cybersecurity systems can be developed to protect the underlying network-based systems and support sensitive real-time applications. In this survey, we highlight various cyber-threats, real-life examples, and initiatives taken by various international organizations. We discuss various computing platforms based on representation learning algorithms to process and analyze the generated data. We highlight various popular datasets introduced by well-known global organizations that can be used to train the representation learning algorithms to predict and detect threats. We also provide an in-depth analysis of research efforts based on representation learning algorithms made in recent years to protect the underlying network-based systems against current cyber-threats.

The traffic efficiency services are designed to enhance the moving fluency and smoothness of traveling vehicles over the road network. The grid layout architecture of the downtown areas provides several routes toward any targeted destination. Moreover, since several conflicted traffic flows compete at the road intersections, many vehicles have to stop and wait for safe situations to pass the road intersection without coming into conflict with other vehicles. The traffic efficiency applications in this scenario are designed to select the most efficient path for vehicles traveling toward their targeted destination/destinations. Moreover, other applications aimed to decrease the queuing delay time for vehicles at road intersections.

The increase in scale and complexity of these systems challenges O&amp;M teams that perform daily monitoring and repair operations, in contrast with the increasing demand for reliability and scalability of modern applications.

Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) has been proposed to tackle modern IT administration challenges thanks to Machine Learning, AI, and Big Data. However, AIOps as a research topic is still largely unstructured and unexplored, due to missing conventions in categorizing contributions for their data requirements, target goals, and components.

Several dimensions of the technology have not been adequately investigated by academia. These dimensions include outline management, security, and standardization. Discovering and highlighting aspects of this technology that may have or have not been covered by academic research is the first step toward helping academia bridge the gap with industry or even go one step further to lead industry in the right direction. This suggests a comprehensive survey on research works in this regard. The literature in this area has already come up with some surveys and taxonomies, but some of them are outdated or do not cover every aspect of CDN while others fail to detect existing trends or to develop a holistic roadmap for research on the technology. Furthermore, none of the existing surveys aim at enlightening the dark aspects of the technology that have not been subject to academic research. In this survey, we first extract the lifecycle of a CDN as suggested by the existing research. Then, we investigate previous relevant works on each phase of the lifecycle to clarify where the research is currently located and headed. We show how CDN technology tends to converge with emerging paradigms such as cloud computing, edge computing, and machine learning, which are more mature in terms of academic research. This helps us determine the right direction for further research by revealing the deficiencies in existing works.},

However, most of the existing solutions still suffer from various drawbacks, such as huge bandwidth utilization and network latency, heavyweight cryptosystems, and policies that are applied on sensor devices and in the cloud. To address these issues, fog computing has been introduced for IoT network edges providing low latency, computation, and storage services. In this survey, we comprehensively review and classify privacy requirements for an in-depth understanding of privacy implications in IoT applications. Based on the classification, we highlight ongoing research efforts and limitations of the existing privacy-preservation techniques and map the existing IoT schemes with Fog-enabled IoT schemes to elaborate on the benefits and improvements that Fog-enabled IoT can bring to preserve data privacy in IoT applications.

abstract = {The Cloud computing paradigm has revolutionised the computer science horizon during the past decade and has enabled the emergence of computing as the fifth utility. It has captured significant attention of academia, industries, and government bodies. Now, it has emerged as the backbone of modern economy by offering subscription-based services anytime, anywhere following a pay-as-you-go model. This has instigated (1) shorter establishment times for start-ups, (2) creation of scalable global enterprise applications, (3) better cost-to-value associativity for scientific and high-performance computing applications, and (4) different invocation/execution models for pervasive and ubiquitous applications. The recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing, software-defined networking, Internet of Things, and processing at network edge are creating new opportunities for Cloud computing. However, they are also posing several new challenges and creating the need for new approaches and research strategies, as well as the re-evaluation of the models that were developed to address issues such as scalability, elasticity, reliability, security, sustainability, and application models. The proposed manifesto addresses them by identifying the major open challenges in Cloud computing, emerging trends, and impact areas. It then offers research directions for the next decade, thus helping in the realisation of Future Generation Cloud Computing.},

abstract = {Mapping of spatial hotspots, i.e., regions with significantly higher rates of generating cases of certain events (e.g., disease or crime cases), is an important task in diverse societal domains, including public health, public safety, transportation, agriculture, environmental science, and so on. Clustering techniques required by these domains differ from traditional clustering methods due to the high economic and social costs of spurious results (e.g., false alarms of crime clusters). As a result, statistical rigor is needed explicitly to control the rate of spurious detections. To address this challenge, techniques for statistically-robust clustering (e.g., scan statistics) have been extensively studied by the data mining and statistics communities. In this survey, we present an up-to-date and detailed review of the models and algorithms developed by this field. We first present a general taxonomy for statistically-robust clustering, covering key steps of data and statistical modeling, region enumeration and maximization, and significance testing. We further discuss different paradigms and methods within each of the key steps. Finally, we highlight research gaps and potential future directions, which may serve as a stepping stone in generating new ideas and thoughts in this growing field and beyond.},

Increasingly, applications for the IoT involve analytics. Data analytics is the process of deriving knowledge from data, generating value like actionable insights from them. This article reviews work in the IoT and big data analytics from the perspective of their utility in creating efficient, effective, and innovative applications and services for a wide spectrum of domains. We review the broad vision for the IoT as it is shaped in various communities, examine the application of data analytics across IoT domains, provide a categorisation of analytic approaches, and propose a layered taxonomy from IoT data to analytics. This taxonomy provides us with insights on the appropriateness of analytical techniques, which in turn shapes a survey of enabling technology and infrastructure for IoT analytics. Finally, we look at some tradeoffs for analytics in the IoT that can shape future research.},

Unlike cloud computing, fog resources are based on constrained and heterogeneous nodes whose connectivity can be unstable. In this complex scenario, there is a need to define and implement orchestration processes to ensure that applications and services can be provided, considering the settled agreements. Although some publications have dealt with orchestration in fog computing, there are still some diverse definitions and functional intersection with other areas, such as resource management and monitoring. This article presents a systematic review of the literature with focus on orchestration in fog computing. A generic architecture of fog orchestration is presented, created from the consolidation of the analyzed proposals, bringing to light the essential functionalities addressed in the literature. This work also highlights the main challenges and open research questions.},

abstract = {The increasing amount of human-related and/or human-originated data in current systems is both an opportunity and a challenge. Nevertheless, despite relying on the processing of large amounts of data, most of the so-called smart systems that we have nowadays merely consider humans as sources of data, not as system beneficiaries or even active “components.” For truly smart systems, we need to create systems that are able to understand human actions and emotions, and take them into account when deciding on the system behavior. Naturally, in order to achieve this, we first have to empower systems with human sensing capabilities, possibly in ways that are as inconspicuous as possible. In this context, in this article we survey existing approaches to unobtrusive monitorization of human beings, namely, of their activity, vital signs, and emotional states. After setting a taxonomy for human sensing, we proceed to present and analyze existing solutions for unobtrusive sensing. Subsequently, we identify and discuss open issues and challenges in this area. Although there are surveys that address some of the concerned fields of research, such as healthcare, human monitorization, or even the use-specific techniques like channel state information or image recognition, as far as we know this is the first comprehensive survey on unobtrusive sensing of human beings.},

Furthermore, we summarize the mechanism of disinformation from four different perspectives (i.e., text only, text with image/multi-modal, text with propagation, and fusion models). In addition, we review existing solutions based on these requirements and compare their pros and cons and give a sort of guide to usage based on a detailed lesson learned. To facilitate future studies in this field, we summarize related publicly accessible real-world data sets and open source codes.

Though there are a variety of Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPSs) that facilitate the development of streaming applications, resource management and task scheduling is not automatically handled by the DSPS middleware and requires a laborious process to tune toward specific deployment targets. As the advent of cloud computing has supported renting resources on-demand, it is of great interest to review the research progress of hosting streaming systems in clouds under certain Service Level Agreements (SLA) and cost constraints. In this article, we introduce the hierarchical structure of streaming systems, define the scope of the resource management problem, and present a comprehensive taxonomy in this context covering critical research topics such as resource provisioning, operator parallelisation, and task scheduling. The literature is then reviewed following the taxonomy structure, facilitating a deeper understanding of the research landscape through classification and comparison of existing works.

abstract = {Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) has been extensively explored to be applied as a vital tool to enhance the capabilities of mobile devices, increasing computing power, expanding storage capacity, and prolonging battery life. Offloading works as the fundamental feature that enables MCC to relieve task load and extend data storage through an accessible cloud resource pool. Several initiatives have drawn attention to delivering MCC-supported energy-oriented offloading as a method to cope with a lately steep increase in the number of rich mobile applications and the enduring limitations of battery technologies. However, MCC offloading relieves only the burden of energy consumption of mobile devices; performance concerns about Cloud resources, in most cases, are not considered when dynamically allocating them for dealing with mobile tasks. The application context of MCC, encompassing urban computing, aggravates the situation with very large-scale scenarios, posing as a challenge for achieving greener solutions in the scope of Cloud resources. Thus, this article gathers and analyzes recent energy-aware offloading protocols and architectures, as well as scheduling and balancing algorithms employed toward Cloud green computing. This survey provides a comparison among system architectures by identifying their most notable advantages and disadvantages. The existing enabling frameworks are categorized and compared based on the stage of the task offloading process and resource management types, describing current open challenges and future research directions.},
