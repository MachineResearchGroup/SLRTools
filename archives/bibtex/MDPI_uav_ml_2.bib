ABSTRACT = {Accurate high-resolution yield maps are essential for identifying spatial yield variability patterns, determining key factors influencing yield variability, and providing site-specific management insights in precision agriculture. Cultivar differences can significantly influence potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber yield prediction using remote sensing technologies. The objective of this study was to improve potato yield prediction using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing by incorporating cultivar information with machine learning methods. Small plot experiments involving different cultivars and nitrogen (N) rates were conducted in 2018 and 2019. UAV-based multi-spectral images were collected throughout the growing season. Machine learning models, i.e., random forest regression (RFR) and support vector regression (SVR), were used to combine different vegetation indices with cultivar information. It was found that UAV-based spectral data from the early growing season at the tuber initiation stage (late June) were more correlated with potato marketable yield than the spectral data from the later growing season at the tuber maturation stage. However, the best performing vegetation indices and the best timing for potato yield prediction varied with cultivars. The performance of the RFR and SVR models using only remote sensing data was unsatisfactory (R2 = 0.48–0.51 for validation) but was significantly improved when cultivar information was incorporated (R2 = 0.75–0.79 for validation). It is concluded that combining high spatial-resolution UAV images and cultivar information using machine learning algorithms can significantly improve potato yield prediction than methods without using cultivar information. More studies are needed to improve potato yield prediction using more detailed cultivar information, soil and landscape variables, and management information, as well as more advanced machine learning models.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) antenna tracking system is an electromechanical component designed to track and steer the signal beams from the ground control station (GCS) to the airborne platform for optimum signal alignment. In a tracking system, an antenna continuously tracks a moving target and records their position. A UAV tracking antenna system is susceptible to signal loss if omnidirectional antenna is deployed as the preferred design. Therefore, to achieve longer UAV distance communication, there is a need for directional high gain antenna. From design principle, directional antennas are known to focus their signal energy in a particular direction viewed from their radiation pattern which is concentrated in a particular azimuth direction. Unfortunately, a directional antenna is limited by angle, thus, it must always be directed to the target. The other limitation of a UAV mechanical beam steering system is that the system is expensive to maintain and with low reliability. To solve this problem, we are proposing the use of MIMO technology as a readily available technology for UAV beyond line of sight technology. Although UAV antenna tracking is domiciled in the mechanical beam steering arrangement, this study shows that this native technology could be usurped by MIMO beam forming.},

ABSTRACT = {Small inter-class and massive intra-class changes are important challenges in aircraft model recognition in the field of remote sensing. Although the aircraft model recognition algorithm based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) has excellent recognition performance, it is limited by sample sets and computing resources. To solve the above problems, we propose the bilinear discriminative extreme learning machine (ELM) network (BD-ELMNet), which integrates the advantages of the CNN, autoencoder (AE), and ELM. Specifically, the BD-ELMNet first executes the convolution and pooling operations to form a convolutional ELM (ELMConvNet) to extract shallow features. Furthermore, the manifold regularized ELM-AE (MRELM-AE), which can simultaneously consider the geometrical structure and discriminative information of aircraft data, is developed to extract discriminative features. The bilinear pooling model uses the feature association information for feature fusion to enhance the substantial distinction of features. Compared with the backpropagation (BP) optimization method, BD-ELMNet adopts a layer-by-layer training method without repeated adjustments to effectively learn discriminant features. Experiments involving the application of several methods, including the proposed method, to the MTARSI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed aircraft type recognition method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Quantitative remote sensing of leaf traits offers an opportunity to track biodiversity changes from space. Augmenting field measurement of leaf traits with remote sensing provides a pathway for monitoring essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) over space and time. Detailed information on key leaf traits such as leaf mass per area (LMA) is critical for understanding ecosystem structure and functioning, and subsequently the provision of ecosystem services. Although studies on remote sensing of LMA and related constituents have been conducted for over three decades, a comprehensive review of remote sensing of LMA—a key driver of leaf and canopy reflectance—has been lacking. This paper reviews the current state and potential approaches, in addition to the challenges associated with LMA estimation/retrieval in forest ecosystems. The physiology and environmental factors that influence the spatial and temporal variation of LMA are presented. The scope of scaling LMA using remote sensing systems at various scales, i.e., near ground (in situ), airborne, and spaceborne platforms is reviewed and discussed. The review explores the advantages and disadvantages of LMA modelling techniques from these platforms. Finally, the research gaps and perspectives for future research are presented. Our review reveals that although progress has been made, scaling LMA to regional and global scales remains a challenge. In addition to seasonal tracking, three-dimensional modeling of LMA is still in its infancy. Over the past decade, the remote sensing scientific community has made efforts to separate LMA constituents in physical modelling at the leaf level. However, upscaling these leaf models to canopy level in forest ecosystems remains untested. We identified future opportunities involving the synergy of multiple sensors, and investigated the utility of hybrid models, particularly at the canopy and landscape levels.},

ABSTRACT = {Inner Mongolia in China is a typically arid and semi-arid region with vegetation prominently affected by global warming and human activities. Therefore, investigating the past and future vegetation change and its impact mechanism is important for assessing the stability of the ecosystem and the ecological policy formulation. Vegetation changes, sustainability characteristics, and the mechanism of natural and anthropogenic effects in Inner Mongolia during 2000–2019 were examined using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. Theil–Sen trend analysis, Mann–Kendall method, and the coefficient of variation method were used to analyze the spatiotemporal variability characteristics and sustained stability of the NDVI. Furthermore, a trend estimation method based on a Seasonal Trend Model (STM), and the Hurst index was used to analyze breakpoints and change trends, and predict the likely future direction of vegetation, respectively. Additionally, the mechanisms of the compound influence of natural and anthropogenic activities on the vegetation dynamics in Inner Mongolia were explored using a Geodetector Model. The results show that the NDVI of Inner Mongolia shows an upward trend with a rate of 0.0028/year (p &lt; 0.05) from 2000 to 2019. Spatially, the NDVI values showed a decreasing trend from the northeast to the southwest, and the interannual variation fluctuated widely, with coefficients of variation greater than 0.15, for which the high-value areas were in the territory of the Alxa League. The areas with increased, decreased, and stable vegetation patterns were approximately equal in size, in which the improved areas were mainly distributed in the northeastern part of Inner Mongolia, the stable and unchanged areas were mostly in the desert, and the degraded areas were mainly in the central-eastern part of Inner Mongolia, it shows a trend of progressive degradation from east to west. Breakpoints in the vegetation dynamics occurred mainly in the northwestern part of Inner Mongolia and the northeastern part of Hulunbuir, most of which occurred during 2011–2014. The future NDVI trend in Inner Mongolia shows an increasing trend in most areas, with only approximately 10% of the areas showing a decreasing trend. Considering the drivers of the NDVI, we observed annual precipitation, soil type, mean annual temperature, and land use type to be the main driving factors in Inner Mongolia. Annual precipitation was the first dominant factor, and when these four dominant factors interacted to influence vegetation change, they all showed interactive enhancement relationships. The results of this study will assist in understanding the influence of natural elements and human activities on vegetation changes and their driving mechanisms, while providing a scientific basis for the rational and effective protection of the ecological environment in Inner Mongolia.},

ABSTRACT = {Edge AI accelerators have been emerging as a solution for near customers’ applications in areas such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), image recognition sensors, wearable devices, robotics, and remote sensing satellites. These applications require meeting performance targets and resilience constraints due to the limited device area and hostile environments for operation. Numerous research articles have proposed the edge AI accelerator for satisfying the applications, but not all include full specifications. Most of them tend to compare the architecture with other existing CPUs, GPUs, or other reference research, which implies that the performance exposé of the articles are not comprehensive. Thus, this work lists the essential specifications of prior art edge AI accelerators and the CGRA accelerators during the past few years to define and evaluate the low power ultra-small edge AI accelerators. The actual performance, implementation, and productized examples of edge AI accelerators are released in this paper. We introduce the evaluation results showing the edge AI accelerator design trend about key performance metrics to guide designers. Last but not least, we give out the prospect of developing edge AI’s existing and future directions and trends, which will involve other technologies for future challenging constraints.},

ABSTRACT = {Most of the reported hand gesture recognition algorithms require high computational resources, i.e., fast MCU frequency and significant memory, which are highly inapplicable to the cost-effectiveness of consumer electronics products. This paper proposes a hand gesture recognition algorithm running on an interactive wristband, with computational resource requirements as low as Flash &lt; 5 KB, RAM &lt; 1 KB. Firstly, we calculated the three-axis linear acceleration by fusing accelerometer and gyroscope data with a complementary filter. Then, by recording the order of acceleration vectors crossing axes in the world coordinate frame, we defined a new feature code named axis-crossing code. Finally, we set templates for eight hand gestures to recognize new samples. We compared this algorithm’s performance with the widely used dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and recurrent neural network (BiLSTM and GRU). The results show that the accuracies of the proposed algorithm and RNNs are higher than DTW and that the time cost of the proposed algorithm is much less than those of DTW and RNNs. The average recognition accuracy is 99.8% on the collected dataset and 97.1% in the actual user-independent case. In general, the proposed algorithm is suitable and competitive in consumer electronics. This work has been volume-produced and patent-granted.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote Sensing (RS) is a useful tool for detecting and mapping Invasive Alien Plants (IAPs). IAPs mapping on dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes, using satellite RS data, is not always feasible. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with ultra-high spatial resolution data represent a promising tool for IAPs detection and mapping. This work develops an operational workflow for detecting and mapping Acacia saligna invasion along Mediterranean coastal dunes. In particular, it explores and tests the potential of RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and multispectral (Green, Red, Red Edge, Near Infra—Red) UAV images collected in pre-flowering and flowering phenological stages for detecting and mapping A. saligna. After ortho—mosaics generation, we derived from RGB images the DSM (Digital Surface Model) and HIS (Hue, Intensity, Saturation) variables, and we calculated the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). For classifying images of the two phenological stages we built a set of raster stacks which include different combination of variables. For image classification, we used the Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis techniques (GEOBIA) in combination with Random Forest (RF) classifier. All classifications derived from RS information (collected on pre-flowering and flowering stages and using different combinations of variables) produced A. saligna maps with acceptable accuracy values, with higher performances on classification derived from flowering period images, especially using DSM + HIS combination. The adopted approach resulted an efficient method for mapping and early detection of IAPs, also in complex environments offering a sound support to the prioritization of conservation and management actions claimed by the EU IAS Regulation 1143/2014.},

ABSTRACT = {Defining stream channels in a watershed is important for assessing freshwater habitat availability, complexity, and quality. However, mapping channels of small tributary streams becomes challenging due to frequent channel change and dense vegetation coverage. In this study, we used an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and photogrammetry method to obtain a 3D Digital Surface Model (DSM) to estimate the total in-stream channel and channel width within grazed riparian pastures. We used two methods to predict the stream channel boundary: the Slope Gradient (SG) and Vertical Slope Position (VSP). As a comparison, the same methods were also applied using low-resolution DEM, obtained with traditional photogrammetry (coarse resolution) and two more LiDAR-derived DEMs with different resolution. When using the SG method, the higher-resolution, UAV-derived DEM provided the best agreement with the field-validated area followed by the high-resolution LiDAR DEM, with Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of 1.81 m and 1.91 m, respectively. The LiDAR DEM collected at low resolution was able to predict the stream channel with a MSE of 3.33 m. Finally, the coarse DEM did not perform accurately and the MSE obtained was 26.76 m. On the other hand, when the VSP method was used we found that low-resolution LiDAR DEM performed the best followed by high-resolution LiDAR, with MSE values of 9.70 and 11.45 m, respectively. The MSE for the UAV-derived DEM was 15.12 m and for the coarse DEM was 20.78 m. We found that the UAV-derived DEM could be used to identify steep bank which could be used for mapping the hydrogeomorphology of lower order streams. Therefore, UAVs could be applied to efficiently map small stream channels in order to monitor the dynamic changes occurring in these ecosystems at a local scale. However, the VSP method should be used to map stream channels in small watersheds when high resolution DEM data is not available.},

ABSTRACT = {The automation of agricultural processes is expected to positively impact the environment by reducing waste and increasing food security, maximising resource use. Precision spraying is a method used to reduce the losses during pesticides application, reducing chemical residues in the soil. In this work, we developed a smart and novel electric sprayer that can be assembled on a robot. The sprayer has a crop perception system that calculates the leaf density based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using image histograms (local binary pattern (LBP), vegetation index, average, and hue). This density can then be used as a reference value to feed a controller that determines the air flow, the water rate, and the water density of the sprayer. This perception system was developed and tested with a created dataset available to the scientific community and represents a significant contribution. The results of the leaf density classifier show an accuracy score that varies between 80% and 85%. The conducted tests prove that the solution has the potential to increase the spraying accuracy and precision.},

ABSTRACT = {Crop production is a major source of food and livelihood for many people in arid and semi-arid (ASA) regions across the world. However, due to irregular climatic events, ASA regions are affected commonly by frequent droughts that can impact food production. In addition, ASA regions in the Middle East and Africa are often characterised by political instability, which can increase population vulnerability to hunger and ill health. Remote sensing (RS) provides a platform to improve the spatial prediction of crop production and food availability, with the potential to positively impact populations. This paper, firstly, describes some of the important characteristics of agriculture in ASA regions that require monitoring to improve their management. Secondly, it demonstrates how freely available RS data can support decision-making through a cost-effective monitoring system that complements traditional approaches for collecting agricultural data. Thirdly, it illustrates the challenges of employing freely available RS data for mapping and monitoring crop area, crop status and forecasting crop yield in these regions. Finally, existing approaches used in these applications are evaluated, and the challenges associated with their use and possible future improvements are discussed. We demonstrate that agricultural activities can be monitored effectively and both crop area and crop yield can be predicted in advance using RS data. We also discuss the future challenges associated with maintaining food security in ASA regions and explore some recent advances in RS that can be used to monitor cropland and forecast crop production and yield.},

ABSTRACT = {Using convolutional neural network (CNN) methods and satellite images for landslide identification and classification is a very efficient and popular task in geological hazard investigations. However, traditional CNNs have two disadvantages: (1) insufficient training images from the study area and (2) uneven distribution of the training set and validation set. In this paper, we introduced distant domain transfer learning (DDTL) methods for landslide detection and classification. We first introduce scene classification satellite imagery into the landslide detection task. In addition, in order to more effectively extract information from satellite images, we innovatively add an attention mechanism to DDTL (AM-DDTL). In this paper, the Longgang study area, a district in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, has only 177 samples as the landslide target domain. We examine the effect of DDTL by comparing three methods: the convolutional CNN, pretrained model and DDTL. We compare different attention mechanisms based on the DDTL. The experimental results show that the DDTL method has better detection performance than the normal CNN, and the AM-DDTL models achieve 94% classification accuracy, which is 7% higher than the conventional DDTL method. The requirements for the detection and classification of potential landslides at different disaster zones can be met by applying the AM-DDTL algorithm, which outperforms traditional CNN methods.},

ABSTRACT = {While remotely sensed images of various resolutions have been widely used in identifying changes in urban and peri-urban environments, only very high resolution (VHR) imagery is capable of providing the information needed for understanding the changes taking place in remote rural environments, due to the small footprints and low density of man-made structures in these settings. However, limited by data availability, mapping man-made structures and conducting subsequent change detections in remote areas are typically challenging and thus require a certain level of flexibility in algorithm design that takes into account the specific environmental and image conditions. In this study, we mapped all buildings and corrals for two remote villages in Mozambique based on two single-date VHR images that were taken in 2004 and 2012, respectively. Our algorithm takes advantage of the presence of shadows and, through a fusion of both spectra- and object-based analysis techniques, is able to differentiate buildings with metal and thatch roofs with high accuracy (overall accuracy of 86% and 94% for 2004 and 2012, respectively). The comparison of the mapping results between 2004 and 2012 reveals multiple lines of evidence suggesting that both villages, while differing in many aspects, have experienced substantial increases in the economic status. As a case study, our project demonstrates the capability of a coupling of VHR imagery with locally adjusted classification algorithms to infer the economic development of small, remote rural settlements.},

ABSTRACT = {Internet of Things (IoT) can help to pave the way to the circular economy and to a more sustainable world by enabling the digitalization of many operations and processes, such as water distribution, preventive maintenance, or smart manufacturing. Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries. Overall, this article provides guidelines that will help future developers to face the challenges that will arise when creating the next generation of Edge-AI G-IoT systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The search for approaches to a holistic sustainable agriculture requires the development of new cropping systems that provide additional ecosystem services beyond biomass supply for food, feed, material, and energy use. The reduction of chemical synthetic plant protection products is a key instrument to protect vulnerable natural resources such as groundwater and biodiversity. Together with an optimal use of mineral fertilizer, agroecological practices, and precision agriculture technologies, a complete elimination of chemical synthetic plant protection in mineral-ecological cropping systems (MECSs) may not only improve the environmental performance of agroecosystems, but also ensure their yield performance. Therefore, the development of MECSs aims to improve the overall ecosystem services of agricultural landscapes by (i) improving the provision of regulating ecosystem services compared to conventional cropping systems and (ii) improving the supply of provisioning ecosystem services compared to organic cropping systems. In the present review, all relevant research levels and aspects of this new farming concept are outlined and discussed based on a comprehensive literature review and the ongoing research project “Agriculture 4.0 without Chemical-Synthetic Plant Protection”.},

ABSTRACT = {Inaccurate electricity load forecasting can lead to the power sector gaining asymmetric information in the supply and demand relationship. This asymmetric information can lead to incorrect production or generation plans for the power sector. In order to improve the accuracy of load forecasting, a combined power load forecasting model based on machine learning algorithms, swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, and data pre-processing is proposed. Firstly, the original signal is pre-processed by the VMD–singular spectrum analysis data pre-processing method. Secondly, the noise-reduced signals are predicted using the Elman prediction model optimized by the sparrow search algorithm, the ELM prediction model optimized by the chaotic adaptive whale algorithm (CAWOA-ELM), and the LSSVM prediction model optimized by the chaotic sparrow search algorithm based on elite opposition-based learning (EOBL-CSSA-LSSVM) for electricity load data, respectively. Finally, the weighting coefficients of the three prediction models are calculated using the simulated annealing algorithm and weighted to obtain the prediction results. Comparative simulation experiments show that the VMD–singular spectrum analysis method and two improved intelligent optimization algorithms proposed in this paper can effectively improve the prediction accuracy. Additionally, the combined forecasting model proposed in this paper has extremely high forecasting accuracy, which can help the power sector to develop a reasonable production plan and power generation plans.},

ABSTRACT = {The performance of a multi-view machine vision method was documented at an orchard level, relative to packhouse count. High repeatability was achieved in night-time imaging, with an absolute percentage error of 2% or less. Canopy architecture impacted performance, with reasonable estimates achieved on hedge, single leader and conventional systems (3.4, 5.0, and 8.2 average percentage error, respectively) while fruit load of trellised orchards was over-estimated (at 25.2 average percentage error). Yield estimations were made for multiple orchards via: (i) human count of fruit load on ~5% of trees (FARM), (ii) human count of 18 trees randomly selected within three NDVI stratifications (CAL), (iii) multi-view counts (MV-Raw) and (iv) multi-view corrected for occluded fruit using manual counts of CAL trees (MV-CAL). Across the nine orchards for which results for all methods were available, the FARM, CAL, MV-Raw and MV-CAL methods achieved an average percentage error on packhouse counts of 26, 13, 11 and 17%, with SD of 11, 8, 11 and 9%, respectively, in the 2019–2020 season. The absolute percentage error of the MV-Raw estimates was 10% or less in 15 of the 20 orchards assessed. Greater error in load estimation occurred in the 2020–2021 season due to the time-spread of flowering. Use cases for the tree level data on fruit load was explored in context of fruit load density maps to inform early harvesting and to interpret crop damage, and tree frequency distributions based on fruit load per tree.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate and timely information on surface water quality and quantity is critical for various applications, including irrigation agriculture. In-field water quality and quantity data from unmanned aerial vehicle systems (UAVs) could be useful in closing spatial data gaps through the generation of near-real-time, fine resolution, spatially explicit information required for water resources accounting. This study assessed the progress, opportunities, and challenges in mapping and modelling water quality and quantity using data from UAVs. To achieve this research objective, a systematic review was adopted. The results show modest progress in the utility of UAVs, especially in the global south. This could be attributed, in part, to high costs, a lack of relevant skills, and the regulations associated with drone procurement and operational costs. The progress is further compounded by a general lack of research focusing on UAV application in water resources monitoring and assessment. More importantly, the lack of robust and reliable water quantity and quality data needed to parameterise models remains challenging. However, there are opportunities to advance scientific inquiry for water quality and quantity accounting by integrating UAV data and machine learning.},

ABSTRACT = {This study proposes a new attention-enhanced YOLO model that incorporates a leaf spot attention mechanism based on regions-of-interest (ROI) feature extraction into the YOLO framework for leaf disease detection. Inspired by a previous study, which revealed that leaf spot attention based on the ROI-aware feature extraction can improve leaf disease recognition accuracy significantly and outperform state-of-the-art deep learning models, this study extends the leaf spot attention model to leaf disease detection. The primary idea is that spot areas indicating leaf diseases appear only in leaves, whereas the background area does not contain useful information regarding leaf diseases. To increase the discriminative power of the feature extractor that is required in the object detection framework, it is essential to extract informative and discriminative features from the spot and leaf areas. To realize this, a new ROI-aware feature extractor, that is, a spot feature extractor was designed. To divide the leaf image into spot, leaf, and background areas, the leaf segmentation module was first pretrained, and then spot feature encoding was applied to encode spot information. Next, the ROI-aware feature extractor was connected to an ROI-aware feature fusion layer to model the leaf spot attention mechanism, and to be joined with the YOLO detection subnetwork. The experimental results confirm that the proposed ROI-aware feature extractor can improve leaf disease detection by boosting the discriminative power of the spot features. In addition, the proposed attention-enhanced YOLO model outperforms conventional state-of-the-art object detection models.},

ABSTRACT = {Bathymetry is a subset of hydrography, aimed at measuring the depth of waterbodies and waterways. Measurements are taken inter alia to detect natural obstacles or other navigational obstacles that endanger the safety of navigation, to examine the navigability conditions, anchorages, waterways and other commercial waterbodies, and to determine the parameters of the safe depth of waterbodies in the vicinity of ports, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to produce precise and reliable seabed maps, so that any hazards that may occur, particularly in shallow waterbodies, can be prevented, including the high dynamics of hydromorphological changes. This publication is aimed at developing a concept of an innovative autonomous unmanned system for bathymetric monitoring of shallow waterbodies. A bathymetric and topographic system will use autonomous unmanned aerial and surface vehicles to study the seabed relief in the littoral zone (even at depths of less than 1 m), in line with the requirements set out for the most stringent International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) order—exclusive. Unlike other existing solutions, the INNOBAT system will enable the coverage of the entire surveyed area with measurements, which will allow a comprehensive assessment of the hydrographic and navigation situation in the waterbody to be conducted.},

ABSTRACT = {Automatic acquisition of the canopy volume parameters of the Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju tree is of great significance to precision management of the orchard. This research combined the point cloud deep learning algorithm with the volume calculation algorithm to segment the canopy of the Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju trees. The 3D (Three-Dimensional) point cloud model of a Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju orchard was generated using UAV tilt photogrammetry images. The segmentation effects of three deep learning models, PointNet++, MinkowskiNet and FPConv, on Shatangju trees and the ground were compared. The following three volume algorithms: convex hull by slices, voxel-based method and 3D convex hull were applied to calculate the volume of Shatangju trees. Model accuracy was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results show that the overall accuracy of the MinkowskiNet model (94.57%) is higher than the other two models, which indicates the best segmentation effect. The 3D convex hull algorithm received the highest R2 (0.8215) and the lowest RMSE (0.3186 m3) for the canopy volume calculation, which best reflects the real volume of Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju trees. The proposed method is capable of rapid and automatic acquisition for the canopy volume of Citrus reticulate Blanco cv. Shatangju trees.},

ABSTRACT = {Burrowing animals are important ecosystem engineers affecting soil properties, as their burrowing activity leads to the redistribution of nutrients and soil carbon sequestration. The magnitude of these effects depends on the spatial density and depth of such burrows, but a method to derive this type of spatially explicit data is still lacking. In this study, we test the potential of using consumer-oriented UAV RGB imagery to determine the density and depth of holes created by burrowing animals at four study sites along a climate gradient in Chile, by combining UAV data with empirical field plot observations and machine learning techniques. To enhance the limited spectral information in RGB imagery, we derived spatial layers representing vegetation type and height and used landscape textures and diversity to predict hole parameters. Across-site models for hole density generally performed better than those for depth, where the best-performing model was for the invertebrate hole density (R2 = 0.62). The best models at individual study sites were obtained for hole density in the arid climate zone (R2 = 0.75 and 0.68 for invertebrates and vertebrates, respectively). Hole depth models only showed good to fair performance. Regarding predictor importance, the models heavily relied on vegetation height, texture metrics, and diversity indices.},

ABSTRACT = {Power-line inspection is an important means to maintain the safety of power networks. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology can provide high-precision 3D information about power corridors for automated power-line inspection, so there are more and more utility companies relying on LiDAR systems instead of traditional manual operation. However, it is still a challenge to automatically detect power lines with high precision. To achieve efficient and accurate power-line extraction, this paper proposes an algorithm using entropy-weighting feature evaluation (EWFE), which is different from the existing hierarchical-multiple-rule evaluation of many geometric features. Six significant features are selected (Height above Ground Surface (HGS), Vertical Range Ratio (VRR), Horizontal Angle (HA), Surface Variation (SV), Linearity (LI) and Curvature Change (CC)), and then the features are combined to construct a vector for quantitative evaluation. The feature weights are determined by an entropy-weighting method (EWM) to achieve optimal distribution. The point clouds are filtered out by the HGS feature, which possesses the highest entropy value, and a portion of non-power-line points can be removed without loss of power-line points. The power lines are extracted by evaluation of the other five features. To decrease the interference from pylon points, this paper analyzes performance in different pylon situations and performs an adaptive weight transformation. We evaluate the EWFE method using four datasets with different transmission voltage scales captured by a light unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR system and a mobile LiDAR system. Experimental results show that our method demonstrates efficient performance, while algorithm parameters remain consistent for the four datasets. The precision F value ranges from 98.4% to 99.7%, and the efficiency ranges from 0.9 million points/s to 5.2 million points/s.},

ABSTRACT = {Global biodiversity is threatened by unprecedented and increasing anthropogenic pressures, including habitat loss and fragmentation. LiDAR can become a decisive technology by providing accurate information about the linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem structure. Here, we review the current use of LiDAR metrics in ecological studies regarding birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, bryophytes, lichens, and fungi (BLF). We quantify the types of research (ecosystem and LiDAR sources) and describe the LiDAR platforms and data that are currently available. We also categorize and harmonize LiDAR metrics into five LiDAR morphological traits (canopy cover, height and vertical distribution, understory and shrubland, and topographic traits) and quantify their current use and effectiveness across taxonomic groups and ecosystems. The literature review returned 173 papers that met our criteria. Europe and North America held most of the studies, and birds were the most studied group, whereas temperate forest was by far the most represented ecosystem. Globally, canopy height was the most used LiDAR trait, especially in forest ecosystems, whereas canopy cover and terrain topography traits performed better in those ecosystems where they were mapped. Understory structure and shrubland traits together with terrain topography showed high effectiveness for less studied groups such as BLF and invertebrates and in open landscapes. Our results show how LiDAR technology has greatly contributed to habitat mapping, including organisms poorly studied until recently, such as BLF. Finally, we discuss the forthcoming opportunities for biodiversity mapping with different LiDAR platforms in combination with spectral information. We advocate (i) for the integration of spaceborne LiDAR data with the already available airborne (airplane, drones) and terrestrial technology, and (ii) the coupling of it with multispectral/hyperspectral information, which will allow for the exploration and analyses of new species and ecosystems.},

ABSTRACT = {Computer vision techniques have become important in agriculture and plant sciences due to their wide variety of applications. In particular, the analysis of seeds can provide meaningful information on their evolution, the history of agriculture, the domestication of plants, and knowledge of diets in ancient times. This work aims to propose an exhaustive comparison of several different types of features in the context of multiclass seed classification, leveraging two public plant seeds data sets to classify their families or species. In detail, we studied possible optimisations of five traditional machine learning classifiers trained with seven different categories of handcrafted features. We also fine-tuned several well-known convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the recently proposed SeedNet to determine whether and to what extent using their deep features may be advantageous over handcrafted features. The experimental results demonstrated that CNN features are appropriate to the task and representative of the multiclass scenario. In particular, SeedNet achieved a mean F-measure of 96%, at least. Nevertheless, several cases showed satisfactory performance from the handcrafted features to be considered a valid alternative. In detail, we found that the Ensemble strategy combined with all the handcrafted features can achieve 90.93% of mean F-measure, at least, with a considerably lower amount of times. We consider the obtained results an excellent preliminary step towards realising an automatic seeds recognition and classification framework.},

ABSTRACT = {Forest degradation continues to increase globally, threatening biodiversity and the survival of species. In this context, identifying intact, old-growth forest stands is both urgent and vital to ensure their existence and multiple contributions to society. Despite the global ecological importance of the Valdivian temperate rainforests, they are threatened by forest degradation resulting from constant and intense human use in the region. Identification of remnant intact forests in this region is urgent to global forest protection efforts. In this paper, we analyzed whether forests-canopy alterations due to logging produce a distinctive canopy gap structure (e.g., a gap area and a fraction of canopy gaps in the forest) that can be used to remotely distinguish intact from altered forests. We tested this question by comparing the canopy gap structure of 12 old-growth temperate rainforests in south-central Chile (39–40° S), with different levels of canopy alterations due to logging. At each stand, we obtained aerial or satellite very high spatial-resolution images that were automatically segmented using the Mean-Shift segmentation algorithm. We validated the results obtained remotely with ground data on the canopy gap structure. We found that the variables, canopy gap fraction, gap area frequency distribution, and mean gap area could be measured remotely with a high level of accuracy. Intact forests have a distinct canopy gap structure in comparison to forests with canopy alterations due to logging. Our results provided a fast, low-cost, and reliable method to obtain canopy gap structure indicators for mapping and monitoring intact forests in the Valdivian ecoregion. The method provided valuable information for managers interested in maintaining and restoring old-growth forest structures in these southern-temperate rainforests.},

ABSTRACT = {This research illustrates the technical efficiency of the pan-India paddy cultivation status obtained through a stochastic frontier approach. The results suggest that the mean technical efficiency varies from 0.64 in Gujarat to 0.95 in Odisha. Inputs like human labor, mechanical labor, fertilizer, irrigation and insecticide were found to determine the yield in paddy cultivation across India (except for Chhattisgarh). Inefficiency in the paddy production in Punjab, Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Gujarat and Odisha in 2016–2017 was caused by technical inefficiency due to poor input management, as suggested by the significant σ2U and σ2v values of the stochastic frontier model. In addition, most of the farm groups in the study operated in the high-efficiency group (80–90% technical efficiency). No specific pattern of input use can be visualized through descriptive measures to give any specific policy implication. Thus, machine learning algorithms based on the input parameters were tested on the data in order to predict the farmers’ efficiency class for individual states. The highest mean accuracy of 0.80 for the models of all of the states was achieved in random forest models. Among the various states of India, the best random forest prediction model based on accuracy was fitted to the input data of Bihar (0.91), followed by Uttar Pradesh (0.89), Andhra Pradesh (0.88), Assam (0.88) and West Bengal (0.86). Thus, the study provides a technique for the classification and prediction of a farmer’s efficiency group from the levels of input use in paddy cultivation for each state in the study. The study uses the DES input dataset to classify and predict the efficiency group of the farmer, as other machine learning models in agriculture have used mostly satellite, spectral imaging and soil property data to detect disease, weeds and crops.},

ABSTRACT = {Grain moisture content (GMC) is a key indicator of the appropriate harvest period of rice. Conventional testing is time-consuming and laborious, thus not to be implemented over vast areas and to enable the estimation of future changes for revealing optimal harvesting. Images of single panicles were shot with smartphones and corrected using a spectral–geometric correction board. In total, 86 panicle samples were obtained each time and then dried at 80 °C for 7 days to acquire the wet-basis GMC. In total, 517 valid samples were obtained, in which 80% was randomly used for training and 20% was used for testing to construct the image-based GMC assessment model. In total, 17 GMC surveys from a total of 201 samples were also performed from an area of 1 m2 representing on-site GMC, which enabled a multi-day GMC prediction. Eight color indices were selected using principal component analysis for building four machine learning models, including random forest, multilayer perceptron, support vector regression (SVR), and multivariate linear regression. The SVR model with a MAE of 1.23% was the most suitable for GMC of less than 40%. This study provides a real-time and cost-effective non-destructive GMC measurement using smartphones that enables on-farm prediction of harvest dates and facilitates the harvesting scheduling of agricultural machinery.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles work seamlessly within the GPS signal range, but their performance deteriorates in GPS-denied regions. This paper presents a unique collaborative computer vision-based approach for target tracking as per the image’s specific location of interest. The proposed method tracks any object without considering its properties like shape, color, size, or pattern. It is required to keep the target visible and line of sight during the tracking. The method gives freedom of selection to a user to track any target from the image and form a formation around it. We calculate the parameters like distance and angle from the image center to the object for the individual drones. Among all the drones, the one with a significant GPS signal strength or nearer to the target is chosen as the master drone to calculate the relative angle and distance between an object and other drones considering approximate Geo-location. Compared to actual measurements, the results of tests done on a quadrotor UAV frame achieve 99% location accuracy in a robust environment inside the exact GPS longitude and latitude block as GPS-only navigation methods. The individual drones communicate to the ground station through a telemetry link. The master drone calculates the parameters using data collected at ground stations. Various formation flying methods help escort other drones to meet the desired objective with a single high-resolution first-person view (FPV) camera. The proposed method is tested for Airborne Object Target Tracking (AOT) aerial vehicle model and achieves higher tracking accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {The adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in numerous sectors is projected to grow exponentially in the future as technology advances and regulation evolves. One of the promising applications of UAVs is in transportation systems. As the current transportation system is moving towards Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), UAVs will play a significant role in the functioning of ITS. This paper presents a survey on the recent advances of UAVs and their roles in current and future transportation systems. Moreover, the emerging technologies of UAVs in the transportation section and the current research areas are summarized. From the discussion, the challenges and opportunities of integrating UAVs towards future ITS are highlighted.

ABSTRACT = {High-throughput field phenotyping using close remote sensing platforms and sensors for non-destructive assessment of plant traits can support the objective evaluation of yield predictions of large breeding trials. The main objective of this study was to examine the potential of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based structural and spectral features and their combination in herbage yield predictions across diploid and tetraploid varieties and breeding populations of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Canopy structural (i.e., canopy height) and spectral (i.e., vegetation indices) information were derived from data gathered with two sensors: a consumer-grade RGB and a 10-band multispectral (MS) camera system, which were compared in the analysis. A total of 468 field plots comprising 115 diploid and 112 tetraploid varieties and populations were considered in this study. A modelling framework established to predict dry matter yield (DMY), was used to test three machine learning algorithms, including Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results of the nested cross-validation revealed: (a) the fusion of structural and spectral features achieved better DMY estimates as compared to models fitted with structural or spectral data only, irrespective of the sensor, ploidy level or machine learning algorithm applied; (b) models built with MS-based predictor variables, despite their lower spatial resolution, slightly outperformed the RGB-based models, as lower mean relative root mean square error (rRMSE) values were delivered; and (c) on average, the RF technique reported the best model performances among tested algorithms, regardless of the dataset used. The approach introduced in this study can provide accurate yield estimates (up to an RMSE = 308 kg ha−1) and useful information for breeders and practical farm-scale applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Precision agriculture has been at the cutting edge of research during the recent decade, aiming to reduce water consumption and ensure sustainability in agriculture. The proposed methodology was based on the crop water stress index (CWSI) and was applied in Greece within the ongoing research project GreenWaterDrone. The innovative approach combines real spatial data, such as infrared canopy temperature, air temperature, air relative humidity, and thermal infrared image data, taken above the crop field using an aerial micrometeorological station (AMMS) and a thermal (IR) camera installed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Following an initial calibration phase, where the ground micrometeorological station (GMMS) was installed in the crop, no equipment needed to be maintained in the field. Aerial and ground measurements were transferred in real time to sophisticated databases and applications over existing mobile networks for further processing and estimation of the actual water requirements of a specific crop at the field level, dynamically alerting/informing local farmers/agronomists of the irrigation necessity and additionally for potential risks concerning their fields. The supported services address farmers’, agricultural scientists’, and local stakeholders’ needs to conform to regional water management and sustainable agriculture policies. As preliminary results of this study, we present indicative original illustrations and data from applying the methodology to assess UAV functionality while aiming to evaluate and standardize all system processes.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aims to solve the problems of poor exploration ability, single strategy, and high training cost in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) motion planning tasks and to overcome certain difficulties, such as multiple constraints and a sparse reward environment. In this research, an end-to-end motion planning system based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed to solve the motion planning problem of an underactuated AUV. The system directly maps the state information of the AUV and the environment into the control instructions of the AUV. The system is based on the soft actor–critic (SAC) algorithm, which enhances the exploration ability and robustness to the AUV environment. We also use the method of generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) to assist its training to overcome the problem that learning a policy for the first time is difficult and time-consuming in reinforcement learning. A comprehensive external reward function is then designed to help the AUV smoothly reach the target point, and the distance and time are optimized as much as possible. Finally, the end-to-end motion planning algorithm proposed in this research is tested and compared on the basis of the Unity simulation platform. Results show that the algorithm has an optimal decision-making ability during navigation, a shorter route, less time consumption, and a smoother trajectory. Moreover, GAIL can speed up the AUV training speed and minimize the training time without affecting the planning effect of the SAC algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {Sodic soils adversely affect crop production over extensive areas of rain-fed cropping worldwide, with particularly large areas in Australia. Crop phenotyping may assist in identifying cultivars tolerant to soil sodicity. However, studies to identify the most appropriate traits and reliable tools to assist crop phenotyping on sodic soil are limited. Hence, this study evaluated the ability of multispectral, hyperspectral, 3D point cloud, and machine learning techniques to improve estimation of biomass and grain yield of wheat genotypes grown on a moderately sodic (MS) and highly sodic (HS) soil sites in northeastern Australia. While a number of studies have reported using different remote sensing approaches and crop traits to quantify crop growth, stress, and yield variation, studies are limited using the combination of these techniques including machine learning to improve estimation of genotypic biomass and yield, especially in constrained sodic soil environments. At close to flowering, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and ground-based proximal sensing was used to obtain remote and/or proximal sensing data, while biomass yield and crop heights were also manually measured in the field. Grain yield was machine-harvested at maturity. UAV remote and/or proximal sensing-derived spectral vegetation indices (VIs), such as normalized difference vegetation index, optimized soil adjusted vegetation index, and enhanced vegetation index and crop height were closely corresponded to wheat genotypic biomass and grain yields. UAV multispectral VIs more closely associated with biomass and grain yields compared to proximal sensing data. The red-green-blue (RGB) 3D point cloud technique was effective in determining crop height, which was slightly better correlated with genotypic biomass and grain yield than ground-measured crop height data. These remote sensing-derived crop traits (VIs and crop height) and wheat biomass and grain yields were further simulated using machine learning algorithms (multitarget linear regression, support vector machine regression, Gaussian process regression, and artificial neural network) with different kernels to improve estimation of biomass and grain yield. The artificial neural network predicted biomass yield (R2 = 0.89; RMSE = 34.8 g/m2 for the MS and R2 = 0.82; RMSE = 26.4 g/m2 for the HS site) and grain yield (R2 = 0.88; RMSE = 11.8 g/m2 for the MS and R2 = 0.74; RMSE = 16.1 g/m2 for the HS site) with slightly less error than the others. Wheat genotypes Mitch, Corack, Mace, Trojan, Lancer, and Bremer were identified as more tolerant to sodic soil constraints than Emu Rock, Janz, Flanker, and Gladius. The study improves our ability to select appropriate traits and techniques in accurate estimation of wheat genotypic biomass and grain yields on sodic soils. This will also assist farmers in identifying cultivars tolerant to sodic soil constraints.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing frequency of active fires worldwide has caused significant impacts on terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric systems. Polar regions have received little attention due to their sparse populations, but active fires in the Arctic cause carbon losses from peatlands, which affects the global climate system. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the spatiotemporal variations in active fires in the Arctic and to assess the fire risk. We used MODIS C6 data from 2001 to 2019 and VIIRS V1 data from 2012 to 2019 to analyse the spatiotemporal characteristics of active fires and establish a fire risk assessment model based on logistic regression. The trends in active fire frequency based on MODIS C6 and VIIRS V1 data are consistent. Throughout the Arctic, the fire frequency appears to be fluctuating and overall increasing. Fire occurrence has obvious seasonality, being concentrated in summer (June–August) and highest in July, when lightning is most frequent. The frequency of active fires is related to multiple factors, such as vegetation type, NDVI, elevation, slope, air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and distances from roads and settlements. A risk assessment model was constructed based on logistic regression and found to be accurate. The results are helpful in understanding the risk of fires in the Arctic under climate change and provide a scientific basis for fire prediction and control and for reducing fire-related carbon emissions.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding socio-ecological systems and the discovery, recovery and adaptation of land knowledge are key challenges for sustainable land use. The analysis of sustainable agricultural systems and practices, for instance, requires interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and coordinated data acquisition, data integration and analysis. However, datasets, which are acquired using remote sensing, geospatial analysis and simulation techniques, are often limited by narrow disciplinary boundaries and therefore fall short in enabling a holistic approach across multiple domains and scales. In this work, we demonstrate a new workflow for interdisciplinary data acquisition and integration, focusing on terraced vineyards in Tuscany, Italy. We used multi-modal data acquisition and performed data integration via a voxelised point cloud that we term a composite voxel model. The latter facilitates a multi-domain and multi-scale data-integrated approach for advancing the discovery and recovery of land knowledge. This approach enables integration, correlation and analysis of data pertaining to different domains and scales in a single data structure.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a novel Time Difference of Arrival-based approach suitable for single-anchor positioning systems, implemented by phase wrapping-impaired array antenna. With the latter being a typical occurrence in large Switched Beam Antenna (SBA) operating in the low microwave range. The proposed method takes advantage from the large bandwidth of radio link, established between the anchor and the positioning target, by generating an unambiguous equivalent phase relationship between antenna array elements. The technique is validated by adopting a relatively large SBA antenna operating in the 4.75–6.25 GHz bandwidth, and capable to position a target in a 3D domain. Experimental data, carried out in the 4–7 GHz frequency bandwidth, show that by dealing properly with the inherent constraint of phase wrapping issues, it is possible to get a significant improvement on the elevation angle with respect to methods not capable to deal with phase reconstruction and thus operating in a phase-less context. Combining range and angle errors, the associated cumulative distribution function error in 90% of cases shows an error of 0.13 m.},

ABSTRACT = {Cropping intensity is a key indicator for evaluating grain production and intensive use of cropland. Timely and accurately monitoring of cropping intensity is of great significance for ensuring national food security and improving the level of national land management. In this study, we used all Sentinel-2 images on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, and constructed an improved peak point detection method to extract the cropping intensity of a heterogeneous planting area combined with crop phenology. The crop growth cycle profiles were extracted from the multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface water index (LSWI) datasets. Results show that by 2020, the area of single cropping, double cropping, and triple cropping in the Henan Province are 52,236.9 km2, 74,334.1 km2, and 1927.1 km2, respectively; the corresponding producer accuracies are 86.12%, 93.72%, and 91.41%, respectively; the corresponding user accuracies are 88.99%, 92.29%, and 71.26%, respectively. The overall accuracy is 90.95%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.81. Using the sown area in the statistical yearbook data of cities in the Henan Province to verify the extraction results of this paper, the R2 is 0.9717, and the root mean square error is 1715.9 km2. This study shows that using all the Sentinel-2 data, the phenology algorithm, and cloud computing technology has great potential in producing a high spatio-temporal resolution dataset for crop remote sensing monitoring and agricultural policymaking in complex planting areas.},

ABSTRACT = {Cloud Computing is a well-established paradigm for building service-centric systems. However, ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, security, and real-time analytics are limitations in Cloud Computing when analysing and providing results for a large amount of data. Fog and Edge Computing offer solutions to the limitations of Cloud Computing. The number of agricultural domain applications that use the combination of Cloud, Fog, and Edge is increasing in the last few decades. This article aims to provide a systematic literature review of current works that have been done in Cloud, Fog, and Edge Computing applications in the smart agriculture domain between 2015 and up-to-date. The key objective of this review is to identify all relevant research on new computing paradigms with smart agriculture and propose a new architecture model with the combinations of Cloud–Fog–Edge. Furthermore, it also analyses and examines the agricultural application domains, research approaches, and the application of used combinations. Moreover, this survey discusses the components used in the architecture models and briefly explores the communication protocols used to interact from one layer to another. Finally, the challenges of smart agriculture and future research directions are briefly pointed out in this article.},

ABSTRACT = {Documenting the impacts of climate change and human activities on tropical rainforests is imperative for protecting tropical biodiversity and for better implementation of REDD+ and UN Sustainable Development Goals. Recent advances in very high-resolution satellite sensor systems (i.e., WorldView-3), computing power, and machine learning (ML) have provided improved mapping of fine-scale changes in the tropics. However, approaches so far focused on feature extraction or the extensive tuning of ML parameters, hindering the potential of ML in forest conservation mapping by not using textural information, which is found to be powerful for many applications. Additionally, the contribution of shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands in forest cover mapping is unknown. The objectives were to develop end-to-end mapping of the tropical forest using fully convolution neural networks (FCNNs) with WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery and to evaluate human impact on the environment using the Betampona Nature Reserve (BNR) in Madagascar as the test site. FCNN (U-Net) using spatial/textural information was implemented and compared with feature-fed pixel-based methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Results show that the FCNN model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 90.9%, while SVM, RF, and DNN provided accuracies of 88.6%, 84.8%, and 86.6%, respectively. When SWIR bands were excluded from the input data, FCNN provided superior performance over other methods with a 1.87% decrease in accuracy, while the accuracies of other models—SVM, RF, and DNN—decreased by 5.42%, 3.18%, and 8.55%, respectively. Spatial–temporal analysis showed a 0.7% increase in Evergreen Forest within the BNR and a 32% increase in tree cover within residential areas likely due to forest regeneration and conservation efforts. Other effects of conservation efforts are also discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Ripeness estimation of fruits and vegetables is a key factor for the optimization of field management and the harvesting of the desired product quality. Typical ripeness estimation involves multiple manual samplings before harvest followed by chemical analyses. Machine vision has paved the way for agricultural automation by introducing quicker, cost-effective, and non-destructive methods. This work comprehensively surveys the most recent applications of machine vision techniques for ripeness estimation. Due to the broad area of machine vision applications in agriculture, this review is limited only to the most recent techniques related to grapes. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art algorithms by covering a wide range of applications. The potential of current machine vision techniques for specific viticulture applications is also analyzed. Problems, limitations of each technique, and future trends are discussed. Moreover, the integration of machine vision algorithms in grape harvesting robots for real-time in-field maturity assessment is additionally examined.},

ABSTRACT = {In the current modern era of information and technology, emerging remote advancements have been widely established for detailed virtual inspections and assessments of infrastructure assets, especially bridges. These technologies are capable of creating an accurate digital representation of the existing assets, commonly known as the digital twins. Digital twins are suitable alternatives to in-person and on-site based assessments that can provide safer, cheaper, more reliable, and less distributive bridge inspections. In the case of bridge monitoring, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) are among the most common advanced technologies that hold the potential to provide qualitative digital models; however, the research is still lacking a reliable methodology to evaluate the generated point clouds in terms of quality and geometric accuracy for a bridge size case study. Therefore, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive methodology along with a thorough bridge case study to evaluate two digital point clouds developed from an existing Australian heritage bridge via both UAV-based photogrammetry and TLS. In this regard, a range of proposed approaches were employed to compare point clouds in terms of points’ distribution, level of outlier noise, data completeness, surface deviation, and geometric accuracy. The comparative results of this case study not only proved the capability and applicability of the proposed methodology and approaches in evaluating these two voluminous point clouds, but they also exhibited a higher level of point density and more acceptable agreements with as-is measurements in TLS-based point clouds subjected to the implementation of a precise data capture and a 3D reconstruction model.},

ABSTRACT = {Timely, accurate maps of invasive plant species are critical for making appropriate management decisions to eliminate emerging target populations or contain infestations. High-resolution aerial imagery is routinely used to map, monitor, and detect invasive plant populations. While conventional image interpretation involving human analysts is straightforward, it can require high demands for time and resources to produce useful intelligence. We compared the performance of human analysts with a custom Retinanet-based deep convolutional neural network (DNN) for detecting individual miconia (Miconia calvescens DC) plants, using high-resolution unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery collected over lowland tropical forests in Hawai’i. Human analysts (n = 38) examined imagery at three linear scrolling speeds (100, 200 and 300 px/s), achieving miconia detection recalls of 74 ± 3%, 60 ± 3%, and 50 ± 3%, respectively. The DNN achieved 83 ± 3% recall and completed the image analysis in 1% of the time of the fastest scrolling speed tested. Human analysts could discriminate large miconia leaf clusters better than isolated individual leaves, while the DNN detection efficacy was independent of leaf cluster size. Optically, the contrast in the red and green color channels and all three (i.e., red, green, and blue) signal to clutter ratios (SCR) were significant factors for human detection, while only the red channel contrast, and the red and green SCRs were significant factors for the DNN. A linear cost analysis estimated the operational use of a DNN to be more cost effective than human photo interpretation when the cumulative search area exceeds a minimum area. For invasive species like miconia, which can stochastically spread propagules across thousands of ha, the DNN provides a more efficient option for detecting incipient, immature miconia across large expanses of forested canopy. Increasing operational capacity for large-scale surveillance with a DNN-based image analysis workflow can provide more rapid comprehension of invasive plant abundance and distribution in forested watersheds and may become strategically vital to containing these invasions.},

ABSTRACT = {The monitoring of vegetation via remote sensing has been widely applied in various fields, such as crop diseases and pests, forest coverage and vegetation growth status, but such monitoring activities were mainly carried out in the daytime, resulting in limitations in sensing the status of vegetation at night. In this article, with the aim of monitoring the health status of outdoor plants at night by remote sensing, a polarized multispectral low-illumination-level imaging system (PMSIS) was established, and a fusion algorithm was proposed to detect vegetation by sensing the spectrum and polarization characteristics of the diffuse and specular reflection of vegetation. The normalized vegetation index (NDVI), degree of linear polarization (DoLP) and angle of polarization (AOP) are all calculated in the fusion algorithm to better detect the health status of plants in the night environment. Based on NDVI, DoLP and AOP fusion images (NDAI), a new index of night plant state detection (NPSDI) was proposed. A correlation analysis was made for the chlorophyll content (SPAD), nitrogen content (NC), NDVI and NPSDI to understand their capabilities to detect plants under stress. The scatter plot of NPSDI shows a good distinction between vegetation with different health levels, which can be seen from the high specificity and sensitivity values. It can be seen that NPSDI has a good correlation with NDVI (coefficient of determination R2 = 0.968), PSAD (R2 = 0.882) and NC (R2 = 0.916), which highlights the potential of NPSDI in the identification of plant health status. The results clearly show that the proposed fusion algorithm can enhance the contrast effect and the generated fusion image will carry richer vegetation information, thereby monitoring the health status of plants at night more effectively. This algorithm has a great potential in using remote sensing platform to monitor the health of vegetation and crops.},

ABSTRACT = {Advances in early insect detection have been reported using digital technologies through camera systems, sensor networks, and remote sensing coupled with machine learning (ML) modeling. However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices.},

ABSTRACT = {The Tactile Internet (TI) is an emerging area of research involving 5G and beyond (B5G) communications to enable real-time interaction of haptic data over the Internet between tactile ends, with audio-visual data as feedback. This emerging TI technology is viewed as the next evolutionary step for the Internet of Things (IoT) and is expected to bring about a massive change in Healthcare 4.0, Industry 4.0 and autonomous vehicles to resolve complicated issues in modern society. This vision of TI makes a dream into a reality. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey of TI, focussing on design architecture, key application areas, potential enabling technologies, current issues, and challenges to realise it. To illustrate the novelty of our work, we present a brainstorming mind-map of all the topics discussed in this article. We emphasise the design aspects of the TI and discuss the three main sections of the TI, i.e., master, network, and slave sections, with a focus on the proposed application-centric design architecture. With the help of the proposed illustrative diagrams of use cases, we discuss and tabulate the possible applications of the TI with a 5G framework and its requirements. Then, we extensively address the currently identified issues and challenges with promising potential enablers of the TI. Moreover, a comprehensive review focussing on related articles on enabling technologies is explored, including Fifth Generation (5G), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), Cloud/Edge/Fog Computing, Multiple Access, and Network Coding. Finally, we conclude the survey with several research issues that are open for further investigation. Thus, the survey provides insights into the TI that can help network researchers and engineers to contribute further towards developing the next-generation Internet.},

ABSTRACT = {This study analyses the relationships between the technologies of Industry 4.0, continuous improvement, and the business results. To carry out this study, 109 questionnaires to companies of different sectors were collected, but an indispensable condition to take into account was the fact that these companies develop themselves their logistics management. The analysis of the results obtained through the Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology argues that there is a positive relationship between 4.0 Industry and continuous improvement processes, as well as between continuous improvement processes and organizational results, although it cannot be concluded that a direct relationship between 4.0 Industry and organizational results exists, which means that there are other variables, such as continuous improvement, mediating between them. With this work, there is already an accredited reference of the relationship, which has been verified to exist, between the Industry 4.0, the continuous improvement, and the business results.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has emerged as a potentially cost-effective alternative to airborne laser scanning (ALS) for forest inventory methods that employ point cloud data. Forest inventory derived from DAP using area-based methods has been shown to achieve accuracy similar to that of ALS data. At the tree level, individual tree detection (ITD) algorithms have been developed to detect and/or delineate individual trees either from ALS point cloud data or from ALS- or DAP-based canopy height models. An examination of the application of ITDs to DAP-based point clouds has not yet been reported. In this research, we evaluate the suitability of DAP-based point clouds for individual tree detection in the Pinus radiata plantation. Two ITD algorithms designed to work with point cloud data are applied to dense point clouds generated from small- and medium-format photography and to an ALS point cloud. Performance of the two ITD algorithms, the influence of stand structure on tree detection rates, and the relationship between tree detection rates and canopy structural metrics are investigated. Overall, we show that there is a good agreement between ALS- and DAP-based ITD results (proportion of false negatives for ALS, SFP, and MFP was always lower than 29.6%, 25.3%, and 28.6%, respectively, whereas, the proportion of false positives for ALS, SFP, and MFP was always lower than 39.4%, 30.7%, and 33.7%, respectively). Differences between small- and medium-format DAP results were minor (for SFP and MFP, differences between recall, precision, and F-score were always less than 0.08, 0.03, and 0.05, respectively), suggesting that DAP point cloud data is robust for ITD. Our results show that among all the canopy structural metrics, the number of trees per hectare has the greatest influence on the tree detection rates.},

ABSTRACT = {Although the combination of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data and optical imagery and machine learning algorithms were proved to improve the estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), the synergistic approaches of different data and ensemble learning algorithms have not been fully investigated, especially for natural secondary forests (NSFs) with complex structures. This study aimed to explore the effects of the two factors on AGB estimation of NSFs based on ALS data and Landsat 8 imagery. The synergistic method of extracting novel features (i.e., COLI1 and COLI2) using optimal Landsat 8 features and the best-performing ALS feature (i.e., elevation mean) yielded higher accuracy of AGB estimation than either optical-only or ALS-only features. However, both of them failed to improve the accuracy compared to the simple combination of the untransformed features that generated them. The convolutional neural networks (CNN) model was much superior to other classic machine learning algorithms no matter of features. The stacked generalization (SG) algorithms, a kind of ensemble learning algorithms, greatly improved the accuracies compared to the corresponding base model, and the SG with the CNN meta-model performed best. This study provides technical support for a wall-to-wall AGB mapping of NSFs of northeastern China using efficient features and algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Riverscapes are complex ecosystems consisting of dynamic processes influenced by spatially heterogeneous physical features. A critical component of riverscapes is vegetation in the stream channel and floodplain, which influences flooding and provides habitat. Riverscape vegetation can be highly variable in size and structure, including wetland plants, grasses, shrubs, and trees. This vegetation variability is difficult to precisely measure over large extents with traditional surveying tools. Drone laser scanning (DLS), or UAV-based lidar, has shown potential for measuring topography and vegetation over large extents at a high resolution but has yet to be used to quantify both the temporal and spatial variability of riverscape vegetation. Scans were performed on a reach of Stroubles Creek in Blacksburg, VA, USA six times between 2017 and 2019. Change was calculated both annually and seasonally over the two-year period. Metrics were derived from the lidar scans to represent different aspects of riverscape vegetation: height, roughness, and density. Vegetation was classified as scrub or tree based on the height above ground and 604 trees were manually identified in the riverscape, which grew on average by 0.74 m annually. Trees had greater annual growth and scrub had greater seasonal variability. Height and roughness were better measures of annual growth and density was a better measure of seasonal variability. The results demonstrate the advantage of repeat surveys with high-resolution DLS for detecting seasonal variability in the riverscape environment, including the growth and decay of floodplain vegetation, which is critical information for various hydraulic and ecological applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Remotely sensed data is increasingly applied across many domains, including fit-for-purpose land administration (FFPLA), where the focus is on fast, affordable, and accurate property information collection. Property valuation, as one of the main functions of land administration systems, is influenced by locational, physical, legal, and economic factors. Despite the importance of property valuation to economic development, there are often no standardized rules or strict data requirements for property valuation for taxation in developing contexts, such as Rwanda. This study aims at assessing different remote sensing data in support of developing a new approach for property valuation for taxation in Rwanda; one that aligns with the FFPLA philosophy. Three different remote sensing technologies, (i) aerial images acquired with a digital camera, (ii) WorldView2 satellite images, and (iii) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images obtained with a DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus quadcopter, are compared and analyzed in terms of their fitness to fulfil the requirements for valuation for taxation purposes. Quantitative and qualitative methods are applied for the comparative analysis. Prior to the field visit, the fundamental concepts of property valuation for taxation and remote sensing were reviewed. In the field, reference data using high precision GNSS (Leica) was collected and used for quantitative assessment. Primary data was further collected via semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The results show that UAVs have the highest potential for collecting data to support property valuation for taxation. The main reasons are the prime need for accurate-enough and up-to-date information. The comparison of the different remote sensing techniques and the provided new approach can support land valuers and professionals in the field in bottom-up activities following the FFPLA principles and maintaining the temporal quality of data needed for fair taxation.},

ABSTRACT = {The transition from batch to continuous processes in the pharmaceutical industry has been driven by the potential improvement in process controllability, product quality homogeneity, and reduction of material inventory. A quality-by-control (QbC) approach has been implemented in a variety of pharmaceutical product manufacturing modalities to increase product quality through a three-level hierarchical control structure. In the implementation of the QbC approach it is common practice to simplify control algorithms by utilizing linearized models with constant model parameters. Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) can effectively deliver control functionality for highly sensitive variations and nonlinear multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is essential for the highly regulated pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. This work focuses on developing and implementing NMPC in continuous manufacturing of solid dosage forms. To mitigate control degradation caused by plant-model mismatch, careful monitoring and continuous improvement strategies are studied. When moving horizon estimation (MHE) is integrated with NMPC, historical data in the past time window together with real-time data from the sensor network enable state estimation and accurate tracking of the highly sensitive model parameters. The adaptive model used in the NMPC strategy can compensate for process uncertainties, further reducing plant-model mismatch effects. The nonlinear mechanistic model used in both MHE and NMPC can predict the essential but complex powder properties and provide physical interpretation of abnormal events. The adaptive NMPC implementation and its real-time control performance analysis and practical applicability are demonstrated through a series of illustrative examples that highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach for different scenarios of plant-model mismatch, while also incorporating glidant effects.},

ABSTRACT = {Weeds are unwanted plants that can reduce crop yields by competing for water, nutrients, light, space, and carbon dioxide, which need to be controlled to meet future food production requirements. The integration of drones, artificial intelligence, and various sensors, which include hyperspectral, multi-spectral, and RGB (red-green-blue), ensure the possibility of a better outcome in managing weed problems. Most of the major or minor challenges caused by weed infestation can be faced by implementing remote sensing systems in various agricultural tasks. It is a multi-disciplinary science that includes spectroscopy, optics, computer, photography, satellite launching, electronics, communication, and several other fields. Future challenges, including food security, sustainability, supply and demand, climate change, and herbicide resistance, can also be overcome by those technologies based on machine learning approaches. This review provides an overview of the potential and practical use of unmanned aerial vehicle and remote sensing techniques in weed management practices and discusses how they overcome future challenges.},

ABSTRACT = {Contamination on insulators may increase the surface conductivity of the insulator, and as a consequence, electrical discharges occur more frequently, which can lead to interruptions in a power supply. To maintain reliability in an electrical distribution power system, components that have lost their insulating properties must be replaced. Identifying the components that need maintenance is a difficult task as there are several levels of contamination that are hard to notice during inspections. To improve the quality of inspections, this paper proposes using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to classify the levels of insulator contamination based on images of insulators at various levels of contamination simulated in the laboratory. Computer vision features such as mean, variance, asymmetry, kurtosis, energy, and entropy are used for training the k-NN. To assess the robustness of the proposed approach, a statistical analysis and a comparative assessment with well-consolidated algorithms such as decision tree, ensemble subspace, and support vector machine models are presented. The k-NN showed up to 85.17% accuracy using the k-fold cross-validation method, with an average accuracy higher than 82% for the multi-classification of contamination of insulators, being superior to the compared models.},

ABSTRACT = {The construction of high-rise building projects is a dangerous vocation due to the uniqueness and nature of the activities, as well as the complexity of the working environment, yet safety issues remain crucial in the construction industry. Digital technologies, such as building information modeling (BIM), have been identified as valuable tools for increasing construction productivity, efficiency, and safety. This research aimed to mitigate the accident safety factors in high-rise building projects via integrating BIM with emerging digital technologies in the construction industry, such as photogrammetry, GPS, RFID, augmented reality, (AR), virtual reality (VR), and drone technology. Qualitative research was conceived in the ground theory approach. Forty-five online interviews with construction stakeholders and qualitative data analysis were carried out using the NVivo 11 software package. According to the findings, interviewees were more motivated to use photogrammetry and drone technologies in high-rise building projects in order to increase construction safety. Positive, negative, and neutral attitudes about BIM integration with emerging digital technologies were discovered. Furthermore, a research framework was developed by consolidating research findings that articulate the measures and future needs of BIM integration with other digital technologies to mitigate construction accidents in high-rise building projects. The framework also renders practical references for industry practitioners towards effective and safer construction.},

ABSTRACT = {Pine wilt disease (PWD) is a serious threat to pine forests. Combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and deep learning (DL) techniques to identify infected pines is the most efficient method to determine the potential spread of PWD over a large area. In particular, image segmentation using DL obtains the detailed shape and size of infected pines to assess the disease’s degree of damage. However, the performance of such segmentation models has not been thoroughly studied. We used a fixed-wing UAV to collect images from a pine forest in Laoshan, Qingdao, China, and conducted a ground survey to collect samples of infected pines and construct prior knowledge to interpret the images. Then, training and test sets were annotated on selected images, and we obtained 2352 samples of infected pines annotated over different backgrounds. Finally, high-performance DL models (e.g., fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation, DeepLabv3+, and PSPNet) were trained and evaluated. The results demonstrated that focal loss provided a higher accuracy and a finer boundary than Dice loss, with the average intersection over union (IoU) for all models increasing from 0.656 to 0.701. From the evaluated models, DeepLLabv3+ achieved the highest IoU and an F1 score of 0.720 and 0.832, respectively. Also, an atrous spatial pyramid pooling module encoded multiscale context information, and the encoder–decoder architecture recovered location/spatial information, being the best architecture for segmenting trees infected by the PWD. Furthermore, segmentation accuracy did not improve as the depth of the backbone network increased, and neither ResNet34 nor ResNet50 was the appropriate backbone for most segmentation models.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital twins (DTs) is a promising technology in the revolution of the industry and essential for Industry 4.0. DTs play a vital role in improving distributed manufacturing, providing up-to-date operational data representation of physical assets, supporting decision-making, and avoiding the potential risks in distributed manufacturing systems. Furthermore, DTs need to collaborate within distributed manufacturing systems to predict the risks and reach consensus-based decision-making. However, DTs collaboration suffers from single failure due to attack and connection in a centralized manner, data interoperability, authentication, and scalability. To overcome the above challenges, we have discussed the major high-level requirements for the DTs collaboration. Then, we have proposed a conceptual framework to fulfill the DTs collaboration requirements by using the combination of blockchain, predictive analysis techniques, and DTs technologies. The proposed framework aims to empower more intelligence DTs based on blockchain technology. In particular, we propose a concrete ledger-based collaborative DTs framework that focuses on real-time operational data analytics and distributed consensus algorithms. Furthermore, we describe how the conceptual framework can be applied using smart transportation system use cases, i.e., smart logistics and railway predictive maintenance. Finally, we highlighted the future direction to guide interested researchers in this interesting area.},

ABSTRACT = {The U-net is nowadays among the most popular deep learning algorithms for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping; nevertheless, it has rarely been used with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral (MS) imagery. On the other hand, the discrimination between plantations and forests in LULC maps has been emphasized, especially for tropical areas, due to their differences in biodiversity and ecosystem services provision. In this study, we trained a U-net using different imagery inputs from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, MS, SAR and a combination of both (MS + SAR); while a random forests algorithm (RF) with the MS + SAR input was also trained to evaluate the difference in algorithm selection. The classification system included ten classes, including old-growth and secondary forests, as well as old-growth and young plantations. The most accurate results were obtained with the MS + SAR U-net, where the highest overall accuracy (0.76) and average F1-score (0.58) were achieved. Although MS + SAR and MS U-nets gave similar results for almost all of the classes, for old-growth plantations and secondary forest, the addition of the SAR band caused an F1-score increment of 0.08–0.11 (0.62 vs. 0.54 and 0.45 vs. 0.34, respectively). Consecutively, in comparison with the MS + SAR RF, the MS + SAR U-net obtained higher F1-scores for almost all the classes. Our results show that using the U-net with a combined input of SAR and MS images enabled a higher F1-score and accuracy for a detailed LULC map, in comparison with other evaluated methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Computer vision is a frequently used approach in static and dynamic measurements of various mechanical structures. Sometimes, however, conducting a large number of experiments is time-consuming and may require significant financial and human resources. On the contrary, the authors propose a simulation approach for performing experiments to synthetically generate vision data. Synthetic images of mechanical structures subjected to loads are generated in the following way. The finite element method is adopted to compute deformations of the studied structure, and next, the Blender graphics program is used to render images presenting that structure. As a result of the proposed approach, it is possible to obtain synthetic images that reliably reflect static and dynamic experiments. This paper presents the results of the application of the proposed approach in the analysis of a complex-shaped structure for which experimental validation was carried out. In addition, the second example of the process of 3D reconstruction of the examined structure (in a multicamera system) is provided. The results for the structure with damage (cantilever beam) are also presented. The obtained results allow concluding that the proposed approach reliably imitates the images captured during real experiments. In addition, the method can become a tool supporting the vision system configuration process before conducting final experimental research.},

ABSTRACT = {Infrared thermography is the science of measuring the infrared energy emitted by an object, translating it to apparent temperature variance, and displaying the result as an infrared image. Significantly, acquiring thermal images delivers distinctive levels of temperature differences in solar panels that correspond to their health status, which is beneficial for the early detection of defects. The proposed algorithm aims to analyze the thermal solar panel images. The acquired thermal solar panel images were segmented into solar cell sizes to provide more detailed information by region or cell area instead of the entire solar panel. This paper uses both the image histogram information and its corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF), useful for image analysis. The acquired thermal solar panel images are enhanced using grayscale, histogram equalization, and adaptive histogram equalization to represent a domain that is easier to analyze. The experimental results reveal that the extraction results of thermal images provide better histogram and CDF features. Furthermore, the proposed scheme includes the convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying the enhanced images, which shows that a 97% accuracy of classification was achieved. The proposed scheme could promote different thermal image applications—for example, non-physical visual recognition and fault detection analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {Agricultural robotics has been a popular subject in recent years from an academic as well as a commercial point of view. This is because agricultural robotics addresses critical issues such as seasonal shortages in manual labor, e.g., during harvest, as well as the increasing concern regarding environmentally friendly practices. On one hand, several individual agricultural robots have already been developed for specific tasks (e.g., for monitoring, spraying, harvesting, transport, etc.) with varying degrees of effectiveness. On the other hand, the use of cooperative teams of agricultural robots in farming tasks is not as widespread; yet, it is an emerging trend. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the work carried out so far in the area of cooperative agricultural robotics and identifies the state-of-the-art. This paper also outlines challenges to be addressed in fully automating agricultural production; the latter is promising for sustaining an increasingly vast human population, especially in cases of pandemics such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic.},

ABSTRACT = {Concrete is an important construction material. Its characteristics depend on the environmental conditions, construction methods, and mix factors. Working with concrete is particularly tricky in a hot climate. This study predicts the properties of concrete in hot conditions using the case study of Rawalpindi, Pakistan. In this research, variable casting temperatures, design factors, and curing conditions are investigated for their effects on concrete characteristics. For this purpose, water–cement ratio (w/c), in-situ concrete temperature (T), and curing methods of the concrete are varied, and their effects on pulse velocity (PV), compressive strength (fc), depth of water penetration (WP), and split tensile strength (ft) were studied for up to 180 days. Quadratic regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models have been formulated to forecast the properties of concrete in the current study. The results show that T, curing period, and moist curing strongly influence fc, ft, and PV, while WP is adversely affected by T and moist curing. The ANN model shows better results compared to the quadratic regression model. Furthermore, a combined ANN model of fc, ft, and PV was also developed that displayed higher accuracy than the individual ANN models. These models can help construction site engineers select the appropriate concrete parameters when concreting under hot climates to produce durable and long-lasting concrete.},

ABSTRACT = {Drones are increasing in popularity and are reaching the public faster than ever before. Consequently, the chances of a drone being misused are multiplying. Automated drone detection is necessary to prevent unauthorized and unwanted drone interventions. In this research, we designed an automated drone detection system using YOLOv4. The model was trained using drone and bird datasets. We then evaluated the trained YOLOv4 model on the testing dataset, using mean average precision (mAP), frames per second (FPS), precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation parameters. We next collected our own two types of drone videos, performed drone detections, and calculated the FPS to identify the speed of detection at three altitudes. Our methodology showed better performance than what has been found in previous similar studies, achieving a mAP of 74.36%, precision of 0.95, recall of 0.68, and F1-score of 0.79. For video detection, we achieved an FPS of 20.5 on the DJI Phantom III and an FPS of 19.0 on the DJI Mavic Pro.},

ABSTRACT = {The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic is showing dramatic impact across the world. Public health authorities attempt to fight against the virus while maintaining economic activity. In the face of the uncertainty derived from the virus, all the countries have adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions for limiting the mobility and maintaining social distancing. In order to support these interventions, some health authorities and governments have opted for sharing very fine-grained data related with the impact of the virus in their territories. Geographical science is playing a major role in terms of understanding how the virus spreads across regions. Location of cases allows identifying the spatial patterns traced by the virus. Understanding these patterns makes controlling the virus spread feasible, minimizes its impact in vulnerable regions, anticipates potential outbreaks, or elaborates predictive risk maps. The application of geospatial analysis to fine-grained data must be urgently adopted for optimal decision making in real and near-real time. However, some aspects related to process and map sensitive health data in emergency cases have not yet been sufficiently explored. Among them include concerns about how these datasets with sensitive information must be shown depending on aspects related to data aggregation, scaling, privacy issues, or the need to know in advance the particularities of the study area. In this paper, we introduce our experience in mapping fine-grained data related to the incidence of the COVID-19 during the first wave in the region of Galicia (NW Spain), and after that we discuss the mentioned aspects.},

ABSTRACT = {The continuous evolution of modern technology has led to the creation of increasingly complex and advanced systems. This has been also reflected in the technology of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), where the growing demand for more reliable performance necessitates the development of sophisticated techniques that provide fault diagnosis and fault tolerance in a timely and accurate manner. Typically, a UAV consists of three types of subsystems: actuators, main structure and sensors. Therefore, a fault-monitoring system must be specifically designed to supervise and debug each of these subsystems, so that any faults can be addressed before they lead to disastrous consequences. In this survey article, we provide a detailed overview of recent advances and studies regarding fault diagnosis, Fault-Tolerant Control (FTC) and anomaly detection for UAVs. Concerning fault diagnosis, our interest is mainly focused on sensors and actuators, as these subsystems are mostly prone to faults, while their healthy operation usually ensures the smooth and reliable performance of the aerial vehicle.},

ABSTRACT = {Facing the realistic demands of the application environment of robots, the application of simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) has gradually moved from static environments to complex dynamic environments, while traditional SLAM methods usually result in pose estimation deviations caused by errors in data association due to the interference of dynamic elements in the environment. This problem is effectively solved in the present study by proposing a SLAM approach based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) under semantic constraints in dynamic environments. Four main modules are used for the projection of point cloud data, semantic segmentation, dynamic element screening, and semantic map construction. A LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation network SANet based on a spatial attention mechanism is proposed, which significantly improves the real-time performance and accuracy of point cloud semantic segmentation. A dynamic element selection algorithm is designed and used with prior knowledge to significantly reduce the pose estimation deviations caused by SLAM dynamic elements. The results of experiments conducted on the public datasets SemanticKITTI, KITTI, and SemanticPOSS show that the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach are significantly improved.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, Sentinel-2 data were used for the retrieval of three key biophysical parameters of crops: leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and leaf water content (LWC) for dominant crop types in the Czech Republic, including winter wheat (Triticum aestivum), spring barley (Hordeum vulgare), winter rapeseed (Brassica napus subsp. napus), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), and corn (Zea mays subsp. Mays) in different stages of crop development. Artificial neural networks were applied in combination with an approach using look-up tables that is based on PROSAIL simulations to retrieve the biophysical properties tailored for each crop type. Crop-specific PROSAIL model optimization and validation were based upon a large dataset of in situ measurements collected in 2017 and 2018 in lowland of Central Bohemia region. For LCC and LAI, respectively, low relative root mean square error (rRMSE; 25%, 37%) was achieved. Additionally, a relatively strong correlation with in situ measurements (r = 0.80) was obtained for LAI. On the contrary, the results of the LWC parameter retrieval proved to be unsatisfactory. We have developed a generic tool for biophysical monitoring of agricultural crops based on the interpretation of Sentinel-2 satellite data by inversion of the radiation transfer model. The resulting crop condition maps can serve as precision agriculture inputs for selective fertilizer and irrigation application as well as for yield potential assessment.},

ABSTRACT = {Building change detection is a critical field for monitoring artificial structures using high-resolution multitemporal images. However, relief displacement depending on the azimuth and elevation angles of the sensor causes numerous false alarms and misdetections of building changes. Therefore, this study proposes an effective object-based building change detection method that considers azimuth and elevation angles of sensors in high-resolution images. To this end, segmentation images were generated using a multiresolution technique from high-resolution images after which object-based building detection was performed. For detecting building candidates, we calculated feature information that could describe building objects, such as rectangular fit, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) homogeneity, and area. Final building detection was then performed considering the location relationship between building objects and their shadows using the Sun’s azimuth angle. Subsequently, building change detection of final building objects was performed based on three methods considering the relationship of the building object properties between the images. First, only overlaying objects between images were considered to detect changes. Second, the size difference between objects according to the sensor’s elevation angle was considered to detect the building changes. Third, the direction between objects according to the sensor’s azimuth angle was analyzed to identify the building changes. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed object-based building change detection performance, two building density areas were selected as study sites. Site 1 was constructed using a single sensor of KOMPSAT-3 bitemporal images, whereas Site 2 consisted of multi-sensor images of KOMPSAT-3 and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The results from both sites revealed that considering additional shadow information showed more accurate building detection than using feature information only. Furthermore, the results of the three object-based change detections were compared and analyzed according to the characteristics of the study area and the sensors. Accuracy of the proposed object-based change detection results was achieved over the existing building detection methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The unsafe behavior of construction workers is one of the main causes of safety accidents at construction sites. To reduce the incidence of construction accidents and improve the safety performance of construction projects, there is a need to identify risky factors by monitoring the behavior of construction workers. Computer vision (CV) technology, which is a powerful and automated tool used for extracting images and video information from construction sites, has been recognized and adopted as an effective construction site monitoring technology for the identification of risky factors resulting from the unsafe behavior of construction workers. In this article, we introduce the research background of this field and conduct a systematic statistical analysis of the relevant literature in this field through the bibliometric analysis method. Thereafter, we adopt a content-based analysis method to depict the historical explorations in the field. On this basis, the limitations and challenges in this field are identified, and future research directions are proposed. It is found that CV technology can effectively monitor the unsafe behaviors of construction workers. The research findings can enhance people’s understanding of construction safety management.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) is essential for crop growth simulations and agricultural management. This study conducted a field experiment with rice and measured the LAI in different rice growth periods. The multispectral bands (B) including red edge (RE, 730 nm ± 16 nm), near-infrared (NIR, 840 nm ± 26 nm), green (560 nm ± 16 nm), red (650 nm ± 16 nm), blue (450 nm ± 16 nm), and visible light (RGB) were also obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with multispectral sensors (DJI-P4M, SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd.). Based on the bands, five vegetation indexes (VI) including Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Leaf Chlorophyll Index (LCI), Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Optimization Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) were calculated. The semi-empirical model (SEM), the random forest model (RF), and the Extreme Gradient Boosting model (XGBoost) were used to estimate rice LAI based on multispectral bands, VIs, and their combinations, respectively. The results indicated that the GNDVI had the highest accuracy in the SEM (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.77). For the single band, NIR had the highest accuracy in both RF (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.98) and XGBoost (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.88). Band combination of NIR + red improved the estimation accuracy in both RF (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.65) and XGBoost (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.63). NDRE and LCI were the first two single VIs for LAI estimation using both RF and XGBoost. However, putting more than one VI together could only increase the LAI estimation accuracy slightly. Meanwhile, the bands + VIs combinations could improve the accuracy in both RF and XGBoost. Our study recommended estimating rice LAI by a combination of red + NIR + OSAVI + NDVI + GNDVI + LCI + NDRE (2B + 5V) with XGBoost to obtain high accuracy and overcome the potential over-fitting issue (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.54).},

ABSTRACT = {High-resolution images obtained by multispectral cameras mounted on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are helping to capture the heterogeneity of the environment in images that can be discretized in categories during a classification process. Currently, there is an increasing use of supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers to retrieve accurate results using scarce datasets with samples with non-linear relationships. We compared the accuracies of two ML classifiers using a pixel and object analysis approach in six coastal wetland sites. The results show that the Random Forest (RF) performs better than K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in the classification of pixels and objects and the classification based on pixel analysis is slightly better than the object-based analysis. The agreement between the classifications of objects and pixels is higher in Random Forest. This is likely due to the heterogeneity of the study areas, where pixel-based classifications are most appropriate. In addition, from an ecological perspective, as these wetlands are heterogeneous, the pixel-based classification reflects a more realistic interpretation of plant community distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {Cloud, one of the poor atmospheric conditions, significantly reduces the usability of optical remote-sensing data and hampers follow-up applications. Thus, the identification of cloud remains a priority for various remote-sensing activities, such as product retrieval, land-use/cover classification, object detection, and especially for change detection. However, the complexity of clouds themselves make it difficult to detect thin clouds and small isolated clouds. To accurately detect clouds in satellite imagery, we propose a novel neural network named the Pyramid Contextual Network (PCNet). Considering the limited applicability of a regular convolution kernel, we employed a Dilated Residual Block (DRB) to extend the receptive field of the network, which contains a dilated convolution and residual connection. To improve the detection ability for thin clouds, the proposed new model, pyramid contextual block (PCB), was used to generate global information at different scales. FengYun-3D MERSI-II remote-sensing images covering China with 14,165 × 24,659 pixels, acquired on 17 July 2019, are processed to conduct cloud-detection experiments. Experimental results show that the overall precision rates of the trained network reach 97.1% and the overall recall rates reach 93.2%, which performs better both in quantity and quality than U-Net, UNet++, UNet3+, PSPNet and DeepLabV3+.},

ABSTRACT = {Urbanization is persistent globally and has increasingly significant spatial and environmental consequences. It is especially challenging in developing countries due to the increasing pressure on the limited resources, and damage to the bio-physical environment. Traditional analytical methods of studying the urban land use dynamics associated with urbanization are static and tend to rely on top-down approaches, such as linear and mathematical modeling. These traditional approaches do not capture the nonlinear properties of land use change. New technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have made it possible to model and predict the nonlinear aspects of urban land dynamics. AI and ML are programmed to recognize patterns and carry out predictions, decision making and perform operations with speed and accuracy. Classification, analysis and modeling using earth observation-based data forms the basis for the geospatial support for land use planning. In the process of achieving higher accuracies in the classification of spatial data, ML algorithms are being developed and being improved to enhance the decision-making process. The purpose of the research is to bring out the various ML algorithms and statistical models that have been applied to study aspects of land use planning using earth observation-based data (EO). It intends to review their performance, functional requirements, interoperability requirements and for which research problems can they be applied best. The literature review revealed that random forest (RF), deep learning like convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are best suited for classification and pattern analysis of earth observation-based data. GANs (generative adversarial networks) have been used to simulate urban patterns. Algorithms like cellular automata, spatial logistic regression and agent-based modeling have been used for studying urban growth, land use change and settlement pattern analysis. Most of the papers reviewed applied ML algorithms for classification of EO data and to study urban growth and land use change. It is observed that hybrid approaches have better performance in terms of accuracies, efficiency and computational cost.},

ABSTRACT = {Buildings can be introduced as a fundamental element for forming a city. Therefore, up-to-date building maps have become vital for many applications, including urban mapping and urban expansion analysis. With the development of deep learning, segmenting building footprints from high-resolution remote sensing imagery has become a subject of intense study. Here, a modified version of the U-Net architecture with a combination of pre- and post-processing techniques was developed to extract building footprints from high-resolution aerial imagery and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. Data pre-processing with the logarithmic correction image enhancing algorithm showed the most significant improvement in the building detection accuracy for aerial images; meanwhile, the CLAHE algorithm improved the most concerning UAV images. This study developed a post-processing technique using polygonizing and polygon smoothing called the Douglas–Peucker algorithm, which made the building output directly ready to use for different applications. The attribute information, land use data, and population count data were applied using two open datasets. In addition, the building area and perimeter of each building were calculated as geometric attributes.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper conducts a rigorous analysis for the problem of robust tensor completion, which aims at recovering an unknown three-way tensor from incomplete observations corrupted by gross sparse outliers and small dense noises simultaneously due to various reasons such as sensor dead pixels, communication loss, electromagnetic interferences, cloud shadows, etc. To estimate the underlying tensor, a new penalized least squares estimator is first formulated by exploiting the low rankness of the signal tensor within the framework of tensor ∗L-Singular Value Decomposition (∗L-SVD) and leveraging the sparse structure of the outlier tensor. Then, an algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is designed to compute the estimator in an efficient way. Statistically, the non-asymptotic upper bound on the estimation error is established and further proved to be optimal (up to a log factor) in a minimax sense. Simulation studies on synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed error bound can predict the scaling behavior of the estimation error with problem parameters (i.e., tubal rank of the underlying tensor, sparsity of the outliers, and the number of uncorrupted observations). Both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are evaluated through experiments for robust completion on seven different types of remote sensing data.},

ABSTRACT = {Seagrass meadows are globally important habitats, protecting shorelines, providing nursery areas for fish, and sequestering carbon. However, both anthropogenic and natural environmental stressors have led to a worldwide reduction seagrass habitats. For purposes of management and restoration, it is essential to produce accurate maps of seagrass meadows over a variety of spatial scales, resolutions, and at temporal frequencies ranging from months to years. Satellite remote sensing has been successfully employed to produce maps of seagrass in the past, but turbid waters and difficulty in obtaining low-tide scenes pose persistent challenges. This study builds on an increased availability of affordable high temporal frequency imaging platforms, using seasonal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys of seagrass extent at the meadow scale, to inform machine learning classifications of satellite imagery of a 40 km2 bay. We find that object-based image analysis is suitable to detect seasonal trends in seagrass extent from UAV imagery and find that trends vary between individual meadows at our study site Bahía de San Quintín, Baja California, México, during our study period in 2019. We further suggest that compositing multiple satellite imagery classifications into a seagrass probability map allows for an estimation of seagrass extent in turbid waters and report that in 2019, seagrass covered 2324 ha of Bahía de San Quintín, indicating a recovery from losses reported for previous decades.},

ABSTRACT = {The commercialization of synthetic auxin-resistant crops and the commensurate increase in post-emergent auxin-mimic herbicide applications has resulted in millions of hectares of injury to sensitive soybeans in the United States since 2016. Visual yield loss estimations following auxin injury can be difficult. The goal of this research was to determine if spectral variations following auxin injury to soybean allow for more precise yield loss estimations. Identical field experiments were performed in 2018, 2019, and 2020 in Columbia, Missouri to compare the ability of established vegetative indices to differentiate between exposure levels of 2,4-D and dicamba in soybean and predict yield loss. Soybeans were planted at three timings for growth stage separation and were exposed to sublethal rates of 2,4-D and dicamba at the R2, R1, and V3 growth stages. A UAV-mounted multispectral sensor was flown over the trial 14 days after the herbicide treatments. The results of this research found that vegetative indices incorporating the red-edge wavelength were more consistent in estimating yield loss than indices comprised of only visible or NIR wavelengths. Yield loss estimations became difficult when soybean injury occurred during later reproductive stages when soybean biomass was increased. This research also determined that when injury occurs to soybean in vegetative growth stages late in the growing season there is a greater likelihood for yield loss to occur due to decreased time for recovery. The results of this research could provide direction for more objective and accurate evaluations of yield loss following synthetic auxin injury than what is currently available.},

ABSTRACT = {In industrial processes, the microtechnology concept refers to the operation of small devices that integrate the elements of operational and reaction units to save energy and space. The advancement of knowledge in the field of microfluidics has resulted in fabricating devices with different applications in micro and nanoscales. Micro- and nano-devices can provide energy-efficient systems due to their high thermal performance. Fluid flow in microchannels and microstructures has been widely considered by researchers in the last two decades. In this paper, a review study on fluid flow within microstructures is performed. The present study aims to present the results obtained in previous studies on this type of system. First, different types of flows in microchannels are examined. The present article will then review previous articles and present a general summary in each section. Then, the multi-phase flows inside the microchannels are discussed, and the flows inside the micropumps, microturbines, and micromixers are evaluated. According to the literature review, it is found that the use of microstructures enhances energy efficiency. The results of previous investigations revealed that the use of nanofluids as a working fluid in microstructures improves energy efficiency. Previous studies have demonstrated special attention to the design aspects of microchannels and micro-devices compared to other design strategies to improve their performance. Finally, general concluding remarks are presented, and the existing challenges in the use of these devices and suggestions for future investigations are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Detection of small moving objects in long range infrared (IR) videos is challenging due to background clutter, air turbulence, and small target size. In this paper, we present two unsupervised, modular, and flexible frameworks to detect small moving targets. The key idea was inspired by change detection (CD) algorithms where frame differences can help detect motions. Our frameworks consist of change detection, small target detection, and some post-processing algorithms such as image denoising and dilation. Extensive experiments using actual long range mid-wave infrared (MWIR) videos with target distances beyond 3500 m from the camera demonstrated that one approach, using Local Intensity Gradient (LIG) only once in the workflow, performed better than the other, which used LIG in two places, in a 3500 m video, but slightly worse in 4000 m and 5000 m videos. Moreover, we also investigated the use of synthetic bands for target detection and observed promising results for 4000 m and 5000 m videos. Finally, a comparative study with two conventional methods demonstrated that our proposed scheme has comparable performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The digital documentation of cultural relics plays an important role in archiving, protection, and management. In the field of cultural heritage, three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data is effective at expressing complex geometric structures and geometric details on the surface of cultural relics, but lacks semantic information. To elaborate the geometric information of cultural relics and add meaningful semantic information, we propose a modeling and processing method of smart point clouds of cultural relics with complex geometries. An information modeling framework for complex geometric cultural relics was designed based on the concept of smart point clouds, in which 3D point cloud data are organized through the time dimension and different spatial scales indicating different geometric details. The proposed model allows smart point clouds or a subset to be linked with semantic information or related documents. As such, this novel information modeling framework can be used to describe rich semantic information and high-level details of geometry. The proposed information model not only expresses the complex geometric structure of the cultural relics and the geometric details on the surface, but also has rich semantic information, and can even be associated with documents. A case study of the Dazu Thousand-Hand Bodhisattva Statue, which is characterized by a variety of complex geometries, reveals that our proposed framework is capable of modeling and processing the statue with excellent applicability and expansibility. This work provides insights into the sustainable development of cultural heritage protection globally.},

ABSTRACT = {Salient object detection represents a novel preprocessing stage of many practical image applications in the discipline of computer vision. Saliency detection is generally a complex process to copycat the human vision system in the processing of color images. It is a convoluted process because of the existence of countless properties inherent in color images that can hamper performance. Due to diversified color image properties, a method that is appropriate for one category of images may not necessarily be suitable for others. The selection of image abstraction is a decisive preprocessing step in saliency computation and region-based image abstraction has become popular because of its computational efficiency and robustness. However, the performances of the existing region-based salient object detection methods are extremely hooked on the selection of an optimal region granularity. The incorrect selection of region granularity is potentially prone to under- or over-segmentation of color images, which can lead to a non-uniform highlighting of salient objects. In this study, the method of color histogram clustering was utilized to automatically determine suitable homogenous regions in an image. Region saliency score was computed as a function of color contrast, contrast ratio, spatial feature, and center prior. Morphological operations were ultimately performed to eliminate the undesirable artifacts that may be present at the saliency detection stage. Thus, we have introduced a novel, simple, robust, and computationally efficient color histogram clustering method that agglutinates color contrast, contrast ratio, spatial feature, and center prior for detecting salient objects in color images. Experimental validation with different categories of images selected from eight benchmarked corpora has indicated that the proposed method outperforms 30 bottom-up non-deep learning and seven top-down deep learning salient object detection methods based on the standard performance metrics.},

ABSTRACT = {Terrestrial features extraction, such as roads and buildings from aerial images using an automatic system, has many usages in an extensive range of fields, including disaster management, change detection, land cover assessment, and urban planning. This task is commonly tough because of complex scenes, such as urban scenes, where buildings and road objects are surrounded by shadows, vehicles, trees, etc., which appear in heterogeneous forms with lower inter-class and higher intra-class contrasts. Moreover, such extraction is time-consuming and expensive to perform by human specialists manually. Deep convolutional models have displayed considerable performance for feature segmentation from remote sensing data in the recent years. However, for the large and continuous area of obstructions, most of these techniques still cannot detect road and building well. Hence, this work’s principal goal is to introduce two novel deep convolutional models based on UNet family for multi-object segmentation, such as roads and buildings from aerial imagery. We focused on buildings and road networks because these objects constitute a huge part of the urban areas. The presented models are called multi-level context gating UNet (MCG-UNet) and bi-directional ConvLSTM UNet model (BCL-UNet). The proposed methods have the same advantages as the UNet model, the mechanism of densely connected convolutions, bi-directional ConvLSTM, and squeeze and excitation module to produce the segmentation maps with a high resolution and maintain the boundary information even under complicated backgrounds. Additionally, we implemented a basic efficient loss function called boundary-aware loss (BAL) that allowed a network to concentrate on hard semantic segmentation regions, such as overlapping areas, small objects, sophisticated objects, and boundaries of objects, and produce high-quality segmentation maps. The presented networks were tested on the Massachusetts building and road datasets. The MCG-UNet improved the average F1 accuracy by 1.85%, and 1.19% and 6.67% and 5.11% compared with UNet and BCL-UNet for road and building extraction, respectively. Additionally, the presented MCG-UNet and BCL-UNet networks were compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning-based networks, and the results proved the superiority of the networks in multi-object segmentation tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Urbanization can induce environmental changes such as the urban heat island effect, which in turn influence the terrestrial ecosystem. However, the effect of urbanization on the phenology of subtropical vegetation remains relatively unexplored. This study analyzed the changing trend of vegetation photosynthetic phenology in Dongting Lake basin, China, and its response to urbanization using nighttime light and chlorophyll fluorescence datasets. Our results indicated the start of the growing season (SOS) of vegetation in the study area was significantly advanced by 0.70 days per year, whereas the end of the growing season (EOS) was delayed by 0.24 days per year during 2000–2017. We found that urbanization promoted the SOS advance and EOS delay. With increasing urbanization intensity, the sensitivity of SOS to urbanization firstly increased then decreased, while the sensitivity of EOS to urbanization decreased with urbanization intensity. The climate sensitivity of vegetation phenology varied with urbanization intensity; urbanization induced an earlier SOS by increasing preseason minimum temperatures and a later EOS by increasing preseason precipitation. These findings improve our understanding of the vegetation phenology response to urbanization in subtropical regions and highlight the need to integrate human activities into future vegetation phenology models.},

ABSTRACT = {Relating ground photographs to UAV orthomosaics is a key linkage required for accurate multi-scaled lichen mapping. Conventional methods of multi-scaled lichen mapping, such as random forest models and convolutional neural networks, heavily rely on pixel DN values for classification. However, the limited spectral range of ground photos requires additional characteristics to differentiate lichen from spectrally similar objects, such as bright logs. By applying a neural network to tiles of a UAV orthomosaics, additional characteristics, such as surface texture and spatial patterns, can be used for inferences. Our methodology used a neural network (UAV LiCNN) trained on ground photo mosaics to predict lichen in UAV orthomosaic tiles. The UAV LiCNN achieved mean user and producer accuracies of 85.84% and 92.93%, respectively, in the high lichen class across eight different orthomosaics. We compared the known lichen percentages found in 77 vegetation microplots with the predicted lichen percentage calculated from the UAV LiCNN, resulting in a R2 relationship of 0.6910. This research shows that AI models trained on ground photographs effectively classify lichen in UAV orthomosaics. Limiting factors include the misclassification of spectrally similar objects to lichen in the RGB bands and dark shadows cast by vegetation.},

ABSTRACT = {The negative climate change induced by rapid urbanization has become a global environmental issue. Numerous studies have been devoted to microclimate regulation functions performed by urban vegetation. Digital city information modeling provides a powerful tool for various simulations and data analytics for the sustainable development of urban areas. However, the method reconstructing urban trees is still in its early stage compared to the relatively mature building modeling. Most prior studies on tree reconstruction focused on retrieving geometric features, while other factors related to urban microclimate simulation were rarely addressed. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review and in-depth analysis covering two distinct research directions in relation to urban microclimate simulation. The first one is set on the identification of key factors related to trees’ impact on urban microclimate. The second one is dedicated to approaches for three-dimensional (3D) tree reconstruction. Based on the findings, the paper identifies information including trees’ geometric, physiological characteristics and relation to the surroundings required for 3D tree reconstruction in the context of urban microclimate simulation, and further assesses the potential of the 3D tree reconstruction approaches to accommodate these pieces of information. An appropriate 3D tree reconstruction approach, which allows for the supply of the required information for urban microclimate simulation, is recommended.},

ABSTRACT = {Image classification of a visual scene based on visibility is significant due to the rise in readily available automated solutions. Currently, there are only two known spectrums of image visibility i.e., dark, and bright. However, normal environments include semi-dark scenarios. Hence, visual extremes that will lead to the accurate extraction of image features should be duly discarded. Fundamentally speaking there are two broad methods to perform visual scene-based image classification, i.e., machine learning (ML) methods and computer vision methods. In ML, the issues of insufficient data, sophisticated hardware and inadequate image classifier training time remain significant problems to be handled. These techniques fail to classify the visual scene-based images with high accuracy. The other alternative is computer vision (CV) methods, which also have major issues. CV methods do provide some basic procedures which may assist in such classification but, to the best of our knowledge, no CV algorithm exists to perform such classification, i.e., these do not account for semi-dark images in the first place. Moreover, these methods do not provide a well-defined protocol to calculate images’ content visibility and thereby classify images. One of the key algorithms for calculation of images’ content visibility is backed by the HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color model. The HSL color model allows the visibility calculation of a scene by calculating the lightness/luminance of a single pixel. Recognizing the high potential of the HSL color model, we propose a novel framework relying on the simple approach of the statistical manipulation of an entire image’s pixel intensities, represented by HSL color model. The proposed algorithm, namely, Relative Perceived Luminance Classification (RPLC) uses the HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color model to correctly identify the luminosity values of the entire image. Our findings prove that the proposed method yields high classification accuracy (over 78%) with a small error rate. We show that the computational complexity of RPLC is much less than that of the state-of-the-art ML algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Pixels, blocks (i.e., grouping of pixels), and polygons are the fundamental choices for use as assessment units for validating per-pixel image classification. Previous research conducted by the authors of this paper focused on the analysis of the impact of positional accuracy when using a single pixel for thematic accuracy assessment. The research described here provided a similar analysis, but the blocks of contiguous pixels were chosen as the assessment unit for thematic validation. The goal of this analysis was to assess the impact of positional errors on the thematic assessment. Factors including the size of a block, labeling threshold, landscape characteristics, spatial scale, and classification schemes were also considered. The results demonstrated that using blocks as an assessment unit reduced the thematic errors caused by positional errors to under 10% for most global land-cover mapping projects and most remote-sensing applications achieving a half-pixel registration. The larger the block size, the more the positional error was reduced. However, there are practical limitations to the size of the block. More classes in a classification scheme and higher heterogeneity increased the positional effect. The choice of labeling threshold depends on the spatial scale and landscape characteristics to balance the number of abandoned units and positional impact. This research suggests using the block of pixels as an assessment unit in the thematic accuracy assessment in future applications.},

ABSTRACT = {A strip of 20th-century landscape woodland planted alongside a 17th to mid-18th century ancient and semi-natural woodland (ASNW) was investigated by applied aerial spectroscopy using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a multispectral image camera (MSI). A simple classification approach of normalized difference spectral index (NDSI), derived using principal component analysis (PCA), enabled the identification of the non-native trees within the 20th-century boundary. The tree species within this boundary, classified by NDSI, were further segmented by the machine learning segmentation method of k-means clustering. This combined innovative approach has enabled the identification of multiple tree species in the 20th-century boundary. Phenotyping of trees at canopy level using the UAV with MSI, across 8052 m2, identified black pine (23%), Norway maple (19%), Scots pine (12%), and sycamore (19%) as well as native trees (oak and silver birch, 27%). This derived data was corroborated by field identification at ground-level, over an area of 6785 m2, that confirmed the presence of black pine (26%), Norway maple (30%), Scots pine (10%), and sycamore (14%) as well as other trees (oak and silver birch, 20%). The benefits of using a UAV, with an MSI camera, for monitoring tree boundaries next to a new housing development are demonstrated.},

This variability affects not only the operational performance of the wind power system, but can also affect its integrity under service conditions. Condition monitoring continues to play an important role in achieving reliable and economic operation of wind turbines. This paper reviews the current advances in wind turbine condition monitoring, ranging from conventional condition monitoring and signal processing tools to machine-learning-based condition monitoring and usage of big data mining for predictive maintenance. A systematic review is presented of signal-based and data-driven modeling methodologies using intelligent and machine learning approaches, with the view to providing a critical evaluation of the recent developments in this area, and their applications in diagnosis, prognosis, health assessment, and predictive maintenance of wind turbines and farms.},

ABSTRACT = {Tropical forests are a key component of the global carbon cycle and climate change mitigation. Field- or LiDAR-based approaches enable reliable measurements of the structure and above-ground biomass (AGB) of tropical forests. Data derived from digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform offer several advantages over field- and LiDAR-based approaches in terms of scale and efficiency, and DAP has been presented as a viable and economical alternative in boreal or deciduous forests. However, detecting with DAP the ground in dense tropical forests, which is required for the estimation of canopy height, is currently considered highly challenging. To address this issue, we present a generally applicable method that is based on machine learning methods to identify the forest floor in DAP-derived point clouds of dense tropical forests. We capitalize on the DAP-derived high-resolution vertical forest structure to inform ground detection. We conducted UAV-DAP surveys combined with field inventories in the tropical forest of the Congo Basin. Using airborne LiDAR (ALS) for ground truthing, we present a canopy height model (CHM) generation workflow that constitutes the detection, classification and interpolation of ground points using a combination of local minima filters, supervised machine learning algorithms and TIN densification for classifying ground points using spectral and geometrical features from the UAV-based 3D data. We demonstrate that our DAP-based method provides estimates of tree heights that are identical to LiDAR-based approaches (conservatively estimated NSE = 0.88, RMSE = 1.6 m). An external validation shows that our method is capable of providing accurate and precise estimates of tree heights and AGB in dense tropical forests (DAP vs. field inventories of old forest: r2 = 0.913, RMSE = 31.93 Mg ha−1). Overall, this study demonstrates that the application of cheap and easily deployable UAV-DAP platforms can be deployed without expert knowledge to generate biophysical information and advance the study and monitoring of dense tropical forests.},

ABSTRACT = {Remotely sensed imagery has been used to support forest ecology and management for decades. In modern times, the propagation of high-spatial-resolution image analysis techniques and automated workflows have further strengthened this synergy, leading to the inquiry into more complex, local-scale, ecosystem characteristics. To appropriately inform decisions in forestry ecology and management, the most reliable and efficient methods should be adopted. For this reason, our research compares visual interpretation to digital (automated) processing for forest plot composition and individual tree identification. During this investigation, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the process of classifying species groups within complex, mixed-species forests in New England. This analysis included a comparison of three high-resolution remotely sensed imagery sources: Google Earth, National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery, and unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery. We discovered that, although the level of detail afforded by the UAS imagery spatial resolution (3.02 cm average pixel size) improved the visual interpretation results (7.87–9.59%), the highest thematic accuracy was still only 54.44% for the generalized composition groups. Our qualitative analysis of the uncertainty for visually interpreting different composition classes revealed the persistence of mislabeled hardwood compositions (including an early successional class) and an inability to consistently differentiate between ‘pure’ and ‘mixed’ stands. The results of digitally classifying the same forest compositions produced a higher level of accuracy for both detecting individual trees (93.9%) and labeling them (59.62–70.48%) using machine learning algorithms including classification and regression trees, random forest, and support vector machines. These results indicate that digital, automated, classification produced an increase in overall accuracy of 16.04% over visual interpretation for generalized forest composition classes. Other studies, which incorporate multitemporal, multispectral, or data fusion approaches provide evidence for further widening this gap. Further refinement of the methods for individual tree detection, delineation, and classification should be developed for structurally and compositionally complex forests to supplement the critical deficiency in local-scale forest information around the world.},

ABSTRACT = {A landslide is a significant environmental hazard that results in an enormous loss of lives and properties. Studies have revealed that rainfall, soil characteristics, and human errors, such as deforestation, are the leading causes of landslides, reducing soil water infiltration and increasing the water runoff of a slope. This paper introduces vegetation establishment as a low-cost, practical measure for slope reinforcement through the ground cover and the root of the vegetation. This study reveals the level of complexity of the terrain with regards to the evaluation of high and low stability areas and has produced a landslide susceptibility map. For this purpose, 12 conditioning factors, namely slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, hill shade, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), terrain roughness index (TRI), distances to roads, distance to lakes, distance to trees, and build-up, were used through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model to produce landslide susceptibility map. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was used for validation of the results. The area under the curve (AUC) values obtained from the ROC method for the AHP model was 0.865. Four seed samples, namely ryegrass, rye corn, signal grass, and couch, were hydroseeded to determine the vegetation root and ground cover’s effectiveness on stabilization and reinforcement on a high-risk susceptible 65° slope between August and December 2020. The observed monthly vegetation root of couch grass gave the most acceptable result. With a spreading and creeping vegetation ground cover characteristic, ryegrass showed the most acceptable monthly result for vegetation ground cover effectiveness. The findings suggest that the selection of couch species over other species is justified based on landslide control benefits.},

In the agricultural sector, many recent visual-computer approaches use deep-learning models. In this approach, a novel predictive analytics methodology to identify Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) and Pepper Huasteco Yellow Vein Virus (PHYVV) visual symptoms on Jalapeño pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) leaves by using image-processing and deep-learning classification models is presented. The proposed image-processing approach is based on the utilization of Normalized Red-Blue Vegetation Index (NRBVI) and Normalized Green-Blue Vegetation Index (NGBVI) as new RGB-based vegetation indices, and its subsequent Jet pallet colored version NRBVI-Jet NGBVI-Jet as pre-processing algorithms. Furthermore, four standard pre-trained deep-learning architectures, Visual Geometry Group-16 (VGG-16), Xception, Inception v3, and MobileNet v2, were implemented for classification purposes. The objective of this methodology was to find the most accurate combination of vegetation index pre-processing algorithms and pre-trained deep- learning classification models. Transfer learning was applied to fine tune the pre-trained deep- learning models and data augmentation was also applied to prevent the models from overfitting. The performance of the models was evaluated using Top-1 accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using test data. The results showed that the best model was an Xception-based model that uses the NGBVI dataset. This model reached an average Top-1 test accuracy of 98.3%. A complete analysis of the different vegetation index representations using models based on deep-learning architectures is presented along with the study of the learning curves of these deep-learning models during the training phase.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) provide two main functions with regards to bridge inspections: (1) high-quality digital imaging to detect element defects; (2) spatial point cloud data for the reconstruction of 3D asset models. With UAS being a relatively new inspection method, there is little in the way of existing framework for storing, processing and managing the resulting inspection data. This study has proposed a novel methodology for a digital information model covering data acquisition through to a 3D GIS visualisation environment, also capable of integrating within a bridge management system (BMS). Previous efforts focusing on visualisation functionality have focused on BIM and GIS as separate entities, which has a number of problems associated with it. This methodology has a core focus on the integration of BIM and GIS, providing an effective and efficient information model, which provides vital visual context to inspectors and users of the BMS. Three-dimensional GIS visualisation allows the user to navigate through a fully interactive environment, where element level inspection information can be obtained through point-and-click operations on the 3D structural model. Two visualisation environments were created: a web-based GIS application and a desktop solution. Both environments develop a fully interactive, user-friendly model which have fulfilled the aims of coordinating and streamlining the BMS process.},

ABSTRACT = {As the human population increases, land cover is converted from vegetation to urban development, causing increased runoff from precipitation events. Additional runoff leads to more frequent and more intense floods. In urban areas, these flood events are often catastrophic due to infrastructure built along the riverbank and within the floodplains. Sufficient data allow for flood modeling used to implement proper warning signals and evacuation plans, however, in least developed countries (LDC), the lack of field data for precipitation and river flows makes hydrologic and hydraulic modeling difficult. Within the most recent data revolution, the availability of remotely sensed data for land use/land cover (LULC), flood mapping, and precipitation estimates has increased, however, flood mapping in urban areas of LDC is still limited due to low resolution of remotely sensed data (LULC, soil properties, and terrain), cloud cover, and the lack of field data for model calibration. This study utilizes remotely sensed precipitation, LULC, soil properties, and digital elevation model data to estimate peak discharge and map simulated flood extents of urban rivers in ungauged watersheds for current and future LULC scenarios. A normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) analysis was proposed to predict a future LULC. Additionally, return period precipitation events were calculated using the theoretical extreme value distribution approach with two remotely sensed precipitation datasets. Three calculation methods for peak discharge (curve number and lag method, curve number and graphical TR-55 method, and the rational equation) were performed and compared to a separate Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) analysis to determine the method that best represents urban rivers. HEC-RAS was then used to map the simulated flood extents from the peak discharges and ArcGIS helped to determine infrastructure and population affected by the floods. Finally, the simulated flood extents from HEC-RAS were compared to historic flood event points, images of flood events, and global surface water maximum water extent data. This analysis indicates that where field data are absent, remotely sensed monthly precipitation data from Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) where GPM is the Global Precipitation Mission can be used with the curve number and lag method to approximate peak discharges and input into HEC-RAS to represent the simulated flood extents experienced. This work contains a case study for seven urban rivers in Freetown, Sierra Leone.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting wildfire behavior is a complex task that has historically relied on empirical models. Physics-based fire models could improve predictions and have broad applicability, but these models require more detailed inputs, including spatially explicit estimates of fuel characteristics. One of the most critical of these characteristics is fuel moisture. Obtaining moisture measurements with traditional destructive sampling techniques can be prohibitively time-consuming and extremely limited in spatial resolution. This study seeks to assess how effectively moisture in grasses can be estimated using reflectance in six wavelengths in the visible and infrared ranges. One hundred twenty 1 m-square field samples were collected in a western Washington grassland as well as overhead imagery in six wavelengths for the same area. Predictive models of vegetation moisture using existing vegetation indices and components from principal component analysis of the wavelengths were generated and compared. The best model, a linear model based on principal components and biomass, showed modest predictive power (r² = 0.45). This model performed better for the plots with both dominant grass species pooled than it did for each species individually. The presence of this correlation, especially given the limited moisture range of this study, suggests that further research using samples across the entire fire season could potentially produce effective models for estimating moisture in this type of ecosystem using unmanned aerial vehicles, even when more than one major species of grass is present. This approach would be a fast and flexible approach compared to traditional moisture measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {Field studies were conducted in 2016 and 2017 to determine if multispectral imagery collected from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a five-band sensor could successfully identify Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) infestations of various densities growing among soybeans (Glycine max [L.] Merr.). The multispectral sensor captures imagery from five wavebands: 475 (blue), 560 (green), 668 (red), 840 (near infrared [NIR]), and 717 nm (red-edge). Image analysis was performed to examine the spectral properties of discrete Palmer amaranth and soybean plants at various weed densities using these wavebands. Additionally, imagery was subjected to supervised classification to evaluate the usefulness of classification as a tool to differentiate the two species in a field setting. Date was a significant factor influencing the spectral reflectance values of the Palmer amaranth densities. The effects of altitude on reflectance were less clear and were dependent on band and density being evaluated. The near infrared (NIR) waveband offered the best resolution in separating Palmer amaranth densities. Spectral separability in the other wavebands was less defined, although low weed densities were consistently able to be discriminated from high densities. Palmer amaranth and soybean were found to be spectrally distinct regardless of imaging date, weed density, or waveband. Soybean exhibited overall lower reflectance intensity than Palmer amaranth across all wavebands. The reflectance of both species within blue, green, red, and red-edge wavebands declined as the season progressed, while reflectance in NIR increased. Near infrared and red-edge wavebands were shown to be the most useful for species discrimination and maintained their utility at most weed densities. Palmer amaranth weed densities were found to be spectrally distinct from one another in all wavebands, with greatest distinction when using the red, NIR and red-edge wavebands. Supervised classification in a two-class system was consistently able to discriminate between Palmer amaranth and soybean with at least 80% overall accuracy. The incorporation of a weed density component into these classifications introduced an error of 65% or greater into these classifications. Reducing the number of classes in a supervised classification system could improve the accuracy of discriminating between Palmer amaranth and soybean.},

ABSTRACT = {Omics technologies, namely genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics, are becoming an integral part of virtually every commercial cereal crop breeding program, as they provide substantial dividends per unit time in both pre-breeding and breeding phases. Continuous advances in omics assure time efficiency and cost benefits to improve cereal crops. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the established omics methods in five major cereals, namely rice, sorghum, maize, barley, and bread wheat. We cover the evolution of technologies in each omics section independently and concentrate on their use to improve economically important agronomic as well as biotic and abiotic stress-related traits. Advancements in the (1) identification, mapping, and sequencing of molecular/structural variants; (2) high-density transcriptomics data to study gene expression patterns; (3) global and targeted proteome profiling to study protein structure and interaction; (4) metabolomic profiling to quantify organ-level, small-density metabolites, and their composition; and (5) high-resolution, high-throughput, image-based phenomics approaches are surveyed in this review.},

ABSTRACT = {Magnetometers measure the local magnetic field and are present in most modern inertial measurement units (IMUs). Readings from magnetometers are used to identify Earth’s Magnetic North outdoors, but are often ignored during indoor experiments since the magnetic field does not behave how most expect. This paper presents methods to create, validate, and visualize three-dimensional magnetic field maps to expand the use of magnetic fields as a sensing modality for navigation. The utility of these maps is measured in their ability to accurately represent the magnetic field and to enable dynamic attitude estimation. In experiments with motion capture truth data, a small multicopter with three-axis inertial measurements, including magnetometer, traversed five flight profiles distinctly exciting roll, pitch, and yaw motion to provide interesting trajectories for attitude estimation. Indoor experimental results were compared to those outdoors to emphasize how spatial variation in the magnetic field drives the need for our mapping techniques. Our work presents a new way of visualizing 3D magnetic fields, which allows users to better reason about the magnetic field in their workspace. Next, we show that magnetic field maps generated from coverage patterns are generally more accurate, but training such maps using observations from desired flight paths is sufficient in the vicinity of these paths. All training sets were interpolated using Gaussian process regression (GPR), which yielded maps with &lt;1 μT of error when interpolating between and extrapolating outside of observed locations. Finally, we validated the utility of our GPR-based maps in enabling attitude estimates in regions of high magnetic field spatial variation with experimental data.},

ABSTRACT = {The evolution of dryland pasture quality is closely related to the seasonal and inter-annual variability characteristic of the Mediterranean climate. This variability introduces great unpredictability in the dynamic management of animal grazing. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of two complementary tools (satellite images, Sentinel-2 and proximal optical sensor, OptRx) for the calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), to monitor in a timely manner indicators of pasture quality (moisture content, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber). In two consecutive years (2018/2019 and 2019/2020) these tools were evaluated in six fields representative of dryland pastures in the Alentejo region, in Portugal. The results show a significant correlation between pasture quality degradation index (PQDI) and NDVI measured by remote sensing (R2 = 0.82) and measured by proximal optical sensor (R2 = 0.83). These technological tools can potentially make an important contribution to decision making and to the management of livestock production. The complementarity of these two approaches makes it possible to overcome the limitations of satellite images that result (i) from the interference of clouds (which occurs frequently throughout the pasture vegetative cycle) and (ii) from the interference of tree canopy, an important layer of the Montado ecosystem. This work opens perspectives to explore new solutions in the field of Precision Agriculture technologies based on spectral reflectance to respond to the challenges of economic and environmental sustainability of extensive livestock production systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Soil salinization process is a complex non-linear dynamic evolution. To classify a system with this type of non-linear characteristic, this study proposed a mixed master/slave chaotic system based on Chua’s circuit and a fractional-order Chen-Lee chaotic system to classify soil salinization level. The subject is the soil in Xinjiang with different levels of human interference. A fractional-order Chen-Lee chaotic system was constructed, and the spectral signal processed by the Chua’s non-linear circuit was substituted into the master/slave chaotic system. The chaotic dynamic errors with different fractional orders were calculated. The comparative analysis showed that 0.1-order has the largest chaotic dynamic error change, which produced two distinct and divergent results. Thus, this study converted the chaotic dynamic errors of fractional 0.1-order into chaotic attractors to build an extension matter-element model. Finally, we compared the soil salt contents (SSC) from the laboratory chemical analysis with the results of the extension theory classification. The comparison showed that the combination of fractional order mixed master/slave chaotic system and extension theory has high classification accuracy for soil salinization level. The results of this system match the result of the chemical analysis. The classification accuracy of the calibration set data was 100%, and the classification accuracy of the validation set data was 90%. This method is the first use of the mixed master/slave chaotic system in this field and can satisfy certain soil salinization monitoring needs as well as promote the application of the chaotic system in soil salinization monitoring.},

ABSTRACT = {The detection of building edges from very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery is essential to various geo-related applications, including surveying and mapping, urban management, etc. Recently, the rapid development of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) has achieved remarkable progress in edge detection; however, there has always been the problem of edge thickness due to the large receptive field of DCNNs. In this paper, we proposed a multi-scale erosion network (ME-Net) for building edge detection to crisp the building edge through two innovative approaches: (1) embedding an erosion module (EM) in the network to crisp the edge and (2) adding the Dice coefficient and local cross entropy of edge neighbors into the loss function to increase its sensitivity to the receptive field. In addition, a new metric, Ene, to measure the crispness of the predicted building edge was proposed. The experiment results show that ME-Net not only detects the clearest and crispest building edges, but also achieves the best OA of 98.75%, 95.00% and 95.51% on three building edge datasets, and exceeds other edge detection networks 3.17% and 0.44% at least in strict F1-score and Ene. In a word, the proposed ME-Net is an effective and practical approach for detecting crisp building edges from VHR remote sensing imagery.},

ABSTRACT = {Disease diagnosis is one of the major tasks for increasing food production in agriculture. Although precision agriculture (PA) takes less time and provides a more precise application of agricultural activities, the detection of disease using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is a challenging task. Several Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and sensors have been used for this purpose. The UAVs’ platforms and their peripherals have their own limitations in accurately diagnosing plant diseases. Several types of image processing software are available for vignetting and orthorectification. The training and validation of datasets are important characteristics of data analysis. Currently, different algorithms and architectures of machine learning models are used to classify and detect plant diseases. These models help in image segmentation and feature extractions to interpret results. Researchers also use the values of vegetative indices, such as Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), etc., acquired from different multispectral and hyperspectral sensors to fit into the statistical models to deliver results. There are still various drifts in the automatic detection of plant diseases as imaging sensors are limited by their own spectral bandwidth, resolution, background noise of the image, etc. The future of crop health monitoring using UAVs should include a gimble consisting of multiple sensors, large datasets for training and validation, the development of site-specific irradiance systems, and so on. This review briefly highlights the advantages of automatic detection of plant diseases to the growers.},

ABSTRACT = {Traditional radar target detection algorithms are mostly based on statistical theory. They have weak generalization capabilities for complex sea clutter environments and diverse target characteristics, and their detection performance would be significantly reduced. In this paper, the range-azimuth-frame information obtained by scanning radar is converted into plain position indicator (PPI) images, and a novel Radar-PPInet is proposed and used for marine target detection. The model includes CSPDarknet53, SPP, PANet, power non-maximum suppression (P-NMS), and multi-frame fusion section. The prediction frame coordinates, target category, and corresponding confidence are directly given through the feature extraction network. The network structure strengthens the receptive field and attention distribution structure, and further improves the efficiency of network training. P-NMS can effectively improve the problem of missed detection of multi-targets. Moreover, the false alarms caused by strong sea clutter are reduced by the multi-frame fusion, which is also a benefit for weak target detection. The verification using the X-band navigation radar PPI image dataset shows that compared with the traditional cell-average constant false alarm rate detector (CA-CFAR) and the two-stage Faster R-CNN algorithm, the proposed method significantly improved the detection probability by 15% and 10% under certain false alarm probability conditions, which is more suitable for various environment and target characteristics. Moreover, the computational burden is discussed showing that the Radar-PPInet detection model is significantly lower than the Faster R-CNN in terms of parameters and calculations.},

ABSTRACT = {The radiometric quality of remotely sensed imagery is crucial for precision agriculture applications because estimations of plant health rely on the underlying quality. Sky conditions, and specifically shadowing from clouds, are critical determinants in the quality of images that can be obtained from low-altitude sensing platforms. In this work, we first compare common deep learning approaches to classify sky conditions with regard to cloud shadows in agricultural fields using a visible spectrum camera. We then develop an artificial-intelligence-based edge computing system to fully automate the classification process. Training data consisting of 100 oblique angle images of the sky were provided to a convolutional neural network and two deep residual neural networks (ResNet18 and ResNet34) to facilitate learning two classes, namely (1) good image quality expected, and (2) degraded image quality expected. The expectation of quality stemmed from the sky condition (i.e., density, coverage, and thickness of clouds) present at the time of the image capture. These networks were tested using a set of 13,000 images. Our results demonstrated that ResNet18 and ResNet34 classifiers produced better classification accuracy when compared to a convolutional neural network classifier. The best overall accuracy was obtained by ResNet34, which was 92% accurate, with a Kappa statistic of 0.77. These results demonstrate a low-cost solution to quality control for future autonomous farming systems that will operate without human intervention and supervision.},

ABSTRACT = {Spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) often show inconsistency in estimating plant traits across different growth conditions; thus, it is still necessary to develop further optimized SRIs to guarantee the performance of SRIs as a simple and rapid approach to accurately estimate plant traits. The primary goal of this study was to develop optimized two- and three-band vegetation- and water-SRIs and to apply different multivariate regression models based on these SRIs for accurately estimating the relative water content (RWC), gravimetric water content (GWCF), and grain yield (GY) of two wheat cultivars evaluated under three irrigation regimes (100%, 75%, and 50% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc)) for two seasons. Results showed that the three plant traits and all SRIs showed significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) between the three irrigation treatments for each wheat cultivar. The three-band water-SRIs (NWIs-3b) showed the best performance in estimating the three plant traits for both cultivars (R2 &gt; 0.80), and RWC and GWCF under 75% ETc (R2 ≥ 0.65). Four out of six three-band vegetation-SRIs (NDVIs-3b) performed better than any other SRIs for estimating GY under 100% ETc and 50% ETC, and RWC under 100% ETc (R2 ≥ 0.60). All types of SRIs demonstrated excellent performance in estimating the three plant traits (R2 ≥ 0.70) when the data of all growth conditions were combined and analyzed together. The NWIs-3b coupled with Random Forest models predicted the three plant traits with satisfactory accuracy for the calibration (R2 ≥ 0.96) and validation (R2 ≥ 0.93) datasets. The overall results of this study elucidate that extracting an optimized NWIs-3b from the full spectrum data and combined with an appropriate regression technique could be a practical approach for managing deficit irrigation regimes of crops through accurately, timely, and non-destructively monitoring the water status and final potential yield.},

However, training such networks requires large amounts of fine-labeled buildings’ point-cloud data, presenting a major challenge in practice because they are difficult to obtain. Consequently, the application of fully supervised DL for semantic segmentation of buildings’ point clouds at LoD3 level is severely limited. In order to reduce the number of required annotated labels, we proposed a novel label-efficient DL network that obtains per-point semantic labels of LoD3 buildings’ point clouds with limited supervision, named 3DLEB-Net. In general, it consists of two steps. The first step (Autoencoder, AE) is composed of a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) encoder and a folding-based decoder. It is designed to extract discriminative global and local features from input point clouds by faithfully reconstructing them without any label. The second step is the semantic segmentation network. By supplying a small amount of task-specific supervision, a segmentation network is proposed for semantically segmenting the encoded features acquired from the pre-trained AE. Experimentally, we evaluated our approach based on the Architectural Cultural Heritage (ArCH) dataset. Compared to the fully supervised DL methods, we found that our model achieved state-of-the-art results on the unseen scenes, with only 10% of labeled training data from fully supervised methods as input. Moreover, we conducted a series of ablation studies to show the effectiveness of the design choices of our model.},

ABSTRACT = {Heat stress (HS) and water stress (WS) pose severe threats to viticulture, and effective management solutions to counter their effects on grapevine performance must be examined. In this study, we evaluated the physiological and spectral responses of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Sauvignon blanc to individual (HS) and combined (HS + WS) stress under four different cooling and irrigation strategies. The treatments were: standard drip irrigation (SI), extra drip irrigation (SI+), extra sprinklers irrigation (SPRI), and sustained deficit irrigation (SDI; 50% of SI). Compared to the other treatments, in the early stages after the occurrence of HS, the vine water status of SPRI and SI+ improved, with high stomatal conductance (gs) (SPRI) and stem water potential (Ψstem; SPRI and SI+). All the physiological indicators measured were significantly lower after the end of HS in the SDI treatment. We also identified the spectral response of grapevine to HS and combined HS and WS (resulting from SDI). Consistent with the physiological analysis, the proximal spectral responses of leaves identified SPRI and SI+ as putative cooling strategies to minimize vine HS. The vines undergoing combined stress (SDI) showed greenness amelioration 10 days after stress, as revealed by the greenness vegetation indices (VIs), i.e., Green Index (GI), Normalized Difference Greenness Vegetation Index (NDGI), and Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI). However, their physiological recovery was not achieved within this time, as shown by the Simple Ratio Index (SRI), Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (TCARI), and TCARI/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI). A three-step band selection process allowed the identification of the spectral traits’ responsive to HS and combined stress, i.e., 1336–1340 nm, 1967–1971 nm, and 600–604 nm.},

ABSTRACT = {Real-time health monitoring of civil infrastructures is performed to maintain their structural integrity, sustainability, and serviceability for a longer time. With smart electronics and packaging technology, large amounts of complex monitoring data are generated, requiring sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for their processing. With the advancement of technology, more complex AI models have been applied, from simple models to sophisticated deep learning (DL) models, for structural health monitoring (SHM). In this article, a comprehensive review is performed, primarily on the applications of AI models for SHM to maintain the sustainability of diverse civil infrastructures. Three smart data capturing methods of SHM, namely, camera-based, smartphone-based, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based methods, are also discussed, having made the utilization of intelligent paradigms easier. UAV is found to be the most promising smart data acquisition technology, whereas convolution neural networks are the most impressive DL model reported for SHM. Furthermore, current challenges and future perspectives of AI-based SHM systems are also described separately. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city concepts are explained to elaborate on the contributions of intelligent SHM systems. The integration of SHM with IoT and cloud-based computing is leading us towards the evolution of future smart cities.},

ABSTRACT = {With high spatial resolution remote sensing images being increasingly used in precision agriculture, more details of the row structure of row crops are captured in the corresponding images. This phenomenon is a challenge for the estimation of the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) of row crops. Previous studies have found that there is an overestimation of FVC for the early growth stage of vegetation in the current algorithms. When the row crops are a form in the early stage of vegetation, their FVC may also have overestimation. Therefore, developing an algorithm to address this problem is necessary. This study used World-View 3 images as data sources and attempted to use the canopy reflectance model of row crops, coupling backward propagation neural networks (BPNNs) to estimate the FVC of row crops. Compared to the prevailing algorithms, i.e., empirical method, spectral mixture analysis, and continuous crop model coupling BPNNs, the results showed that the calculated accuracy of the canopy reflectance model of row crops coupling with BPNNs is the highest performing (RMSE = 0.0305). Moreover, when the structure is obvious, we found that the FVC of row crops was about 0.5–0.6, and the relationship between estimated FVC of row crops and NDVI presented a strong exponential relationship. The results reinforced the conclusion that the canopy reflectance model of row crops coupled with BPNNs is more suitable for estimating the FVC of row crops in high-resolution images.},

ABSTRACT = {The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America is an extremely important habitat for a diverse range of wetland ecosystems that provide a wealth of socio-economic value. This paper describes the ecological characteristics and importance of PPR wetlands and the use of remote sensing for mapping and monitoring applications. While there are comprehensive reviews for wetland remote sensing in recent publications, there is no comprehensive review about the use of remote sensing in the PPR. First, the PPR is described, including the wetland classification systems that have been used, the water regimes that control the surface water and water levels, and the soil and vegetation characteristics of the region. The tools and techniques that have been used in the PPR for analyses of geospatial data for wetland applications are described. Field observations for ground truth data are critical for good validation and accuracy assessment of the many products that are produced. Wetland classification approaches are reviewed, including Decision Trees, Machine Learning, and object versus pixel-based approaches. A comprehensive description of the remote sensing systems and data that have been employed by various studies in the PPR is provided. A wide range of data can be used for various applications, including passive optical data like aerial photographs or satellite-based, Earth-observation data. Both airborne and spaceborne lidar studies are described. A detailed description of Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data and research are provided. The state of the art is the use of multi-source data to achieve higher accuracies and hybrid approaches. Digital Surface Models are also being incorporated in geospatial analyses to separate forest and shrub and emergent systems based on vegetation height. Remote sensing provides a cost-effective mechanism for mapping and monitoring PPR wetlands, especially with the logistical difficulties and cost of field-based methods. The wetland characteristics of the PPR dictate the need for high resolution in both time and space, which is increasingly possible with the numerous and increasing remote sensing systems available and the trend to open-source data and tools. The fusion of multi-source remote sensing data via state-of-the-art machine learning is recommended for wetland applications in the PPR. The use of such data promotes flexibility for sensor addition, subtraction, or substitution as a function of application needs and potential cost restrictions. This is important in the PPR because of the challenges related to the highly dynamic nature of this unique region.},

ABSTRACT = {Crop disease is widely considered as one of the most pressing challenges for food crops, and therefore an accurate crop disease detection algorithm is highly desirable for its sustainable management. The recent use of remote sensing and deep learning is drawing increasing research interests in wheat yellow rust disease detection. However, current solutions on yellow rust detection are generally addressed by RGB images and the basic semantic segmentation algorithms (e.g., UNet), which do not consider the irregular and blurred boundary problems of yellow rust area therein, restricting the disease segmentation performance. Therefore, this work aims to develop an automatic yellow rust disease detection algorithm to cope with these boundary problems. An improved algorithm entitled Ir-UNet by embedding irregular encoder module (IEM), irregular decoder module (IDM) and content-aware channel re-weight module (CCRM) is proposed and compared against the basic UNet while with various input features. The recently collected dataset by DJI M100 UAV equipped with RedEdge multispectral camera is used to evaluate the algorithm performance. Comparative results show that the Ir-UNet with five raw bands outperforms the basic UNet, achieving the highest overall accuracy (OA) score (97.13%) among various inputs. Moreover, the use of three selected bands, Red-NIR-RE, in the proposed Ir-UNet can obtain a comparable result (OA: 96.83%) while with fewer spectral bands and less computation load. It is anticipated that this study by seamlessly integrating the Ir-UNet network and UAV multispectral images can pave the way for automated yellow rust detection at farmland scales.},

ABSTRACT = {Using aerial platforms for Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) of large and complex structures is a growing field of interest in various industries. Infrastructures such as: buildings, bridges, oil and gas, etc. refineries require regular and extensive inspections. The inspection reports are used to plan and perform required maintenance, ensuring their structural health and the safety of the workers. However, performing these inspections can be challenging due to the size of the facility, the lack of easy access, the health risks for the inspectors, or several other reasons, which has convinced companies to invest more in drones as an alternative solution to overcome these challenges. The autonomous nature of drones can assist companies in reducing inspection time and cost. Moreover, the employment of drones can lower the number of required personnel for inspection and can increase personnel safety. Finally, drones can provide a safe and reliable solution for inspecting hard-to-reach or hazardous areas. Despite the recent developments in drone-based NDI to reliably detect defects, several limitations and challenges still need to be addressed. In this paper, a brief review of the history of unmanned aerial vehicles, along with a comprehensive review of studies focused on UAV-based NDI of industrial and commercial facilities, are provided. Moreover, the benefits of using drones in inspections as an alternative to conventional methods are discussed, along with the challenges and open problems of employing drones in industrial inspections, are explored. Finally, some of our case studies conducted in different industrial fields in the field of Non-Destructive Inspection are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Computation offloading technology extends cloud computing to the edge of the access network close to users, bringing many benefits to terminal devices with limited battery and computational resources. Nevertheless, the existing computation offloading approaches are challenging to apply to specific scenarios, such as the dense distribution of end-users and the sparse distribution of network infrastructure. The technological revolution in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and chip industry has granted UAVs more computing resources and promoted the emergence of UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, which could be applied to those scenarios. However, in the MEC system with multiple users and multiple servers, making reasonable offloading decisions and allocating system resources is still a severe challenge. This paper studies the offloading decision and resource allocation problem in the UAV-assisted MEC environment with multiple users and servers. To ensure the quality of service for end-users, we set the weighted total cost of delay, energy consumption, and the size of discarded tasks as our optimization objective. We further formulate the joint optimization problem as a Markov decision process and apply the soft actor–critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the offloading policy. Numerical simulation results show that the offloading policy optimized by our proposed SAC-based dynamic computing offloading (SACDCO) algorithm effectively reduces the delay, energy consumption, and size of discarded tasks for the UAV-assisted MEC system. Compared with the fixed local-UAV scheme in the specific simulation setting, our proposed approach reduces system delay and energy consumption by approximately 50% and 200%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is one of the most important factors affecting photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen status, both of which influence crop harvest. However, the development of rapid and nondestructive methods for leaf chlorophyll estimation is a topic of much interest. Hence, this study explored the use of the machine learning approach to enhance the estimation of leaf chlorophyll from spectral reflectance data. The objective of this study was to evaluate four different approaches for estimating the LCC of apple tree leaves at five growth stages (the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th growth stages): (1) univariate linear regression (ULR); (2) multivariate linear regression (MLR); (3) support vector regression (SVR); and (4) random forest (RF) regression. Samples were collected from the leaves on the eastern, western, southern and northern sides of apple trees five times (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th growth stages) over three consecutive years (2016–2018), and experiments were conducted in 10–20-year-old apple tree orchards. Correlation analysis results showed that LCC and ST, LCC and vegetation indices (VIs), and LCC and three edge parameters (TEP) had high correlations with the first-order differential spectrum (FODS) (0.86), leaf chlorophyll index (LCI) (0.87), and (SDr − SDb)/ (SDr + SDb) (0.88) at the 3rd, 3rd, and 4th growth stages, respectively. The prediction models of different growth stages were relatively good. The MLR and SVR models in the LCC assessment of different growth stages only reached the highest R2 values of 0.79 and 0.82, and the lowest RMSEs were 2.27 and 2.02, respectively. However, the RF model evaluation was significantly better than above models. The R2 value was greater than 0.94 and RMSE was less than 1.37 at different growth stages. The prediction accuracy of the 1st growth stage (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 0.95) was best with the RF model. This result could provide a theoretical basis for orchard management. In the future, more models based on machine learning techniques should be developed using the growth information and physiological parameters of orchards that provide technical support for intelligent orchard management.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper considered the constrained unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning problem as the multi-objective optimization problem, in which both costs and constraints are treated as the objective functions. A novel multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on the Gaussian distribution and the Q-Learning technique (GMOPSO-QL) is proposed and applied to determine the feasible and optimal path for UAV. In GMOPSO-QL, the Gaussian distribution based updating operator is adopted to generate new particles, and the exploration and exploitation modes are introduced to enhance population diversity and convergence speed, respectively. Moreover, the Q-Learning based mode selection logic is introduced to balance the global search with the local search in the evolution process. Simulation results indicate that our proposed GMOPSO-QL can deal with the constrained UAV path planning problem and is superior to existing optimization algorithms in terms of efficiency and robustness.},

ABSTRACT = {The territory of the Republic of Serbia is vulnerable to various natural disasters, among which forest fires stand out. In relation with climate changes, the number of forest fires in Serbia has been increasing from year to year. Protected natural areas are especially endangered by wildfires. For Nature Park Golija, as the second largest in Serbia, with an area of 75,183 ha, and with MaB Reserve Golija-Studenica on part of its territory (53,804 ha), more attention should be paid in terms of forest fire mitigation. GIS and multi-criteria decision analysis are indispensable when it comes to spatial analysis for the purpose of natural disaster risk management. Index-based and fuzzy AHP methods were used, together with TOPSIS method for forest fire susceptibility zonation. Very high and high forest fire susceptibility zone were recorded on 26.85% (Forest Fire Susceptibility Index) and 25.75% (fuzzy AHP). The additional support for forest fire prevention is realized through an additional Internet of Thing (IoT)-based sensor network that enables the continuous collection of local meteorological and environmental data, which enables low-cost and reliable real-time fire risk assessment and detection and the improved long-term and short-term forest fire susceptibility assessment. Obtained results can be applied for adequate forest fire risk management, improvement of the monitoring, and early warning systems in the Republic of Serbia, but are also important for relevant authorities at national, regional, and local level, which will be able to coordinate and intervene in a case of emergency events.},

ABSTRACT = {Automatically extracting buildings from remote sensing images with deep learning is of great significance to urban planning, disaster prevention, change detection, and other applications. Various deep learning models have been proposed to extract building information, showing both strengths and weaknesses in capturing the complex spectral and spatial characteristics of buildings in remote sensing images. To integrate the strengths of individual models and obtain fine-scale spatial and spectral building information, this study proposed a stacking ensemble deep learning model. First, an optimization method for the prediction results of the basic model is proposed based on fully connected conditional random fields (CRFs). On this basis, a stacking ensemble model (SENet) based on a sparse autoencoder integrating U-NET, SegNet, and FCN-8s models is proposed to combine the features of the optimized basic model prediction results. Utilizing several cities in Hebei Province, China as a case study, a building dataset containing attribute labels is established to assess the performance of the proposed model. The proposed SENet is compared with three individual models (U-NET, SegNet and FCN-8s), and the results show that the accuracy of SENet is 0.954, approximately 6.7%, 6.1%, and 9.8% higher than U-NET, SegNet, and FCN-8s models, respectively. The identification of building features, including colors, sizes, shapes, and shadows, is also evaluated, showing that the accuracy, recall, F1 score, and intersection over union (IoU) of the SENet model are higher than those of the three individual models. This suggests that the proposed ensemble model can effectively depict the different features of buildings and provides an alternative approach to building extraction with higher accuracy.},

We focused our study on our own dataset of agricultural fields to validate the results. The fields studied in our case are in the Guelmin-Oued noun region in the south of Morocco. These fields are divided into two areas, with a total surface of 3.44 Ha2 for the first field and 3.73 Ha2 for the second. The images were collected using a DJI-type unmanned aerial vehicle and an RGB camera. Performance evaluation showed that the system could process up to 86 fps versus 12 fps or 20 fps in C/C++ and OpenMP implementations, respectively. Software optimizations have increased the performance to 107 fps, which meets real-time constraints.},

ABSTRACT = {Timely clearing-up interventions are essential for effective recovery of flood-damaged housing, however, time-consuming door-to-door inspections for insurance purposes need to take place before major repairs can be done to adequately assess the losses caused by flooding. With the increased probability of flooding, there is a heightened need for rapid flood damage assessment methods. High resolution imagery captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers an opportunity for accelerating the time needed for inspections, either through visual interpretation or automated image classification. In this study, object-oriented image segmentation coupled with tree-based classifiers was implemented on a 10 cm resolution RGB orthoimage, captured over the English town of Cockermouth a week after a flood triggered by storm Desmond, to automatically detect debris associated with damages predominantly to residential housing. Random forests algorithm achieved a good level of overall accuracy of 74%, with debris being correctly classified at the rate of 58%, and performing well for small debris (67%) and skips (64%). The method was successful at depicting brightly-colored debris, however, was prone to misclassifications with brightly-colored vehicles. Consequently, in the current stage, the methodology could be used to facilitate visual interpretation of UAV images. Methods to improve accuracy have been identified and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid search and localization for nuclear sources can be an important aspect in preventing human harm from illicit material in dirty bombs or from contamination. In the case of a single mobile radiation detector, there are numerous challenges to overcome such as weak source intensity, multiple sources, background radiation, and the presence of obstructions, i.e., a non-convex environment. In this work, we investigate the sequential decision making capability of deep reinforcement learning in the nuclear source search context. A novel neural network architecture (RAD-A2C) based on the advantage actor critic (A2C) framework and a particle filter gated recurrent unit for localization is proposed. Performance is studied in a randomized 20×20 m convex and non-convex simulation environment across a range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)s for a single detector and single source. RAD-A2C performance is compared to both an information-driven controller that uses a bootstrap particle filter and to a gradient search (GS) algorithm. We find that the RAD-A2C has comparable performance to the information-driven controller across SNR in a convex environment. The RAD-A2C far outperforms the GS algorithm in the non-convex environment with greater than 95% median completion rate for up to seven obstructions.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapidly increasing world population and human activities accelerate the crisis of the limited freshwater resources. Water quality must be monitored for the sustainability of freshwater resources. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne hyperspectral data can capture fine features of water bodies, which have been widely used for monitoring water quality. In this study, nine machine learning algorithms are systematically evaluated for the inversion of water quality parameters including chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and suspended solids (SS) with UAV-borne hyperspectral data. In comparing the experimental results of the machine learning model on the water quality parameters, we can observe that the prediction performance of the Catboost regression (CBR) model is the best. However, the prediction performances of the Multi-layer Perceptron regression (MLPR) and Elastic net (EN) models are very unsatisfactory, indicating that the MLPR and EN models are not suitable for the inversion of water quality parameters. In addition, the water quality distribution map is generated, which can be used to identify polluted areas of water bodies.},

ABSTRACT = {Fifth-generation (5G) communication technology is intended to offer higher data rates, outstanding user exposure, lower power consumption, and extremely short latency. Such cellular networks will implement a diverse multi-layer model comprising device-to-device networks, macro-cells, and different categories of small cells to assist customers with desired quality-of-service (QoS). This multi-layer model affects several studies that confront utilizing interference management and resource allocation in 5G networks. With the growing need for cellular service and the limited resources to provide it, capably handling network traffic and operation has become a problem of resource distribution. One of the utmost serious problems is to alleviate the jamming in the network in support of having a better QoS. However, although a limited number of review papers have been written on resource distribution, no review papers have been written specifically on 5G resource allocation. Hence, this article analyzes the issue of resource allocation by classifying the various resource allocation schemes in 5G that have been reported in the literature and assessing their ability to enhance service quality. This survey bases its discussion on the metrics that are used to evaluate network performance. After consideration of the current evidence on resource allocation methods in 5G, the review hopes to empower scholars by suggesting future research areas on which to focus.},

ABSTRACT = {Water is a critically important element of human life. The best practice of effective water management comes from ancient civilizations that, despite their technologies and practices, were unable to prevent collapse from water scarcity. In the 21st century, in an era of climate change, pollution or population explosion, cities are looking for innovative ways to effectively manage scarce resources for future generations. Which elements should cities of the future follow to avoid water collapse? The following article aims to identify the key elements of effective management and to represent them graphically in the form of a recommended model, which will be verified in the future in Slovakia. The article uses case analysis of best past and current practices, comparison and summarization to identify the elements, creativity, and logic in the development of the model, including induction and deduction. The article serves as a basis for fellow researchers (analyses carried out) and strategic urban management (effective urban water management). The main finding of the article is that ecological change puts pressure on social elements and therefore it is necessary to focus on the area of strategic management. Cities should not only know how to manage resource abundance or short-term scarcity, but also long-term scarcity. They should use elements of trust, awareness and continuous improvement through modern monitoring technologies (UAVs, sensors) and prediction (machine learning). This is the only way to generate water sustainability in the urban concept of the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Ambient Intelligence (AmI) encompasses technological infrastructures capable of sensing data from environments and extracting high-level knowledge to detect or recognize users’ features and actions, as well as entities or events in their surroundings. Visual perception, particularly object detection, has become one of the most relevant enabling factors for this context-aware user-centered intelligence, being the cornerstone of relevant but complex tasks, such as object tracking or human action recognition. In this context, convolutional neural networks have proven to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy levels. However, they typically result in large and highly complex models that typically demand computation offloading onto remote cloud platforms. Such an approach has security- and latency-related limitations and may not be appropriate for some AmI use cases where the system response time must be as short as possible, and data privacy must be guaranteed. In the last few years, the on-device paradigm has emerged in response to those limitations, yielding more compact and efficient neural networks able to address inference directly on client machines, thus providing users with a smoother and better-tailored experience, with no need of sharing their data with an outsourced service. Framed in that novel paradigm, this work presents a review of the recent advances made along those lines in object detection, providing a comprehensive study of the most relevant lightweight CNN-based detection frameworks, discussing the most paradigmatic AmI domains where such an approach has been successfully applied, the different challenges arisen, the key strategies and techniques adopted to create visual solutions for image-based object classification and localization, as well as the most relevant factors to bear in mind when assessing or comparing those techniques, such as the evaluation metrics or the hardware setups used.},

ABSTRACT = {High-frequency monitoring of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration can improve water resource management. Missing high-resolution satellite images could hamper remote-sensing SPM monitoring. This study resolved the problem by applying spatiotemporal fusion technology to obtain high spatial resolution and dense time-series data to fill image-data gaps. Three data sources (MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2) and two spatiotemporal fusion methods (the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF)) were used to reconstruct missing satellite images. We compared their fusion accuracy and verified the consistency of fusion images between data sources. For the fusion images, we used random forest (RF) and XGBoost as inversion methods and set “fusion first” and “inversion first” strategies to test the method’s feasibility in Ebinur Lake, Xinjiang, arid northwestern China. Our results showed that (1) the blue, green, red, and NIR bands of ESTARFM fusion image were better than FSDAF, with a good consistency (R2 ≥ 0.54) between the fused Landsat 8, Sentinel 2 images, and their original images; (2) the original image and fusion image offered RF inversion effect better than XGBoost. The inversion accuracy based on Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 were R2 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. The correlation of SPM distribution maps of the two data sources attained a good consistency of R2 0.51; (3) in retrieving SPM from fused images, the “fusion first” strategy had better accuracy. The optimal combination was ESTARFM (Landsat 8)_RF and ESTARFM (Sentinel 2)_RF, consistent with original SPM maps (R2 = 0.38, 0.41, respectively). Overall, the spatiotemporal fusion model provided effective SPM monitoring under the image-absence scenario, with good consistency in the inversion of SPM. The findings provided the research basis for long-term and high-frequency remote-sensing SPM monitoring and high-precision smart water resource management.},

ABSTRACT = {Harvester-mounted yield monitor sensors are expensive and require calibration and data cleaning. Therefore, we evaluated six vegetation indices (VI) from unmanned aerial system (Quantix™ Mapper) imagery for corn (Zea mays L.) yield prediction. A field trial was conducted with N sidedress treatments applied at four growth stages (V4, V6, V8, or V10) compared against zero-N and N-rich controls. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2), based on flights at R4, resulted in the most accurate yield estimations, as long as sidedressing was performed before V6. Yield estimations based on earlier flights were less accurate. Estimations were most accurate when imagery from both N-rich and zero-N control plots were included, but elimination of the zero-N data only slightly reduced the accuracy. Use of a ratio approach (VITrt/VIN-rich and YieldTrt/YieldN-rich) enables the extension of findings across fields and only slightly reduced the model performance. Finally, a smaller plot size (9 or 75 m2 compared to 150 m2) resulted in a slightly reduced model performance. We concluded that accurate yield estimates can be obtained using NDVI and EVI2, as long as there is an N-rich strip in the field, sidedressing is performed prior to V6, and sensing takes place at R3 or R4.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, medical image analysis has played a vital role in detecting diseases in their early stages. Medical images are rapidly becoming available for various applications to solve human problems. Therefore, complex medical features are needed to develop a diagnostic system for physicians to provide better treatment. Traditional methods of abnormality detection suffer from misidentification of abnormal regions in the given data. Visual-saliency detection methods are used to locate abnormalities to improve the accuracy of the proposed work. This study explores the role of a visual saliency map in the classification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Bottom-up saliency corresponds to image features, whereas top-down saliency uses domain knowledge in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the use of an elliptical local binary pattern descriptor for low-level MRI characterization. Ellipse-like topologies help to obtain feature information from different orientations. Extensively directional features at different orientations cover the micro patterns. The brain regions of the Alzheimer’s disease stages were classified from the saliency maps. Multiple-kernel learning (MKL) and simple and efficient MKL (SEMKL) were used to classify Alzheimer’s disease from normal controls. The proposed method used the OASIS dataset and experimental results were compared with eight state-of-the-art methods. The proposed visual saliency-based abnormality detection produces reliable results in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f-measure.},

ABSTRACT = {To ensure the continuity of electric power generation for photovoltaic systems, condition monitoring frameworks are subject to major enhancements. The continuous uniform delivery of electric power depends entirely on a well-designed condition maintenance program. A just-in-time task to deal with several naturally occurring faults can be correctly undertaken via the cooperation of effective detection, diagnosis, and prognostic analyses. Therefore, the present review first outlines different failure modes to which all photovoltaic systems are subjected, in addition to the essential integrated detection methods and technologies. Then, data-driven paradigms, and their contribution to solving this prediction problem, are also explored. Accordingly, this review primarily investigates the different learning architectures used (i.e., ordinary, hybrid, and ensemble) in relation to their learning frameworks (i.e., traditional and deep learning). It also discusses the extension of machine learning to knowledge-driven approaches, including generative models such as adversarial networks and transfer learning. Finally, this review provides insights into different works to highlight various operating conditions and different numbers and types of failures, and provides links to some publicly available datasets in the field. The clear organization of the abundant information on this subject may result in rigorous guidelines for the trends adopted in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {The present work aims to demonstrate how machine learning (ML) techniques can be used for automatic feature detection and extraction in fluvial environments. The use of photogrammetry and machine learning algorithms has improved the understanding of both environmental and anthropic issues. The developed methodology was applied considering the acquisition of multiple photogrammetric images thanks to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) carrying multispectral cameras. These surveys were carried out in the Salbertrand area, along the Dora Riparia River, situated in Piedmont (Italy). The authors developed an algorithm able to identify and detect the water table contour concerning the landed areas: the automatic classification in ML found a valid identification of different patterns (water, gravel bars, vegetation, and ground classes) in specific hydraulic and geomatics conditions. Indeed, the RE+NIR data gave us a sharp rise in terms of accuracy by about 11% and 13.5% of F1-score average values in the testing point clouds compared to RGB data. The obtained results about the automatic classification led us to define a new procedure with precise validity conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) have become more accessible in recent years and SITS analysis has attracted increasing research interest. Given that labeled SITS training samples are time and effort consuming to acquire, clustering or unsupervised analysis methods need to be developed. Similarity measure is critical for clustering, however, currently established methods represented by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) still exhibit several issues when coping with SITS, such as pathological alignment, sensitivity to spike noise, and limitation on capacity. In this paper, we introduce a new time series similarity measure method named time adaptive optimal transport (TAOT) to the application of SITS clustering. TAOT inherits several promising properties of optimal transport for the comparing of time series. Statistical and visual results on two real SITS datasets with two different settings demonstrate that TAOT can effectively alleviate the issues of DTW and further improve the clustering accuracy. Thus, TAOT can serve as a usable tool to explore the potential of precious SITS data.},

ABSTRACT = {Previous studies have observed seasonal cooling effects in paddy rice as compared to temperate forest through enhanced evapotranspiration (ET) in Northeast Asia, while rare studies have revealed biophysical factors responsible for spatial variations of ET and its cooling effects. In this study, we adopted a data fusion method that integrated MODIS 8-day surface reflectance products, gridded daily climate data of ground surface, and a remote sensing pixel-based Penman-Monteith ET model (i.e., the RS–PM model) to quantify ET patterns of paddy rice in South Korea from 2011 to 2014. Results indicated that the regional variations of the rice-growing season ET (RGS-ET, the sum of daily ET from the season onset of rapid canopy expansion (SoS) to the end of the rice-growing season (EGS)) were primarily influenced by phenological factors (i.e., the length of growing period-LGP), followed by growing season mean climatic factors (i.e., vapor pressure deficit-VPD, and air temperature). For regional variations of the paddy field ET (PF-ET, the sum of daily ET from the field flooding and transplanting date detected by satellite observations (FFTDsat) to SoS, and to EGS), the extents were substantially reduced, only accounting for 54% of the RGS-ET variations. The FFTDsat and SoS were considered critical for the reduced PF-ET variations. In comparison to the temperate forest, changes in monthly ground surface air temperature (Ts) in paddy fields showed the V-shaped seasonal pattern with significant cooling effects found in late spring and early summer, primarily due to a large decline in daytime Ts that exceeded the nighttime warming. Bringing FFTDsat towards late spring and early summer was identified as vital field management practices, causing significant declines in daytime Ts due to enhanced ET. Results highlighted climate-warming mitigation by paddy fields due to early flooding practices.},

ABSTRACT = {Citrus is the most extensively produced fruit tree crop in the world and is grown in over 130 countries. Fungal diseases in citrus can cause significant losses in yield and quality. An accurate diagnosis is critical for determining the best management practices and preventing future losses. In this study, a Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/associated (Cas) system was established with the integration of a lateral flow assay (LFA) readout system for diagnosis of citrus scab. This detection can be completed within 1 h, is highly sensitive and prevents cross-reactions with other common fungal citrus diseases. Furthermore, the detection system is compatible with crude DNA extracted from infected plant tissue. This RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a-LFA system provides a sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective method with promising and significant practical value for point-of-care diagnosis of citrus scab. To our knowledge, this is the first report to establish an RPA- and CRISPR-based method with LFA for fungal diseases in plants.},

ABSTRACT = {Coral reefs are the sub-aqueous calcium carbonate structures collected by the invertebrates known as corals. The charm and beauty of coral reefs attract tourists, and they play a vital role in preserving biodiversity, ceasing coastal erosion, and promoting business trade. However, they are declining because of over-exploitation, damaging fishery, marine pollution, and global climate changes. Also, coral reefs help treat human immune-deficiency virus (HIV), heart disease, and coastal erosion. The corals of Australia’s great barrier reef have started bleaching due to the ocean acidification, and global warming, which is an alarming threat to the earth’s ecosystem. Many techniques have been developed to address such issues. However, each method has a limitation due to the low resolution of images, diverse weather conditions, etc. In this paper, we propose a bag of features (BoF) based approach that can detect and localize the bleached corals before the safety measures are applied. The dataset contains images of bleached and unbleached corals, and various kernels are used to support the vector machine so that extracted features can be classified. The accuracy of handcrafted descriptors and deep convolutional neural networks is analyzed and provided in detail with comparison to the current method. Various handcrafted descriptors like local binary pattern, a histogram of an oriented gradient, locally encoded transform feature histogram, gray level co-occurrence matrix, and completed joint scale local binary pattern are used for feature extraction. Specific deep convolutional neural networks such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception v3, and CoralNet are being used for feature extraction. From experimental analysis and results, the proposed technique outperforms in comparison to the current state-of-the-art methods. The proposed technique achieves 99.08% accuracy with a classification error of 0.92%. A novel bleached coral positioning algorithm is also proposed to locate bleached corals in the coral reef images.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must keep track of their location in order to maintain flight plans. Currently, this task is almost entirely performed by a combination of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and reference to GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). Navigation by GNSS, however, is not always reliable, due to various causes both natural (reflection and blockage from objects, technical fault, inclement weather) and artificial (GPS spoofing and denial). In such GPS-denied situations, it is desirable to have additional methods for aerial geolocalization. One such method is visual geolocalization, where aircraft use their ground facing cameras to localize and navigate. The state of the art in many ground-level image processing tasks involve the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We present here a study of how effectively a modern CNN designed for visual classification can be applied to the problem of Absolute Visual Geolocalization (AVL, localization without a prior location estimate). An Xception based architecture is trained from scratch over a &gt;1000 km2 section of Washington County, Arkansas to directly regress latitude and longitude from images from different orthorectified high-altitude survey flights. It achieves average localization accuracy on unseen image sets over the same region from different years and seasons with as low as 115 m average error, which localizes to 0.004% of the training area, or about 8% of the width of the 1.5 × 1.5 km input image. This demonstrates that CNNs are expressive enough to encode robust landscape information for geolocalization over large geographic areas. Furthermore, discussed are methods of providing uncertainty for CNN regression outputs, and future areas of potential improvement for use of deep neural networks in visual geolocalization.},

ABSTRACT = {Several cancer risk factors (exposure to ultraviolet-B, pollution, toxins and pathogens) have been identified for wildlife, to form a “cancer risk landscape.” However, information remains limited on how the spatiotemporal variability of these factors impacts the prevalence of cancer in wildlife. Here, we evaluated the cancer risk landscape at 49 foraging sites of the globally distributed green turtle (Chelonia mydas), a species affected by fibropapillomatosis, by integrating data from a global meta-analysis of 31 publications (1994–2019). Evaluated risk factors included ultraviolet light exposure, eutrophication, toxic phytoplanktonic blooms, sea surface temperature, and the presence of mechanical vectors (parasites and symbiotic species). Prevalence was highest in areas where nutrient concentrations facilitated the emergence of toxic phytoplankton blooms. In contrast, ultraviolet light exposure and the presence of parasitic and/or symbiotic species did not appear to impact disease prevalence. Our results indicate that, to counter outbreaks of fibropapillomatosis, management actions that reduce eutrophication in foraging areas should be implemented.},

ABSTRACT = {In oil palm crop, soil fertility is less important than the physical soil characteristics. It is important to have a balance and sufficient soil moisture to sustain high yields in oil palm plantations. However, conventional methods of soil moisture determination are laborious and time-consuming with limited coverage and accuracy. In this research, we evaluated synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and in-situ observations at an oil palm plantation to determine SAR signal sensitivity to oil palm crop by means of water cloud model (WCM) inversion for retrieving soil moisture from L-band HH and HV polarized data. The effects of vegetation on backscattering coefficients were evaluated by comparing Leaf Area Index (LAI), Leaf Water Area Index (LWAI) and Normalized Plant Water Content (NPWC). The results showed that HV polarization effectively simulated backscatter coefficient as compared to HH polarization where the best fit was obtained by taking the LAI as a vegetation descriptor. The HV polarization with the LAI indicator was able to retrieve soil moisture content with an accuracy of at least 80%.},

ABSTRACT = {Gully erosion is the most severe type of water erosion and is a major land degradation process. Gully erosion susceptibility mapping (GESM)’s efficiency and interpretability remains a challenge, especially in complex terrain areas. In this study, a WoE-MLC model was used to solve the above problem, which combines machine learning classification algorithms and the statistical weight of evidence (WoE) model in the Loess Plateau. The three machine learning (ML) algorithms utilized in this research were random forest (RF), gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results showed that: (1) GESM were well predicted by combining both machine learning regression models and WoE-MLC models, with the area under the curve (AUC) values both greater than 0.92, and the latter was more computationally efficient and interpretable; (2) The XGBoost algorithm was more efficient in GESM than the other two algorithms, with the strongest generalization ability and best performance in avoiding overfitting (averaged AUC = 0.947), followed by the RF algorithm (averaged AUC = 0.944), and GBDT algorithm (averaged AUC = 0.938); and (3) slope gradient, land use, and altitude were the main factors for GESM. This study may provide a possible method for gully erosion susceptibility mapping at large scale.},

ABSTRACT = {The deep neural network-based method requires a lot of data for training. Aiming at the problem of a lack of training images in tomato leaf disease identification, an Adversarial-VAE network model for generating images of 10 tomato leaf diseases is proposed, which is used to expand the training set for training an identification model. First, an Adversarial-VAE model is designed to generate tomato leaf disease images. Then, a multi-scale residual learning module is used to replace single-size convolution kernels to enrich extracted features, and a dense connection strategy is integrated into the Adversarial-VAE networks to further enhance the image generation ability. The training set is expanded by the proposed model, which generates the same number of images by training 10,892 images of 10 leaves. The generated images are superior to those of InfoGAN, WAE, VAE, and VAE-GAN measured by the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). The experimental results show that using the extension dataset that is generated by the Adversarial-VAE model to train the Resnet identification model could improve the accuracy of identification effectively. The model proposed in this paper could generate enough images of tomato leaf diseases and provide a feasible solution for data expansion of tomato leaf disease images.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, researchers have realized a number of achievements involving deep-learning-based neural networks for the tasks of segmentation and detection based on 2D images, 3D point clouds, etc. Using 2D and 3D information fusion for the advantages of compensation and accuracy improvement has become a hot research topic. However, there are no critical reviews focusing on the fusion strategies of 2D and 3D information integration based on various data for segmentation and detection, which are the basic tasks of computer vision. To boost the development of this research domain, the existing representative fusion strategies are collected, introduced, categorized, and summarized in this paper. In addition, the general structures of different kinds of fusion strategies were firstly abstracted and categorized, which may inspire researchers. Moreover, according to the methods included in this paper, the 2D information and 3D information of different methods come from various kinds of data. Furthermore, suitable datasets are introduced and comparatively summarized to support the relative research. Last but not least, we put forward some open challenges and promising directions for future research.},

ABSTRACT = {In agriculture, explainable deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used to pinpoint the discriminative part of weeds for an imagery classification task, albeit at a low resolution, to control the weed population. This paper proposes the use of a multi-layer attention procedure based on a transformer combined with a fusion rule to present an interpretation of the DNN decision through a high-resolution attention map. The fusion rule is a weighted average method that is used to combine attention maps from different layers based on saliency. Attention maps with an explanation for why a weed is or is not classified as a certain class help agronomists to shape the high-resolution weed identification keys (WIK) that the model perceives. The model is trained and evaluated on two agricultural datasets that contain plants grown under different conditions: the Plant Seedlings Dataset (PSD) and the Open Plant Phenotyping Dataset (OPPD). The model represents attention maps with highlighted requirements and information about misclassification to enable cross-dataset evaluations. State-of-the-art comparisons represent classification developments after applying attention maps. Average accuracies of 95.42% and 96% are gained for the negative and positive explanations of the PSD test sets, respectively. In OPPD evaluations, accuracies of 97.78% and 97.83% are obtained for negative and positive explanations, respectively. The visual comparison between attention maps also shows high-resolution information.},

ABSTRACT = {A large portion of Canada is covered by wetlands; mapping and monitoring them is of great importance for various applications. In this regard, Remote Sensing (RS) technology has been widely employed for wetland studies in Canada over the past 45 years. This study evaluates meta-data to investigate the status and trends of wetland studies in Canada using RS technology by reviewing the scientific papers published between 1976 and the end of 2020 (300 papers in total). Initially, a meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the status of RS-based wetland studies in terms of the wetland classification systems, methods, classes, RS data usage, publication details (e.g., authors, keywords, citations, and publications time), geographic information, and level of classification accuracies. The deep systematic review of 128 peer-reviewed articles illustrated the rising trend in using multi-source RS datasets along with advanced machine learning algorithms for wetland mapping in Canada. It was also observed that most of the studies were implemented over the province of Ontario. Pixel-based supervised classifiers were the most popular wetland classification algorithms. This review summarizes different RS systems and methodologies for wetland mapping in Canada to outline how RS has been utilized for the generation of wetland inventories. The results of this review paper provide the current state-of-the-art methods and datasets for wetland studies in Canada and will provide direction for future wetland mapping research.},

ABSTRACT = {Satellite–terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) are regarded as a promising solution to meeting the demands of global high-speed seamless network access in the future. Software-defined networking and network function virtualization (SDN/NFV) are two complementary technologies that can be used to ensure that the heterogeneous resources in STINs can be easily managed and deployed. Considering the dual mobility of satellites and ubiquitous users, along with the dynamic requirements of user requests and network resource states, it is challenging to maintain service continuity and high QoE performance in STINs. Thus, we investigate the service migration and reconfiguration scheme, which are of great significance to the guarantee of continuous service provisioning. Specifically, this paper proposes a dynamic service reconfiguration method that can support flexible service configurations on integrated networks, including LEO satellites and ground nodes. We first model the migration cost as an extra delay incurred by service migration and reconfiguration and then formulate the selection processes of the location and migration paths of virtual network functions (VNFs) as an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization problem. Then, we propose a fuzzy logic and quantum genetic algorithm (FQGA) to obtain an approximate optimal solution that can accelerate the solving process efficiently with the benefits of the high-performance computing capacity of QGA. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and improved performance of the scheme proposed in this paper.},

ABSTRACT = {When original aerial photographs are combined with deep learning to classify forest vegetation cover, these photographs are often hindered by the interlaced composition of complex backgrounds and vegetation types as well as the influence of different deep learning calculation processes, resulting in unpredictable training and test results. The purpose of this research is to evaluate (1) data preprocessing, (2) the number of classification targets, and (3) convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches combined with deep learning’s effects on high-resolution aerial photographs to identify forest and vegetation types. Data preprocessing is mainly composed of principal component analysis and content simplification (noise elimination). The number of classification targets is divided into 14 types of forest vegetation that are more complex and difficult to distinguish and seven types of forest vegetation that are simpler. We used CNN approaches to compare three CNN architectures: VGG19, ResNet50, and SegNet. This study found that the models had the best execution efficiency and classification accuracy after data preprocessing using principal component analysis. However, an increase in the number of classification targets significantly reduced the classification accuracy. The algorithm analysis showed that VGG19 achieved the best classification accuracy, but SegNet achieved the best performance and overall stability of relative convergence. This proves that data preprocessing helps identify forest and plant categories in aerial photographs with complex backgrounds. If combined with the appropriate CNN algorithm, these architectures will have great potential to replace high-cost on-site forestland surveys. At the end of this study, a user-friendly classification system for practical application is proposed, and its testing showed good results.},

ABSTRACT = {A large number of studies have been published addressing sugarcane management and monitoring to increase productivity and production as well as to better understand landscape dynamics and environmental threats. Building on existing reviews which mainly focused on the crop’s spectral behavior, a comprehensive review is provided which considers the progress made using novel data analysis techniques and improved data sources. To complement the available reviews, and to make the large body of research more easily accessible for both researchers and practitioners, in this review (i) we summarized remote sensing applications from 1981 to 2020, (ii) discussed key strengths and weaknesses of remote sensing approaches in the sugarcane context, and (iii) described the challenges and opportunities for future earth observation (EO)-based sugarcane monitoring and management. More than one hundred scientific studies were assessed regarding sugarcane mapping (52 papers), crop growth anomaly detection (11 papers), health monitoring (14 papers), and yield estimation (30 papers). The articles demonstrate that decametric satellite sensors such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 enable a reliable, cost-efficient, and timely mapping and monitoring of sugarcane by overcoming the ground sampling distance (GSD)-related limitations of coarser hectometric resolution data, while offering rich spectral information in the frequently recorded data. The Sentinel-2 constellation in particular provides fine spatial resolution at 10 m and high revisit frequency to support sugarcane management and other applications over large areas. For very small areas, and in particular for up-scaling and calibration purposes, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are also useful. Multi-temporal and multi-source data, together with powerful machine learning approaches such as the random forest (RF) algorithm, are key to providing efficient monitoring and mapping of sugarcane growth, health, and yield. A number of difficulties for sugarcane monitoring and mapping were identified that are also well known for other crops. Those difficulties relate mainly to the often (i) time consuming pre-processing of optical time series to cope with atmospheric perturbations and cloud coverage, (ii) the still important lack of analysis-ready-data (ARD), (iii) the diversity of environmental and growth conditions—even for a given country—under which sugarcane is grown, superimposing non-crop related radiometric information on the observed sugarcane crop, and (iv) the general ill-posedness of retrieval and classification approaches which adds ambiguity to the derived information.},

ABSTRACT = {The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) has been often used as a physiology-based remote sensing indicator of ecosystem carbon fluxes. However, the assessments of PRI in tracking long-term carbon fluxes with climatic anomalies in mangroves are very limited. In this study, four-year (2017–2020) continuous time series measurements from tower-based eddy covariance and spectral systems in a subtropical mangrove were used to explore the ability of PRI in tracking the response of mangrove carbon fluxes to climate fluctuations and drought stress. The results showed that the temporal dynamics of daily PRI and carbon fluxes shared similar variation patterns over the study period, experiencing simultaneously decreasing trends under drought stress. Compared with the first three years, annual mean values of NEE in 2020 decreased by 10.7% and PRI decreased by 29.0%, correspondingly. PRI and carbon fluxes were significantly correlated across diurnal, seasonal, and annual time scales with better fitness under drought stress. Dark-state PRI (PRI0), the constitutive component of PRI variation due to seasonally changing pigment pool size, showed similar temporal variation as PRI in response to drought stress, while delta PRI (ΔPRI), the facultative component of PRI variation due to diurnal xanthophyll cycle, showed no response to drought stress. This study confirms the ability of PRI to track temporal dynamics of mangrove carbon fluxes on both short-term and long-term scales, with the temporal variation of PRI largely affected by the long-term constitutive pigment pool size. This study highlights the potential of PRI to serve as an early and readily detectable indicator to track the response of the mangrove carbon cycle to climatic anomalies such as drought stress.},

ABSTRACT = {Salinization in arid or semiarid regions with water logging limits cropland yield, threatening food security. The highest level of farmland salinization, that is, abandoned salinized farmland, is a tradeoff between inadequate drainage facilities and sustainable farming. The evolution of abandoned salinized farmlands is closely related to the development of cropping systems. However, detecting abandoned salinized farmland using time-series remote sensing data has not been investigated well by previous studies. In this study, a novel approach was proposed to detect the dynamics of abandoned salinized farmland using time-series multispectral and thermal imagery. Thirty-two years of temporal Landsat imagery (from 1988 to 2019) was used to assess the evolution of salinization in Hetao, a two-thousand-year-old irrigation district in northern China. As intermediate variables of the proposed method, the crop-specific planting area was retrieved via its unique temporal vegetation index (VI) pattern, in which the shape-model-fitting technology and the K-means cluster algorithm were used. The desert area was stripped from the clustered non-vegetative area using its distinct features in the thermal band. Subsequently, the abandoned salinized farmland was distinguished from the urban area by the threshold-based saline index (SI). In addition, a regression model between electrical conductance (EC) and SI was established, and the spatial saline degree was evaluated by the SI map in uncropped and unfrozen seasons. The results show that the cropland has constantly been expanding in recent decades (from 4.7 × 105 ha to 7.1 × 105 ha), while the planting area of maize and sunflower has grown and the area of wheat has decreased. Significant desalinization progress was observed in Hetao, where both the area of salt-affected land (salt-free area increased approximately 4 × 105 ha) and the abandoned salinized farmland decreased (reduced from 0.45 × 105 ha to 0.19 × 105 ha). This could be mainly attributed to three reasons: the popularization of water-saving irrigation technology, the construction of artificial drainage facilities, and a shift in cropping patterns. The decrease in irrigation and the increase in drainage have deepened the groundwater table in Hetao, which weakens the salt collection capacity of the abandoned salinized farmland. The results demonstrate the promising possibility of reutilizing abandoned salinized farmland via a leaching campaign where the groundwater table is sufficiently deep to stop salinization.},

ABSTRACT = {As one of the most devastating disasters to pine forests, pine wilt disease (PWD) has caused tremendous ecological and economic losses in China. An effective way to prevent large-scale PWD outbreaks is to detect and remove the damaged pine trees at the early stage of PWD infection. However, early infected pine trees do not show obvious changes in morphology or color in the visible wavelength range, making early detection of PWD tricky. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral imagery (HI) has great potential for early detection of PWD. However, the commonly used methods, such as the two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN), fail to simultaneously extract and fully utilize the spatial and spectral information, whereas the three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) is able to collect this information from raw hyperspectral data. In this paper, we applied the residual block to 3D-CNN and constructed a 3D-Res CNN model, the performance of which was then compared with that of 3D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and 2D-Res CNN in identifying PWD-infected pine trees from the hyperspectral images. The 3D-Res CNN model outperformed the other models, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 88.11% and an accuracy of 72.86% for detecting early infected pine trees (EIPs). Using only 20% of the training samples, the OA and EIP accuracy of 3D-Res CNN can still achieve 81.06% and 51.97%, which is superior to the state-of-the-art method in the early detection of PWD based on hyperspectral images. Collectively, 3D-Res CNN was more accurate and effective in early detection of PWD. In conclusion, 3D-Res CNN is proposed for early detection of PWD in this paper, making the prediction and control of PWD more accurate and effective. This model can also be applied to detect pine trees damaged by other diseases or insect pests in the forest.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral remote sensing technologies have unique advantages in high-precision quantitative analysis of non-contact water surface source concentration. Improving the accuracy of non-point source detection is a difficult engineering problem. To facilitate water surface remote sensing, imaging, and spectral analysis activities, a UAV-based hyperspectral imaging remote sensing system was designed. Its prototype was built, and laboratory calibration and a joint air–ground water quality monitoring activity were performed. The hyperspectral imaging remote sensing system of UAV comprised a light and small UAV platform, spectral scanning hyperspectral imager, and data acquisition and control unit. The spectral principle of the hyperspectral imager is based on the new high-performance acousto-optic tunable (AOTF) technology. During laboratory calibration, the spectral calibration of the imaging spectrometer and image preprocessing in data acquisition were completed. In the UAV air–ground joint experiment, combined with the typical water bodies of the Yangtze River mainstream, the Three Gorges demonstration area, and the Poyang Lake demonstration area, the hyperspectral data cubes of the corresponding water areas were obtained, and geometric registration was completed. Thus, a large field-of-view mosaic and water radiation calibration were realized. A chlorophyl-a (Chl-a) sensor was used to test the actual water control points, and 11 traditional Chl-a sensitive spectrum selection algorithms were analyzed and compared. A random forest algorithm was used to establish a prediction model of water surface spectral reflectance and water quality parameter concentration. Compared with the back propagation neural network, partial least squares, and PSO-LSSVM algorithms, the accuracy of the RF algorithm in predicting Chl-a was significantly improved. The determination coefficient of the training samples was 0.84; root mean square error, 3.19 μg/L; and mean absolute percentage error, 5.46%. The established Chl-a inversion model was applied to UAV hyperspectral remote sensing images. The predicted Chl-a distribution agreed with the field observation results, indicating that the UAV-borne hyperspectral remote sensing water quality monitoring system based on AOTF is a promising remote sensing imaging spectral analysis tool for water.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last few years, jargon, such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), have been ubiquitous in both popular science media as well as the academic literature. Many industries have tried the current suite of ML and AI algorithms with various degrees of success. Mineral processing, as an industry, is looking at AI for two reasons. First of all, as with other industries, it is pertinent to know if AI algorithms can be used to enhance productivity. The second reason is specific to the mining industry. Of late, the grade of ores is reducing, and the demand for ethical mining (with as little effect on ecology as possible) is increasing. Thus, mineral processing industries also want to explore the possible use of AI in solving these challenges. In this review paper, first, the challenges in mineral processing that can potentially be solved by AI are presented. Then, some of the most pertinent developments in the domain of ML and AI (applied in the domain of mineral processing) are discussed. Lastly, a top-level modus operandi is presented for a mineral processing industry that might want to explore the possibilities of using AI in its processes. Following are some of the new paradigms added by this review. This review presents a holistic view of the domain of mineral processing with an AI lens. It is also one of the first reviews in this domain to thoroughly discuss the use of AI in ethical, green, and sustainable mineral processing. The AI process proposed in this paper is a comprehensive one. To ensure the relevance to industry, the flow was made agile with the spiral system engineering flow. This is expected to drive rapid and agile investigation of the potential of applying ML and AI in different mineral processing industries.},

ABSTRACT = {Eucalyptus is a diverse genus from which several species are often deployed for commercial industrial tree plantation due to their desirable wood properties for utilization in both solid wood and fiber products, as well as their growth and productivity in many environments. In this study, a method for monitoring the health status of a 22.78 ha Eucalyptus pellita plantation stand was developed using the red-green-blue channels captured using an unmanned aerial vehicle. The ortho-image was generated, and visual atmospheric resistance index (VARI) indices were developed. Herein, four classification levels of pest and disease were generated using the VARI-green algorithm. The range of normalized VARI-green indices was between −2.0 and 2.0. The results identified seven dead trees (VARI-green index −2 to 0), five trees that were severely infected (VARI-green index 0 to 0.05), 967 trees that were mildly infected (VARI-green index 0.06 to 0.16), and 10,090 trees that were considered healthy (VARI-green index 0.17 to 2.00). The VARI-green indices were verified by manual ground-truthing and by comparison with normalized difference vegetation index which showed a mean correlation of 0.73. This study has shown practical application of aerial survey of a large-scale operational area of industrial tree plantation via low-cost UAV and RGB camera, to analyze VARI-green images in the detection of pest and disease.},

ABSTRACT = {Integrating the representation of the territory, through airborne remote sensing activities with hyperspectral and visible sensors, and managing complex data through dimensionality reduction for the identification of cannabis plantations, in Albania, is the focus of the research proposed by the multidisciplinary group of the Benecon University Consortium. In this study, principal components analysis (PCA) was used to remove redundant spectral information from multiband datasets. This makes it easier to identify the most prevalent spectral characteristics in most bands and those that are specific to only a few bands. The survey and airborne monitoring by hyperspectral sensors is carried out with an Itres CASI 1500 sensor owned by Benecon, characterized by a spectral range of 380–1050 nm and 288 configurable channels. The spectral configuration adopted for the research was developed specifically to maximize the spectral separability of cannabis. The ground resolution of the georeferenced cartographic data varies according to the flight planning, inserted in the aerial platform of an Italian Guardia di Finanza’s aircraft, in relation to the orography of the sites under investigation. The geodatabase, wherein the processing of hyperspectral and visible images converge, contains ancillary data such as digital aeronautical maps, digital terrain models, color orthophoto, topographic data and in any case a significant amount of data so that they can be processed synergistically. The goal is to create maps and predictive scenarios, through the application of the spectral angle mapper algorithm, of the cannabis plantations scattered throughout the area. The protocol consists of comparing the spectral data acquired with the CASI1500 airborne sensor and the spectral signature of the cannabis leaves that have been acquired in the laboratory with ASD Fieldspec PRO FR spectrometers. These scientific studies have demonstrated how it is possible to achieve ex ante control of the evolution of the phenomenon itself for monitoring the cultivation of cannabis plantations.},

ABSTRACT = {The concept of vehicle automation is a promising approach to achieve sustainable transport systems, especially in an urban context. Automation requires the integration of learning-based approaches and methods in control theory. Through the integration, a high amount of information in automation can be incorporated. Thus, a sustainable operation, i.e., energy-efficient and safe motion with automated vehicles, can be achieved. Despite the advantages of integration with learning-based approaches, enhanced vehicle automation poses crucial safety challenges. In this paper, a novel closed-loop matching method for control-oriented purposes in the context of vehicle control systems is presented. The goal of the method is to match the nonlinear vehicle dynamics to the dynamics of a linear system in a predefined structure; thus, a control-oriented model is obtained. The matching is achieved by an additional control input from a neural network, which is designed based on the input–output signals of the nonlinear vehicle system. In this paper, the process of closed-loop matching, i.e., the dataset generation, the training, and the evaluation of the neural network, is proposed. The evaluation process of the neural network through data-driven reachability analysis and statistical performance analysis methods is carried out. The proposed method is applied to achieve the path following functionality, in which the nonlinearities of the lateral vehicle dynamics are handled. The effectiveness of the closed-loop matching and the designed control functionality through high fidelity CarMaker simulations is illustrated.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate fruit segmentation in images is the prerequisite and key step for precision agriculture. In this article, aiming at the segmentation of grape cluster with different varieties, 3 state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks, i.e., Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), U-Net, and DeepLabv3+ applied on six different datasets were studied. We investigated: (1) the segmentation performance difference of the 3 studied networks; (2) The impact of different input representations on segmentation performance; (3) The effect of image enhancement method to improve the poor illumination of images and further improve the segmentation performance; (4) The impact of the distance between grape clusters and camera on segmentation performance. The experiment results show that compared with FCN and U-Net the DeepLabv3+ combined with transfer learning is more suitable for the task with an intersection over union (IoU) of 84.26%. Five different input representations, namely RGB, HSV, L*a*b, HHH, and YCrCb obtained different IoU, ranging from 81.5% to 88.44%. Among them, the L*a*b got the highest IoU. Besides, the adopted Histogram Equalization (HE) image enhancement method could improve the model’s robustness against poor illumination conditions. Through the HE preprocessing, the IoU of the enhanced dataset increased by 3.88%, from 84.26% to 88.14%. The distance between the target and camera also affects the segmentation performance, no matter in which dataset, the closer the distance, the better the segmentation performance was. In a word, the conclusion of this research provides some meaningful suggestions for the study of grape or other fruit segmentation.},

ABSTRACT = {Ongoing urban expansion has accelerated the explosive growth of urban populations and has led to a dramatic increase in the impervious surface area within urban areas. This, in turn, has exacerbated the surface heat island effect within cities. However, the importance of the surface heat island effect within urban areas, scilicet the intra-SUHI effect, has attracted less concern. The aim of this study was to quantitatively explore the relationship between the spatial heterogeneity of a built environment and the intra-urban surface heat island (intra-SUHI) effect using the thermally sharpened land surface temperature (LST) and high-resolution land-use classification products. The results show that at the land parcel scale, the parcel-based relative intensity of intra-SUHI should be attributed to the land parcels featured with differential land developmental intensity. Furthermore, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling quantified the relative importance of the spatial heterogeneity indices of the built environment that exhibit a negative contribution to decreasing the parcel-based intra-SUHI effect or a positive contribution to increasing the intra-SUHI effect. Finally, based on the findings of this study, some practical countermeasures towards mitigating the adverse intra-SUHI effect and improving urban climatic adaption are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Determining maize water content variability is necessary for crop monitoring and in developing early warning systems to optimise agricultural production in smallholder farms. However, spatially explicit information on maize water content, particularly in Southern Africa, remains elementary due to the shortage of efficient and affordable primary sources of suitable spatial data at a local scale. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), equipped with light-weight multispectral sensors, provide spatially explicit, near-real-time information for determining the maize crop water status at farm scale. Therefore, this study evaluated the utility of UAV-derived multispectral imagery and machine learning techniques in estimating maize leaf water indicators: equivalent water thickness (EWT), fuel moisture content (FMC), and specific leaf area (SLA). The results illustrated that both NIR and red-edge derived spectral variables were critical in characterising the maize water indicators on smallholder farms. Furthermore, the best models for estimating EWT, FMC, and SLA were derived from the random forest regression (RFR) algorithm with an rRMSE of 3.13%, 1%, and 3.48%, respectively. Additionally, EWT and FMC yielded the highest predictive performance and were the most optimal indicators of maize leaf water content. The findings are critical towards developing a robust and spatially explicit monitoring framework of maize water status and serve as a proxy of crop health and the overall productivity of smallholder maize farms.},

ABSTRACT = {Boulders on the seabed in coastal marine environments provide key geo- and ecosystem functions and services. They serve as natural coastal protection by dissipating wave energy, and they form an important hard substrate for macroalgae, and hence for coastal marine reefs that serve as important habitats for fish. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of developing an automated method to classify boulders from topo-bathymetric LiDAR data in coastal marine environments. The Rødsand lagoon in Denmark was used as study area. A 100 m × 100 m test site was divided into a training and a test set. The classification was performed using the random forest machine learning algorithm. Different tuning parameters were tested. The study resulted in the development of a nearly automated method to classify boulders from topo-bathymetric LiDAR data. Different measure scores were used to evaluate the performance. For the best parameter combination, the recall of the boulders was 57%, precision was 27%, and F-score 37%, while the accuracy of the points was 99%. The most important tuning parameters for boulder classification were the subsampling level, the choice of the neighborhood radius, and the features. Automatic boulder detection will enable transparent, reproducible, and fast detection and mapping of boulders.},

ABSTRACT = {With the growing concern about the spread of new respiratory infectious diseases, several studies involving the application of technology in the prevention of these diseases have been carried out. Among these studies, it is worth highlighting the importance of those focused on the primary forms of prevention, such as social distancing, mask usage, quarantine, among others. This importance arises because, from the emergence of a new disease to the production of immunizers, preventive actions must be taken to reduce contamination and fatalities rates. Despite the considerable number of studies, no records of works aimed at the identification, registration, selection, and rigorous analysis and synthesis of the literature were found. For this purpose, this paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the application of technological solutions in the primary ways of respiratory infectious diseases transmission prevention. From the 1139 initially retrieved, 219 papers were selected for data extraction, analysis, and synthesis according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results enabled the identification of a general categorization of application domains, as well as mapping of the adopted support mechanisms. Findings showed a greater trend in studies related to pandemic planning and, among the support mechanisms adopted, data and mathematical application-related solutions received greater attention. Topics for further research and improvement were also identified such as the need for a better description of data analysis and evidence.},

ABSTRACT = {Irrigation represents one of the most impactful human interventions in the terrestrial water cycle. Knowing the distribution and extent of irrigated areas as well as the amount of water used for irrigation plays a central role in modeling irrigation water requirements and quantifying the impact of irrigation on regional climate, river discharge, and groundwater depletion. Obtaining high-quality global information about irrigation is challenging, especially in terms of quantification of the water actually used for irrigation. Here, we review existing Earth observation datasets, models, and algorithms used for irrigation mapping and quantification from the field to the global scale. The current observation capacities are confronted with the results of a survey on user requirements on satellite-observed irrigation for agricultural water resources’ management. Based on this information, we identify current shortcomings of irrigation monitoring capabilities from space and phrase guidelines for potential future satellite missions and observation strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Weeds are among the most harmful abiotic factors in agriculture, triggering significant yield loss worldwide. Remote sensing can detect and map the presence of weeds in various spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. This review aims to show the current and future trends of UAV applications in weed detection in the crop field. This study systematically searched the original articles published from 1 January 2016 to 18 June 2021 in the databases of Scopus, ScienceDirect, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux (CAB) Direct, and Web of Science (WoS) using Boolean string: “weed” AND “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle” OR “UAV” OR “drone”. Out of the papers identified, 144 eligible studies did meet our inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Most of the studies (i.e., 27.42%) on weed detection were carried out during the seedling stage of the growing cycle for the crop. Most of the weed images were captured using red, green, and blue (RGB) camera, i.e., 48.28% and main classification algorithm was machine learning techniques, i.e., 47.90%. This review initially highlighted articles from the literature that includes the crops’ typical phenology stage, reference data, type of sensor/camera, classification methods, and current UAV applications in detecting and mapping weed for different types of crop. This study then provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of each sensor and algorithm and tries to identify research gaps by providing a brief outlook at the potential areas of research concerning the benefit of this technology in agricultural industries. Integrated weed management, coupled with UAV application improves weed monitoring in a more efficient and environmentally-friendly way. Overall, this review demonstrates the scientific information required to achieve sustainable weed management, so as to implement UAV platform in the real agricultural contexts.},

ABSTRACT = {Considering variations in surface soil moisture (SSM) is essential in improving crop yield and irrigation scheduling. Today, most remotely sensed soil moisture products have difficulties in resolving irrigation signals at the plot scale. This study aims to use Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to estimate SSM at high spatial (10 m) and temporal resolution (at least 5 days) over an agricultural domain. Three supervised machine learning algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and linear regression models, were trained to estimate changes in SSM based on the variation in surface reflectance and backscatter over five different crops. Results showed that CNN is the best algorithm as it understands spatial relations and better represents two-dimensional images. Estimated values for SSM were in agreement with in-situ measurements regardless of the crop type, with RMSE=0.0292&nbsp;(cm3/cm3) and R2=0.92 for the Sentinel-2 derived SSM and RMSE=0.0317&nbsp;(cm3/cm3) and R2=0.84 for the Sentinel-1 soil moisture data. Moreover, a time series of estimated SSM based on Sentinel-1 (SSM-S1), Sentinel-2 (SSM-S2), and SSM derived from SMAP-Sentinel1 was compared. The developed SSM data showed a significantly higher mean SSM state over irrigated agriculture relative to the rainfed cropland area during the irrigation season. The multiple comparisons (fisher LSD) were tested and found that these two groups are different (pvalue=0.035 in 95% confidence interval). Therefore, by employing the maximum likelihood classification on the SSM data, we managed to map the irrigated agriculture. The overall accuracy of this unsupervised classification is 77%, with a kappa coefficient of 65%.},

ABSTRACT = {Ship motion planning constitutes the most critical part in the autonomous navigation systems of marine autonomous surface ships (MASS). Weather and ocean conditions can significantly affect their navigation, but there are relatively few studies on the influence of wind and current on motion planning. This study investigates the motion planning problem for USV, wherein the goal is to obtain an optimal path under the interference of the navigation environment (wind and current), and control the USV in order to avoid obstacles and arrive at its destination without collision. In this process, the influences of search efficiency, navigation safety and energy consumption on motion planning are taken into consideration. Firstly, the navigation environment is constructed by integrating information, including the electronic navigational chart, wind and current field. Based on the environmental interference factors, the three-degree-of-freedom kinematic model of USVs is created, and the multi-objective optimization and complex constraints are reasonably expressed to establish the corresponding optimization model. A multi-objective optimization algorithm based on HA* is proposed after considering the constraints of motion and dynamic and optimization objectives. Simulation verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm, where an efficient, safe and economical path is obtained and is more in line with the needs of practical application.},

ABSTRACT = {The survival rate of seedlings is a decisive factor of afforestation assessment. Generally, ground checking is more accurate than any other methods. However, the survival rate of seedlings can be higher in the growing season, and this can be estimated in a larger area at a relatively lower cost by extracting the tree crown from the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, which provides an opportunity for monitoring afforestation in an extensive area. At present, studies on extracting individual tree crowns under the complex ground vegetation conditions are limited. Based on the afforestation images obtained by airborne consumer-grade cameras in central China, this study proposes a method of extracting and fusing multiple radii morphological features to obtain the potential crown. A random forest (RF) was used to identify the regions extracted from the images, and then the recognized crown regions were fused selectively according to the distance. A low-cost individual crown recognition framework was constructed for rapid checking of planted trees. The method was tested in two afforestation areas of 5950 m2 and 5840 m2, with a population of 2418 trees (Koelreuteria) in total. Due to the complex terrain of the sample plot, high weed coverage, the crown width of trees, and spacing of saplings vary greatly, which increases both the difficulty and complexity of crown extraction. Nevertheless, recall and F-score of the proposed method reached 93.29%, 91.22%, and 92.24% precisions, respectively, and 2212 trees were correctly recognized and located. The results show that the proposed method is robust to the change of brightness and to splitting up of a multi-directional tree crown, and is an automatic solution for afforestation verification.},

ABSTRACT = {Detecting and quantifying methane emissions is gaining an increasingly vital role in mitigating emissions for the oil and gas industry through early detection and repair and will aide our understanding of how emissions in natural ecosystems are playing a role in the global carbon cycle and its impact on the climate. Traditional methods of measuring and quantifying emissions utilize chamber methods, bagging individual equipment, or require the release of a tracer gas. Advanced leak detection techniques have been developed over the past few years, utilizing technologies, such as optical gas imaging, mobile surveyors equipped with sensitive cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS), and manned aircraft and satellite approaches. More recently, sUAS-based approaches have been developed to provide, in some ways, cheaper alternatives that also offer sensing advantages to traditional methods, including not being constrained to roadways and being able to access class G airspace (0–400 ft) where manned aviation cannot travel. This work looks at reviewing methods of quantifying methane emissions that can be, or are, carried out using small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) as well as traditional methods to provide a clear comparison for future practitioners. This includes the current limitations, capabilities, assumptions, and survey details. The suggested technique for LDAQ depends on the desired accuracy and is a function of the survey time and survey distance. Based on the complexity and precision, the most promising sUAS methods are the near-field Gaussian plume inversion (NGI) and the vertical flux plane (VFP), which have comparable accuracy to those found in conventional state-of-the-art methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of applications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is increasing. The use of UAVs in swarms makes many operators see more advantages than the individual use of UAVs, thus reducing operational time and costs. The main objective of this work is to design a system that, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) techniques, can obtain a good path for each UAV in the swarm and distribute the flight environment in such a way that the combination of the captured images is as simple as possible. To determine whether it is better to use a global ANN or multiple local ANNs, experiments have been done over the same map and with different numbers of UAVs at different altitudes. The results are measured based on the time taken to find a solution. The results show that the system works with any number of UAVs if the map is correctly partitioned. On the other hand, using local ANNs seems to be the option that can find solutions faster, ensuring better trajectories than using a single global network. There is no need to use additional map information other than the current state of the environment, like targets or distance maps.},

ABSTRACT = {Agriculture is the principal basis of livelihood that acts as a mainstay of any country. There are several changes faced by the farmers due to various factors such as water shortage, undefined price owing to demand–supply, weather uncertainties, and inaccurate crop prediction. The prediction of crop yield, notably paddy yield, is an intricate assignment owing to its dependency on several factors such as crop genotype, environmental factors, management practices, and their interactions. Researchers are used to predicting the paddy yield using statistical approaches, but they failed to attain higher accuracy due to several factors. Therefore, machine learning methods such as support vector regression (SVR), general regression neural networks (GRNNs), radial basis functional neural networks (RBFNNs), and back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs) are demonstrated to predict the paddy yield accurately for the Cauvery Delta Zone (CDZ), which lies in the eastern part of Tamil Nadu, South India. The performance of each developed model is examined using assessment metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of variance (CV), and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). The observed results show that the GRNN algorithm delivers superior evaluation metrics such as R2, RMSE, MAE, MSE, MAPE, CV, and NSME values about 0.9863, 0.2295 and 0.1290, 0.0526, 1.3439, 0.0255, and 0.0136, respectively, which ensures accurate crop yield prediction compared with other methods. Finally, the performance of the GRNN model is compared with other available models from several studies in the literature, and it is found to be high while comparing the prediction accuracy using evaluation metrics.},

ABSTRACT = {The accurate detection and timely replacement of abnormal vibration dampers on transmission lines are critical for the safe and stable operation of power systems. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become widely used to inspect transmission lines. In this paper, we constructed a data set of abnormal vibration dampers (DAVDs) on transmission lines in images obtained by UAVs. There are four types of vibration dampers in this data set, and each vibration damper may be rusty, defective, or normal. The challenges in the detection of abnormal vibration dampers on transmission lines in the images captured by UAVs were as following: the images had a high resolution as well as the objects of vibration dampers were relatively small and sparsely distributed, and the backgrounds of cross stage partial networks of the images were complex due to the fact that the transmission lines were erected in a variety of outdoor environments. Existing methods of ground-based object detection significantly reduced the accuracy when dealing with complex backgrounds and small objects of abnormal vibration dampers detection. To address these issues, we proposed an end-to-end parallel mixed attention You Only Look Once (PMA-YOLO) network to improve the detection performance for abnormal vibration dampers. The parallel mixed attention (PMA) module was introduced and integrated into the YOLOv4 network. This module combines a channel attention block and a spatial attention block, and the convolution results of the input feature maps in parallel, allowing the network to pay more attention to critical regions of abnormal vibration dampers in complex background images. Meanwhile, in view of the problem that abnormal vibration dampers are prone to missing detections, we analyzed the scale and ratio of the ground truth boxes and used the K-means algorithm to re-cluster new anchors for abnormal vibration dampers in images. In addition, we introduced a multi-stage transfer learning strategy to improve the efficiency of the original training method and prevent overfitting by the network. The experimental results showed that the mAP@0.5 for PMA-YOLO in the detection of abnormal vibration dampers reached 93.8% on the test set of DAVD, 3.5% higher than that of YOLOv4. When the multi-stage transfer learning strategy was used, the mAP@0.5 was improved by a further 0.2%.},

ABSTRACT = {Collaborative exploration, sensing and communication in previously unknown environments with high network latency, such as outer space, battlefields and disaster hit areas are promising in multi-agent applications. When disasters such as large fires or natural disasters occur, previously established networks might be destroyed or incapacitated. In these cases, multiple autonomous mobile robots (AMR) or autonomous unmanned ground vehicles carrying wireless devices and/or thermal sensors can be deployed to create an end-to-end communication and sensing coverage to support rescue efforts or access the severity of damage. However, a fundamental problem is how to rapidly deploy these mobile agents in such complex and dynamic environments. The uncertainties introduced by the operational environment and wide range of scheduling problem have made solving them as a whole challenging. In this paper, we present an efficient decentralized approach for practical mobile agents deployment in unknown, burnt or disaster hit areas. Specifically, we propose an approach that combines methods from Artificial Immune System (AIS) with special token messages passing for a team of interconnected AMR to decide who, when and how to act during deployment process. A distributed scheme is adopted, where each AMR makes its movement decisions based on its local observation and a special token it receives from its neighbors. Empirical evidence of robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulation.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of 5G communications, enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine type communications and ultra-reliable low latency communications are widely supported. However, a 5G communication system is still based on Shannon’s information theory, while the meaning and value of information itself are not taken into account in the process of transmission. Therefore, it is difficult to meet the requirements of intelligence, customization, and value transmission of 6G networks. In order to solve the above challenges, we propose a 6G mailbox theory, namely a cognitive information carrier to enable distributed algorithm embedding for intelligence networking. Based on Mailbox, a 6G network will form an intelligent agent with self-organization, self-learning, self-adaptation, and continuous evolution capabilities. With the intelligent agent, redundant transmission of data can be reduced while the value transmission of information can be improved. Then, the features of mailbox principle are introduced, including polarity, traceability, dynamics, convergence, figurability, and dependence. Furthermore, key technologies with which value transmission of information can be realized are introduced, including knowledge graph, distributed learning, and blockchain. Finally, we establish a cognitive communication system assisted by deep learning. The experimental results show that, compared with a traditional communication system, our communication system performs less data transmission quantity and error.},

ABSTRACT = {Effectively monitoring Pantana phyllostachysae Chao (PPC) is essential for the sustainable development of the bamboo industry. However, the morphological similarity between damaged and off-year bamboo imposes challenges in the monitoring. The knowledge on whether the severity of this pest could be effectively monitored by using remote sensing methods is very limited. To fill this gap, this study aimed to identify the PPC damage of moso bamboo leaves using hyperspectral data. Specifically, we investigated differences in relative chlorophyll content (RCC), leaf water content (LWC), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), and hyperspectral spectrum among healthy, damaged (mildly damage, moderately damage, severely damage), and off-year bamboo leaves. Then, the hyperspectral indices sensitive to pest damage were selected by recursive feature elimination (RFE). The PPC damage identification model was constructed using the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) algorithm. We designed two different scenarios, without (A) and with (B) off-year samples, to evaluate the impact of off-year leaves on identification results. The RCC, the LWC, and the LNC of damaged leaves generally showed clear declined trends with the deterioration of damaged severity. The RCC and the LNC of off-year leaves were significantly lower than those of healthy and damaged leaves, whereas the LWC of off-leaves was significantly different from that of damaged leaves. The pest infestation caused noticeable distortion of leaf spectrum, increases in red and shortwave infrared bands, and decreases in green and near-infrared bands. The magnitude of reflectance change increased with the pest severity. The reflectance of off-year leaves in visible and near-infrared regions was distinguishably higher than that of healthy and damaged leaves. The overall accuracy (OA) of the constructed model for the identification of leaves with different degrees of damage severity reached 81.51%. When off-year, healthy, and damaged leaves were lumped together, the OA of the constructed model decreased by 5%. About half of the off-year leaf samples were misclassified into the damaged group. The identification of off-year leaves is a challenge for monitoring PPC damage using hyperspectral data. These results can provide practical guidance for monitoring PPC using remote sensing methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The widespread use of mobile devices and sensors has motivated data-driven applications that can leverage the power of big data to benefit many aspects of our daily life, such as health, transportation, economy, and environment. Under the context of smart city, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), as a main building block of modern cities, and edge computing (EC), as an emerging computing service that targets addressing the limitations of cloud computing, have attracted increasing attention in the research community in recent years. It is well believed that the application of EC in ITS will have considerable benefits to transportation systems regarding efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Despite the growing trend in ITS and EC research, a big gap in the existing literature is identified: the intersection between these two promising directions has been far from well explored. In this paper, we focus on a critical part of ITS, i.e., sensing, and conducting a review on the recent advances in ITS sensing and EC applications in this field. The key challenges in ITS sensing and future directions with the integration of edge computing are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Sensor data streams often represent signals/trajectories which are twice differentiable (e.g., to give a continuous velocity and acceleration), and this property must be reflected in their segmentation. An adaptive streaming algorithm for this problem is presented. It is based on the greedy look-ahead strategy and is built on the concept of a cubic splinelet. A characteristic feature of the proposed algorithm is the real-time simultaneous segmentation, smoothing, and compression of data streams. The segmentation quality is measured in terms of the signal approximation accuracy and the corresponding compression ratio. The numerical results show the relatively high compression ratios (from 135 to 208, i.e., compressed stream sizes up to 208 times smaller) combined with the approximation errors comparable to those obtained from the state-of-the-art global reference algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be applied to various domains, including online compression and/or smoothing of data streams coming from sensors, real-time IoT analytics, and embedded time-series databases.},

ABSTRACT = {Localization and mapping technologies are of great importance for all varieties of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to perform their operations. In the near future, it is planned to increase the use of micro/nano-size UAVs. Such vehicles are sometimes expendable platforms, and reuse may not be possible. Compact, mounted and low-cost cameras are preferred in these UAVs due to weight, cost and size limitations. Visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) methods are used for providing situational awareness of micro/nano-size UAVs. Fast rotational movements that occur during flight with gimbal-free, mounted cameras cause motion blur. Above a certain level of motion blur, tracking losses exist, which causes vSLAM algorithms not to operate effectively. In this study, a novel vSLAM framework is proposed that prevents the occurrence of tracking losses in micro/nano-UAVs due to the motion blur. In the proposed framework, the blur level of the frames obtained from the platform camera is determined and the frames whose focus measure score is below the threshold are restored by specific motion-deblurring methods. The major reasons of tracking losses have been analyzed with experimental studies, and vSLAM algorithms have been made durable by our studied framework. It has been observed that our framework can prevent tracking losses at 5, 10 and 20 fps processing speeds. vSLAM algorithms continue to normal operations at those processing speeds that have not been succeeded before using standard vSLAM algorithms, which can be considered as a superiority of our study.},

ABSTRACT = {The behaviour of traditional roofs affects issues relating to sustainability, zero-carbon targets, and Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. This paper discusses an innovative approach towards understanding the behaviour of porous, and other types, of roofs in Malta in relation to temperature and moisture characteristics, and to project this behaviour onto a changing climate, predicted to be hotter and drier. The new methodology is being trialled on four roof types, on historic buildings, the innovation being the use of data from co-temporal Earth Observations (EO) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in conjunction with in-situ data. This research is helping to develop a new application for Remote Sensing in Cultural Heritage; results should enable recommendations for sustainable use of traditional roof-building techniques. The initial results show that the traditional roof has different (reflective and emissive) properties from the hybrid roof, that are being detected from space, complemented with UAV, hand-held thermal camera and in-situ measurements. These results are preliminary; satellite images for spring/early summer and mid-summer and the corresponding UAV images are expected to provide more conclusive information. These promising results should enable the proof-of-concept to progress onto a larger number and greater variety of roof types, even in other Mediterranean countries.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, the world is facing high competition and market risks in improving yield, crop illness, and crop water stress. This could potentially be addressed by technological advancements in the form of precision systems, improvements in production, and through ensuring the sustainability of development. In this context, remote-sensing systems are fully equipped to address the complex and technical assessment of crop production, security, and crop water stress in an easy and efficient way. They provide simple and timely solutions for a diverse set of ecological zones. This critical review highlights novel methods for evaluating crop water stress and its correlation with certain measurable parameters, investigated using remote-sensing systems. Through an examination of previous literature, technologies, and data, we review the application of remote-sensing systems in the analysis of crop water stress. Initially, the study presents the relationship of relative water content (RWC) with equivalent water thickness (EWT) and soil moisture crop water stress. Evapotranspiration and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence are then analyzed in relation to crop water stress using remote sensing. Finally, the study presents various remote-sensing technologies used to detect crop water stress, including optical sensing systems, thermometric sensing systems, land-surface temperature-sensing systems, multispectral (spaceborne and airborne) sensing systems, hyperspectral sensing systems, and the LiDAR sensing system. The study also presents the future prospects of remote-sensing systems in analyzing crop water stress and how they could be further improved.},

ABSTRACT = {The interest in visual-based surveillance systems, especially in natural disaster applications, such as flood detection and monitoring, has increased due to the blooming of surveillance technology. In this work, semantic segmentation based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) was proposed to identify water regions from the surveillance images. This work presented two well-established deep learning algorithms, DeepLabv3+ and SegNet networks, and evaluated their performances using several evaluation metrics. Overall, both networks attained high accuracy when compared to the measurement data but the DeepLabv3+ network performed better than the SegNet network, achieving over 90% for overall accuracy and IoU metrics, and around 80% for boundary F1 score (BF score), respectively. When predicting new images using both trained networks, the results show that both networks successfully distinguished water regions from the background but the outputs from DeepLabv3+ were more accurate than the results from the SegNet network. Therefore, the DeepLabv3+ network was used for practical application using a set of images captured at five consecutive days in the study area. The segmentation result and water level markers extracted from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data were overlaid to estimate river water levels and observe the water fluctuation. River water levels were predicted based on the elevation from the predefined markers. The proposed water level framework was evaluated according to Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient was 0.91, which indicates a strong relationship between the estimated water level and observed water level. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the proposed approach has high potential as an alternative monitoring system that offers water region information and water level estimation for flood management and related activities.},

ABSTRACT = {Visual inspections are performed to investigate cracks in concrete infrastructure. These activities require manpower or equipment such as articulated ladders. Additionally, there are health and safety issues because some structures have low accessibility. To deal with these problems, crack measurement with digital images and digital image processing (DIP) techniques have been adopted in various studies. The objective of this experimental study is to evaluate the optical limit of digital camera lenses as working distance increases. Three different lenses and two digital cameras were used to capture images of lines ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mm in thickness. As a result of the experiments, it was found that many elements affect width measurement. However, crack width measurement is dependent on the measured pixel values. To accurately measure width, the measured pixel values must be in decimal units, but that is theoretically impossible. According to the results, in the case of 0.3 mm wide or wider cracks, a working distance of 1 m was secured when the focal length was 50 mm, and working distances of 3 m and 4 m were secured when the focal length was 100 mm and 135 mm, respectively. However, for cracks not wider than 0.1 mm, focal lengths of 100 mm and 135 mm showed measurability within 1 m, but a focal length of 50 mm was judged to hardly enable measurement except for certain working positions. Field measurement tests were conducted to verify measurement parameters identified by the results of the indoor experiment. The widths of actual cracks were measured through visual inspection and used for the analysis. From the evaluation, it was confirmed that the number of pixels corresponding to the working distance had a great influence on crack width measurement accuracy when using image processing. Therefore, the optimal distance and measurement guidelines required for the measurement of the size of certain objects was presented for the imaging equipment and optical equipment applied in this study.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the major concerns in 5G IoT networks is that most of the sensor nodes are powered through limited lifetime, which seriously affects the performance of the networks. In this article, Compressive sensing (CS) technique is used to decrease transmission cost in 5G IoT networks. Sparse basis is one of the important steps in the CS. However, most of the existing sparse basis-based method such as DCT (Discrete cosine transform) and DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) basis do not capture data structure characteristics in the networks. They also do not take into consideration multi-resolution representations. In addition, some of sparse basis-driven methods exploit either spatial or temporal features, resulting in performance degradation of CS-based strategies. To address these challenging problems, we propose a novel spatial–temporal correlation basis algorithm (SCBA). Subsequently, an optimal basis algorithm (OBA) is provided considering greedy scoring criteria. To evaluate the efficiency of OBA, orthogonal wavelet basis algorithm (OWBA) by employing NS (Numerical Sparsity) and GI (Gini Index) sparse metrics is also presented. In addition, we discuss the complexity of the above three algorithms, and prove that OBA has low numerical rank. After experimental evaluation, we found that OBA is capable of the sparsest representing original signal compared to spatial, DCT, haar-1, haar-2, and rbio5.5. Furthermore, OBA has the low recovery error and the highest efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {This is a novel investigation on the possibility of detecting barely visible impact damage (BVID) in composite materials by whisking across the surface via tactile whisker sensors that resemble rats’ whiskers. A series of drop tower low-velocity impact tests were performed on quasi-isotropic composite plates. The plates were made from unidirectional T800 carbon/MTM49-3 epoxy prepregs with the stacking sequence of [45/0/90/−45]4S. Investigating the specimens’ surface by the naked eye does not reveal any significant damage, rather than a small dent on the surface, with no tangible difference in the different impact energy levels. Ultrasonic C-scan observations showed the existence of BVID in all the impact energy levels, with an increasing trend in the damage size by increasing the impact energy level. The collected data from whisker sensors were analyzed using the support vector machine classifier, based on their vibrational properties, to identify the impacted region and classify the impact severity. It was observed that after training for 13 whisker contacts, the BVID severity can be classified with an accuracy of 100%. This is offering a new BVID detection technique, with a high potential for automation and high reliability that can be used as an alternative or combined with available inspection systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Typhoons strongly impact the structure and functioning of the forests, especially in the coastal areas in which typhoon-induced flooding imposes additional stress on the ecosystem via physical destruction and rising soil salinity. The impact of typhoons on forest ecosystems is becoming even more significant in the changing climate, which triggers atmospheric mechanisms that increase their frequency and intensity. This study investigates the resiliency of the Philippines’ forest areas (i.e., two selected forestry areas in Tacloban and Guiuan) in the aftermath of Super Typhoon Haiyan, which was followed by coastal flooding, as well as changes in ecosystem and biomass content using remote sensing. For this, we first evaluated the sensitivity of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in detecting temporal changes in biomass content using very high-resolution satellite images. Then, employing three resilience concepts: amplitude, malleability, and elasticity, the most sensitive biomass index (i.e., NDVI) and digital elevation model (DEM) data were used to measure the resiliency of the Guiuan and Tacloban sites. We also applied a mean-variance analysis to extract and illustrate the shifts in the ecosystem status. The results show that despite a considerable biomass loss (57% in Guiuan and 46% in Tacloban), the Guiuan and Tacloban sites regained 80% and 70% of their initial biomass content within a year after the typhoon, respectively. However, the presence of canopy gaps in the Tacloban site makes it vulnerable to external stressors. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that the study areas return to their initial states within two years. This indicates the high resiliency of those areas according to elasticity results. Moreover, the evaluation of typhoon impacts according to the elevation demonstrates that the elevation had a substantial impact on both damage severity and biomass recovery.},

ABSTRACT = {Object detection has made great progress. However, due to the unique imaging method of optical satellite remote sensing, the detection of slender targets is still insufficient. Specifically, the perspective of optical satellites is small, and the characteristics of slender targets are severely lost during imaging, resulting in insufficient detection task information; at the same time, the appearance of slender targets in the image is greatly affected by the satellite perspective, which is likely to cause insufficient generalization capabilities of conventional detection models. In response to these two points, we have made some improvements. First, in this paper, we introduce the shadow as auxiliary information to complement the trunk features of the target lost in imaging. Second, to reduce the impact of satellite perspective on imaging, in this paper, we use the characteristic that shadow information is not affected by satellite perspective to design STC-Det. STC-Det treats the shadow and the target as two different types of targets and uses the shadow information to assist the detection, reducing the impact of the satellite perspective on detection. Among them, in order to improve the performance of STC-Det, we propose an automatic matching method (AMM) of shadow and target and a feature fusion method (FFM). Finally, this paper proposes a new method to calculate the heatmaps of detectors, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed network in a visual way. Experiments show that when the satellite perspective is variable, the precision of STC-Det is increased by 1.7%, and when the satellite perspective is small, the precision of STC-Det is increased by 5.2%.},

ABSTRACT = {Beyond the importance of ponds for aquatic and terrestrial life, pond networks seem to be crucial to providing a vital spatial resource in response to global climate change for all migrating and spreading taxa. Additionally, ponds offer sustainable solutions to issues of concern in water management, such as nutrient retention, rainfall interception, or carbon sequestration. Although the ecological role of shallow waters seems clear, significant work must be performed to set future guidelines and actions towards their conservation. The main aims of the present study are to (i) georeference all small temporary wetlands within the Tyrrhenian central Italy coastal area, (ii) evaluate their hydroperiod, and (iii) calculate their surface size variability. We found 137 wetlands, 53 of which were temporary and contained listed habitats. Each wetland’s status was assessed in relation to land use and proximity to stressors (e.g., urban centres, railways, roads) while observing the relationship between pond occurrence, lithology, and permeability. Amongst the detected wetlands, we selected and monitored 21 temporary ponds (homogeneously distributed within the study area) for 12 months using images collected by the non-professional drone Parrot Bebop 2. All images were then acquired in ArcGIS to georeference all temporary ponds. The analysis confirmed that the majority of the surveyed ponds are in close proximity to roads and tracks, which might have significant impacts on the preservation of such fragile habitats. Moreover, despite the wide variability of hydroperiod duration, the greater part of the pools fill with water in autumn and dry in summer, in alignment with the Mediterranean climate. This preliminary study allowed for the creation of the first temporary ponds’ database, which is useful for monitoring their status in central Italy and planning further studies to assess eventual detrimental effects caused by human-mediated activities.},

ABSTRACT = {Resolving circuit diagrams is a regular part of learning for school and university students from engineering backgrounds. Simulating circuits is usually done manually by creating circuit diagrams on circuit tools, which is a time-consuming and tedious process. We propose an innovative method of simulating circuits from hand-drawn diagrams using smartphones through an image recognition system. This method allows students to use their smartphones to capture images instead of creating circuit diagrams before simulation. Our contribution lies in building a circuit recognition system using a deep learning capsule networks algorithm. The developed system receives an image captured by a smartphone that undergoes preprocessing, region proposal, classification, and node detection to get a Netlist and exports it to a circuit simulator program for simulation. We aim to improve engineering education using smartphones by (1) achieving higher accuracy using less training data with capsule networks and (2) developing a comprehensive system that captures hand-drawn circuit diagrams and produces circuit simulation results. We use 400 samples per class and report an accuracy of 96% for stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Through testing, we identify the optimum distance for taking circuit images to be 10 to 20 cm. Our proposed model can identify components of different scales and rotations.},

ABSTRACT = {Object detection in aerial images has been an active research area thanks to the vast availability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Along with the increase of computational power, deep learning algorithms are commonly used for object detection tasks. However, aerial images have large variations, and the object sizes are usually small, rendering lower detection accuracy. Besides, real-time inferencing on low-cost edge devices remains an open-ended question. In this work, we explored the usage of state-of-the-art deep learning object detection on low-cost edge hardware. We propose YOLO-RTUAV, an improved version of YOLOv4-Tiny, as the solution. We benchmarked our proposed models with various state-of-the-art models on the VAID and COWC datasets. Our proposed model can achieve higher mean average precision (mAP) and frames per second (FPS) than other state-of-the-art tiny YOLO models, especially on a low-cost edge device such as the Jetson Nano 2 GB. It was observed that the Jetson Nano 2 GB can achieve up to 12.8 FPS with a model size of only 5.5 MB.},

ABSTRACT = {The definition of multiple slicing types in 5G has created a wide field for service innovation in communications. However, the advantages that network slicing has to offer remain to be fully exploited by today’s applications and users. An important area that can potentially benefit from 5G slicing is emergency communications for First Responders. The latter consists of heterogeneous teams, imposing different requirements on the connectivity network. In this paper, the RESPOND-A platform is presented, which provides First Responders with network-enabled tools on top of 5G on-scene planning, with enhanced service slicing capabilities tailored to emergency communications. Furthermore, a mapping of emergency services and communications to specific slice types is proposed to identify the current challenges in the field. Additionally, the proposed tentative mechanism is evaluated in terms of energy efficiency. Finally, the approach is summarized by discussing future steps in the convergence of 5G network slicing in various areas of emergency vertical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we consider a control problem where a group of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with uncertain dynamics tracks the target vehicle cooperatively in the case of external disturbance. Based on the Gaussian process regression, a data-driven model is established, whose uniform error is bounded with probability. Then a learning-based consensus protocol for multi-UAVs is designed. The stability of the system is proven via Lyapunov function, and the tracking error is guaranteed to be bounded with a high probability. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown in the numerical simulation.},

ABSTRACT = {The snowpack is important for water resources, tourism, ecology, and the global energy budget. Over the past century, we have gone from point measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) to estimate spring and summer runoff volumes, to remote sensing of various snowpack properties at continuously finer spatial and temporal resolutions, to various complexities of snowpack and hydrological modeling, to the current fusion of field data with remote sensing and modeling, all to improve our estimates of the snowpack and the subsequent runoff. However, we are still limited by the uncertainty induced by scaling from point field measurements to the area represented by remote sensing and modeling. This paper uses several examples of fine-resolution sampling to issue a call to snow hydrologists and other earth scientists to collect more data, or at least to thoroughly evaluate their sampling strategy for collecting ground-truth measurements. Recommendations are provided for different approaches to have more representative sampling, when at all possible, to collect at least a few more samples or data points.},

ABSTRACT = {Contemporary deep learning approaches for post-earthquake damage assessments based on 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require encoding of ground motion records to transform their inherent 1D time series to 2D images, thus requiring high computing time and resources. This study develops a 1D CNN model to avoid the costly 2D image encoding. The 1D CNN model is compared with a 2D CNN model with wavelet transform encoding and a feedforward neural network (FNN) model to evaluate prediction performance and computational efficiency. A case study of a benchmark reinforced concrete (r/c) building indicated that the 1D CNN model achieved a prediction accuracy of 81.0%, which was very close to the 81.6% prediction accuracy of the 2D CNN model and much higher than the 70.8% prediction accuracy of the FNN model. At the same time, the 1D CNN model reduced computing time by more than 90% and reduced resources used by more than 69%, as compared to the 2D CNN model. Therefore, the developed 1D CNN model is recommended for rapid and accurate resultant damage assessment after earthquakes.},

ABSTRACT = {A communication system based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a viable alternative for meeting the coverage and capacity needs of future wireless networks. However, because of the limitations of UAV-enabled communications in terms of coverage, energy consumption, and flying laws, the number of studies focused on the sustainability element of UAV-assisted networking in the literature was limited thus far. We present a solution to this problem in this study; specifically, we design a Q-learning-based UAV placement strategy for long-term wireless connectivity while taking into account major constraints such as altitude regulations, nonflight zones, and transmit power. The goal is to determine the best location for the UAV base station (BS) while reducing energy consumption and increasing the number of users covered. Furthermore, a weighting method is devised, allowing energy usage and the number of users served to be prioritized based on network/battery circumstances. The suggested Q-learning-based solution is contrasted to the standard k-means clustering method, in which the UAV BS is positioned at the centroid location with the shortest cumulative distance between it and the users. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms the baseline k-means clustering-based method in terms of the number of users covered while achieving the desired minimization of the energy consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital maps of road networks are a vital part of digital cities and intelligent transportation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review on road extraction based on various remote sensing data sources, including high-resolution images, hyperspectral images, synthetic aperture radar images, and light detection and ranging. This review is divided into three parts. Part 1 provides an overview of the existing data acquisition techniques for road extraction, including data acquisition methods, typical sensors, application status, and prospects. Part 2 underlines the main road extraction methods based on four data sources. In this section, road extraction methods based on different data sources are described and analysed in detail. Part 3 presents the combined application of multisource data for road extraction. Evidently, different data acquisition techniques have unique advantages, and the combination of multiple sources can improve the accuracy of road extraction.

These programs benefit from having access to high-quality, standardized phenotypic and genotypic data. Technological advances have made it possible to collect phenomic and genomic data for genebank collections, which, with the appropriate analytical tools, can directly inform breeding programs. We discuss the importance of considering genebank accession homogeneity and heterogeneity in data collection and documentation. Citing specific examples, we describe how well-documented genomic and phenomic data have met or could meet the needs of plant genetic resource managers and users.

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to classify an urban area and its surrounding objects after the destructive M7.3 Kermanshah earthquake (12 November 2017) in the west of Iran using very high-resolution (VHR) post-event WorldView-2 images and object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods. The spatial resolution of multispectral (MS) bands (~2 m) was first improved using a pan-sharpening technique that provides a solution by fusing the information of the panchromatic (PAN) and MS bands to generate pan-sharpened images with a spatial resolution of about 50 cm. After applying a segmentation procedure, the classification step was considered as the main process of extracting the aimed features. The aforementioned classification method includes applying spectral and shape indices. Then, the classes were defined as follows: type 1 (settlement area) was collapsed areas, non-collapsed areas, and camps; type 2 (vegetation area) was orchards, cultivated areas, and urban green spaces; and type 3 (miscellaneous area) was rocks, rivers, and bare lands. As OBIA results in the integration of the spatial characteristics of the image object, we also aimed to evaluate the efficiency of object-based features for damage assessment within the semi-automated approach. For this goal, image context assessment algorithms (e.g., textural parameters, shape, and compactness) together with spectral information (e.g., brightness and standard deviation) were applied within the integrated approach. The classification results were satisfactory when compared with the reference map for collapsed buildings provided by UNITAR (the United Nations Institute for Training and Research). In addition, the number of temporary camps was counted after applying OBIA, indicating that 10,249 tents or temporary shelters were established for homeless people up to 17 November 2018. Based on the total damaged population, the essential resources such as emergency equipment, canned food and water bottles can be estimated. The research makes a significant contribution to the development of remote sensing science by means of applying different object-based image-analyzing techniques and evaluating their efficiency within the semi-automated approach, which, accordingly, supports the efficient application of these methods to other worldwide case studies.},

ABSTRACT = {Research on the forest structure classification is essential, as it plays an important role in assessing the vitality and diversity of vegetation. However, classifying forest structure involves in situ surveying, which requires considerable time and money, and cannot be conducted directly in some instances; also, the update cycle of the classification data is very late. To overcome these drawbacks, feasibility studies on mapping the forest vertical structure from aerial images using machine learning techniques were conducted. In this study, we investigated (1) the performance improvement of the forest structure classification, using a high-resolution LiDAR-derived digital surface model (DSM) acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform and (2) the performance comparison of results obtained from the single-seasonal and two-seasonal data, using random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM). For the performance comparison, the UAV optic and LiDAR data were divided into three cases: (1) only used autumn data, (2) only used winter data, and (3) used both autumn and winter data. From the results, the best model was XGBoost, and the F1 scores achieved using this method were approximately 0.92 in the autumn and winter cases. A remarkable improvement was achieved when both two-seasonal images were used. The F1 score improved by 35.3% from 0.68 to 0.92. This implies that (1) the seasonal variation in the forest vertical structure can be more important than the spatial resolution, and (2) the classification performance achieved from the two-seasonal UAV optic images and LiDAR-derived DSMs can reach 0.9 with the application of an optimal machine learning approach.},

ABSTRACT = {The fast growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its diverse applications increase the risk of cyberattacks, one type of which is malware attacks. Due to the IoT devices’ different capabilities and the dynamic and ever-evolving environment, applying complex security measures is challenging, and applying only basic security standards is risky. Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are intrusion-detecting algorithms inspired by the human body’s adaptive immune system techniques. Most of these algorithms imitate the human’s body B-cell and T-cell defensive mechanisms. They are lightweight, adaptive, and able to detect malware attacks without prior knowledge. In this work, we review the recent advances in employing AIS for the improved detection of malware in IoT networks. We present a critical analysis that highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art in AIS research and offer insights into promising new research directions.},

ABSTRACT = {In a warming Arctic, permafrost-related disturbances, such as retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), are becoming more abundant and dynamic, with serious implications for permafrost stability and bio-geochemical cycles on local to regional scales. Despite recent advances in the field of earth observation, many of these have remained undetected as RTS are highly dynamic, small, and scattered across the remote permafrost region. Here, we assessed the potential strengths and limitations of using deep learning for the automatic segmentation of RTS using PlanetScope satellite imagery, ArcticDEM and auxiliary datasets. We analyzed the transferability and potential for pan-Arctic upscaling and regional cross-validation, with independent training and validation regions, in six different thaw slump-affected regions in Canada and Russia. We further tested state-of-the-art model architectures (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabv3) and encoder networks to find optimal model configurations for potential upscaling to continental scales. The best deep learning models achieved mixed results from good to very good agreement in four of the six regions (maxIoU: 0.39 to 0.58; Lena River, Horton Delta, Herschel Island, Kolguev Island), while they failed in two regions (Banks Island, Tuktoyaktuk). Of the tested architectures, UNet++ performed the best. The large variance in regional performance highlights the requirement for a sufficient quantity, quality and spatial variability in the training data used for segmenting RTS across diverse permafrost landscapes, in varying environmental conditions. With our highly automated and configurable workflow, we see great potential for the transfer to active RTS clusters (e.g., Peel Plateau) and upscaling to much larger regions.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a mechanical control method for precise weeding based on deep learning. Deep convolutional neural network was used to identify and locate weeds. A special modular weeder was designed, which can be installed on the rear of a mobile platform. An inverted pyramid-shaped weeding tool equipped in the modular weeder can shovel out weeds without being contaminated by soil. The weed detection and control method was implemented on an embedded system with a high-speed graphics processing unit and integrated with the weeder. The experimental results showed that even if the speed of the mobile platform reaches 20 cm/s, the weeds can still be accurately detected and the position of the weeds can be located by the system. Moreover, the weeding mechanism can successfully shovel out the roots of the weeds. The proposed weeder has been tested in the field, and its performance and weed coverage have been verified to be precise for weeding.},

ABSTRACT = {Water stress is a significant element impacting photosynthesis, which is one of the major physiological activities governing crop growth and development. In this study, the photosynthetic rate of Brassica chinensis L. var. parachinensis (Bailey) (referred to as Chinese Brassica hereafter) was predicted using the deep learning method. Five sets of Chinese Brassica were created, each with a different water stress gradient. Air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), canopy temperature (Tc), transpiration rate (Tr), photosynthetic rate (Pn), and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) were measured in different growth stages. The upper limit and lower limit equations were built using the non-water-stress baseline (NWSB) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN) methods. The crop water stress index (CWSI) was then calculated using these built equations. The multivariate long short-term memory (MLSTM) model was proposed to predict Pn based on CWSI and other parameters. At the same time, the support vector regression (SVR) method was applied to provide a comparison to the MSLTM model. The results show that water stress had an important effect on the growth of Chinese Brassica. The more serious the water stress, the lower the growth range (GR). The HDBSCAN method had a lower root mean square error (RMSE) in calculating CWSI. Furthermore, the CWSI had a significant effect on predicting Pn. The regression fitting between measured Pn and predicted Pn showed that the determination coefficient (R2) and RMSE were 0.899 and 0.108 μmol·m−2·s−1, respectively. In this study, we successfully developed a method for the reliable prediction of Pn in Chinese Brassica, which can serve as a useful reference for application in water saving.},
