abstract={Illegal wildlife poaching poses one severe threat to the environment. Measures to stem poaching have only been with limited success, mainly due to efforts required to keep track of wildlife stock and animal tracking. Recent developments in remote sensing have led to low-cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), facilitating quick and repeated image acquisitions over vast areas. In parallel, progress in object detection in computer vision yielded unprecedented performance improvements, partially attributable to algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We present an object detection method tailored to detect large animals in UAV images. We achieve a substantial increase in precision over a robust state-of-the-art model on a dataset acquired over the Kuzikus wildlife reserve park in Namibia. Furthermore, our model processes data at over 72 images per second, as opposed 3 for the baseline, allowing for real-time applications.},

abstract={Recently, the 5G is widely deployed for supporting communications of high mobility nodes including train, vehicular and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) largely emerged as the main components for constructing the wireless heterogeneous network (HetNet). To further improve the radio utilization, the Time Division Duplex (TDD) is considered to be the potential full-duplex communication technology in the high mobility 5G network. However, the high mobility of users leads to the high dynamic network traffic and unpredicted link state change. A new method to predict the dynamic traffic and channel condition and schedule the TDD configuration in real-time is essential for the high mobility environment. In this paper, we investigate the channel model in the high mobility and heterogeneous network and proposed a novel deep reinforcement learning based intelligent TDD configuration algorithm to dynamically allocate radio resources in an online manner. In the proposal, the deep neural network is employed to extract the features of the complex network information, and the dynamic Q-value iteration based reinforcement learning with experience replay memory mechanism is proposed to adaptively change TDD Up/Down-link ratio by evaluated rewards. The simulation results show that the proposal achieves significant network performance improvement in terms of both network throughput and packet loss rate, comparing with conventional TDD resource allocation algorithms.},

abstract={This work presents a high precision unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications to detect, track and locate people during moving using real-time dataset.

abstract={Autonomous navigation in an unknown or uncertain environment is one of the challenging tasks for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In order to address this challenge, it is necessary to have sophisticated high level control methods that can learn and adapt themselves to changing conditions. One of the most promising frameworks for such a purpose is reinforcement learning. In this paper, a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, TEXPLORE, is developed as a high level control method for autonomous navigation of UAVs. The developed approach has been extensively tested with a quadcopter UAV in ROS-Gazebo environment. The experimental results show that our method is able to learn an efficient trajectory in a few iterations and perform actions in real-time. Moreover, we show that our approach significantly outperforms Q-learning based method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that TEXPLORE has been developed to achieve autonomous navigation of UAVs.},

This paper studies the ground-to-UAV (G2U) communication system with a malicious eavesdropper. The optimization goal of this paper is to maximize the accumulated secrecy rate of the system by optimizing the UAV trajectory and connection sequence, which is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with finite states and actions, and implement the double deep Q network (DDQN) algorithm to solve it.

abstract={Fast and accurate vehicle detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery is a meaningful but challenging task, playing an important role in a wide range of applications. Due to its tiny size, few features, variable scales and imbalance vehicle sample problems in UAV imagery, current deep learning methods used in this task cannot achieve a satisfactory performance both in accuracy and speed, which is obvious a classical trade-off problem. In this paper, we propose a single-shot vehicle detector, which focuses on accurate and real-time vehicle detection in UAV imagery. We make contributions in the following two aspects: 1) presenting a multi-scale feature fusion module to combine the high resolution but semantically weak features with the low resolution but semantically strong features, aiming to introduce context information to enhance the feature representation of the small vehicles; 2) proposing a dynamic training strategy (DTS) which constructs the network to learn more discriminative features of hard examples, via using cross entropy and focal loss function alternately. Experimental results show that our method can achieve 90.8% accuracy in UAV images and can run at 59 FPS on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU for the small vehicle detection in UAV images.},

abstract={Real-time continuous workload assessment is important for researchers and developers of tools that aim to reduce human operators' cognitive workload, especially in dynamic environments, as the military environment, where task demands and workload change rapidly. Most workload measurement techniques provide a single retrospective value or require expensive high-end sensing equipment. This study aimed to introduce an affordable continuous machine learning (ML) based workload assessment tool, that can provide real-time workload scores. Using experienced military unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators in a simulated operational setting, muscle behavior represented by their interaction with a joystick was modeled to predict Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) scores. Data were obtained from six professional participants. Four machine learning (ML) modeling methodologies were tested on each participant's data. It has been shown that after running an ML setup phase for each participant, an already in use available tool as the UAV joystick controller can be used to predict SWAT scores at any given time. By implementing the approach presented in this study, researchers can more accurately evaluate various aspects of the human operator's cognitive workload, and developers can evaluate the progression of their solutions on operators' cognitive workload over time.},

abstract={Taking the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mission planning as the research background, we adopt the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) to establish an effective UAV path planning scheme under obstacle-avoidance constraint in this paper. UAV path planning is the basis and premise of UAV mission execution. The essence of UAV path planning is to obtain the feasible flight path planning from the starting point to the target point according to the specific task of UAV. Simultaneously, effective UAV path planning should reach the optimal performance while meeting the demand of different constraints. ACO is a swarm intelligence algorithm that ants cooperate with pheromone. That is, ACO has great scalability and robustness, which is compatible to UAV path planning problem. In this paper, taking the obstacle-avoidance constraint into consideration, we build an effective UAV path planning strategy based on ACO to acquire the shortest UAV route. Experiments and analyses demonstrate that, when the obstacle number gradually increased from one to three, the proposed algorithm can all achieve the optimal UAV path planning. Hence, the rationality and applicability of the proposed algorithm are verified. Besides, the proposed algorithm can still realize the optimal UAV path planning when further adding the obstacle number and increasing the complexity of multiple obstacles. Thus, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm are ulteriorly proved. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm has certain practical significance.},

Considering different types of sensor faults of a quadrotor UAV, a new fault detection and classification method based on time-frequency analysis (TFA) and deep learning (DL) technologies is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the data sets including different types of sensor fault in time-domain are generated randomly. The date sets are then transformed into time-frequency domain by short-time Fourier transform (STFT), resulting in time-frequency graph (TFG). Secondly, the time-frequency graph sets are used to train the deep network, by which the fault type can be rapidly classified with high accuracy. Finally, the simulations are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm and the accuracy reaches to 99.6%.},

abstract={Camera-equipped UAVs, or drones, are increasingly employed in a wide range of applications. Thus, ensuring their safe flight in areas containing people is a top priority. In this paper, a deep neural network-based method is proposed for the task of visual human crowd detection from UAV footage, allowing a drone to rapidly extract semantic segmentation maps from captured video frames during flight. These maps can be exploited (e.g., by a path planner) to define no-fly zones over, or near human crowds and, hence, enhance UAV flight safety. To this end, a novel neural architecture for binary (crowd/non- crowd) semantic segmentation from single RGB images is proposed, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It consists of a semantic segmentation and an image-to-image translation (I2I) neural branch. The overall network is trained using a novel multi-task loss function that addresses both tasks by processing the output of the corresponding branch. During inference, information flows across branches through additional skip synapses to further assist the crowd detection task. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we introduce a real and a synthetic human crowd RGB image dataset. The proposed method outperforms previous aerial crowd detection methods by a large margin and without any post-processing. Moreover, it demonstrates increased generalization ability, while running at real-time and near-real-time speeds on a ground computer and on embedded AI hardware, respectively.},

This paper designs an object detection system for UAV grasping. The system uses the object detection algorithm to provide the species and position information of object for UAV, and controls the UAV to fly over the object. The RGB-D sensor is used to acquire the image and depth information of object, and an optimal grasping box is trained based on the deep learning network to provide the grasping information for the UAV.

abstract={In this article, we study the pricing and resource management in the Internet of Things (IoT) system with blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and mobile-edge computing (MEC). The BaaS model includes the cloud-based server to perform blockchain tasks and the set of peers to collect data from local IoT devices. The MEC model consists of the set of terrestrial and aerial base stations (BSs), i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to forward the tasks of peers to the BaaS server. Each BS is also equipped with an MEC server to run some blockchain tasks. As the BSs can be privately owned or controlled by different operators, there is no information exchange among them. We show that the resource management and pricing in the BaaS-MEC system are modeled as a stochastic Stackelberg game with multiple leaders and incomplete information about actions of leaders/BSs and followers/peers. We formulate a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for the decision makings of BSs and peers. We also develop an unsupervised hierarchical deep learning (HDL) algorithm that combines deep $Q$ -learning (DQL) for BSs with the Bayesian deep learning (BDL) for peers. We prove that the proposed algorithms converge to stable states in which the peers' actions are the best responses to optimal actions of BSs.},

abstract={Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) have emanated over the last few years for numerous civil and military applications. Owing to underlying attributes such as a dynamic topology, node mobility in three-dimensional (3D) space, and the limited energy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a routing protocol for FANETs is challenging to design. Exiting topology-based routing is unsuitable for highly dynamic FANETs. Location-based routing protocols can be preferred for FANETs owing to their scalability, but are based on one-hop neighbor information and do not contemplate the reachability of further appropriate nodes for forwarding. Owing to the rapid mobility of UAVs, the topology frequently changes; thus, some route entries in the routing table can become invalid and the next-hop nodes may be unavailable before a timeout. That is, the routing decision based on one-hop neighbors cannot assure a successful delivery. In this study, we propose a novel Q-learning-based topology-aware routing (QTAR) protocol for FANETs to provide reliable combinations between the source and destination. The proposed QTAR improves the routing decision by considering two-hop neighbor nodes, extending the local view of the network topology. With the Q-learning technique, QTAR adaptively adjusts the routing decision according to the network condition. Our simulation results reveal that QTAR outstrips the existing routing protocols in respect of various performance metrics under distinct scenarios.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a popular research platform with many application areas such as military, civil, commercial and recreational areas, thanks to their high maneuverability, vertical take-off / landing, and outdoor and indoor use. Today, small, light, and very high powerful embedding systems have been developed. Therefore, many real-time computer vision applications can be run on unmanned aerial vehicle platforms by integrating such embedding systems onto these vehicles. In this work, the problem of car detection (localization) in images taken from unmanned aerial vehicles has been studied. To this end, we collected a new aerial image dataset by using quadcopters and different type of cameras. To solve the car detection problem, the results were compared by using both the Polyhedral Conic Classifier and the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm which is considered one of the fastest deep neural network methods in the literature.},

A sigma-pi neural network (SPNN) is used as the compensator to reduce the model error and improve the system performance in the presence of the uncertainties of UAV dynamics, payload, and environment. Besides, we present a technical framework for fast and robust implementation of multipurpose UAV systems and develop a testbed for the evaluation of UAV control system by using a high-precision optical motion capture system. Both simulation results and experiment results demonstrate that the SPNN can reduce the inversion errors related to UAV parameter uncertainties as well as tracking errors related to unknown disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. With the help of an online neural network (NN) learning mechanism, the entire system can achieve much higher accuracy in attitude and trajectory control than that achieved by conventional proportional-integral derivative based control systems under varying flight conditions.},

The method first detects the objects in real-time, using the state-of-art deep learning object detector named “YOLOv3”. After that, for effective Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) control, the objects, which were detected, will be highlighted by the image difference function. In this part, the most important job is to know which object has moved and how much it has moved. Our study, focus on these two parts. Using the Bounding box size sort, the object bounding boxes will be sorted from small size to big size boxes and with the Pixel winning function, the object boxes will take the pixels that belong to them. At last, with each object's pixel value the percentage of the object's movement will be calculated.},

abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence and integrated sensor technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are more and more applied in the air combats. A bottleneck that constrains the capability of UAVs against manned vehicles is the autonomous maneuver decision, which is a very challenging problem in the short-range air combat undergoing highly dynamic and uncertain maneuvers of enemies. In this paper, an autonomous maneuver decision model is proposed for the UAV short-range air combat based on reinforcement learning, which mainly includes the aircraft motion model, one-to-one short-range air combat evaluation model and the maneuver decision model based on deep Q network (DQN). However, such model includes a high dimensional state and action space which requires huge computation load for DQN training using traditional methods. Then, a phased training method, called “basic-confrontation”, which is based on the idea that human beings gradually learn from simple to complex is proposed to help reduce the training time while getting suboptimal but efficient results. Finally, one-to-one short-range air combats are simulated under different target maneuver policies. Simulation results show that the proposed maneuver decision model and training method can help the UAV achieve autonomous decision in the air combats and obtain an effective decision policy to defeat the opponent.},

abstract={A novel framework is proposed for the trajectory design of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on the prediction of users' mobility information. The problem ofjoint trajectory design and power control is formulated for maximizing the instantaneous sum transmit rate while satisfying the rate requirement of users. In an effort to solve this pertinent problem, a threestep approach is proposed, which is based on machine learning techniques to obtain both the position information of users and the trajectory design of UAVs. First, a multi-agent Q-learning-based placement algorithm is proposed for determining the optimal positions of the UAVs based on the initial location of the users. Second, in an effort to determine the mobility information of users based on a real dataset, their position data is collected from Twitter to describe the anonymous user-trajectories in the physical world. In the meantime, an echo state network (ESN) based prediction algorithm is proposed for predicting the future positions of users based on the real dataset. Third, a multi-agent Q-learning-based algorithm is conceived for predicting the position of UAVs in each time slot based on the movement of users. In this algorithm, multiple UAVs act as agents to find optimal actions by interacting with their environment and learn from their mistakes. Additionally, we also prove that the proposed multi-agent Q-learning-based trajectory design and power control algorithm can converge under mild conditions. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that as the size of the reservoir increases, the proposed ESN approach improves the prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that the throughput gains of about 17% are achieved.},

abstract={The accurate detection and location of the drogue under complex environment is an important issue in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) autonomous aerial refueling. In this paper, a new drogue detection and location method based on deep learning and vision is proposed for this intractable problem. The method consists of two parts: drogue detection and drogue location. The well-trained Yolo (You only look once) model is established to detect the drogue in the image to obtain the parameters of the predicted bounding box. A small part of the entire image is selected for processing based on these parameters, then the position of the eight beacons on the drogue ring in the image can be obtained. Least-squares ellipse fitting is performed on these eight points in the image coordinate system to obtain the long semi-axis of the ellipse. Finally, monocular vision is used to measure the position of the drogue in camera coordinate system. The simulation results show that this method can not only correctly identify the drogue but also accurately locate it with a distance of 2.5m to 45m under complex environment.},

abstract={Lately, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications acquired great attention because of its weighty new applications, particularly in rescue services. In such a case, access and gateway UAVS are spread to cover and fully support communications over disaster areas where the ground network is malfunctioned or wholly damaged. Each access UAV collects essential information from its assigned area, then flies and transfers it to the nearby gateway UAVs that deliver this collected information to the closest operating ground network. Meanwhile, collisions may occur as two or more access UAVs might target the same gateway UAV. This paper leverages and modifies two multi-armed bandit (MAB) based algorithms, namely, Kullback Leibler upper confidence bound (KLUCB) and minimax optimal stochastic strategy (MOSS) to formulate the gateway UAV selection issue. The issue is modeled as a budget-constrained multiagent MAB (MA-MAB) that maximizes data rates while considering access UAVs' flight battery consumption. Hence, MA battery aware KLUCB (MABA-KLUCB) and battery aware MOSS (MA-BA-MOSS) algorithms are proposed for efficient gateway UAV selection. The proposed MAB algorithms maximize the UAV network's total sum rate over the conventional selection techniques with assuring good convergence performance.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology is a rapidly growing field with tremendous opportunities for research and applications. To achieve true autonomy for UAVs in the absence of remote control, external navigation aids like global navigation satellite systems and radar systems, a minimum energy trajectory planning that considers obstacle avoidance and stability control will be the key. Although this can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem, due to the complicated non-linear relationships between UAV trajectory and thrust control, it is almost impossible to be solved analytically. While deep reinforcement learning is known for its ability to provide model free optimization for complex system through learning, its state space, actions and reward functions must be designed carefully. This paper presents our vision of different layers of autonomy in a UAV system, and our effort in generating and tracking the trajectory both using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The experimental results show that compared to conventional approaches, the learned trajectory will need 20% less control thrust and 18% less time to reach the target. Furthermore, using the control policy learning by DRL, the UAV will achieve 58.14% less position error and 21.77% less system power.},

Previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for predicting end-of-season biomass in a single year. However, biomass prediction across multiple years remains a challenge due to the variation of environments and breeding trials. This paper focuses on exploring the transferability of an RNN model incorporating features extracted from LiDAR, hyperspectral and weather data. A k-means assisted transfer learning strategy is proposed to identify optimal samples for fine-tuning the pre-trained RNN model.

abstract={In this paper, we consider a cellular Internet of UAVs, where UAVs execute multiple sensing tasks continuously and cooperatively through sensing and transmission with the objective to minimize the age of information (AoI). However, the cooperative sensing and transmission is coupled with the trajectories of the UAVs, which makes the trajectory design a challenging problem. To tackle this challenge, we first propose a distributed sense-and-send protocol to coordinate the UAVs. Based on this protocol, we formulate the trajectory design problem for AoI minimization and propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to solve it, which we refer to as the compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm. Simulation results show that the CA2C algorithm outperforms two baseline algorithms for AoI minimization.},

The goal of this paper is the development of an anomaly detection system to prevent the motor of the drone from operating at abnormal temperatures. In this anomaly detection system, the temperature of the motor is recorded using DS18B20 sensors. Then, using reinforcement learning, the motor is judged to be operating abnormally by a Raspberry Pi processing unit. A specially built user interface allows the activity of the Raspberry Pi to be tracked on a Tablet for observation purposes.

abstract={In recent times, security issues pertaining to drones have received a great deal of attention from researchers in networking and communication circles, given their applications in the civilian and defence domains. Object collision avoidance over a trajectory is the only built-in security mechanism in the autopilot system of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This mechanism, however, cannot protect drones from signal spoofing and hacking attacks. Attacks on UAVs can be triggered from either the ground or flying vehicles in the transmission vicinity medium, by means of which attackers get to control flight operations or manipulate the UAV's autopilot system. An intermittent network connection that disrupts communication in UAVs exacerbates the problem. Hence, a deep learning-based, adaptive Intrusion Detection System is needed for a drone to identify its intruders and ensure its safe return-to-home (RTH). In the proposed IDS, Self-Taught Learning (STL) with a multiclass SVM is used to maintain the high true positive rate of the IDS, even in uncharted territory. A self-healing method in IDS recovery phase uses the Deep-Q Network, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for dynamic route learning to facilitate the drone's safe return home. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed IDS against cyber security attacks on UAVs in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.},

To deal with large state space sizes, we use function approximation to achieve faster convergence. The results show how the UAV can successfully carry out the task in a realistic urban SaR scenario. However, common approaches limit their work to target search. In practice, searching for mobile targets is not enough as their position may change before the rescue team arrives for evacuation. To address this, we uniquely combine YOLO with Optical flow to allow the UAV to track and follow the target victim. Extensive simulations demonstrate its application in SaR missions.},

abstract={This work examines the relationships among drone swarm characteristics and how they affect swarm performance. A swarm of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is implemented in simulation to cooperatively gather situational awareness data during the first few hours after a major natural disaster. The swarm is controlled by prioritized sets of relatively simple, reactive behaviors, the totality of which result in the emergence of a form of collective intelligence. The behaviors are designed to optimize the coverage area of a simulated camera mounted on each UAV. The behaviors are implemented in simulation on swarms of sizes from 10 to 50 UAVs. The UAVs are each assigned one of 3 different roles, or “personality types”: Social Searcher, Antisocial Searcher, or Relay. 100 different size and personality type distribution configurations were compared over 1000 simulation runs to determine explore the effect of swarm parameters on search success over the target area. The results show that the swarm is successful in locating over 90 % of survivors in less than 40 minutes using the most effective personality type distributions. Results also show that, within in the context of the particular simulation scenario, the addition of any number of Relay UAVs tends to decrease performance of the swarm when compared to a distribution that does not include any Relays. More generally, the work demonstrates the value of the novel approach of applying design of experiment principles to simulation experiments in order to explore optimal swarm configurations.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm needs to broadcast routing messages to each other, accept unified control commands, and return the discovered targets' information to the ground control station in time. Most of these messages are broadcast in the UAV swarm. Therefore, in the UAV swarm network, the efficiency of broadcasting and rebroadcasting will determine the network efficiency of the entire network. Aiming at the broadcasting problem of UAV network, in order to adapt to the dynamic nature of the network and improve the broadcasting ability and efficiency, this paper focuses on the rebroadcasting mechanism based on dynamic probability. A prediction method of collision probability of rebroadcasting behavior, and a multi-agent cooperative rebroadcasting method based on virtual action and reinforcement learning are proposed. Simulation results show that the dynamic probability mechanism of rebroadcasting has obvious performance advantages over fixed probability flooding and simple flooding in dynamic scenarios after pre-learning.},

abstract={With the advancement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and their application in the most diverse areas, the demand for increasingly better precision in their positioning and navigation task has arisen. Based on this context, this article proposes a new approach for localization and navigation UAVs using topological maps and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNN is used as features extractor, according to the concept of Transfer Learning. The use of topological maps helps to guide the vehicle through the exploration environment. To evaluate the performance of the approach, parameters such as Accuracy, F1-Score, and processing time are considered. For the classification were used Bayesian Classifier, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results show that CNN achieved 99.97% Accuracy and also F1-Score in combination with most of the considered classifiers, proving the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract={Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) requires navigating large regions - often in rugged, remote areas - searching for missing people or animals. Because of the large regions and potentially limited mobility of ground vehicles, WiSAR missions are frequently carried out with the help of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the ability to autonomously execute WiSAR remains an unsolved challenge. In this paper, we take advantage of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an autonomous WiSAR controller for UAVs. We improve the learning and understanding of a UAV agent to explore a partially observable environment in search of a victim trapped in the wild. The proposed approach breaks up this difficult problem into 4 sub-tasks: tractable mapping of the environment in small regions, region selection, target search, and region exploration. Quad-Tree is utilized offline to decompose the environment map into smaller, tractable maps. Then, an efficient cost function is repeatedly computed to determine the best target region to search in each iteration of the process. Recurrent-DDQN and A2C algorithms are trained to generate optimal policies for the target search and regions exploration tasks, respectively. We tested our approach against a baseline of a hard-coded policy of navigating the map in a zigzag fashion and another baseline of using the same sub-tasks but instead of using the DRL algorithms, randomly selecting an action at each time step. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of navigating through 25 randomly generated environments and finding the missing victim faster than the baselines by 46%.},

abstract={Future wireless communication networks tend to be intelligentized to accomplish the missions that cannot be preprogrammed. In the new intelligent communication systems, optimizing the network performance has become a challenge due to the ever-increasing complexity of the network environment. New theories and technologies for intelligent wireless communications have obtained widespread attention, among which deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an excellent machine learning technology. DRL has great potential in enhancing the intelligence of wireless communication systems while overcoming the above challenge. This paper presents a review on applications of DRL in intelligent wireless communications with focuses on millimeter wave (mmWave), intelligent caching and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scenarios. We first introduce the concepts and basic principles of single/multi-agent DRL techniques. Then, we review the related works where DRL algorithms are used to address emerging issues in wireless communications. These issues include mmWave communication, intelligent caching, UAV aided communication, and handover/access control in HetNets. Finally, critical challenges and future research directions of applying DRL in intelligent wireless communications are outlined.},

abstract={In recent years, there have occurred many incidents that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the field of national security. While in some situations, UAVs may be deployed simultaneously by different parties with opposite purposes, easily resulting in direct competitions against each other. In this case, how to use UAVs to pursue UAVs has become a hot spot. In order to analyze the behavior of UAV, building a realistic mathematical dynamic model is necessary. In this paper, we propose a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy control system based UAV dynamic model, which is exactly the same UAV control method in practice. To address the competition conundrum between UAVs, we formulate this problem into a pursuer-evader problem and leverage the reinforcement learning based machine learning method to solve this. The proposed deep Q network is based on traditional Q learning but able to address some deficiencies. Basically, deep Q network has three vital improvements: using neural network to describe the Q function, the architecture of double networks, and the experience replay. The simulation results show the correctness of our analysis and effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract={Accurate and timely crop yield estimation is critical for food security and sustainable development. The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers a new approach to acquire high spatio-temporal resolution imagery of farmland at a low cost. In order to realize the full potential of UAV platform and sensor, machine learning has been introduced to estimate crop yield, but the shortages of field measurements have troubled researchers. In this article, the CW-RF model, a new wheat yield estimation model suitable for the North China plain, was established using random forest, and the crop growth model (the CERES-wheat model) was chosen to simulate abundant training samples for random forest at field plot scale. According to CERES-wheat model simulation, the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) at the wheat jointing and heading stages were selected as the most sensitive parameters, and were retrieved from UAV hyperspectral imagery using the directional second derivative and angular insensitivity vegetation index methods, respectively. Then the retrieved LAI and LNC results were input into the CW-RF model to estimate winter wheat yield. The field validation in Luohe, Henan showed that the root-mean-squared error of the retrieved LAI and LNC were 6.27% and 12.17% at jointing stages, 9.21% and 13.64% at heading stages, respectively. The RMSE of estimated yield was 1,008.08 kg/ha, and the mean absolute percent error of estimated yield was 9.36%, demonstrating the available of the CW-RF model in wheat yield estimation at field plot scale. Apart from Luohe, validations in some other fields (e.g., Xiaotangshan, Beijing), prove the wide applicability of the CW-RF model. In addition, the UAV hyperspectral data were found to significantly improve the retrieval accuracy, and further improve CW-RF model estimation accuracy. In conclusion, this article showed that the CERES-Wheat model simulation can be important data source for machine learning-based wheat yield estimation model at field plot scale, and the hyperspectral sensor mounted on a UAV is a feasible remote sensing data acquisition mode for winter wheat growth monitoring and yield estimation.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as important users of next-generation cellular networks. By operating in the sky, UAV users experience very different radio conditions than terrestrial users, due to factors such as strong Line-of-Sight (LoS) channels (and interference) and Base Station (BS) antenna misalignment. As a consequence, the UAVs may experience significant degradation to their received quality of service, particularly when they are moving and are subject to frequent handovers. The solution is to allow the UAV to be aware of its surrounding environment, and intelligently connect into the cellular network taking advantage of this awareness. In this paper we present REgression and deep Q-learning for Intelligent UAV cellular user to Base station Association (REQIBA), a solution that allows a UAV flying over an urban area to intelligently connect to underlying BSs, using information about the received signal powers, the BS locations, and the surrounding building topology. We demonstrate how REQIBA can as much as double the total UAV throughput, when compared to heuristic association schemes similar to those commonly used by terrestrial users. We also evaluate how environmental factors such as UAV height, building density, and throughput loss due to handovers impact the performance of our solution.},

abstract={The UAV is emerging as one of the greatest technology developments for rapid network coverage provisioning at affordable cost. The aim of this paper is to outsource network coverage of a specific area according to a desired quality of service requirement and to enable various entities in the network to have intelligence to make autonomous decisions using blockchain and auction mechanisms. In this regard, by considering a multiple-UAV network where each UAV is associated to its own controlling operator, this paper addresses two major challenges: the selection of the UAV for the desired quality of network coverage and the development of a distributed and autonomous real-time monitoring framework for the enforcement of service level agreement (SLA). For a suitable UAV selection, we employ a reputation-based auction mechanism to model the interaction between the business agent who is interested in outsourcing the network coverage and the UAV operators serving in closeby areas. In addition, theoretical analysis is performed to show that the proposed auction mechanism attains a dominant strategy equilibrium. For the SLA enforcement and trust model, we propose a permissioned blockchain architecture considering Support Vector Machine (SVM) for real-time autonomous and distributed monitoring of UAV service. In particular, smart contract features of the blockchain are invoked for enforcing the SLA terms of payment and penalty, and for quantifying the UAV service reputation. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of theoretical analysis and efficacy of the proposed model.},

To efficiently manage the available spectrum, computing, and caching resources for the MEC-mounted base station and UAVs, a resource optimization problem is formulated and carried out at a central controller. Considering the overlong solving time of the formulated problem and the sensitive delay requirements of vehicular applications, we transform the optimization problem using reinforcement learning and then design a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based solution. Through training the DDPG-based resource management model offline, optimal vehicle association and resource allocation decisions can be obtained rapidly. Simulation results demonstrate that the DDPG-based resource management scheme can converge within 200 episodes and achieve higher delay/quality-of-service satisfaction ratios than the random scheme.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been considered as effective flying base stations (FBSs) to provide on- demand wireless communications. Equipped with computation resource, UAVs are also capable of offering computation offloading opportunities for the mobile users (MUs) in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. However, due to the small hardware and load capacity, UAVs can only supply limited computation and energy resource. It is thus challenging for UAVs to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) of MUs, while minimizing their total resource consumptions. Toward this end, instead of using all resource for every single task, we propose an intelligent resource allocation algorithm based on reinforcement learning, which enables UAVs to make energy-efficent and computation-efficent allocation decisions intelligently. Then, we take UAVs as learning agents by forming resource allocation decisions as actions and designing a reward function with the aim of minimizing the weighted resource consumptions. Each UAV performs the algorithm only based on its local observations without information exchange among different UAVs. Simulation results show that the proposed reinforcement learning based approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of weighted consumptions in a whole time period.},

abstract={Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are considered reliable systems, suitable for several autonomous applications, especially for target detection and tracking. Although significant developments were achieved in object detection systems over the last decades using the deep learning technique known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), there are still research gaps in this area. In this paper, we present a new object detection-tracking algorithm that can be used on low power consuming processing boards. In particular, we analysed a specific application scenario in which a UAV patrols coastlines and autonomously classifies different kind of marine objects. Current state of the art solutions propose centralised architectures or flying systems with human in the loop, making the whole system poorly efficient and not scalable. On the contrary, applying a Deep Learning detection system that runs on commercial Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) makes UAVs potentially more efficient than humans (especially for dull tasks like coastline patrolling) and the whole system becomes easily scalable because each UAV can fly independently and the Ground Control Station does not represent a bottleneck. To deal with this task, a database consisting of more than 115000 images was created to train and test several CNN architectures. Furthermore, an adaptive detection-tracking algorithm was introduced to make the whole system faster by optimizing the balancing between detecting new objects and tracking existing targets. The proposed solution is based on the measure of the tracking confidence and the frame similarity, by means of the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index, computed both globally and locally. Finally, the developed algorithms were tested on a realistic scenario by means of a UAV test-bed.},

abstract={In air-to-ground communications, the network lifetime depends on the operation time of unmanned aerial vehicle-base stations (UAV-BSs) owing to the restricted battery capacity. Therefore, the maximization of energy efficiency and the minimization of outage ground users are important metrics of network performance. To achieve these two objectives, the location and transmit power of the UAV-BSs in the network must be optimized. This optimization problem may not be tractable in the conventional optimization framework because multiple UAV-BSs interact in a complicated manner. Hence, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and develop an algorithm to obtain a solution in a reinforcement learning framework. To avoid a central controller and high computational complexity, we employ a multi-agent distributed Q-learning algorithm to obtain a solution. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent Q-learning-based UAV-BS deployment and power control strategy to maximize energy efficiency and minimize the number of outage users in multi-UAV wireless networks. Through intensive simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can outperform benchmark algorithms in terms of average energy efficiency and number of average outage users in multi-UAV wireless networks.},

abstract={Flooding occurs frequently and causes loss of lives, and extensive damages to infrastructure and the environment. Accurate and timely mapping of flood extent to ascertain damages is critical and essential for relief activities. Recently, deep-learning-based approaches, including convolutional neural network (CNN) has shown promising results for flood extent mapping. However, these methods cannot extract floods underneath vegetation canopy using the optical imagery. This article attempts to address this problem by introducing an integrated CNN and region growing (RG) method for the mapping of both visible and underneath vegetation flooded areas. The CNN-based classifier is used to extract flooded areas from the optical images, whereas, the RG method is applied to estimate the extent of floods underneath vegetation that are not visible from imagery using the digital elevation model. A data augmentation technique is applied for training the CNN-based classifier to improve the classification results. The results show that the data augmentation can enhance the accuracy of image classification and the proposed integrated method efficiently detects floods in both the visible and the areas covered by vegetation, which is essential to supporting effective flood emergency response and recovery activities.},

To reach the destination while minimizing a weighted function of traveling time and number of radio failures, we propose in this paper a UAV joint trajectory and band switch approach. By leveraging Double Deep Q-Learning we develop two different approaches to learn a trajectory besides managing the band switch. A first blind approach switches the band along the trajectory anytime the UAV-UE throughput is below a predefined threshold. In addition, we propose a smart approach for simultaneous learning-based path planning of UAV and band switch. The two approaches are compared with an optimal band switch strategy in terms of radio failure and band switches for different thresholds. Results reveal that the smart approach is able in a high threshold regime to reduce the number of radio failures and band switches while reaching the desired destination.},

abstract={An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an airborne system or pilotless aircraft which is remotely controlled by a human operator on ground or by an onboard computer such that the vehicle moves autonomously. The range of applications in which UAVs are used is very large. This paper describes the application of developing an autonomous surveillance system using an UAV to identify a given target and/or objects of interest in the terrain over which it flies. Such a system can be used in rescue operations, especially in remote areas where physical access is difficult. It can also be used for military operations, farming or any field where surveillance of a given land area is required. The UAV developed in this work is capable of object detection. A mounted camera is used to give visual feedback, and an onboard processing unit runs image recognition software to identify the target in real time. Optimal algorithms are used to search and find the target from the given search area. After recognition of the target, the UAV can either be used to hold its position so as to have a video feed of the target, or return to its base station once the coordinates have been estimated using GPS modules or relay the GPS location to the base station. This paper describes the implementation of the hardware and software components that lead to the realization of the UAV and the application of object detection. The details of a new search algorithm and an example of object detection is presented . The work presented in this paper is the first part in the attempt to develop a cluster of UAVs meant to work in collaboration to be deployed for search and rescue operations.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently been proposed as flying base stations, called UAV-BSs, to provide reliable connections and extend the coverage of the existing wireless networks. The mobility of UAV-BSs leads to a dynamic network environment, in which the global network information is hard to be obtained. Since frequent information exchanges cause huge signaling overheads, it is difficult to deploy centralized algorithms in UAV networks. Hence, we propose a distributed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for multi-user access control in UAV networks. In particular, each user makes its own access decisions independently based on the local network information, and maximizes the long-term throughput while avoiding frequent handovers. Simulation results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and shown the superiority of the proposed DRL framework over the state of arts.},

abstract={The arrival of big data and the Internet of Things (IoT) era greatly promotes innovative in-network computing techniques, where the edge-cloud continuum becomes a feasible paradigm in handling multi-dimensional resources such as computing, storage, and communication. In this article, an energy constrained unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided mobile edge-cloud continuum framework is introduced, where the offloaded tasks from ground IoT devices can be cooperatively executed by UAVs acts as an edge server and cloud server connected to a ground base station (GBS), which can be seen as an access point. Specifically, a UAV is powered by the laser beam transmitted from a GBS, and can further charge IoT devices wirelessly. Here, an interesting task offloading and energy allocation problem is investigated by maximizing the long-term reward subject to executed task size and execution delay, under constraints such as energy causality, task causality, and cache causality. A federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) framework is proposed to learn the joint task offloading and energy allocation decision while reducing the training cost and preventing privacy leakage of DRL training. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme as compared to three baseline schemes.},

abstract={Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are viewed as effective acquisition platforms for several civilian applications. They can acquire images with an extremely high level of spatial detail compared to standard remote sensing platforms. However, these images are highly affected by illumination, rotation, and scale changes, which further increases the complexity of analysis compared to those obtained using standard remote sensing platforms. In this paper, we introduce a novel convolutional support vector machine (CSVM) network for the analysis of this type of imagery. Basically, the CSVM network is based on several alternating convolutional and reduction layers ended by a linear SVM classification layer. The convolutional layers in CSVM rely on a set of linear SVMs as filter banks for feature map generation. During the learning phase, the weights of the SVM filters are computed through a forward supervised learning strategy unlike the backpropagation algorithm widely used in standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This makes the proposed CSVM particularly suitable for detecting problems characterized by very limited training sample availability. The experiments carried out on two UAV data sets related to vehicles and solar-panel detection issues, with a 2-cm resolution, confirm the promising capability of the proposed CSVM network compared to recent state-of-the-art solutions based on pretrained CNNs.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles assisted (UAV-assisted) communication with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is one of the key technologies for future 6G communication due to the advantages, such as high mobility, coverage extend, power-saving, and signal concentration. However, the deployment of UAVs to optimize the overall objective of the system is proved to be an NP-hard problem. To address the complexity issue, several approaches present heuristic algorithms as a solution. Nevertheless, the request to locate the users for heuristic algorithms can lead to an invasion of privacy. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution with the federated learning framework, each UAV as an agent with Q-table to learn the deployment via observation from the total capacity of the relayed users. In addition, UAVs update the Q-table values through federated learning with others to bring the learning process together. As UAVs do not require location information and only model parameters are exchanged, user privacy is protected. The simulation shows that the proposed method deploys the UAVs with less information obtained in advance, and reaches the ability to transmit to the users as high as possible.},

The delivery of multi-media contents for the mixed augmented reality (AR) and normal multi-media application is assisted by multiple mobile UAV base stations, which cache popular contents for wireless backhaul link traffic offloading. To cope with the dynamic content requests and mobility of users in practical scenarios, the dynamic optimization problem for user association, caching placement of UAVs, real-time deployment of UAVs, and power allocation of NOMA is modeled as a stackelberg game to minimize the long-term content delivery delay. Specifically, the game is decomposed into a leader level problem and a number of follower level problems. A correction mechanism is added in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize the user association in leader level. A meta actor network is proposed in DRL to jointly optimize the UAVs caching placement, real-time UAVs deployment and power allocation of NOMA in follower level. Then, a dynamic caching placement and resource allocation algorithm based on multi-agent meta deep reinforcement learning is proposed to minimize the long-term content delivery delay. Finally, we demonstrate that the considerable gains are achieved by the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={We propose a deep learning-based method for object detection in UAV-borne thermal images that have the capability of observing scenes in both day and night. Compared with visible images, thermal images have lower requirements for illumination conditions, but they typically have blurred edges and low contrast. Using a boundary-aware salient object detection network, we extract the saliency maps of the thermal images to improve the distinguishability. Thermal images are augmented with the corresponding saliency maps through channel replacement and pixel-level weighted fusion methods. Considering the limited computing power of UAV platforms, a lightweight combinational neural network ComNet is used as the core object detection method. The YOLOv3 model trained on the original images is used as a benchmark and compared with the proposed method. In the experiments, we analyze the detection performances of the ComNet models with different image fusion schemes. The experimental results show that the average precisions (APs) for pedestrian and vehicle detection have been improved by 2%~5% compared with the benchmark without saliency map fusion and MobileNetv2. The detection speed is increased by over 50%, while the model size is reduced by 58%. The results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a compromise model, which has application potential in UAV-borne detection tasks.},

abstract={State-of-the-art drone technologies have severe flight time limitations due to weight constraints, which inevitably lead to a relatively small amount of available energy. Therefore, frequent battery replacement or recharging is necessary in applications such as delivery, exploration, or support to the wireless infrastructure. Mobile charging stations (i.e., mobile stations with charging equipment) for outdoor ad-hoc battery charging is one of the feasible solutions to address this issue. However, the ability of these platforms to charge the drones is limited in terms of the number and charging time. This paper designs an auction-based mechanism to control the charging schedule in multi-drone setting. In this paper, charging time slots are auctioned, and their assignment is determined by a bidding process. The main challenge in developing this framework is the lack of prior knowledge on the distribution of the number of drones participating in the auction. Based on optimal second-price-auction, the proposed formulation, then, relies on deep learning algorithms to learn such distribution online. Numerical results from extensive simulations show that the proposed deep-learning-based approach provides effective battery charging control in multi-drone scenarios.},

abstract={With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and the drastic growth of multi-UAV collaborative applications, research on UAV Ad-Hoc Network (UAVNET) has received extensive attention in recent years. Due to the decentralization nature and being prone to failure and high dynamics, the performance of traditional contention-based carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols and variants is far from satisfaction for UAVNETs. In this paper, we propose an intelligent access mechanism based on actor-critic (AC) algorithm, called AC-CSMA, with aim of achieving low access collision rate and high throughput for UAVNETs in dynamic environments. The UAVs are modeled as decision-making agents without priori information about the network (e.g., the number of nodes, link conditions, and other agents' strategies). Individual UAV agents learn their optimal strategy by using the historical sensory information including the number of collisions or successful transmissions. Numerical results show that the proposed AC-CSMA mechanism significantly outperforms traditional access mechanism in terms of collision rate and throughput for UAVNETs without compromising access fairness.},

Therefore, the study of guidance, navigation and control (GNC) system of UAV has becoming a popular research direction. Path planning plays an important role in the GNC system. In this paper, a multi-layer path planning algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL) technique is proposed. Compared to the classic Q-learning, the proposed multi-layer algorithm has a distinct advantage that it collects both global and local information which greatly improves overall performance. The proposed RL algorithm has two layers, the higher layer deals with the local information, which could be considered as a short-term strategy. The lower layer deals with the global information, which could be considered as a long-term strategy. Both the higher layer and lower layer are working in harmony to plan a collision-free path. B-spline curve approach is applied for on-line path smoothing. Simulation results in different scenarios prove the effectiveness of multi-layer Q-learning algorithm.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed as aerial base stations (BSs) due to their high mobility and flexible deployment. This paper focuses on a UAV-assisted wireless network, where users can be scheduled to get access to either an aerial BS or a terrestrial BS for uplink transmission. In contrast to state-of-the-art designs focusing on the instantaneous cost of the network, this paper aims at minimizing the long-term average transmit power consumed by the users by dynamically optimizing user association and power allocation in each time slot. Such a joint user association scheduling and power allocation problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). Unfortunately, solving such an MDP problem with the conventional relative value iteration (RVI) can suffer from the curses of dimensionality, in the presence of a large number of users. As a countermeasure, we propose a distributed RVI algorithm to reduce the dimension of the MDP problem, such that the original problem can be decoupled into multiple solvable small-scale MDP problems. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm can yield lower long-term average transmit power consumption than both the conventional RVI algorithm and a baseline algorithm with myopic policies.},

The localization and activity classification for aerial vehicle enables the utilization of mmWave Radars in security surveillance and privacy monitoring applications. In the proposed method, Radar's antennas are oriented vertically to measure the elevation angle of arrival of the aerial vehicle from ground station. The height of the aerial vehicle and horizontal distance of the aerial vehicle from Radar station on ground are estimated using the measured radial range and the elevation angle of arrival. The aerial vehicle's activity is classified using machine learning methods on micro-Doppler signatures extracted from Radar measurements taken in an outdoor environment. To evaluate performance, various light weight classification models such as logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), Light gradient boosting machine (GBM), and a custom lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) are investigated. Based on the results, the logistic regression, SVM, and Light GBM achieve an accuracy of 93%. Furthermore, the custom lightweight CNN can achieve activity classification accuracy of 95%. The performance of the proposed lightweight CNN is also compared with the pre-trained models (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, and InceptionResNet). The proposed lightweight CNN suits best for embedded and/or edge computing devices.},

abstract={Cellular-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems are a promising paradigm to provide reliable and fast Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLoS) communication services for UAV operations. However, such systems are facing a serious GPS spoofing threat for UAV’s position. To enable safe and secure UAV navigation BVLoS, this paper proposes a cellular network assisted UAV position monitoring and anti-GPS spoofing system, where deep learning approach is used to live detect spoofed GPS positions. Specifically, the proposed system introduces a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) model which is trained on the statistical properties of path loss measurements collected from nearby base stations to decide the authenticity of the GPS position. Experiment results indicate the accuracy rate of detecting GPS spoofing under our proposed approach is more than 93% with three base stations and it can also reach 80% with only one base station.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the potential of providing reliable high-rate connectivity, are becoming a promising component of future wireless networks. A UAV collects data from a set of randomly distributed sensors, where both the locations of these sensors and their data volume to be transmitted are unknown to the UAV. In order to assist the UAV in finding the optimal motion trajectory in the face of the uncertainty without the above knowledge whilst aiming for maximizing the cumulative collected data, we formulate a reinforcement learning problem by modelling the motion-trajectory as a Markov decision process with the UAV acting as the learning agent. Then, we propose a pair of novel trajectory optimization algorithms based on stochastic modelling and reinforcement learning, which allows the UAV to optimize its flight trajectory without the need for system identification. More specifically, by dividing the considered region into small tiles, we conceive state-action-reward-state-action (Sarsa) and Q-learning based UAV-trajectory optimization algorithms (i.e., SUTOA and QUTOA) aiming to maximize the cumulative data collected during the finite flight-time. Our simulation results demonstrate that both of the proposed approaches are capable of finding an optimal trajectory under the flight-time constraint. The preference for QUTOA vs. SUTOA depends on the relative position of the start and the end points of the UAVs.},

abstract={The large aspect ratio of the Unmanned Air Vehicle(UAV) wing inevitably causes the wing to fail due to its complex operating conditions such as heavy loads, large disturbances and strong impact. However, the fault prediction of the wing is often characterized by complexity, weakness, coupling and complex causality, which makes the traditional fault prediction method not achieve good results. As a newcomer in the field of intelligent fault diagnosis, deep learning can independently explore representative diagnostic information hidden in the original data and directly establish an accurate mapping relationship between the original data and the running state. This paper proposes a fault diagnosis and prediction method for large aspect ratio UAV wing based on deep Belief network and has done a lot of experiments to show that this method can effectively establish the accurate mapping between monitoring data and wing health status. Achieve accurate troubleshooting and prediction. The accuracy is significantly better than other traditional machine learning methods.},

abstract={Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology is endorsed to enable applications in domains such as Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor networks, and cellular networks. Particularly, time-sensitive and energy-limited IoT networks located in hard-to-reach areas require efficient/cost-effective data collection solution. To address this matter, we consider a multi-UAV enabled IoT network, where several UAVs collect data from time-constrained sensor nodes (SNs). In our framework, SNs are managed by cluster heads (CHs), then UAVs collect data from them. We formulate the problem of minimizing system’s deployment costs and operating energy to collect data within deadlines, subject to communication, UAVs mission time, and battery capacity constraints. To solve it, we propose a two-step approach. In the first step, an efficient K-means based method groups SNs and deploys CHs. Then, UAV-based offline and online data collection methods are proposed. In the offline setting where the system’s status is known beforehand, UAV paths are determined using near-optimal meta-heuristics. In simulations, the nearest-neighbor and Tabu search provided best offline performances, conditioned on the system’s parameters. In the online setting where no system information is available, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approaches are proposed. Results demonstrate the superiority of the actor-critic solution.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a promising technology in the 6G communication system can collect and transmit information intelligently. However, the existing methods are difficult to design UAV's trajectory to guarantee the information freshness performance. In this paper, the information freshness of a multiple-UAV communication system is modeled based on the age of information (AoI) and the minimization AoI optimization problem subjected to the minimal energy is formulated. In order to solve this nonconvex optimization problem, reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheme is proposed to design the UAVs' trajectory. The proposed scheme constructs the reward function depending on the accumulated AoI to make a fast trajectory decision and reduce the AoI of UAV communication system. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can improve 21.7% performance gain of information freshness compared to the random scheme and the greedy scheme, and 7.7% performance gain compared to the flying-hover-communication scheme. In addition, the proposed UAV trajectory design scheme has the superior convergence.},

abstract={The cache-enabling unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks for mixture of augmented reality (AR) and normal multimedia applications are investigated, which is assisted by UAV base stations. The user association, power allocation of NOMA, deployment of UAVs and caching placement of UAVs are jointly optimized to minimize the content delivery delay. A branch and bound (BaB) based algorithm is proposed to obtain the per-slot optimization. To cope with the dynamic content requests and mobility of users in practical scenarios, the original optimization problem is transformed to a Stackelberg game. Specifically, the game is decomposed into a leader level user association sub-problem and a number of power allocation, UAV deployment and caching placement follower level sub-problems. The long-term minimization was further solved by a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm. Simulation result shows that the content delivery delay of the proposed BaB based algorithm is much lower than benchmark algorithms, as the optimal solution in each time slot is achieved. Meanwhile, the proposed DRL based algorithm achieves a relatively low long-term content delivery delay in the dynamic environment with lower computation complexity than BaB based algorithm.},

abstract={With the raise of the world population, increasing agricultural productivity has become a necessity for farmers. One way to reduce the cost of chemicals and environmental impact is to allocate the right doses of herbicide to the right place and at the right time (precision agriculture). Nowadays, automatic weeds detection is one of the most challenging problem for precision agriculture. However, weeds and crop are hard to discriminate because of their strong similarities. One of the approaches used for weed detection is machine learning. The main common point between machine learning algorithms is the need of training data. In this article we propose to use deep features and one-class classification on unsupervised data for weed detection in UAV images. The results show that one-class classification can be comparable to the literature and also to a deep learning model trained with supervised training data labeling. Results obtained on all test datasets can be up to 90% depending on the data used for the training.},

abstract={Real-time path planning typically aims to obtain a collision-free and shorter path with lower computational complexity for UAVs in unknown environment. Apart from the above basic objective, kinematic constraints and the smoothness of path should be further considered especially for fixed-wing UAVs restricted by their maneuverability. In this paper, we propose an adaptive real-time path planning method based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. Taking the sensor data of obstacles nearby and the target’s position relative to the UAV as the decision information, and designing the action satisfying kinematic constraints of fixed-wing UAV, the proposed method can plan a feasible path for fixed-wing UAV in real-time. Experimental results show that the adaptive action devised combining with greedy reward, granularity reward and smoothness reward can accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm and enhance the smoothness of the planned path.},

The PIL uses image data from the visualized FFT graph to detect robust points, and compares the average image similarity with a reference FFT template associated with a target of interest. Whereas, the KNN uses FFT-format csv files to compare the average distance similarity. Experiments were performed with the two methods. As a result, the accuracy rate of 83% and 61% was shown in each of PIL and KNN. The major deliverables of this work are a software package framework one may use to experiment with various sound samples and classifiers via modifiable classifier modules and initial testing of two classifiers.

abstract={There have been increasing interests in employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as drones for telecommunication purpose. In such networks, UAVs act as base stations and provide downloading service to users. Compared with conventional terrestrial base stations, such UAV-BSs can dynamically adjust their locations to improve network performance. However, there exists two important issues in UAV networks, handoff overhead and UAV deployment. The handoff overhead issue is particularly important for UAVs because UAV BSs are connected to cellular BSs via wireless backhaul links, which are costly in terms of spectrum usage and energy consumption. Hence, it is highly desirable to eliminate any unnecessary handoff to minimise the waste of wireless backhaul. The UAV deployment, on the other hand, introduces a new tool for radio resource management, since BS positions are open for network optimisation. In this paper, a smart user association algorithm, named reinforcement learning handoff (RLH), is devised to reduce redundant handoffs in UAV networks and two methods of UAV mobility control are designed to co-operate with the proposed RLH algorithm to optimise the system throughput. In the RLH algorithm, users perform handoffs according to the reward of a reinforcement learning process. In UAV deployment two UAV mobility control methods are proposed respectively base on the SNR estimation and based on the K-Means approach. According to our simulation results, the RLH algorithm can reduce the number of handoffs by 75%.},

In order to improve the accuracy of traditional terrain linearization method, B-spline neural network is applied to fit terrain data. Terrain-aided navigation (TAN) system often need to preload digital elevation map (DEM), so offline training of the neural network using the actual terrain data is practical. The neural network calculates the continuous terrain elevation and terrain gradient. Then these data are used in EKF. The simulation results show that the B-spline neural network can calculate the high-accuracy linearized terrain data on the DEM, and the performance of TAN system is better by using EKF combined B-spline neural network method.},

abstract={To provide ubiquitous connectivity and achieve high reliability in the under-served and under-connected areas, the integration of aerial and space communication infrastructures into terrestrial networks is envisioned as a promising solution. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in the role of aerial base stations (BSs), have been recommended to solve the coverage problem. In order to effectively leverage the advantages of UAVs deployment, UAV trajectory and resource management are required to effectively adapt to the network conditions. However, providing backhaul connectivity for terrestrial and aerial BSs deployed in these areas is another tremendous challenge. In this paper, we aim at jointly optimizing backhaul link and access link in a space-air-ground integrated network. We consider low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites as an effective backhaul solution. For access links, we manage the radio resource among UAVs and small cell BSs, and optimize the trajectories of UAVs in the network. To solve the problem in a distributed manner, we utilize the tools of reinforcement learning, and propose two approaches based on the multi-armed bandit and satisfaction algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches yield significant performance compared to the benchmark algorithms.},

abstract={Air ground integrated mobile cloud computing (MCC) provides unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) the capability to act as an aerial relay with more flexibility and resilience. In the cloud computing architecture, the data generated by ground users (GUs) can be offloaded to the remote server for fast processing. However, the heterogeneity of mobile tasks makes the data size distributed among GUs unbalanced. Besides, the energy efficiency of UAVs movement should be carefully considered for sustainable flight and obstacle avoidance. In general, such a joint trajectory issue can hardly be formulated as a convex optimization in unpredictable and dynamic environments. This paper proposes a potential game combined multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize multiple UAVs' trajectory with the consideration of GUs' offloading delay, energy efficiency as well as obstacle avoidance system. In specific, we first model the issue as a mixed integer non-linear problem (MINP), in which the service assignment between multi-user and multi-UAV is solved by potential game. The convergence to a Nash Equilibrium (NE) can be achieved by distributive service assignment update with infinite iteration. Then, we optimize the trajectory with obstacle avoidance at each UAV by MADDPG approach, which has a great advantage of centralized-training and decentralized-execution to reduce the global synchronized communication overhead. UAVs movement can be optimized in continuity rather than other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches generating discrete simple actions. Experiments demonstrate the proposed game-combined learning algorithm can minimize the offloading delay, enhance UAVs’ energy efficiency and avoid the obstacles at the same time.},

abstract={The commercialization of aerial image processing is highly dependent on the platforms such as UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). However, the lack of an automated UAV forced landing site detection system has been identified as one of the main impediments to allow UAV flight over populated areas in civilian airspace. This article proposes a UAV forced landing site detection system that is based on machine learning approaches including the Gaussian Mixture Model and the Support Vector Machine. A range of learning parameters are analysed including the number of Guassian mixtures, support vector kernels including linear, radial basis function Kernel (RBF) and polynormial kernel (poly), and the order of RBF kernel and polynormial kernel. Moreover, a modified footprint operator is employed during feature extraction to better describe the geometric characteristics of the local area surrounding a pixel. The performance of the presented system is compared to a baseline UAV forced landing site detection system which uses edge features and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) region type classifier. Experiments conducted on aerial image datasets captured over typical urban environments reveal improved landing site detection can be achieved with an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel using a combination of colour and texture features. Compared to the baseline system, the proposed system provides significant improvement in term of the chance to detect a safe landing area, and the performance is more stable than the baseline in the presence of changes to the UAV altitude.},

abstract={Recent advances in camera equipped drone applications and their widespread use increased the demand on vision based object detection algorithms for aerial images. Object detection process is inherently a challenging task as a generic computer vision problem, however, since the use of object detection algorithms on UAVs (or on drones) is relatively a new area, it remains as a more challenging problem to detect objects in aerial images. There are several reasons for that including: (i) the lack of large drone datasets including large object variance, (ii) the large orientation and scale variance in drone images when compared to the ground images, and (iii) the difference in texture and shape features between the ground and the aerial images. Deep learning based object detection algorithms can be classified under two main categories: (a) single-stage detectors and (b) multi-stage detectors. Both single-stage and multi-stage solutions have their advantages and disadvantages over each other. However, a technique to combine the good sides of each of those solutions could yield even a stronger solution than each of those solutions individually. In this paper, we propose an ensemble network, SyNet, that combines a multi-stage method with a single-stage one with the motivation of decreasing the high false negative rate of multi-stage detectors and increasing the quality of the single-stage detector proposals. As building blocks, CenterNet and Cascade R-CNN with pretrained feature extractors are utilized along with an ensembling strategy. We report the state of the art results obtained by our proposed solution on two different datasets: namely MS-COCO and visDrone with %52.1 mAPIoU=0.75 is obtained on MS-COCO val2017 dataset and %26.2 mAPIoU=0.75 is obtained on VisDrone test - set.

Under the name "Smart Factory", the Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) aims to send data from systems that monitor and control the physical world to data processing systems for which cloud computing has proven to be an important tool to meet processing needs. unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now being introduced as part of IIoT and can perform important tasks. UAVs are now considered one of the best remote sensing techniques for collecting data over large areas. In the field of fog and edge computing, the IoT gateway connects various objects and sensors to the Internet. It function as a common interface for different networks and support different communication protocols. Edge intelligence is expected to replace Deep Learning (DL) computing in the cloud, providing a variety of distributed, low-latency and reliable intelligent services. In this paper, An unmanned aerial vehicle is automatically integrated into an industrial control system through an IoT gateway platform. Rather than sending photos from the UAV to the cloud for processing, an AI cloud trained model is deployed in the IoT gateway and used to process the taken photos. This model is designed to overcome the latency channels of the cloud computing architecture. The results show that the monitoring and tracking process using advanced computing in the IoT gateway is significantly faster than in the cloud.},

abstract={Recently, needs for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are attachable to the wall have been highlighted. As one of the ways to address the need, researches on various tilting multirotors that can increase maneuverability has been employed. Unfortunately, existing studies on the tilting multirotors require considerable amounts of prior information on the complex dynamic model. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning on quadrotors has been studied to mitigate this issue. Yet, these are only been applied to standard quadrotors, whose systems are less complex than those of tilting multirotors. In this paper, a novel reinforcement learning-based method is proposed to control a tilting multirotor on real-world applications, which is the first attempt to apply reinforcement learning to a tilting multirotor. To do so, we propose a novel reward function for a neural network model that takes power efficiency into account. The model is initially trained over a simulated environment and then fine-tuned using real-world data in order to overcome the sim-to-real gap issue. Furthermore, a novel, efficient state representation with respect to the goal frame that helps the network learn optimal policy better is proposed. As verified on real-world experiments, our proposed method shows robust controllability by overcoming the complex dynamics of tilting multirotors.},

abstract={We propose a DQN based reinforcement learning method in swarm communication constraint based formation control with target searching function. A decentralized communication performance indicator is applied in evaluating the UAV's formation control in simulating a more realistic wireless communication environment between each UAV. A target searching model based on communication aware formation control is presented. The simulation results show that the trained model with state observation space and one thrust action space could be applied in the larger swarm system's group formation and target point tracking.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are advantageous in their high maneuverability for long-range outdoor target tracking. In this paper, we develop a UAV-based target tracking and recognition system using an intelligent gimbal system with the capabilities of accurate camera positioning, fast image processing, and multi-modality information fusion. Algorithms of consensus-based target tracking, moving background processing, and neural network-based target detection/recognition are optimized for embedded implementation. A geographic information system (GIS) is utilized to provide geo-location, environmental, and contextual information. The experimental results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed UAV-based target tracking and recognition framework.},

abstract={The traditional control framework of UAV(unmanned aerial vehicle) platform is mainly applicable for stable flight. But there are still some deficiencies in solving the singularity and strong coupling problems occur in aggressive maneuver flight. This paper systematically studies the UAV's maneuver flight control method, and proposes a novel quaternion based adaptive dynamic inversion control method and a maneuver motion command generation method based on long-short-term memory network. To verify the effectiveness of the above mentioned methods, an autonomous UAV flight simulation system is established. This research helps to understand and realize the maneuver flight of fixed-wing UAVs.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce how to predict the parachute deploy for landing at the desired point. The UAV-parachute system is required 9-DOF dynamic modeling, so we build up the equations of motion for this system. And then the input and the output data sets are trained to compose the neural network. The input data sets are the flight conditions such as the deploy position, UAV's velocity, and wind velocity and the output data sets are the landing points such as the cross range and the down range position that simulated by the 9-DOF dynamic modeling. Using the training input and output data sets we can build up the nonlinear function approximator for the neural network. So we can predict the deploy timing and conditions such as the deploy position, UAV's velocity for landing at the desired point.},
