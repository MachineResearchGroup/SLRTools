ABSTRACT = {The electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by high voltage power systems can cause a serious problem for nearby electrically conductive structures, such as railroads, communication lines, or pipelines, that would place a system&rsquo;s integrity and the operational safety of the structure at high level of risk. According to the IEEE standard-80, by implementing a well-designed mitigation system, the induced voltage on neighboring electrically conductive structure can reach a harmless level. The mitigation system can enhance the overall integrity of pipelines and provide higher operation safety for personal during working on the exposed parts of metallic pipelines or conductive appurtenances. An accurate prediction about the level of induced voltage is absolutely necessary to design a suitable mitigation system for metallic pipelines. Thus, in this work a hybrid prediction methodology composed of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and a backtracking search algorithm (BSA) is developed to accurately predict the electromagnetic inference&rsquo;s effects on metallic pipelines with shared right-of-way (RoW) and high voltage overhead lines (OHLs). Through the combination of BSA as a robust and efficient optimization algorithm in the learning process of an ANFIS approach, a hybrid data mining algorithm has been developed to predict the induced voltage on mitigated and unmitigated pipelines more accurately and reliably. The simulation results are validated by data sets observed from the Current Distribution, Electromagnetic Interference, Grounding and Soil Structure Analysis (CDEGS) software. From the simulation results it was confirmed that the proposed hybrid method is effective in accurately predicting the induced voltage on pipelines with changing system parameters. Furthermore, to evaluate the precision and applicability of the developed approach in this paper, its estimates are compared with the results obtained from an artificial neural network (ANN), a support vector regression (SVR) and an ANFIS optimized by other well-known optimization algorithms. The obtained results indicate higher accuracy of the developed hybrid method over other artificial intelligence based approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {The study collected particulate matter (PM)-related documents in Korea and classified main keywords related to particulate matter, health, and social problems using text and opinion mining. The study attempted to present a prediction model for important causes related to particulate matter by using social big-data analysis. Topics related to particulate matter were collected from online (online news sites, blogs, caf&eacute;s, social network services, and bulletin boards) from 1 January 2015, to 31 May 2016, and 226,977 text documents were included in the analysis. The present study applied machine-learning analysis technique to forecast the risk of particulate matter. Emotions related to particulate matter were found to be 65.4% negative, 7.7% neutral, and 27.0% positive. Intelligent services that can detect early and prevent unknown crisis situations of particulate matter may be possible if risk factors of particulate matter are predicted through the linkage of the machine-learning prediction model.},

ABSTRACT = {Pervasive healthcare services have undergone a great evolution in recent years. The technological development of communication networks, including the Internet, sensor networks, and M2M (Machine-to-Machine) have given rise to new architectures, applications, and standards related to addressing almost all current e-health challenges. Among the standards, the importance of OpenEHR has been recognized, since it enables the separation of medical semantics from data representation of electronic health records. However, it does not meet the requirements related to interoperability of e-health devices in M2M networks, or in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Moreover, the lack of interoperability hampers the application of new data-processing techniques, such as data mining and online analytical processing, due to the heterogeneity of the data and the sources. This article proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform for pervasive healthcare that ensures interoperability, quality of the detection process, and scalability in an M2M-based architecture, and provides functionalities for the processing of high volumes of data, knowledge extraction, and common healthcare services. The platform uses the semantics described in OpenEHR for both data quality evaluation and standardization of healthcare data stored by the association of IoMT devices and observations defined in OpenEHR. Moreover, it enables the application of big data techniques and online analytic processing (OLAP) through Hadoop Map/Reduce and content-sharing through fast healthcare interoperability resource (FHIR) application programming interfaces (APIs).},

ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional (3D) pipe network modeling plays an essential part in high performance-based smart city applications. Given that massive 3D pipe networks tend to be difficult to manage and to visualize, we propose in this study a hybrid framework for high-performance modeling of a 3D pipe network, including pipe network data model and high-performance modeling. The pipe network data model is devoted to three-dimensional pipe network construction based on network topology and building information models (BIMs). According to the topological relationships of the pipe point pipelines, the pipe network is decomposed into multiple pipe segment units. The high-performance modeling of 3D pipe network contains a spatial 3D model, the instantiation, adaptive rendering, and combination parallel computing. Spatial 3D model (S3M) is proposed for spatial data transmission, exchange, and visualization of massive and multi-source 3D spatial data. The combination parallel computing framework with GPU and OpenMP was developed to reduce the processing time for pipe networks. The results of the experiments showed that the hybrid framework achieves a high efficiency and the hardware resource occupation is reduced.},

ABSTRACT = {The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) as a solution in diverse application domains has nurtured the expansion in the number of devices and data volume. Multiple platforms and protocols have been introduced and resulted in high device ubiquity and heterogeneity. However, currently available IoT architectures face challenges to accommodate the diversity in IoT devices or services operating under different operating systems and protocols. In this paper, we propose a new IoT architecture that utilizes the component-based design approach to create and define the loosely-coupled, standalone but interoperable service components for IoT systems. Furthermore, a data-driven feedback function is included as a key feature of the proposed architecture to enable a greater degree of system automation and to reduce the dependency on mankind for data analysis and decision-making. The proposed architecture aims to tackle device interoperability, system reusability and the lack of data-driven functionality issues. Using a real-world use case on a proof-of-concept prototype, we examined the viability and usability of the proposed architecture.},

ABSTRACT = {Modelling and simulation of social interaction and networks are of high interest in multiple disciplines and fields of application ranging from fundamental social sciences to smart city management. Future smart city infrastructures and management are characterised by adaptive and self-organising control using real-world sensor data. In this work, humans are considered as sensors. Virtual worlds, e.g., simulations and games, are commonly closed and rely on artificial social behaviour and synthetic sensor information generated by the simulator program or using data collected off-line by surveys. In contrast, real worlds have a higher diversity. Agent-based modelling relies on parameterised models. The selection of suitable parameter sets is crucial to match real-world behaviour. In this work, a framework combining agent-based simulation with crowd sensing and social data mining using mobile agents is introduced. The crowd sensing via chat bots creates augmented virtuality and reality by augmenting the simulated worlds with real-world interaction and vice versa. The simulated world interacts with real-world environments, humans, machines, and other virtual worlds in real-time. Among the mining of physical sensors (e.g., temperature, motion, position, and light) of mobile devices like smartphones, mobile agents can perform crowd sensing by participating in question&ndash;answer dialogues via a chat blog (provided by smartphone Apps or integrated into WEB pages and social media). Additionally, mobile agents can act as virtual sensors (offering data exchanged with other agents) and create a bridge between virtual and real worlds. The ubiquitous usage of digital social media has relevant impact on social interaction, mobility, and opinion-making, which has to be considered. Three different use-cases demonstrate the suitability of augmented agent-based simulation for social network analysis using parameterised behavioural models and mobile agent-based crowd sensing. This paper gives a rigorous overview and introduction of the challenges and methodologies used to study and control large-scale and complex socio-technical systems using agent-based methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this descriptive research paper is to initiate discussions on the use of innovative technologies and their potential to support the research and development of pan-Canadian monitoring and surveillance activities associated with environmental impacts on health and within the health system. Its primary aim is to provide a review of disruptive technologies and their current uses in the environment and in healthcare. Drawing on extensive experience in population-level surveillance through the use of technology, knowledge from prior projects in the field, and conducting a review of the technologies, this paper is meant to serve as the initial steps toward a better understanding of the research area. In doing so, we hope to be able to better assess which technologies might best be leveraged to advance this unique intersection of health and environment. This paper first outlines the current use of technologies at the intersection of public health and the environment, in particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper provides a description for each of these technologies, along with a summary of their current applications, and a description of the challenges one might face with adopting them. Thereafter, a high-level reference architecture, that addresses the challenges of the described technologies and could potentially be incorporated into the pan-Canadian surveillance system, is conceived and presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Making transport systems sustainable is a topic that has attracted the attention of many researchers and urban planners. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Smart Cities Network (ASCN) was initiated to develop a sustainable transport system in the ASEAN countries. A comprehensive understanding of street networks (SNs) can contribute significantly to the achievement of this initiative. Therefore, this paper measured and compared characteristics of drivable street networks (DSNs) and walkable street networks (WSNs) of the 26 ASCN pilot cities by applying multiple network metrics. The OSMnx tool was used to download and analyse WSNs and DSNs from the OpenStreetMap. The findings present the topological and geometric characteristics of WSNs and DSNs that are diverse and characterized by different factors. The cities with orthogonal street grids, high street density, intersection density, and fewer cul-de-sacs have good accessibility to reach destinations. In contrast, some other cities have more curvilinear and circuitous SNs with many missing links to other streets, which in turn are prone to traffic disruption. The study highlights the important features of SNs that have significant implications for future designs of SNs in the ASCN whose goal is to make cities smart and liveable for ASEAN members.},

ABSTRACT = {Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) issues have a direct impact on the health and comfort of building occupants. In this paper, an experimental low-cost system has been developed to address IAQ issues by using a distributed internet of things platform to control and monitor the indoor environment in building spaces while adopting a data-driven approach. The system is based on several real-time sensor data to model the indoor air quality and accurately control the ventilation system through algorithms to maintain a comfortable level of IAQ by balancing indoor and outdoor pollutant concentrations using the Indoor Air Quality Index approach. This paper describes hardware and software details of the system as well as the algorithms, models, and control strategies of the proposed solution which can be integrated in detached ventilation systems. Furthermore, a mobile app has been developed to inform, in real time, different-expertise-user profiles showing indoor and outdoor IAQ conditions. The system is implemented in a small prototype box and early-validated with different test cases considering various pollutant concentrations, reaching a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3&ndash;4.},

ABSTRACT = {Vehicle Logo Recognition (VLR) is an important part of vehicle behavior analysis and can provide supplementary information for vehicle identification, which is an essential research topic in robotic systems. However, the inaccurate extraction of vehicle logo candidate regions will affect the accuracy of logo recognition. Additionally, the existing methods have low recognition rate for most small vehicle logos and poor performance under complicated environments. A VLR method based on enhanced matching, constrained region extraction and SSFPD network is proposed in this paper to solve the aforementioned problems. A constrained region extraction method based on segmentation of the car head and car tail is proposed to accurately extract the candidate region of logo. An enhanced matching method is proposed to improve the detection performance of small objects, which augment each of training images by copy-pasting small objects many times in the unconstrained region. A single deep neural network based on a reduced ResNeXt model and Feature Pyramid Networks is proposed in this paper, which is named as Single Shot Feature Pyramid Detector (SSFPD). The SSFPD uses the reduced ResNeXt to improve classification performance of the network and retain more detailed information for small-sized vehicle logo detection. Additionally, it uses the Feature Pyramid Networks module to bring in more semantic context information to build several high-level semantic feature maps, which effectively improves recognition performance. Extensive evaluations have been made on self-collected and public vehicle logo datasets. The proposed method achieved 93.79% accuracy on the Common Vehicle Logos Dataset and 99.52% accuracy on another public dataset, respectively, outperforming the existing methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are increasingly embraced around the world to advance smart mobility and more broadly, smart, and sustainable cities. Algorithms form the basis of decision-making in AVs, allowing them to perform driving tasks autonomously, efficiently, and more safely than human drivers and offering various economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, algorithmic decision-making in AVs can also introduce new issues that create new safety risks and perpetuate discrimination. We identify bias, ethics, and perverse incentives as key ethical issues in the AV algorithms&rsquo; decision-making that can create new safety risks and discriminatory outcomes. Technical issues in the AVs&rsquo; perception, decision-making and control algorithms, limitations of existing AV testing and verification methods, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities can also undermine the performance of the AV system. This article investigates the ethical and technical concerns surrounding algorithmic decision-making in AVs by exploring how driving decisions can perpetuate discrimination and create new safety risks for the public. We discuss steps taken to address these issues, highlight the existing research gaps and the need to mitigate these issues through the design of AV&rsquo;s algorithms and of policies and regulations to fully realise AVs&rsquo; benefits for smart and sustainable cities.},

ABSTRACT = {The 5G cellular network is expected to provide core service platform for the expanded Internet of Things (IoT) by supporting enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communication (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, provide civil, commercial, and government services in various fields. Particularly in a 5G IoT scenario, UAV-aided network communications will fulfill an increasingly important role and will require the tracking of multiple UAV targets. As UAVs move quickly, maintaining the stability of the communication connection in 5G will be a challenge. Therefore, it is necessary to track the trajectory of UAVs. At present, the GM-PHD filter has a problem that the new target intensity must be known, and it cannot obtain the moving target trajectory and the influence of the clutter is likely to cause false alarm. A UAV-PHD filter is proposed in this work to improve the traditional GM-PHD filter by applying machine learning to the emergency detection and trajectory tracking of UAV targets. An out-of-sight detection algorithm for multiple UAVs is then presented to improve tracking performance. The method is assessed by simulation using MATLAB, and OSPA distance is utilized as an evaluation indicator. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed method can be applied to the tracking of multiple UAV targets in future 5G-IoT scenarios, and the performance is superior to the traditional GM-PHD filter.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors are becoming increasingly popular, especially in monitoring large and ambient environments. Applications that embrace IoT and sensors often require mining the data feeds that are collected at frequent intervals for intelligence. Despite the fact that such sensor data are massive, most of the data contents are identical and repetitive; for example, human traffic in a park at night. Most of the traditional classification algorithms were originally formulated decades ago, and they were not designed to handle such sensor data effectively. Hence, the performance of the learned model is often poor because of the small granularity in classification and the sporadic patterns in the data. To improve the quality of data mining from the IoT data, a new pre-processing methodology based on subspace similarity detection is proposed. Our method can be well integrated with traditional data mining algorithms and anomaly detection methods. The pre-processing method is flexible for handling similar kinds of sensor data that are sporadic in nature that exist in many ambient sensing applications. The proposed methodology is evaluated by extensive experiment with a collection of classical data mining models. An improvement over the precision rate is shown by using the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Fly-rock induced by blasting is an undesirable phenomenon in quarries. It can be dangerous for humans, equipment, and buildings. To minimize its undesirable hazards, we proposed a state-of-the-art technology of fly-rock prediction based on artificial neural network (ANN) models and their robust combination, called EANNs model (ensemble of ANN models); 210 fly-rock events were recorded to develop and test the ANN and EANNs models. Of thi sample, 80% of the whole dataset was assigned to develop the models, the remaining 20% was assigned to confirm the models developed. Accordingly, five ANN models were designed and developed using the training dataset (i.e., 80% of the whole original data) first; then, their predictions on the training dataset were ensembled to generate a new training dataset. Subsequently, another ANN model was developed based on the new set of training data (i.e., EANNs model). Its performance was evaluated through a variety of performance indices, such as MAE (mean absolute error), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), RMSE (root-mean-square error), R2 (correlation coefficient), and VAF (variance accounted for). A promising result was found for the proposed EANNs model in predicting blast-induced fly-rock with a MAE = 2.777, MAPE = 0.017, RMSE = 4.346, R2 = 0.986, and VAF = 98.446%. To confirm the performance of the proposed EANNs model, another ANN model with the same structure was developed and tested on the training and testing datasets. The findings also indicated that the proposed EANNs model yielded better performance than those of the ANN model with the same structure.},

ABSTRACT = {Underground spaces have become increasingly important in recent decades in metropolises. In this regard, the demand for the use of underground spaces and, consequently, the excavation of these spaces has increased significantly. Excavation of an underground space is accompanied by risks and many uncertainties. Tunnel convergence, as the tendency for reduction of the excavated area due to change in the initial stresses, is frequently observed, in order to monitor the safety of construction and to evaluate the design and performance of the tunnel. This paper presents a model/equation obtained by a gene expression programming (GEP) algorithm, aiming to predict convergence of tunnels excavated in accordance to the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM). To obtain this goal, a database was prepared based on experimental datasets, consisting of six input and one output parameter. Namely, tunnel depth, cohesion, frictional angle, unit weight, Poisson&rsquo;s ratio, and elasticity modulus were considered as model inputs, while the cumulative convergence was utilized as the model&rsquo;s output. Configurations of the GEP model were determined through the trial-error technique and finally an optimum model is developed and presented. In addition, an equation has been extracted from the proposed GEP model. The comparison of the GEP-derived results with the experimental findings, which are in very good agreement, demonstrates the ability of GEP modeling to estimate the tunnel convergence in a reliable, robust, and practical manner.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart growth is widely adopted by urban planners as an innovative approach, which can guide a city to develop into an environmentally friendly modern city. Therefore, determining the degree of smart growth is quite significant. In this paper, sustainable degree (SD) is proposed to evaluate the level of urban smart growth, which is established by principal component regression (PCR) and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network. In the case study of Yumen and Otago, the SD values of Yumen and Otago are 0.04482 and 0.04591, respectively, and both plans are moderately successful. Yumen should give more attention to environmental development while Otago should concentrate on economic development. In order to make a reliable future plan, a self-organizing map (SOM) is conducted to classify all indicators and the RBF neural network-trained indicators are separate under different classifications to output new plans. Finally, the reliability of the plan is confirmed by cellular automata (CA). Through simulation of the trend of urban development, it is found that the development speed of Yumen and Otago would increase slowly in the long term. This paper provides a powerful reference for cities pursuing smart growth.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart Cities are approaching the Internet of Things (IoT) World. Most of the first-generation Smart City solutions are based on Extract Transform Load (ETL); processes and languages that mainly support pull protocols for data gathering. IoT solutions are moving forward to event-driven processes using push protocols. Thus, the concept of IoT applications has turned out to be widespread; but it was initially &ldquo;implemented&rdquo; with ETL; rule-based solutions; and finally; with true data flows. In this paper, these aspects are reviewed, highlighting the requirements for smart city IoT applications and in particular, the ones that implement a set of specific MicroServices for IoT Applications in Smart City contexts. Moreover; our experience has allowed us to implement a suite of MicroServices for Node-RED; which has allowed for the creation of a wide range of new IoT applications for smart cities that includes dashboards, IoT Devices, data analytics, discovery, etc., as well as a corresponding Life Cycle. The proposed solution has been validated against a large number of IoT applications, as it can be verified by accessing the https://www.Snap4City.org portal; while only three of them have been described in the paper. In addition, the reported solution assessment has been carried out by a number of smart city experts. The work has been developed in the framework of the Select4Cities PCP (PreCommercial Procurement), funded by the European Commission as Snap4City platform.},

ABSTRACT = {Industry is going through a transformation phase, enabling automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes, and this transformation is called Industry 4.0. Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) applications require real-time processing, near-by storage, ultra-low latency, reliability and high data rate, all of which can be satisfied by fog computing architecture. With smart devices expected to grow exponentially, the need for an optimized fog computing architecture and protocols is crucial. Therein, efficient, intelligent and decentralized solutions are required to ensure real-time connectivity, reliability and green communication. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of methods and techniques in fog computing. Our focus is on fog infrastructure and protocols in the context of IIoT applications. This article has two main research areas: In the first half, we discuss the history of industrial revolution, application areas of IIoT followed by key enabling technologies that act as building blocks for industrial transformation. In the second half, we focus on fog computing, providing solutions to critical challenges and as an enabler for IIoT application domains. Finally, open research challenges are discussed to enlighten fog computing aspects in different fields and technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {The massive amount of data generated by structural health monitoring (SHM) systems usually affects the system&rsquo;s capacity for data transmission and analysis. This paper proposes a novel concept based on the probability theory for data reduction in SHM systems. The beauty salient feature of the proposed method is that it alleviates the burden of collecting and analysis of the entire strain data via a relative damage approach. In this methodology, the rate of variation of strain distributions is related to the rate of damage. In order to verify the accuracy of the approach, experimental and numerical studies were conducted on a thin steel plate subjected to cyclic in-plane tension loading. Circular holes with various sizes were made on the plate to define damage states. Rather than measuring the entire strain response, the cumulative durations of strain events at different predefined strain levels were obtained for each damage scenario. Then, the distribution of the calculated cumulative times was used to detect the damage progression. The results show that the presented technique can efficiently detect the damage progression. The damage detection accuracy can be improved by increasing the predefined strain levels. The proposed concept can lead to over 2500% reduction in data storage requirement, which can be particularly important for data generation and data handling in on-line SHM systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The New Urban Agenda (Agenda 2030) adopted at the United Nations Conference related to Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in the year 2016 has the goal of prompting cities to achieve the identified Sustainable Development Goals by the year 2030. In this context, cities can experiment strategies of circular economy for the optimization of resources, waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. The data generated by the components of an Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem can contribute in two relevant ways to a smart city model: (1) by the generation of a circular economy and (2) by the creation of intelligence to improve the decision-making processes by citizens or city managers. In this context, it is in our interest to understand the most relevant axes of the research related to IoT, particularly those based on the LoRa technology. LoRa has attracted the interest of researchers because it is an open standard and contributes to the development of sustainable smart cities, since they are linked to the concepts of a circular economy. Additionally, the intention of this work is to identify the technological or practical barriers that hamper the development of solutions, find possible future trends that could exist in the context of smart cities and IoT, and understand how they could be exploited by the industry and academy.},

ABSTRACT = {Public bike share (PBS) systems are meant to be a sustainable urban mobility solution in areas where different travel options and the practice of active transport modes can diminish the need on the vehicle and decrease greenhouse gas emission. Although PBS systems have been included in transportation plans in the last decades experiencing an important development and growth, it is crucial to know the main enablers and barriers that PBS systems are facing to reach their goals. In this paper, first, sentiment analysis techniques are applied to user generated content (UGC) in social media comments (Facebook, Twitter and TripAdvisor) to identify these enablers and barriers. This analysis provides a set of explanatory variables that are combined with data from official statistics and the PBS observatory in Spain. As a result, a statistical model that assesses the connection between PBS use and certain characteristics of the PBS systems, utilizing sociodemographic, climate, and positive and negative opinion data extracted from social media is developed. The outcomes of the research work show that the identification of the main enablers and barriers of PBS systems can be effectively achieved following the research method and tools presented in the paper. The findings of the research can contribute to transportation planners to uncover the main factors related to the adoption and use of PBS systems, by taking advantage of publicly available data sources.},

The main features of communication networks associated with multi-UAV systems are presented. This system sends information through Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). After comparing and analyzing area scanning strategies, it presents the specification of a data communication network architecture for a squadron of UAVs within a sensor network using XBee Pro 900HP S3B modules. A brief description is made about the initial information from the construction of the system. The embedded hardware and the design procedure of a dedicated communication antenna to the XBee modules are presented. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture in terms of robustness and reliability, a set of experimental tests in different communication scenarios is carried out. Network management software is employed to measure the throughput, packet loss and other performance indicators in the communication links between the different network nodes. Experimental results allow verifying the quality and performance of the network nodes, as well as the reliability of the communication links, assessing signal received quality, range and latency.},

ABSTRACT = {Gross calorific value (GCV) is one of the essential parameters for evaluating coal quality. Therefore, accurate GCV prediction is one of the primary ways to improve heating value as well as coal production. A novel evolutionary-based predictive system was proposed in this study for predicting GCV with high accuracy, namely the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-support vector regression (SVR) model. It was developed based on the SVR and PSO algorithms. Three different kernel functions were employed to establish the PSO-SVR models, including radial basis function, linear, and polynomial functions. Besides, three benchmark machine learning models including classification and regression trees (CART), multiple linear regression (MLR), and principle component analysis (PCA) were also developed to estimate GCV and then compared with the proposed PSO-SVR model; 2583 coal samples were used to analyze the proximate components and GCV for this study. Then, they were used to develop the mentioned models as well as check their performance in experimental results. Root-mean-squared error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R2), ranking, and intensity color criteria were used and computed to evaluate the GCV predictive models developed. The results revealed that the proposed PSO-SVR model with radial basis function had better accuracy than the other models. The PSO algorithm was optimized in the SVR model with high efficiency. These should be used as a supporting tool in practical engineering to determine the heating value of coal seams in complex geological conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors that increase the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes mellitus. It is crucial to get diagnosed with time to take preventive measures, especially for patients in locations without proper access to laboratories and medical consultations. This work presented a new methodology to diagnose diseases using data mining that documents all the phases thoroughly for further improvement of the resulting models. We used the methodology to create a new model to diagnose the syndrome without using biochemical variables. We compared similar classification models, using their reported variables and previously obtained data from a study in Colombia. We built a new model and compared it to previous models using the holdout, and random subsampling validation methods to get performance evaluation indicators between the models. Our resulting ANN model used three hidden layers and only Hip Circumference, dichotomous Waist Circumference, and dichotomous blood pressure variables. It gave an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 87.75% by the IDF and 85.12% by HMS MetS diagnosis criteria, higher than previous models. Thanks to our new methodology, diagnosis models can be thoroughly documented for appropriate future comparisons, thus benefiting the diagnosis of the studied diseases.},

ABSTRACT = {Floods are amongst the most common and devastating of all natural hazards. The alarming number of flood-related deaths and financial losses suffered annually across the world call for improved response to flood risks. Interestingly, the last decade has presented great opportunities with a series of scholarly activities exploring how camera images and wireless sensor data from Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks can improve flood management. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature regarding IoT-based sensors and computer vision applications in flood monitoring and mapping. The paper contributes by highlighting the main computer vision techniques and IoT sensor approaches utilised in the literature for real-time flood monitoring, flood modelling, mapping and early warning systems including the estimation of water level. The paper further contributes by providing recommendations for future research. In particular, the study recommends ways in which computer vision and IoT sensor techniques can be harnessed to better monitor and manage coastal lagoons&mdash;an aspect that is under-explored in the literature.},

ABSTRACT = {The safety and welfare of companion animals such as dogs has become a large challenge in the last few years. To assess the well-being of a dog, it is very important for human beings to understand the activity pattern of the dog, and its emotional behavior. A wearable, sensor-based system is suitable for such ends, as it will be able to monitor the dogs in real-time. However, the question remains unanswered as to what kind of data should be used to detect the activity patterns and emotional patterns, as does another: what should be the location of the sensors for the collection of data and how should we automate the system? Yet these questions remain unanswered, because to date, there is no such system that can address the above-mentioned concerns. The main purpose of this study was (1) to develop a system that can detect the activities and emotions based on the accelerometer and gyroscope signals and (2) to automate the system with robust machine learning techniques for implementing it for real-time situations. Therefore, we propose a system which is based on the data collected from 10 dogs, including nine breeds of various sizes and ages, and both genders. We used machine learning classification techniques for automating the detection and evaluation process. The ground truth fetched for the evaluation process was carried out by taking video recording data in frame per second and the wearable sensors data were collected in parallel with the video recordings. Evaluation of the system was performed using an ANN (artificial neural network), random forest, SVM (support vector machine), KNN (k nearest neighbors), and a na&iuml;ve Bayes classifier. The robustness of our system was evaluated by taking independent training and validation sets. We achieved an accuracy of 96.58% while detecting the activity and 92.87% while detecting emotional behavior, respectively. This system will help the owners of dogs to track their behavior and emotions in real-life situations for various breeds in different scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {With electricity representing around 20% of the global energy demand, and increasing support for renewable sources of electricity, there is also an escalating need to improve solar forecasts to support power management. While considerable research has been directed to statistical methods to improve solar power forecasting, few have employed finite mixture distributions. A statistically-objective classification of the overall sky condition may lead to improved forecasts. Combining information from the synoptic driving conditions for daily variability with local processes controlling subdaily fluctuations could assist with forecast validation and enhancement where few observations are available. Gaussian mixture models provide a statistical learning approach to automatically identify prevalent sky conditions (clear, semi-cloudy, and cloudy) and explore associated weather patterns. Here a first stage in the development of such a model is presented: examining whether there is sufficient information in the large-scale environment to identify days with clear, semi-cloudy, or cloudy conditions. A three-component Gaussian distribution is developed that reproduces the observed multimodal peaks in sky clearness indices, and their temporal distribution. Posterior probabilities from the fitted mixture distributions are used to identify periods of clear, partially-cloudy, and cloudy skies. Composites of low-level (850 hPa) humidity and winds for each of the mixture components reveal three patterns associated with the typical synoptic conditions governing the sky clarity, and hence, potential solar power.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, the problem of parking guidance information (PGI) is one of the great challenges of smart cities. Sensor networks have been traditionally used, but they sometimes constitute a high administrative cost. For this reason, this paper presents social parking, a system that is based on the citizens as sensors paradigm, where data are collected by users and are processed using data mining techniques. Moreover, an ontology is used to enable the standardization of information. This way, social parking is compatible with the FIWARE platform. A forecast algorithm was also designed and verified to estimate the number of free parking spots inside a parking lot. With this aim, we used public parking data from eight parking lots in the city of Zaragoza. Client applications allowed testing of all the functions of the parking system. These tests were carried out in three experimental parking lots in the city of M&aacute;laga.},

ABSTRACT = {As urbanization continues to accelerate, the number of cities and their growing populations have created problems, such as the congestion and noise related to transportation, the pollution from industry, and the difficulty of disposing of garbage. An emerging urban strategy is to make use of digital technologies and big data to help improve the quality of life of urban residents. In the past decade, more and more researchers have studied smart cities, and the number of literature in this field grows rapidly, making it &ldquo;big data&rdquo;. With the aim of better understanding the contexts of smart-city research, including the distribution of topics, knowledge bases, and the research frontiers in the field, this paper is based on the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection, and the method used is that of comprehensive scientometric analysis and knowledge mapping in terms of diversity, time slicing, and dynamics, using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to study the literature in the field. The main research topics can be divided into three areas&mdash;&ldquo;the concepts and elements of the smart city&rdquo;, &ldquo;the smart city and the Internet of Things&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the smart city of the future&rdquo;&mdash;through document co-citation analysis. There are four key directions&mdash;&ldquo;research objectives and development-strategy research&rdquo;, &ldquo;technical-support research&rdquo;, &ldquo;data-processing and applied research&rdquo;, and &ldquo;management and applied research&rdquo;&mdash;analyzed using keywords co-occurrence. Finally, the research frontiers are urban-development, sustainable cities, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, integration, undertaken through keyword co-occurrence analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {It is critical for quality requirements, such as trust, privacy, and confidentiality, to be fulfilled during the execution of smart city applications. In this study, smart city applications were modeled as agent systems composed of many agents, each with its own privacy and confidentiality properties. Violations of those properties may occur during execution due to the dynamic of agent behavior, decision-making capabilities, and social activities. In this research, a framework called Agent Quality Management was proposed and implemented to manage agent quality in agent systems. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach by applying it toward a smart city application called a crowdsourced navigation system to verify and assess agent data confidentiality. The AnyLogic Agent-Based Modeling tool was used to model and conduct the experiments. The experiments showed that the framework helped to improve the detection of agent quality violations in a dynamic smart city application. The results can be further analyzed using advanced data analytic approach to reduce future violations and improve data confidentiality in a smart city environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Automatic traffic flow classification is useful to reveal road congestions and accidents. Nowadays, roads and highways are equipped with a huge amount of surveillance cameras, which can be used for real-time vehicle identification, and thus providing traffic flow estimation. This research provides a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art object detectors, visual features, and classification models useful to implement traffic state estimations. More specifically, three different object detectors are compared to identify vehicles. Four machine learning techniques are successively employed to explore five visual features for classification aims. These classic machine learning approaches are compared with the deep learning techniques. This research demonstrates that, when methods and resources are properly implemented and tested, results are very encouraging for both methods, but the deep learning method is the most accurately performing one reaching an accuracy of 99.9% for binary traffic state classification and 98.6% for multiclass classification.},

ABSTRACT = {The exponential growth of cities has brought important challenges such as waste management, pollution and overpopulation, and the administration of transportation. To mitigate these problems, the idea of the smart city was born, seeking to provide robust solutions integrating sensors and electronics, information technologies, and communication networks. More particularly, to face transportation challenges, intelligent transportation systems are a vital component in this quest, helped by vehicular communication networks, which offer a communication framework for vehicles, road infrastructure, and pedestrians. The extreme conditions of vehicular environments, nonetheless, make communication between nodes that may be moving at very high speeds very difficult to achieve, so non-deterministic approaches are necessary to maximize the chances of packet delivery. In this paper, we address this problem using artificial intelligence from a hybrid perspective, focusing on both the best next message to replicate and the best next hop in its path. Furthermore, we propose a deep learning&ndash;based router (DLR+), a router with a prioritized type of message scheduler and a routing algorithm based on deep learning. Simulations done to assess the router performance show important gains in terms of network overhead and hop count, while maintaining an acceptable packet delivery ratio and delivery delays, with respect to other popular routing protocols in vehicular networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Sensor-clouds are a combination of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and cloud computing. The emergence of sensor-clouds has greatly enhanced the computing power and storage capacity of traditional WSNs via exploiting the advantages of cloud computing in resource utilization. However, there are still many problems to be solved in sensor-clouds, such as the limitations of WSNs in terms of communication and energy, the high latency, and the security and privacy issues due to applying a cloud platform as the data processing and control center. In recent years, mobile edge computing has received increasing attention from industry and academia. The core of mobile edge computing is to migrate some or all of the computing tasks of the original cloud computing center to the vicinity of the data source, which gives mobile edge computing great potential in solving the shortcomings of sensor-clouds. In this paper, the latest research status of sensor-clouds is briefly analyzed and the characteristics of the existing sensor-clouds are summarized. After that we discuss the issues of sensor-clouds and propose some applications, especially a trust evaluation mechanism and trustworthy data collection which use mobile edge computing to solve the problems in sensor-clouds. Finally, we discuss research challenges and future research directions in leveraging mobile edge computing for sensor-clouds.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban traffic routing is deemed to be a significant challenge in intelligent transportation systems. Existing implementations suffer from several intrinsic issues such as scalability in centralized systems, unnecessary complexity of mechanisms and communication in distributed systems, and lack of privacy. These imply force intensive computational tasks in the traffic control center, continuous communication in real-time with involved stakeholders which require drivers to reveal their location, origin, and destination of their trips. In this paper we present an innovative urban traffic routing framework and reference architecture (multimap traffic control architecture, MuTraff), which is based on the strategical generation and distribution of a set of traffic network maps (traffic weighted multimaps, TWM) to vehicle categories or fleets. Each map in a TWM map set has the same topology but a different distribution of link weights, which are computed by considering policies and constraints that may apply to different vehicle groups. MuTraff delivers a traffic management system (TMS), where a traffic control center generates and distributes maps, while routing computation is performed at the vehicles. We show how this balance between generation, distribution, and routing computation improves scalability, eases communication complexities, and solves former privacy issues. Our study presents case studies in a real city environment for (a) global congestion management using random maps; (b) congestion control on road incidents; and c) emergency fleets routing. We show that MuTraff is a promising foundation framework that is easy to deploy, and is compatible with other existing TMS frameworks.},

ABSTRACT = {The high customer requirements for appropriate product quality pose a challenge for manufacturers and suppliers and also cause them many problems related to ensuring a sufficiently high product quality throughout the entire production cycle. For the above reasons, it is so important to assess the capability of monitored processes, and shaping, analyzing and controlling the capability of processes is an important aspect of managing an organization that uses a process approach to management. The use of an appropriate method to analyze the course of production processes is a necessity imposed by quality standards, e.g., ISO 9001: 2015. That is why it is so important to propose a quick and low-cost method of assessing production processes. For this purpose, a method of assessing the capability of the manufacturing process using bootstrap analysis was used. The article presents the analysis of inherent properties of the production process based on the results of measurements of the characteristic features of the process or the characteristics of the manufactured products (process variables) for the shafts with grooves. The main goals of the work are to develop a procedure for determining process capability based on the bootstrap method, including criteria for the classification of production process capability; to develop the criterion values for confidence intervals of production process capability; as well as to demonstrate the practical application of bootstrap analysis in manufacturing. Moreover, comparative analyses of process capabilities using bootstrap and classic methods were carried out. They confirm both the narrowing of the confidence interval when using the bootstrap method and the possibility of determining a better estimator of the lower limit of this range compared to the results obtained using the classic method. The tests carried out for the unit production of shafts with grooves showed that the analysis of the process capability for measuring tests n = 10 is possible. Finally, new criterion values for the assessment of process capability for the bootstrap method were proposed. The model for assessing the capability of production processes presented in the paper was implemented in low-volume production in the defense industry.},

ABSTRACT = {Solar energy is one of the most promising sources of energy that could be used to address distributed supply problems. Global warming and decarbonization are significant global concerns, particularly for countries that are not fossil fuel providers. This paper presents a study focused on Spain, a country with a favorable location with respect to horizontal irradiance. The study addresses the future energy demand forecast and how photovoltaic energy could supply an important part of electricity needs. Our approach focuses on two analyses. First, several traditional statistical techniques are discussed in order to obtain a model that best suits Spanish energy demand forecasts for the future years. Different algorithms are compared in order to determine which is the most appropriate for the considered purpose. Second, the evolution of solar photovoltaic technology in Spain is analyzed. The latitude of Spanish cities makes them suitable for utilizing this kind of technology. In this sense, seasonal and monthly trends are identified with high levels of detail, considering a large historical dataset. The increase of the capacity of electricity generation based on this procedure is evaluated. Finally, a discussion about matching electricity demand forecasts and photovoltaic production is offered. Considering the selected model for the photovoltaic power of Spain, from    5    to     42     GW in 2030, the Spanish production is determined as     81     TWh. The obtained results suggest that a possible energy transition is feasible. However, some challenges have to be considered, such us the design of an effective strategy to store excess energy produced when generation is higher than electricity demand. In this way, the electrical distribution system could be fed by the stored energy when solar energy production is deficient.},

ABSTRACT = {The present work tries to fill part of the gap regarding the pilots&rsquo; emotions and their bio-reactions during some flight procedures such as, takeoff, climbing, cruising, descent, initial approach, final approach and landing. A sensing architecture and a set of experiments were developed, associating it to several simulated flights (     N  f l i g h t s   = 13    ) using the Microsoft Flight Simulator Steam Edition (FSX-SE). The approach was carried out with eight beginner users on the flight simulator (     N  p i l o t s   = 8    ). It is shown that it is possible to recognize emotions from different pilots in flight, combining their present and previous emotions. The cardiac system based on Heart Rate (HR), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Electroencephalography (EEG), were used to extract emotions, as well as the intensities of emotions detected from the pilot face. We also considered five main emotions: happy, sad, angry, surprise and scared. The emotion recognition is based on Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning techniques. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were the main methods used to measure the quality of the regression output models. The tests of the produced output models showed that the lowest recognition errors were reached when all data were considered or when the GSR datasets were omitted from the model training. It also showed that the emotion surprised was the easiest to recognize, having a mean RMSE of 0.13 and mean MAE of 0.01; while the emotion sad was the hardest to recognize, having a mean RMSE of 0.82 and mean MAE of 0.08. When we considered only the higher emotion intensities by time, the most matches accuracies were between 55% and 100%.},

ABSTRACT = {An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) particulate-matter (PM) monitoring system was developed that can perform three-dimensional stereoscopic observation of PM2.5 and PM10 in the atmosphere. The UAV monitoring system was mainly integrated by modules of data acquisition and processing, wireless data transmission, and global positioning system (GPS). Particularly, in this study, a ground measurement-control subsystem was added that can display and store collected data in real time and set up measurement scenarios, data-storage modes, and system sampling frequency as needed. The UAV PM monitoring system was calibrated via comparison with a national air-quality monitoring station; the data of both systems were highly correlated. Since rotation of the UAV propeller affects measured PM concentration, this study specifically tested this effect by setting up another identical monitoring system fixed at a tower as reference. The UAV systems worked simultaneously to collect data for comparison. A correction method for the propeller disturbance was proposed. Averaged relative errors for the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations measured by the two systems were 6.2% and 6.6%, respectively, implying that the UAV system could be used for monitoring PM in an atmosphere environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Water management towards smart cities is an issue increasingly appreciated under financial and environmental sustainability focus in any water sector. The main objective of this research is to disclose the technological breakthroughs associated with water and energy use. A methodology is proposed and applied in a case study to analyze the benefits to develop smart water grids, showing the advantages offered by the development of control measures. The case study showed the positive results, particularly savings of 57 GWh and 100 Mm3 in a period of twelve years when different measures from the common ones were developed for the monitoring and control of water losses in smart water management. These savings contributed to reducing the CO2 emissions to 47,385 t CO2-eq. Finally, in order to evaluate the financial effort and savings obtained in this reference systems (RS) network, the investment required in the monitoring and water losses control in a correlation model case (CMC) was estimated, and, as a consequence, the losses level presented a significant reduction towards sustainable values in the next nine years. Since the pressure control is one of the main issues for the reduction of leakage, an estimation of energy production for Portugal is also presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Layered internet of things (IoT) architectures have been proposed over the last years as they facilitate understanding the roles of different networking, hardware, and software components of smart applications. These are inherently distributed, spanning from devices installed in the field up to a cloud datacenter and further to a user smartphone, passing by intermediary stages at different levels of fog computing infrastructure. However, IoT architectures provide almost no hints on where components should be deployed. IoT Software Platforms derived from the layered architectures are expected to adapt to scenarios with different characteristics, requirements, and constraints from stakeholders and applications. In such a complex environment, a one-size-fits-all approach does not adapt well to varying demands and may hinder the adoption of IoT Smart Applications. In this paper, we propose a 5-layer IoT Architecture and a 5-stage IoT Computing Continuum, as well as provide insights on the mapping of software components of the former into physical locations of the latter. Also, we conduct a performance analysis study with six configurations where components are deployed into different stages. Our results show that different deployment configurations of layered components into staged locations generate bottlenecks that affect system performance and scalability. Based on that, policies for static deployment and dynamic migration of layered components into staged locations can be identified.},

ABSTRACT = {Intimate partner violence (IPV) remains a scourge that compromises the rights of many women around the world, shaping an asymmetry in civil rights. Fighting gender-based violence, especially when it is committed by an intimate partner, is an important responsibility that needs to be addressed from all angles. It is also remarkable that our society is clearly conditioned by information and communication technology (ICT), which involves many aspects of our daily life. Unfortunately, violence that is performed in the real world is also replicated in this &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; existence, by offenders in ICT contexts. On the other hand, the same technologies also provide a plethora of opportunities to fight IPV, which are enhanced by the innovative paradigm of the so-called Internet of Things (IoT). In this work, we first present a thorough compilation of ICT proposals already published&mdash;based on either hardware or software&mdash;aimed at protecting IPV survivors, and which can be applied in real life situations but also within social networks. The challenges that still lie ahead are highlighted and, a complete ICT-based platform for IPV management, within an IoT framework, that overcomes the limitations of previous works is proposed, and then promoting a symmetry between individuals in society.},

ABSTRACT = {Airborne particulates are of particular significance for their human health impacts and their roles in both atmospheric radiative transfer and atmospheric chemistry. Observations of airborne particulates are typically made by environmental agencies using rather expensive instruments. Due to the expense of the instruments usually used by environment agencies, the number of sensors that can be deployed is limited. In this study we show that machine learning can be used to effectively calibrate lower cost optical particle counters. For this calibration it is critical that measurements of the atmospheric pressure, humidity, and temperature are also made.},

ABSTRACT = {Rising interest in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems combined with the increased availability of collected data allows the study of different methods for prevention of traffic congestion in cities. A common need in all of these methods is the use of traffic predictions for supporting planning and operation of the traffic lights and traffic management schemes. This paper focuses on comparing the forecasting effectiveness of three machine learning models, namely Random Forests, Support Vector Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron&mdash;in addition to Multiple Linear Regression&mdash;using probe data collected from the road network of Thessaloniki, Greece. The comparison was conducted with multiple tests clustered in three types of scenarios. The first scenario tests the algorithms on specific randomly selected dates on different randomly selected roads. The second scenario tests the algorithms on randomly selected roads over eight consecutive 15 min intervals; the third scenario tests the algorithms on random roads for the duration of a whole day. The experimental results show that while the Support Vector Regression model performs best at stable conditions with minor variations, the Multilayer Perceptron model adapts better to circumstances with greater variations, in addition to having the most near-zero errors.},
