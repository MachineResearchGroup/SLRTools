abstract = {In this note, we present a novel approach in using visual programming languages and in treating Specific Language Impairments (SLI). Starting from the characteristics of SLI, in particular of syntactic impairment, and from the need to develop metalinguistic awareness, assuming that the latest researches in computer programming assessing it as a language are right, we show the theoretical possibility to treat linguistic impairments, for what concerns linguistic and social difficulties, through the use of visual programming, in particular of Scratch. This study does not have an application in the field yet, but we believe in the importance of sharing these ideas.},

abstract = {More than 10% of the population has dyslexia, and most are diagnosed only after they fail in school. This work seeks to change this through early detection via machine learning models that predict dyslexia by observing how people interact with a linguistic computer-based game. We designed items of the game taking into account (i) the empirical linguistic analysis of the errors that people with dyslexia make, and (ii) specific cognitive skills related to dyslexia: Language Skills, Working Memory, Executive Functions, and Perceptual Processes. . Using measures derived from the game, we conducted an experiment with 267 children and adults in order to train a statistical model that predicts readers with and without dyslexia using measures derived from the game. The model was trained and evaluated in a 10-fold cross experiment, reaching 84.62% accuracy using the most informative features.},

abstract = {Children with dyslexia are often diagnosed after they fail school even if dyslexia is not related to general intelligence. In this work, we present an approach for universal screening of dyslexia using machine learning models with data gathered from a web-based language-independent game. We designed the game content taking into consideration the analysis of mistakes of people with dyslexia in different languages and other parameters related to dyslexia like auditory perception as well as visual perception. We did a user study with 313 children (116 with dyslexia) and train predictive machine learning models with the collected data. Our method yields an accuracy of 0.74 for German and 0.69 for Spanish as well as a F1-score of 0.75 for German and 0.75 for Spanish, using Random Forests and Extra Trees, respectively. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that risk of dyslexia is screened using a language-independent content web-based game and machine-learning. Universal screening with language-independent content can be used for the screening of pre-readers who do not have any language skills, facilitating a potential early intervention.},

DysWebxia integrates previous results about the best way to present text for people with dyslexia together with a unique feature, the ability to show synonyms on demand for complex words. Although the new algorithm used for this unique feature is language independent, our first prototype is for Spanish. To evaluate DysWebxia we carried out two different user studies. One to evaluate the quality of the synonyms on demand that included 32 participants with dyslexia and 38 strong readers without dyslexia, and another one to evaluate the usability of the app based on 12 participants. Our results show that the quality of the synonyms generated by the new algorithm outperforms a frequency based baseline, and that the participants found DysWebxia very usable. Therefore, we show that this app may have in the future a large impact for people with dyslexia.},

abstract = {At least 10% of the global population has dyslexia. In the United States and Spain, dyslexia is associated with a large percentage of school drop out. Current methods to detect risk of dyslexia are language specific, expensive, or do not scale well because they require a professional or extensive equipment. A central challenge to detecting dyslexia is handling its differing manifestations across languages. To address this, we designed a browser-based game, Dytective, to detect risk of dyslexia across the English and Spanish languages. Dytective consists of linguistic tasks informed by analysis of common errors made by persons with dyslexia. To evaluate Dytective, we conducted a user study with 60 English and Spanish speaking children between 7 and 12 years old. We found children with and without dyslexia differed significantly in their performance on the game. Our results suggest that Dytective is able to differentiate school age children with and without dyslexia in both English and Spanish speakers.},

This paper presents a user study with 341 participants (89 with dyslexia) that measures the effect of using background colors on screen readability. Readability was measured via reading time and distance travelled by the mouse. Comprehension was used as a control variable. The results show that using certain background colors have a significant impact on people with and without dyslexia. Warm background colors, Peach, Orange and Yellow, significantly improved reading performance over cool background colors, Blue, Blue Grey and Green. These results provide evidence to the practice of using colored backgrounds to improve readability; people with and without dyslexia benefit, but people with dyslexia may especially benefit from the practice given the difficulty they have in reading in general.},

The app is a reading exercise articulated in levels and is based on sentences created on purpose. Specific metrics for detecting reading problems are also proposed and the threshold values are experimentally set. The sample is composed of 46 second class children of a primary school. A preliminary validation of the application has been conducted on a little sample of children with learning difficulties. First results are encouraging and suggest that the application may be tested on a wider scale.},

abstract = {Although literacy rates around the world have increased and there is an expectation that individuals who access web pages will be able to read their content, this is not always the case. The barriers that may be faced can be linked to the way the system is designed and content is written. There may be complex language or a layout that is dense, cluttered and lacks clear markers regarding the key points being made. Many organizations have provided guidance for web developers and authors offering suitable ways to ensure those accessing a website or service will have a pleasurable experience. However, it appears that there are still websites hosting pages with dense text, convoluted instructions and little support for those with low levels of literacy. When considering poor reading skills, the cause may be due to many factors including a lack of education, sensory and /or intellectual impairments and specific difficulties such as dyslexia. This means that the vast majority of online content may be hard to understand for a significant proportion of the world’s population. Moreover, these individuals may also lack digital skills, with little realization that assistive technologies and the availability of supportive access strategies can be helpful in these situations. This paper aims to introduce the idea of enhancing readability of web content by using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as linked data, natural language processing and image recognition to make available a wide range of automatically mapped multilingual symbols that can be used to clarify text content. In the past only a few symbol sets have been mapped and it was not possible to consider their appropriateness for text to symbol translations in a wide range of languages and cultural settings.},

Our research aims at exploring the use of Conversational Agents (CAs) to support linguistic assessment and training among children with language impairment. One of the open research issues in this arena concerns the identification of the most appropriate form of "embodiment" of the CA for children to interact with. To this end, we evaluated the linguistic performance of 14 neuro-typical children and 3 children with language impairment comparing different CAs - physical object and virtual character - with "traditional" human interaction. Based on our analysis, we identify insights for the design of CA: the physicality does influence the performance of linguistic tasks for children with linguistic impairment. In addition, children seem to show a preference for the physical CA and perceived it as smarter than the virtual one.},

abstract = {Narrative recall tasks are widely used in neuropsychological evaluation protocols in order to detect symptoms of disorders such as autism, language impairment, and dementia. In this paper, we propose a graph-based method commonly used in information retrieval to improve word-level alignments in order to align a source narrative to narrative retellings elicited in a clinical setting. From these alignments, we automatically extract narrative recall scores which can then be used for diagnostic screening. The significant reduction in alignment error rate (AER) afforded by the graph-based method results in improved automatic scoring and diagnostic classification. The approach described here is general enough to be applied to almost any narrative recall scenario, and the reductions in AER achieved in this work attest to the potential utility of this graph-based method for enhancing multilingual word alignment and alignment of comparable corpora for more standard NLP tasks.},

In order for these needs to be addressed, and in accordance with accessibility guidelines, it is beneficial to provide the definitions of complex words to the user. In this sense, human language can, at times, be ambiguous, and many words may be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the context. To offer a correct definition, it is often necessary to carry out Word Sense Disambiguation. In this paper, a system that is based on Natural Language Processing and Language Resources in the field of easy reading to provide a contextualized definition for a complex word is presented. An expert linguistic, specialized in easy reading and plain language, has evaluated the Word Sense Disambiguation system.

abstract = {Part of citizenship faces accessibility barriers when they read and understand texts containing long sentences, unusual words, complex linguistic structures, etc. Readability and understanding should be considered when texts are created. In order to make online texts more accessible, there are initiatives as Easy-to-Read (E2R) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, however they do not cover every need that arises in this regard. In addition to accessibility guidelines and E2R rules, technology supporting the authorship of texts is required because the transformation of a text to an easier text to read and understandable is impossible. As a solution to the need to have (semi)automatic support to comply with accessibility and E2R guidelines, the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) resources and methods is proposed. In this paper, E2R guidelines are introduced and a subset of WCAG guidelines regarding readability and understanding has been obtained. In addition, a review on NLP technology concerning accessibility is given. To illustrate this proposal for improving accessibility using PLN approaches, a use case for simplifying drug package leaflets in Spanish is introduced.},

abstract = {Language delay is a developmental problem of children who do not acquire language as expected for their chronological ages. Without timely intervention, language delay can act as a lifelong risk factor. Speech-language pathologists highlight that effective parent participation in everyday parent-child conversation is important to treat children's language delay. For effective roles, however, parents need to alter their own lifelong-established conversation habits, requiring extensive period of conscious effort and staying alert. In this paper, we present new opportunities for mobile and social computing to reinforce everyday parent-child conversation with therapeutic implications for children with language delays. Specifically, we propose TalkBetter, a mobile in-situ intervention service to help parents in daily parent-child conversation through real-time meta-linguistic analysis of ongoing conversations. Through extensive field studies with speech-language pathologists and parents, we report the multilateral motivations and implications of TalkBetter. We present our development of TalkBetter prototype and report its performance evaluation.},

abstract = {Welcome to CSCW 2017, the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing! We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

A participatory design approach was followed in the development of the integrated system to ensure that the expectations of visually challenged people are met. Given that India is a multilingual country (22 official languages), a uniform framework for an integrated text-to-speech synthesis systems with screen readers across six Indian languages are developed, which can be easily extended to other languages as well. Since Indian languages are syllable centred, syllable-based concatenative speech synthesizers are built.This paper describes the development and evaluation of syllable-based Indian language Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis system (around festival TTS) with ORCA and NVDA, for Linux and Windows environments respectively. TTS systems for six Indian Languages, namely, Hindi, Tamil, Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam and Telugu were built. Usability studies of the screen readers were performed. The system usability was evaluated by a group of visually challenged people based on a questionnaire provided to them. And a Mean Opinion Score(MoS) of 62.27% was achieved.},

However, few studies have investigated how children from rural low socio-economic status (SES) schools, who learn English as a foreign language (EFL) used and perceived an AR app in language learning. In this paper, we present an exploratory case study of 11 EFL children and four school teachers from a Chinese rural county who used an AR app (called AR PhonoBlocks), for one week. The goal of the app is to support children to learn the alphabetic principle of English. The key features are overlaid dynamic colour cues on 3D physical letters. We present the results including themes related to children's interactional behaviours and motivations, and rural teachers' feedback on the opportunities and concerns around using an AR app in a rural school context. We suggest design implications and future research directions for designing AR apps to support EFL children from low SES schools in early English learning.},

Due to the increase in internationalization in education, the development and implementation of such technologies is now required. However, as yet, the particular challenges and future opportunities associated with the use of such technologies has not been fully investigated. We have conducted interviews with teachers in Ireland and China, to establish their perspectives on the use of of emerging technologies, their current practice, and their future needs and hopes. We found that both teachers had experience with the use of emerging technologies, but only the teacher in China was based in a school which implemented such technologies formally, and this was only in recent years. Novelty was identified as a major reason why students would be expected to embrace emerging technologies in the future. The teacher in China also pointed out potential challenges relating to the availability of high-speed internet in parts of China. We suggest that future research should investigate the perspectives of teachers in Ireland, China, and other countries, on the use of emerging technologies for cross-cultural collaboration, in order to develop a more detailed understanding of the specific needs and challenges such international digital collaboration will bring about.},

Four categories of students -- students in poverty, multi-lingual students, students with disabilities, and students who have below-grade-level proficiency in reading and math, may face academic challenges that can hinder their learning in CS/CT curricula. However, little is known about how to support these students in CS/CT instruction, especially at this young age. TIPP&amp;SEE, a meta-cognitive strategy that scaffolds learning by proceduralizing engagement through example code, may offer some support. A quasi-experimental study revealed that the gaps between students with and without academic challenges narrowed when using the TIPP&amp;SEE strategy, indicating its promise in providing equitable learning opportunities in CS/CT.},

abstract = {Keystroke-logging tools are widely used in writing process research. These applications are designed to capture each character and mouse movement as isolated events as an indicator of cognitive processes. The current research project explores the possibilities of aggregating the logged process data from the letter level (keystroke) to the word level by merging them with existing lexica and using NLP tools. Linking writing process data to lexica and using NLP tools enables researchers to analyze the data on a higher, more complex level.In this project the output data of Inputlog are segmented on the sentence level and then tokenized. However, by definition writing process data do not always represent clean and grammatical text. Coping with this problem was one of the main challenges in the current project. Therefore, a parser has been developed that extracts three types of data from the S-notation: word-level revisions, deleted fragments, and the final writing product. The within-word typing errors are identified and excluded from further analyses. At this stage the Inputlog process data are enriched with the following linguistic information: part-of-speech tags, lemmas, chunks, syllable boundaries and word frequencies.},

For example, one might search [recurring or reoccurring] to decide between these similar words. While language-related queries are common, they have low click-through rates, lack a strong intent signal, and are generally challenging to study. Perhaps for these reasons, they have yet to be characterized in the literature. In this paper we report the results of two surveys that investigate how, when, and why people use web search to support low-level, language-related tasks. The first survey was distributed by email, and asked participants to reflect on a recent search task. The second survey was embedded directly in search result pages, and captured information about searchers' intents in-situ. Our analysis confirms that language-related search tasks are indeed common, accounting for at least 2.7% of all queries posed by our respondents. Survey responses also reveal: (1) the range of language-related tasks people perform with search, (2) the contexts in which these tasks arise, and (3), the reasons why people elect to use web search rather than relying on traditional proofing tools (e.g., spelling and grammar checkers).},

At that age, students are learning the foundational skills of reading and math. It is important to understand how computing can influence the development of these skills. While some argue that learning computing sharpens problem-solving skills that are applicable to other subjects, evidence supporting this belief is thin.In a quasi-experimental study of fourth-grade (ages 9-10) students, we compared state reading and math test scores of students receiving computing instruction with students who did not. Our findings demonstrated that a more open-ended, less scaffolded form of computing instruction was linked to performance gains in math, but not in reading (F(2, 232)=11.08, p&lt; .01, ηp2=.0625). When looking at students who face academic challenges that can impact reading and math, the same trend applied to students with economic disadvantages and students with limited English proficiency, but not for students with disabilities. These results suggest that moderately scaffolded computing instruction supports the development of skills applicable to math, a step towards better understanding the relationship between learning opportunities in computing and outcomes in other subjects.},

abstract = { With the global movement to incorporate computer science instruction into elementary education, learners are being introduced to computer science and computational thinking (CS/CT) ideas at increasingly younger ages. At these early ages, young learners are developing cognitive abilities foundational to their education. While other discipline-based education fields, such as math, science, and reading, have long studied the role of cognitive abilities, such as short-term working memory and long-term retrieval, in their respective fields, similar research in computer science education is relatively sparse. In this exploratory study, we examined the relationship between cognitive abilities and CS/CT performance of fourth-grade students (ages 9-10) who underwent either an introductory CT curriculum based on Use–&gt;Modify–&gt;Create or the same curriculum with additional scaffolding from the TIPP&amp;SEE metacognitive learning strategy. Our analysis revealed performance on CT assessments to be weakly correlated with working memory and long-term retrieval, with correlations increasing as the CT concepts grew more complex. This suggests that scaffolding beyond TIPP&amp;SEE may be needed with more complex CT concepts. We also found that when using TIPP&amp;SEE, students scoring below average on cognitive ability tests performed as well as students in the control condition with average cognitive ability scores. These results indicate TIPP&amp;SEE’s potential in creating more equitable computing instruction. We hope that results from this initial exploration can help encourage further study into the role of cognitive abilities in CS/CT education for young learners.},

abstract = {Psychotic disorders are forms of severe mental illness characterized by abnormal social function and a general sense of disconnect with reality. The evaluation of such disorders is often complex, as their multifaceted nature is often difficult to quantify. Multimodal behavior analysis technologies have the potential to help address this need and supply timelier and more objective decision support tools in clinical settings. While written language and nonverbal behaviors have been previously studied, the present analysis takes the novel approach of examining the rarely-studied modality of spoken language of individuals with psychosis as naturally used in social, face-to-face interactions. Our analyses expose a series of language markers associated with psychotic symptom severity, as well as interesting interactions between them. In particular, we examine three facets of spoken language: (1) lexical markers, through a study of the function of words; (2) structural markers, through a study of grammatical fluency; and (3) disfluency markers, through a study of dialogue self-repair. Additionally, we develop predictive models of psychotic symptom severity, which achieve significant predictive power on both positive and negative psychotic symptom scales. These results constitute a significant step toward the design of future multimodal clinical decision support tools for computational phenotyping of mental illness.},

Using mixed methods, we evaluated Balloons for three weeks in New Delhi with ten medium-low functioning autistic children. Our findings suggest that employing CSC interventions for children with autism in India provide (a) observable improvements in social interaction with typically developed peers, (b) the opportunity to customize and individualize intervention to cater to a large spectrum of children and (c) the potential opportunity of reducing fears of certain objects.},

abstract = {Art Gallery: Data MaterialitiesWe are constantly surrounded by networks, information, and data. Whether they consist of electromagnetic frequencies or physical wired connections, networks are everywhere, consuming and permeating our offices, homes, schools, and public indoor and outdoor spaces. The SIGGRAPH 2016 Art Gallery exposes this plethora of data and transforms it to incarnations of tangibility that not only showcase their complexity, but also allow us to relate to them on a human scale. By injecting humor and kinetic energy to their exposition, the gallery makes light of these data platforms and presents them on a grand scale to reveal their ubiquity.Artwork and artists for the SIGGRAPH 2016 Art Gallery are selected by the Art Gallery Chair and not by a jury.Art PapersArt Papers investigate the roles of artists and the methods of art-making in an increasingly global, networked, and technologically mediated world. Art Papers contribute to our understanding of the history of art, inform contemporary artistic and critical practices, and anticipate and stimulate future trajectories.Authors present Art Papers in 20-minute sessions with five minutes of Q&amp;A. The papers are published in a special issue of Leonardo, The Journal of the International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology. The issue also includes visual documentation of the works exhibited in the Art Gallery. This publication coincides with SIGGRAPH 2016 and will mark the eighth year of collaboration between SIGGRAPH and Leonardo.},
