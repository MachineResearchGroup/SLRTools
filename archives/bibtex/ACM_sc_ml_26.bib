abstract = {The Internet and the way people use it are constantly changing. Knowing traffic is crucial for operating the network, understanding users’ needs, and ultimately improving applications. Here, we provide an in-depth longitudinal view of Internet traffic during 5 years (from 2013 to 2017). We take the point of the view of a national-wide ISP and analyze rich flow-level measurements to pinpoint and quantify changes. We observe the traffic, both from a point of view of users and services. We show that an ordinary broadband subscriber downloaded in 2017 more than twice as much as they used to do 5 years before. Bandwidth hungry video services drove this change at the beginning, while recently social messaging applications contribute to increase of data consumption. We study how protocols and service infrastructures evolve over time, highlighting events that may challenge traffic management policies. In the rush to bring servers closer and closer to users, we witness the birth of the sub-millisecond Internet, with caches located directly at ISP edges. The picture we take shows a lively Internet that always evolves and suddenly changes. To support new analyses, we make anonymized data available at <uri>https://smartdata.polito.it/five-years-at-the-edge/</uri>.},

abstract = {Design science research (DSR) is increasingly prominent in the information systems discipline. However, despite a lively discourse, and methodical and conceptual advances notwithstanding, DSR contributions are rarely cumulative and mostly remain isolated. This lack of cumulative research impedes scientific progress and practical impact. Our goal in this paper is to help establish a cumulative tradition in DSR by proposing (1) a general, consensus-oriented, evolutionary process model of scientific progress based on a synthesis of different streams in the philosophy of science, (2) quality criteria for DSR contributions corresponding to the individual steps in the process model, (3) actions that the IS community as a whole can take to facilitate adherence to these quality criteria. We expect that our work can pave the way towards developing a more cumulative research tradition in DSR and thereby foster genuine scientific progress in the field.},

abstract = {Volunteered geographic information (VGI) is the result of activities where individuals, supported by enabling technologies, behave like physical sensors by harvesting and organizing georeferenced content, usually in their surroundings. Both researchers and organizations have recognized the value of VGI content, however this content is typically heterogeneous in quality and spatial coverage. As a consequence, in order for applications to benefit from it, its quality and reliability need to be assessed in advance. This may not be easy since, typically, it is unknown how the process of collecting and organizing the VGI content has been conducted and by whom. In the literature, various proposals focus on an indirect process of quality assessment based on reputation scores. Following this perspective, the present paper provides as main contributions: (i) a multi-layer architecture for VGI which supports a process of reputation evaluation; (ii) a new comprehensive model for computing reputation scores for both VGI data and contributors, based on direct and indirect evaluations expressed by users, and including the concept of data aging; (iii) a variety of experiments evaluating the accuracy of the model. Finally, the relevance of adopting this framework is discussed via an applicative scenario for recommending tourist itineraries.},

Enterprises can leverage these developments by enriching their core business data and analyses with up-to-date streaming data. Comparing streaming architectures for these complex use cases is challenging, as existing benchmarks do not cover them. ESPBench is a new enterprise stream processing benchmark that fills this gap. We present its architecture, the benchmarking process, and the query workload. We employ ESPBench on three state-of-the-art stream processing systems, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, and Hazelcast Jet, using provided query implementations developed with Apache Beam. Our results highlight the need for the provided ESPBench toolkit that supports benchmark execution, as it enables query result validation and objective latency measures.},

abstract = {The advent of smart devices has caused unprecedented security and privacy concerns to its users. Although the fingerprint technology is a go-to biometric solution in high-impact applications (e.g., smart-phone security, monetary transactions and international-border verification), the existing fingerprint scanners are vulnerable to spoofing attacks via fake-finger and cannot be employed across smart devices (e.g., wearables) due to hardware constraints. We propose SonicPrint that extends fingerprint identification beyond smartphones to any smart device without the need for traditional fingerprint scanners. SonicPrint builds on the fingerprint-induced sonic effect (FiSe) caused by a user swiping his fingertip on smart devices and the resulting property, i.e., different users' fingerprint would result in distinct FiSe. As the first exploratory study, extensive experiments verify the above property with 31 participants over four different swipe actions on five different types of smart devices with even partial fingerprints. SonicPrint achieves up to a 98% identification accuracy on smartphone and an equal-error-rate (EER) less than 3% for smartwatch and headphones. We also examine and demonstrate the resilience of SonicPrint against fingerprint phantoms and replay attacks. A key advantage of SonicPrint is that it leverages the already existing microphones in smart devices, requiring no hardware modifications. Compared with other biometrics including physiological patterns and passive sensing, SonicPrint is a low-cost, privacy-oriented and secure approach to identify users across smart devices of unique form-factors.},

abstract = { Knowledge Graph (KG) completion has been widely studied to tackle the incompleteness issue (i.e., missing facts) in modern KGs. A fact in a KG is represented as a triplet (h, r, t) linking two entities h and t via a relation r. Existing work mostly consider link prediction to solve this problem, i.e., given two elements of a triplet predicting the missing one, such as (h, r, ?). This task has, however, a strong assumption on the two given elements in a triplet, which have to be correlated, resulting otherwise in meaningless predictions, such as (Marie Curie, headquarters location, ?). In addition, the KG completion problem has also been formulated as a relation prediction task, i.e., when predicting relations r for a given entity h. Without predicting t, this task is however a step away from the ultimate goal of KG completion. Against this background, this paper studies an instance completion task suggesting r-t pairs for a given h, i.e., (h, ?, ?). We propose an end-to-end solution called RETA (as it suggests the Relation and Tail for a given head entity) consisting of two components: a RETA-Filter and RETA-Grader. More precisely, our RETA-Filter first generates candidate r-t pairs for a given h by extracting and leveraging the schema of a KG; our RETA-Grader then evaluates and ranks the candidate r-t pairs considering the plausibility of both the candidate triplet and its corresponding schema using a newly-designed KG embedding model. We evaluate our methods against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on three real-world KG datasets. Results show that our RETA-Filter generates of high-quality candidate r-t pairs, outperforming the best baseline techniques while reducing by 10.61%-84.75% the candidate size under the same candidate quality guarantees. Moreover, our RETA-Grader also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art link prediction techniques on the instance completion task by 16.25%-65.92% across different datasets.},

Situational awareness as a technical term has its earliest roots in formative human factors research in service of military and flight applications. However, its value as a construct in other domains, particularly those having to do with rapid sensemaking in safety-sensitive conditions, has led to a broader applied and theoretical interest over the past few decades. As a discipline, CSCW has been relatively less engaged with this concept, but has empirical and theoretical tools that will be valuable to its study. To bring CSCW more fully into the conversation, we present a description of how operators in a city department of transportation's transportation management center (TMC) develop and maintain situational awareness for themselves and the key recipients of their critical information outputs. We identify some of the schemas operators must develop in order to effectively construct situational awareness and dynamically articulate common fields of work, and the social collaborative practices they engage in to support that awareness. Implications for design and further research are proposed.},

Implementations of ICN have demonstrated its advantages over IP, in terms of network performance and resource requirements. Because of these advantages, ICN is also considered to be a good network paradigm candidate for the Internet-of-Things (IoT), especially in scenarios involving resource constrained devices.In this paper we propose OnboardICNg, the first secure protocol for on-boarding (authenticating and authorizing) IoT devices in ICN mesh networks. OnboardICNg can securely onboard resource constrained devices into an existing IoT network, outperforming the authentication protocol selected for the ZigBee-IP specification: EAP-PANA, i.e., the Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) combined with the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). In particular we show that, compared with EAP-PANA, OnboardICNg reduces the communication and energy consumption, by 87% and 66%, respectively.},

This theoretical work is developed through an ethnographic study of contemporary UK charity shops, as a site focused on the labour of valuation, but embedded in both local and global values. Through this study, we consider implications for the intervention and design of 'data-driven innovation', with a particular focus on distributed ledger technologies. We argue that these technologies inevitably engage in valuation, and require careful attention to the ongoing processes by which value is translated and performed by different stakeholders.},

abstract = {Smart devices without an interactive UI (e.g., a smart bulb) typically rely on specific provisioning schemes to connect to wireless networks. Among all the provisioning schemes, SmartCfg is a popular technology to configure the connection between smart devices and wireless routers. Although the SmartCfg technology facilitates the Wi-Fi configuration, existing solutions seldom take into serious consideration the protection of credentials and therefore introduce security threats against Wi-Fi credentials.This paper conducts a security analysis against eight SmartCfg based Wi-Fi provisioning solutions designed by different wireless module manufacturers. Our analysis demonstrates that six manufacturers provide flawed SmartCfg implementations that directly lead to the exposure of Wi-Fi credentials: attackers could exploit these flaws to obtain important credentials without any substantial efforts on brute-force password cracking. Furthermore, we keep track of the smart devices that adopt such Wi-Fi provisioning solutions to investigate the influence of the security flaws on real world products. Through reversely analyzing the corresponding apps of those smart devices we conclude that the flawed SmartCfg implementations constitute a wide potential impact on the security of smart home ecosystems.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the min-max cycle cover problem with neighborhoods, which is to find a given number of K cycles to collaboratively visit n Points of Interest (POIs) in a 2D space such that the length of the longest cycle among the K cycles is minimized. The problem arises from many applications, including employing mobile sinks to collect sensor data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), dispatching charging vehicles to recharge sensors in rechargeable sensor networks, scheduling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to monitor disaster areas, etc. For example, consider the application of employing multiple mobile sinks to collect sensor data in WSNs. If some mobile sink has a long data collection tour while the other mobile sinks have short tours, this incurs a long data collection latency of the sensors in the long tour. Existing studies assumed that one vehicle needs to move to the location of a POI to serve it. We however assume that the vehicle is able to serve the POI as long as the vehicle is within the neighborhood area of the POI. One such an example is that a mobile sink in a WSN can receive data from a sensor if it is within the transmission range of the sensor (e.g., within 50 meters). It can be seen that the ignorance of neighborhoods will incur a longer traveling length. On the other hand, most existing studies only took into account the vehicle traveling time but ignore the POI service time. Consequently, although the length of some vehicle tour is short, the total amount of time consumed by a vehicle in the tour is prohibitively long, due to many POIs in the tour. In this paper we first study the min-max cycle cover problem with neighborhoods, by incorporating both neighborhoods and POI service time into consideration. We then propose novel approximation algorithms for the problem, by exploring the combinatorial properties of the problem. We finally evaluate the proposed algorithms via experimental simulations. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are promising. Especially, the maximum tour times by the proposed algorithms are only about from 80% to 90% of that by existing algorithms.},

abstract = {It is a matter of fact that quality of experience (QoE) has become one of the key factors determining whether a new multimedia service will be successfully accepted by the final users. Accordingly, several QoE models have been developed with the aim of capturing the perception of the user by considering as many influencing factors as possible. However, when it comes to adopting these models in the management of the services and networks, it frequently happens that no single provider has access to all of the tools to either measure all influencing factors parameters or control over the delivered quality. In particular, it often happens to the over-the-top (OTT) and Internet service providers (ISPs), which act with complementary roles in the service delivery over the Internet. On the basis of this consideration, in this article we first highlight the importance of a possible OTT-ISP collaboration for a joint service management in terms of technical and economic aspects. Then we propose a general reference architecture for a possible collaboration and information exchange among them. Finally, we define three different approaches, namely joint venture, customer lifetime value based, and QoE fairness based. The first aims to maximize the revenue by providing better QoE to customers paying more. The second aims to maximize the profit by providing better QoE to the most profitable customers (MPCs). The third aims to maximize QoE fairness among all customers. Finally, we conduct simulations to compare the three approaches in terms of QoE provided to the users, profit generated for the providers, and QoE fairness.},

In this work, we propose ULISSE, the first data series index structure designed for answering similarity search queries of variable length. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we introduce a novel representation technique, which effectively and succinctly summarizes multiple sequences of different length (irrespective of Z-normalization). Based on the proposed index, we describe efficient algorithms for approximate and exact similarity search, combining disk based index visits and in-memory sequential scans. We experimentally evaluate our approach using several synthetic and real datasets. The results show that ULISSE is several times (and up to orders of magnitude) more efficient in terms of both space and time cost, when compared to competing approaches.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous mobile devices with rich sensors and advanced communication capabilities have given rise to mobile crowdsensing systems. The diverse reliabilities of mobile users and the openness of sensing paradigms raise concerns for data trustworthiness, user privacy, and incentive provision. Instead of considering these issues as isolated modules in most existing researches, we comprehensively capture both conflict and inner-relationship among them. In this paper, we propose a holistic solution for trustworthy and privacy-aware mobile crowdsensing with no need of a trusted third party. Specifically, leveraging cryptographic technologies, we devise a series of protocols to enable benign users to request tasks, contribute their data, and earn rewards anonymously without any data linkability. Meanwhile, an anonymous trust/reputation model is seamlessly integrated into our scheme, which acts as reference for our fair incentive design, and provides evidence to detect malicious users who degrade the data trustworthiness. Particularly, we first propose the idea of limiting the number of issued pseudonyms which serves to efficiently tackle the anonymity abuse issue. Security analysis demonstrates that our proposed scheme achieves stronger security with resilience against possible collusion attacks. Extensive simulations are presented which demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of our scheme.},

abstract = {In this article, we introduce the concept of Water Flow Driven Sensor Networks for leakage and contamination monitoring in urban water distribution systems. The unique aspect of our work is that the sensor network can be deployed in the underground water network with only access to connection points (through manholes) and driven only by water harvested energy without the need for AC power or frequent battery changes. Although water systems may be affected by a large variety of contaminants, only a few sensors can be practically deployed. Thus, many types of contaminants are sensed via “proxy sensing,” which may not be 100% reliable. The main problems addressed are (a) adaptation of the network to the available energy to maximize leak/contamination detection and (b) minimal artificial water circulation or leakage to improve detectability during periods of almost zero natural water flow. The article shows, through extensive simulations, that the proposed approach can drastically reduce the leakage/contamination reporting time (from 3.5h up to ∼6min), and the adaptation can reduce this circulation by ∼33% and yet enhance the collected/transmitted data by 30%.},

abstract = {Data series similarity search is an important operation and at the core of several analysis tasks and applications related to data series collections. Despite the fact that data series indexes enable fast similarity search, all existing indexes can only answer queries of a single length (fixed at index construction time), which is a severe limitation. In this work, we propose ULISSE, the first data series index structure designed for answering similarity search queries of variable length. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we introduce a novel representation technique, which effectively and succinctly summarizes multiple sequences of different length (irrespective of Z-normalization). Based on the proposed index, we describe efficient algorithms for approximate and exact similarity search, combining disk based index visits and in-memory sequential scans. We experimentally evaluate our approach using several synthetic and real datasets. The results show that ULISSE is several times (and up to orders of magnitude) more efficient in terms of both space and time cost, when compared to competing approaches.},

In this paper we present Glaze, a system that overlays data on existing wireless signals to create a new channel of downlink communication for IoT backscatter devices. In particular, Glaze uses a new technique that introduces small perturbations to existing signals to convey data.

abstract = {Looking from a global perspective, the landscape of online social networks is highly fragmented. A large number of online social networks have appeared, which can provide users with various types of services. Generally, information available in these online social networks is of diverse categories, which can be represented as heterogeneous social networks (HSNs) formally. Meanwhile, in such an age of online social media, users usually participate in multiple online social networks simultaneously, who can act as the anchors aligning different social networks together. So multiple HSNs not only represent information in each social network, but also fuse information from multiple networks.Formally, the online social networks sharing common users are named as the aligned social networks, and these shared users are called the anchor users. The heterogeneous information generated by users' social activities in the multiple aligned social networks provides social network practitioners and researchers with the opportunities to study individual user's social behaviors across multiple social platforms simultaneously. This paper presents a comprehensive survey about the latest research works on multiple aligned HSNs studies based on the broad learning setting, which covers 5 major research tasks, including network alignment, link prediction, community detection, information diffusion and network embedding respectively.},

abstract = {We design Fogstore, a key-value store for event-based systems, that exploits the concept of relevance to guarantee low-latency access to relevant data with strong consistency guarantees, while providing tolerance from geographically correlated failures. Distributed event-based processing pipelines are envisioned to utilize the resources of densely geo-distributed infrastructures for low-latency responses - enabling real-time applications. Increasing complexity of such applications results in higher dependence on state, which has driven the incorporation of state-management as a core functionality of contemporary stream processing engines a la Apache Flink and Samza. Processing components executing under the same context (like location) often produce information that may be relevant to others, thereby necessitating shared state and an out-of-band globally-accessible data-store. Efficient access to application state is critical for overall performance, thus centralized data-stores are not a viable option due to the high-latency of network traversals. On the other hand, a highly geo-distributed datastore with low-latency implemented with current key-value stores would necessitate degrading client expectation of consistency as per the PACELC theorem. In this paper we exploit the notion of contextual relevance of events (data) in situation-awareness applications - and offer differential consistency guarantees for clients based on their context. We highlight important systems concerns that may arise with a highly geo-distributed system and show how Fogstore's design tackles them. We present, in detail, a prototype implementation of Fogstore's mechanisms on Apache Cassandra and a performance evaluation. Our evaluations show that Fogstore is able to achieve the throughput of eventually consistent configurations while serving data with strong consistency to the contextually relevant clients.},

Recent data privacy regulations worldwide established new requirements for privacy choices, but system practitioners struggle to implement legally compliant privacy choices that also provide users meaningful privacy control. We construct a design space for privacy choices based on a user-centered analysis of how people exercise privacy choices in real-world systems. This work contributes a conceptual framework that considers privacy choice as a user-centered process as well as a taxonomy for practitioners to design meaningful privacy choices in their systems.

EUSE activities are secondary to the goal that the program is helping to achieve and end-user programming is opportunistic. The challenge is then to find ways to incorporate EUSE activities into the existing workflow without users having to make substantial changes to the type of work they do or their priorities. In this article, we set out an approach to EUSE for web-based applications. We also propose a software lifecycle that is consistent with the conditions and priorities of end users without programming skills and is well-aligned with EUSE's characteristic informality, ambiguity and opportunisticness. Users applying this lifecycle manage to find solutions that they would otherwise be unable to identify. They also develop quality products. Users of this approach will not have to be acquainted with software engineering, as a framework will take them through the web-centred EUSE lifecycle step-by-step. We also report a statistical experiment in which users develop web software with and without a framework to guide them through the lifecycle. Its aim is to validate the applicability of our framework-driven lifecycle.},

abstract = {Large spatial data becomes ubiquitous. As a result, it is critical to provide fast, scalable, and high-throughput spatial queries and analytics for numerous applications in location-based services (LBS). Traditional spatial databases and spatial analytics systems are disk-based and optimized for IO efficiency. But increasingly, data are stored and processed in memory to achieve low latency, and CPU time becomes the new bottleneck. We present the Simba (Spatial In-Memory Big data Analytics) system that offers scalable and efficient in-memory spatial query processing and analytics for big spatial data. Simba is based on Spark and runs over a cluster of commodity machines. In particular, Simba extends the Spark SQL engine to support rich spatial queries and analytics through both SQL and the DataFrame API. It introduces indexes over RDDs in order to work with big spatial data and complex spatial operations. Lastly, Simba implements an effective query optimizer, which leverages its indexes and novel spatial-aware optimizations, to achieve both low latency and high throughput. Extensive experiments over large data sets demonstrate Simba's superior performance compared against other spatial analytics system.},

abstract = {Emerging IoT applications with real-time latency constraints require new data processing systems operating at the Edge. Serverless computing offers a new compelling paradigm, where a user can execute a small application without handling the operational issues of server provisioning and resource management. Despite a variety of existing commercial and open source serverless platforms (utilizing VMs and containers), these solutions are too heavy-weight for a resource-constrained Edge systems (due to large memory footprint and high invocation time). Moreover, serverless workloads that focus on per-client, short-running computations are not an ideal fit for existing general purpose computing systems.In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Sledge -- a novel and efficient WebAssembly-based serverless framework for the Edge. Sledge is optimized for supporting unique properties of serverless workloads: the need for high density multi-tenancy, low startup time, bursty client request rates, and short-lived computations. Sledge is designed for these constraints by offering (i) optimized scheduling policies and efficient work-distribution for short-lived computations, and (ii) a light-weight function isolation model implemented using our own WebAssembly-based software fault isolation infrastructure. These lightweight sandboxes are designed to support high-density computation: with fast startup and teardown times to handle high client request rates. An extensive evaluation of Sledge with varying workloads and real-world serverless applications demonstrates the effectiveness of the designed serverless-first runtime for the Edge. Sledge supports up to 4 times higher throughput and 4 times lower latencies compared to Nuclio, one of the fastest open-source serverless frameworks.},

In this article, we present and study the logic rLTL, which provides a means to formally reason about both correctness and robustness in system design. Furthermore, we identify a large fragment of rLTL for which the verification problem can be efficiently solved, i.e., verification can be done by using an automaton, recognizing the behaviors described by the rLTL formula φ, of size at most O(3 |φ |), where |φ | is the length of φ. This result improves upon the previously known bound of O(5|φ |) for rLTL verification and is closer to the LTL bound of O(2|φ |). The usefulness of this fragment is demonstrated by a number of case studies showing its practical significance in terms of expressiveness, the ability to describe robustness, and the fine-grained information that rLTL brings to the process of system verification. Moreover, these advantages come at a low computational overhead with respect to LTL verification.},

abstract = {Spatial distributions of data of natural phenomena can be estimated by using different spatial interpolation techniques. These techniques can be used for the purpose of developing urban noise pollution monitoring applications, so they can truly describe the actual urban noise pollution scenario of any region of interest to make effective and informed decisions. In this context, our aim is to use IoT-cloud based framework to generate dynamic (i.e., changes in terms of time and space) noise maps as a service with the help of spatial interpolation techniques. Noise map generation is an effective method for visualizing and assessing urban noise pollution. In this article, we have proposed three spatial interpolation techniques (GLIDW, I-GLIDW, GLIDW-OK) that work on participatory sensing-based noise pollution data collected using smartphones as IoT devices to generate dynamic noise maps. Proposed techniques can address diverse scenarios such as sparse datasets, high accuracy, better response time, and so on. Depending on the situation, we can choose an appropriate technique. We evaluate our proposed methods based on a real-world urban noise pollution dataset collected by participants over a period of two years in an urban area of the city Kolkata. The results are compared with inverse distance weighting (IDW) and Ordinary Kriging (OK) methods. The method GLIDW is proposed for a dense dataset. The results validate that in the case of a dense dataset GLIDW dominates over other methods. But, when the data sparsity level is medium, I-GLIDW performs well. However, if the dataset is very sparse, then GLIDW-OK dominates in terms of predictive accuracy. The results also show that Relative Improvement (RI) of I-GLIDW and GLIDW-OK is always positive compared to baseline methods IDW and OK.},

abstract = {The deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSN) in an untended environment and the openness of the wireless channel bring various security threats to WSN. The resource limitations of the sensor nodes make the conventional security systems less attractive for WSN. Moreover, conventional cryptography alone cannot ensure the desired security against the physical attacks on sensor nodes. Physically unclonable function (PUF) is an emerging hardware security primitive that provides low-cost hardware security exploiting the unique inherent randomness of a device. In this article, we have proposed an authentication and key sharing scheme for the WSN integrating Pedersen’s verifiable secret sharing (Pedersen’s VSS) and Shamir’s secret sharing (Shamir’s SS) scheme with PUF which ensure the desired security with low overhead. The security analysis depicts the resilience of the proposed scheme against different active, passive and physical attacks. Also, the performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme possesses low computation, communication and storage overhead. The scheme only needs to store a polynomial number of PUF challenge-response pairs to the user node. The sink or senor nodes do not require storing any secret key. Finally, the comparison with the previous protocols establishes the dominance of the proposed scheme to use in WSN.},

abstract = {Collaboration across institutional boundaries is widespread and increasing today. It depends on federations sharing data that often have governance rules or external regulations restricting their use. However, the handling of data governance rules (aka. data-use policies) remains manual, time-consuming and error-prone, limiting the rate at which collaborations can form and respond to challenges and opportunities, inhibiting citizen science and reducing data providers' trust in compliance. Using an automated system to facilitate compliance handling reduces substantially the time needed for such non-mission work, thereby accelerating collaboration and improving productivity. We present a framework, Dr.Aid, that helps individuals, organisations and federations comply with data rules, using automation to track which rules are applicable as data is passed between processes and as derived data is generated. It encodes data-governance rules using a formal language and performs reasoning on multi-input-multi-output data-flow graphs in decentralised contexts. We test its power and utility by working with users performing cyclone tracking and earthquake modelling to support mitigation and emergency response. We query standard provenance traces to detach Dr.Aid from details of the tools and systems they are using, as these inevitably vary across members of a federation and through time. We evaluate the model in three aspects by encoding real-life data-use policies from diverse fields, showing its capability for real-world usage and its advantages compared with traditional frameworks. We argue that this approach will lead to more agile, more productive and more trustworthy collaborations and show that the approach can be adopted incrementally. This, in-turn, will allow more appropriate data policies to emerge opening up new forms of collaboration.},

abstract = {We consider a group of mobile users, within proximity of each other, who are interested in watching the same online video. The common practice today is that each user downloads the video independently on her mobile device using her own cellular connection, which wastes access bandwidth and may also lead to poor video quality. We propose a novel cooperative system where each mobile device uses simultaneously two network interfaces: i cellular to connect to the video server and download parts of the video and ii WiFi to connect locally to all other devices in the group to exchange those parts. Devices cooperate to efficiently utilize all network resources and to adapt to varying wireless network conditions. In the local WiFi network, we exploit overhearing, which we further combine with network coding. The end result is savings in cellular bandwidth and improved user experience. We follow a complete approach, from theory to practice. First, we formulate the problem using a network utility maximization NUM framework, decompose the problem, and provide a distributed solution. Then, based on the structure of the NUM solution, we design a system called MicroCast, and we implement a prototype as an Android application. We provide both simulation results of the NUM solution and experimental evaluation. We demonstrate that the proposed approach brings significant performance benefits namely, faster download on the order of the group size without battery penalty.},

abstract = {Application development for Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) is challenging, because the wireless network and the devices introduce latencies that vary continuously along with the load, status, or environmental conditions of the infrastructure. Reactive programming is well suited for the development of event-driven applications, yet current reactive programming frameworks require developers to predict event arrival time-boundaries at compile time, which is impractical, if not impossible, for CPS. Thus, there is a tradeoff between timeliness and completeness of complex event computations, e.g., operational efficiency in a manufacturing plant: Waiting too long until all individual events arrive can fail to produce a useful result, while not waiting long enough may lead to faults due to incomplete status information. In this article, we propose (a) a set of extensions to state-of-the-art reactive programming frameworks, which remove the burden of specifying timeouts at compile time by utilizing (b) Khronos, a middleware that automatically determines timeouts by taking into account variations in event arrival times due to the underlying infrastructure. Evaluation on a physical testbed shows that the extensions significantly decrease developer effort and that Khronos considerably improves timeliness under varying network configurations and conditions, while still satisfying the application’s tolerance to missed events.},

abstract = {Building and programming tiny battery-free energy harvesting embedded computer systems is hard for the average maker because of the lack of tools, hard to comprehend programming models, and frequent power failures. With the high ecologic cost of equipping the next trillion embedded devices with batteries, it is critical to equip the makers, hobbyists, and novice embedded systems programmers with easy-to-use tools supporting battery-free energy harvesting application development. This way, makers can create untethered embedded systems that are not plugged into the wall, the desktop, or even a battery, providing numerous new applications and allowing for a more sustainable vision of ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we present BFree, a system that makes it possible for makers, hobbyists, and novice embedded programmers to develop battery-free applications using Python programming language and widely available hobbyist maker platforms. BFree provides energy harvesting hardware and a power failure resilient version of Python, with durable libraries that enable common coding practice and off the shelf sensors. We develop demonstration applications, benchmark BFree against battery-powered approaches, and evaluate our system in a user study. This work enables makers to engage with a future of ubiquitous computing that is useful, long-term, and environmentally responsible.},

abstract = {A main challenge faced by the state-of-the-art parking sensing systems is to infer the state of the spots not covered by participants’ parking/unparking events (called background availability) when the system penetration rate is limited. In this paper, we tackle this problem by exploring an empirical phenomenon that ignoring a spot along a driver’s parking search trajectory is likely due to the unavailability. However, complications caused by drivers’ preferences, e.g. ignoring the spots too far from the driver’s destination, have to be addressed based on human parking decisions. We build a model based on a dataset of more than 55,000 real parking decisions to predict the probability that a driver would take a spot, assuming the spot is available. Then, we present a crowdsourcing system, called ParkScan, which leverages the learned parking decision model in collaboration with the hidden Markov model to estimate background parking spot availability. We evaluated ParkScan with real-world data from both off-street scenarios (i.e., two public parking lots) and an on-street parking scenario (i.e., 35 urban blocks in Seattle). Both of the experiments showed that with a 5% penetration rate, ParkScan reduces over 12.9% of availability estimation errors for all the spots during parking peak hours, compared to the baseline using only the historical data. Also, even with a single participant driver, ParkScan cuts off at least 15% of the estimation errors for the spots along the driver’s parking search trajectory.},

abstract = {Sensor networks are commonly adopted to collect a variety of measurements in indoor and outdoor settings. However, collecting such measurements from every node in the network, although providing high accuracy and resolution of the phenomena of interest, may easily cause sensors’ battery depletion. In this article, we show that measurement correlation can be successfully exploited to reduce the amount of data collected in the network without significantly sacrificing the monitoring accuracy. In particular, we propose an online adaptive measurement technique with which a subset of nodes are dynamically chosen as monitors while the measurements of the remaining nodes are estimated using the computed correlations. We propose an estimation framework based on jointly Gaussian distributed random variables, and we formulate an optimization problem to select the monitors under a total cost constraint. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and propose three efficient heuristics. We also develop statistical approaches that automatically switch between learning and estimation phases to take into account the variability occurring in real networks. Simulations carried out on real-world traces show that our approach outperforms previous solutions based on compressed sensing, and it can be successfully applied to the real application of solar irradiance prediction of photovoltaics systems.},

Interested in the coordination of such help and potential challenges of collaboration, we conducted a virtual ethnography of a multi-level network located in Germany. We focused on aims, activities, and technological mediation, with Activity Theory as theoretical framework. Our findings show that the organizational aim of coordinating help was successfully achieved by connecting heterogeneous actors through digitization and institutionalization. Enabled by the context of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, the network acted virtually, but was also able to integrate analog spaces of help. We identified six crucial implications regarding the use of technology and collaboration for building a successful volunteering network.},

abstract = {Unprecedented attention towards blockchain technology is serving as a game-changer in fostering the development of blockchain-enabled distinctive frameworks. However, fragmentation unleashed by its underlying concepts hinders different stakeholders from effectively utilizing blockchain-supported services, resulting in the obstruction of its wide-scale adoption. To explore synergies among the isolated frameworks requires comprehensively studying inter-blockchain communication approaches. These approaches broadly come under the umbrella of Blockchain Interoperability (BI) notion, as it can facilitate a novel paradigm of an integrated blockchain ecosystem that connects state-of-the-art disparate blockchains. Currently, there is a lack of studies that comprehensively review BI, which works as a stumbling block in its development. Therefore, this article aims to articulate potential of BI by reviewing it from diverse perspectives. Beginning with a glance of blockchain architecture fundamentals, this article discusses its associated platforms, taxonomy, and consensus mechanisms. Subsequently, it argues about BI’s requirement by exemplifying its potential opportunities and application areas. Concerning BI, an architecture seems to be a missing link. Hence, this article introduces a layered architecture for the effective development of protocols and methods for interoperable blockchains. Furthermore, this article proposes an in-depth BI research taxonomy and provides an insight into the state-of-the-art projects. Finally, it determines possible open challenges and future research in the domain.},
