abstract={IoT is quickly becoming a popular field of IT and the digital world, presenting new research prospects in the ambit of devices and applications connected via internet. Several academics have previously proved their work in this field by employing Machine Learning techniques and algorithms as a subset of AI to fully implement large volumes of data. IOT is considered as a platform where devices are connected together through internet as a medium and by using sensors, data is captured which adds digital intelligence. Data can be access anytime and from anywhere. The need for such devices that can not only store data but also analyzeit and take quick action is growing by the day. Machine learning which makes smart system after adding intelligence to it, makes IOT more smart, responsive and action oriented. Using machine learning we can detect the slightest changes and warn against any type of malfunctioning. Predictive Analysis is added advantage which acts as gift from Machine learning to IOT. This analysis is done in real-time and the results can be displayed on the Smartphone in a few seconds. Though IOT and Machine leaning are powerful tools as an alone but combination of both the technologies is much more which is yet to be explored.},

abstract={Governments around the world are actively pursuing research on smart cities as an attempt to pursue the city's sophistication and sustainability. In order to create a smart city, it is important to reduce energy and manage it efficiently. With the development of smart city, it is expected that a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be installed in various buildings in the city, and a lot of energy usage information will be measured. When many IoT devices are connected to the internet, a large amount of data is generated. Therefore, when the existing cloud service is used, data is delayed in analyzing and transmitting data, and it becomes impossible to receive the analysis result quickly. With edge computing, you can process data directly in the edge environment where data is collected and apply the results quickly to the field. It can respond to data much faster than it can deliver data and wait for the results to be analyzed and reduce the load on the data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a system for predicting energy consumption using a deep learning (DL) algorithm in an edge computing environment. We have applied the proposed system to office environment by building testbed. We used the long short-term memory (LSTM) network which shows high accuracy in time series data analysis and obtained the energy prediction result per day. We check the state of the electronics through the energy consumption prediction data, detect the abnormality and provide the energy consumption pattern analysis service respectively.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies incorporate a large number of different sensing devices and communication technologies to collect a large amount of data for various applications. Smart cities employ IoT infrastructures to build services useful for the administration of the city and the citizens. In this article, we present an IoT pipeline for acquisition, processing, and visualization of air pollution data over the city of Antwerp, Belgium. Our system employs IoT devices mounted on vehicles as well as static reference stations to measure a variety of city parameters, such as humidity, temperature, and air pollution. Mobile measurements cover a larger area compared to static stations; however, there is a tradeoff between temporal and spatial resolution. We address this problem as a matrix completion on graphs problem and rely on variational graph autoencoders to propose a deep learning solution for the estimation of the unknown air pollution values. Our model is extended to capture the correlation among different air pollutants, leading to improved estimation. We conduct experiments at different spatial and temporal resolution and compare with state-of-the-art methods to show the efficiency of our approach. The observed and estimated air pollution values can be accessed by interested users through a Web visualization tool designed to provide an air pollution map of the city of Antwerp.},

abstract={As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues its run as one of the most popular technology buzzwords of today, the discussion really turns from how the massive data sets are collected to how value can be derived from them, i.e., how to extract knowledge out of such (big) data. IoT devices are used in an ever-growing number of application domains (see Figure 1), ranging from sports gadgets (e.g., Fitbits and Apple Watches) or more serious medical devices (e.g., pacemakers and biochips) to smart homes, cities, and self-driving cars, to predictive maintenance in missioncritical systems (e.g., in nuclear power plants or airplanes). Such applications introduce endless possibilities for better understanding, learning, and informedly acting (i.e., situational awareness and actionable information in government lingo). Although rapid expansion of devices and sensors brings terrific opportunities for taking advantage of terabytes of machine data, the mind-boggling task of understanding growth of data remains and heavily relies on artificial intelligence and machine learning [1], [2].},

abstract={In this paper, a practical field of quantum technology known as “quantum technology, and weather prediction of smart grids”, and their future have been analyzed. Smart grids are among the significant fundamentals of a smart city and its supplying sources. So, factors such as weather prediction, or demand response are among important factors and have a crucial role. Also, experts should use highly accurate models to predict these factors such as weather prediction Therefore, when they are combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Neural Networks (NN), they will be more efficient. However, in the smart grids of future Smart Sustainable Cities (SSCs) that the gathered big data has enormous amount, the classical AI, and ANN models will inefficient.

This paper presents weather prediction of smart grids, their regular methods, and quantum technology with its usage in the ladders. Respectively, it compares Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) method with other regular techniques that are ANN-based in the area of weather prediction. Finally, it is concluded that quantum technology and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) have the potential to be combined with other techniques which leads to accurate models with ultrafast processing, and execution speed.

abstract={Most of the research on Federated Learning (FL) has focused on analyzing global optimization, privacy, and communication, with limited attention focusing on analyzing the critical matter of performing efficient local training and inference at the edge devices. One of the main challenges for successful and efficient training and inference on edge devices is the careful selection of parameters to build local Machine Learning (ML) models. To this aim, we propose a Particle Swarm optimization (PSO)-based technique to optimize the hyperparameter settings for the local ML models in an FL environment. We evaluate the performance of our proposed technique using two case studies. First, we consider smart city services, and use an experimental transportation dataset for traffic prediction as a proxy for this setting. Second, we consider Industrial IoT(IIoT) services, and use the real-time telemetry dataset to predict the probability that a machine will fail shortly due to component failures. Our experiments indicate that PSO provides an efficient approach for tuning the hyperparameters of deep Long short-term memory (LSTM) models when compared to the grid search method. Our experiments illustrate that the number of client-server communication rounds to explore the landscape of configurations to find the near-optimal parameters are greatly reduced (roughly by two orders of magnitude needing only 2%-4% of the rounds compared to state of the art non-PSO-based approaches). We also demonstrate that utilizing the proposed PSO-based technique to find the near-optimal configurations for FL and centralized learning models does not adversely affect the accuracy of the models.},

For effective energy management of smart buildings, the accurate prediction of the electrical consumption data is required. To increase the accuracy of prediction, the paper proposes deep learning methods for load profile prediction in a model-free environment. In this paper, a commercial smart building load profile is predicted using the re-current neural network (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Using the best features of RNN and BiLSTM a hybrid model is developed for the load profile prediction. To compare the performance of different models error metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are considered for performance evaluation. The paper also highlights the significance of hyperparameters in improving the accuracy of prediction. Finally, from the results, it can be claimed that the hybrid model performs better as compared to RNN, LSTM, and GRU models.},

Aiming at tackling these issues, this paper presents a convolutional neural network-based transfer learning approach. It includes transferring the big data-trained GoogLeNet model into our identification task, fine-tuning the model using the `finetune' idea, and adding three adaptive layers behind the original feature layer.

abstract={Already known as densely populated areas with land use including housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities and communication, nowadays, cities tend to grow even bigger. Genuine road-user's types are emerging with further technological developments to come. As cities population size escalates, and roads getting congested, government agencies such as Department of Transportation (DOT) through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are in pressing need to perfect their management systems with new efficient technologies. The challenge is to anticipate on never before seen problems, in their effort to save lives and implement sustainable cost-effective management systems. To make things yet more complicated and a bit daunting, self-driving car will be authorized in a close future in crowded major cities where roads are to be shared among pedestrians, cyclists, cars, and trucks. Roads sizes and traffic signaling will need to be constantly adapted accordingly. Counting and classifying turning vehicles and pedestrians at an intersection is an exhausting task and despite traffic monitoring systems use, human interaction is heavily required for counting. Our approach to resolve traffic intersection turning-vehicles counting is less invasive, requires no road dig up or costly installation. Live or recorded videos from already installed camera all over the cities can be used as well as any camera including cellphones. Our system is based on Neural Network and Deep Learning of object detection along computer vision technology and several methods and algorithms. Our approach will work on still images, recorded-videos, real-time live videos and will detect, classify, track and compute moving object velocity and direction using convolution neural network. Created based upon series of algorithms modeled after the human brain, our system uses NVIDIA Video cards with GPU, CUDA, OPENCV and mathematical vectors systems to perform.},

abstract={With the development of the Internet of Things and big data technology, the intelligent transportation system is becoming the main development direction of future transportation systems. The time required for a given trajectory in a transportation system can be accurately estimated using the trajectory data of the taxis in a city. This is a very challenging task. Although historical data have been used in existing research, excessive use of trajectory information in historical data or inaccurate neighbor trajectory information does not allow for a better prediction accuracy of the query trajectory. In this article, we propose a deep learning method based on neighbors for travel time estimation (TTE), called the Nei-TTE method. We divide the entire trajectory into multiple disjoint segments and use the historical trajectory data approximated at the time level. Our model captures the characteristics of each segment and utilizes the trajectory characteristics of adjacent segments as the road network topology and speed interact. We use velocity features to effectively represent adjacent segment structures. The experiments on the Porto dataset show that the experimental results of our model are significantly better than those of the existing models.},

Although many researches have been done on this type of learning, it has not been specifically addressed to improve Q-table values and to increase the amount of reward received by the agent. One of the notable issues in this regard is the improvement of the results of the q-learning algorithm functions. Hence in order to improve the amount of received reward, a weighting matrix is proposed and defined for the set of possible actions of the agent. In this regard our method is capable of reducing the likelihood of behaviours consideration by the agent which leads to a notable decrease in the time of action choosing and as a result achieves improvement in the amount of reward and produces acceptable results in this criteria.},

The machine learning algorithms under observation include artificial neural network, support vector machine, naïve Bayes classifier, k-nearest neighbors and decision tree classifier. The data was acquired for this research from digital relative temperature/humidity sensor (DHT22). Drift fault was injected in the normal data using Arduino Uno microcontroller. The statistical time-domain features were extracted from normal and faulty signals and pooled together in training data. Trained models were tested in an online manner, where the models were used to detect drift fault in the sensor output in real-time. The performance of algorithms was compared using precision, recall, f1-score, and total accuracy parameters. The results show that support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) outperform among the given classifiers.},

Over the years, these dogmas of studying one's enemy before the battle have now made its way into our modern lives as well, not only in real battle but also on the electronic battlefield. In E-Sports, teams will often study one another to find the strengths and weaknesses that can be exploited and avoided in the next encounters. The manner in which this is done is through the observing of prior matches to determine patterns in the manner in which they operate, play and react. This process is extremely time-consuming as one match is a minimum of an hour in duration. This paper demonstrates a program able to acquire and track player positions throughout a match in order to simplify and automate this process. This tracking data can be used with machine learning and or neural networks as part of a professional E-Sport prediction model.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) technology is being utilized in endless applications nowadays and the security of these applications is of great importance. Image based IoT applications serve a wide variety of fields such as medical application and smart cities. Steganography is a great threat to these applications where adversaries can use the images in these applications to hide malicious messages. Therefore, this paper presents an image steganalysis technique that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect the infamous JPEG steganography technique: JPEG universal wavelet relative distortion (J-UNIWARD). Several experiments were conducted to determine the breaking point of J-UNIWARD, whether the hiding technique relies on correlation of the images, and the effect of utilizing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) on the performance of the CNN. The results of the CNN display that the breaking point of J-UNIWARD is 1.5 (bpnzAC), the correlation of the database affects the detection accuracy, and DCT increases the detection accuracy by 13%.},

abstract={The evolution of neural networks has led to the development of various prediction applications such as the time series prediction models. Time series prediction techniques has as widely used in many real-life applications such character recognition, speech recognition, and bio-metric authentication as well person identification. In this work, we report on the comprehensive model for time-series prediction system using multi-Layer feedforward neural network (FFNN) model with the least possible training/prediction error. As a case study, an FFNN Model with minimum estimation error has been developed via MATLAB computing platform to model and predict the time series for yearly averaged sunspot activity during the period from 1719-2018 as a 10th order nonlinear one step ahead predictor. The developed model uses only 90% of the data set to train a two-layer feed forward neural network using generalized delta learning rule (gradient) algorithm. In order to achieve the minimum possible training error, we have trained the proposed FFNN with 4000 sweeps where it recorded a high accuracy levels with a mean square error (MSE) registered as 0.002227 after only 200 sweeps of the training process according to the plot that shows the number of training sweeps vs. the training error (i.e., MSE). Thus, the remaining unused 10% of the data set were used to test the proposed NN model. Therefore, all output signals (the desired output, the training output and testing output) were plotted together for comparison purposes and to gain more insights about the level of confidence achieved by applying the proposed FFNN.},

abstract={Augmented Reality (AR) applications provide major opportunities for healthcare. Mental health rehabilitation in particular is an area that stands to gain from innovations in this field. Debilitating medical conditions related to traumatic brain injuries, aging, and drug abuse, can take advantage from the benefits that these applications provide. Coupled with IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) sensors and machine learning, effective system implementations that predict mental rehabilitation outcomes can be built. This can help in administering better treatment protocols. The collective use of these technologies for therapeutic approaches to alter patient behaviour at a physiological level falls in the emerging field of Digital Therapeutics (DT). In this paper, the current state of AR for mental health rehabilitation is described and used to motivate the implementation of a proof of concept mental DT rehabilitation system developed by us. Similar AR-IoMT systems can reduce inpatient counts in smart cities where an increase in aging populations is already a concern, and existing healthcare resources may be clogged up due to minor inpatient health checkups. In addition, the paper discusses the deployment challenges of the implemented system, which include the lack and need thereof of a standardized protocol for IoMT data collection and analysis for cross interoperability across different healthcare providers and vendors.},

abstract={Personal Information Displays (PID) at bus stops help making the usage of public transport more attractive. If no electric grid is nearby, however, the installation of PIDs is very expensive due to the high wiring costs. To resolve this issue, the partners of the R&D project IoT-STOP develop a novel PID system that will be independent from the access to power lines. The system uses e-papers as displays that can be accessed using a cellular network. To prevent long, energy-intensive idle listening, the network receiver operates only when the passenger information, in particular, the Expected Times of Arrival (ETA) of the buses, is updated. Between two updates, the receiver is switched off such that adjustments after sudden events are not possible. Therefore, the update periods have to be carefully selected. In this paper, we introduce a predictor that estimates time intervals between updates. Our method is based on linear regression using samples of previous bus rides to forecast arrival times. Its predictions are applied by an algorithm to detect areas during the journey of a bus at which its ETA at a later stop changes with a certain probability. The forecasted times for passing such areas are then selected to update the PID at this stop. In addition, we present a number of tests of the predictor carried out at some bus stops in Bergen, Norway. The results show that the proposed method indeed predicts sensible update times of the PID systems.},

abstract={IoT devices enable a massive amount of data to be aggregated and analyzed for anomaly detection. The nature of heterogeneous devices introduces the challenge of collecting and handling these massive datasets to perform data analyses to discover cyber attacks in near real-time. However, the traditional IDS cannot deal with such a problem due to scalability limitations and insufficient storage and processing capabilities. Moreover, issues such as network bandwidth, real-time support, and security limit the power of cloud server-based IDSs. This paper presents an edge-cloud deep IDS model in Lambda architecture for IoT security to address these challenges. Our system decreases the training phase's time compared to traditional machine learning algorithms and increases the accuracy of true positive detected attacks. Furthermore, neural network layers lead deep learning to achieve better performance and flexibility compared to conventional machine learning. Our solution enables the detection of suspicious activities in real-time and allows to classify them by analyzing historical data in a batch process.},

abstract={Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning among multiple independent participants while preserving data privacy of each participant through model aggregation during training. However, model aggregation still faces potential risks that are associated with indirect leakage, such as parameters. In this paper, we first propose an algorithm called Meta Operation Neural Network (MONN) to perform basic arithmetic operations on encrypted data and generate operation results in a plaintext way. MONN is actually a general neural network composed of an encoder and a meta operation decoder, where both the encryption and meta decryption are lossless. MONN can be applied to federated learning for secure model aggregation. In this way, data privacy can be well preserved not only from malicious attackers but also untrustworthy servers. Experimental results reveal the following three key properties: 1) The proposed MONN based federated aggregation method (denoted as FedMONN) can reach satisfactory performance comparable with non-federated counterparts; 2) FedMONN is more secure than the classic federated averaging and one-time pad aggregation, even the server is not a trustable third party; 3) FedMONN is much efficient than the federated aggregation based on the Paillier homomorphic encryption technique.},

abstract={In computer vision fields, 3D object recognition is one of the most important tasks for many real-world applications. Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their advantages in 3D object recognition. In this paper, we propose to use the principal curvature directions of 3D objects (using a CAD model) to represent the geometric features as inputs for the 3D CNN. Our framework, namely CurveNet, learns perceptually relevant salient features and predicts object class labels. Curvature directions incorporate complex surface information of a 3D object, which helps our framework to produce more precise and discriminative features for object recognition. Multitask learning is inspired by sharing features between two related tasks, where we consider pose classification as an auxiliary task to enable our CurveNet to better generalize object label classification. Experimental results show that our proposed framework using curvature vectors performs better than voxels as an input for 3D object classification. We further improved the performance of CurveNet by combining two networks with both curvature direction and voxels of a 3D object as the inputs. A Cross-Stitch module was adopted to learn effective shared features across multiple representations. We evaluated our methods using three publicly available datasets and achieved competitive performance in the 3D object recognition task.},

abstract={Using fuzzy logic, we propose a model with a neural network for public transport, normal cars, and motorcycles. The model controls traffic-light systems to reduce traffic congestion and help vehicles with high priority pass through. A fuzzy neural network (FNN) calculates the traffic-light system and extends or terminates the green signal according to the traffic situation at the given junction while also computing from adjacent intersections. In the presence of public transports, the system decides which signal(s) should be red and how much of an extension should be given to green signals for the priority-based vehicle. The system also monitors the density of car flows and makes real-time decisions accordingly. In order to verify the proposed design algorithm, we adapted the simulations of sumo, ns2, and GLD to our model, and further results depict the performance of the proposed FNN in handling traffic congestion and priority-based traffic. The promising results present the efficiency and the scope of the proposed multi-module architecture for future development in traffic control.},

Accurate quantification would inform developers and municipalities in space allocation and design, while real-time measurements would provide drivers and parking enforcement with information that saves time and resources.

Using recent developments in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and a novel vehicle tracking filter, we combine information across multiple image frames in a video sequence to remove noise introduced by occlusions and detection failures. We demonstrate that our system achieves higher accuracy than pure image-based instance segmentation, and is comparable in performance to industry benchmark systems that utilize more expensive sensors, such as radar. Furthermore, our system shows significant potential in its scalability to a city-wide scale and also in the richness of its output that goes beyond traditional binary occupancy statistics.},

abstract={Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has emerged as a key component of smart cities. Connected vehicles are increasingly processing real-time data to respond immediately to user requests. However, the data must be sent to a remote cloud for processing. To resolve this issue, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged as a promising paradigm that improves the quality of computation experiences for vehicles by offloading computation tasks from the cloud to network edges. Nevertheless, due to the resource restrictions of fog computing, only a limited number of vehicles are able to use it while it is still challenging to provide real-time responses for vehicular applications, such as traffic and accident warnings in the highly dynamic IoV environment. Therefore, in this article, we formulate the problem of allocating the limited fog resources to vehicular applications such that the service latency is minimized, by utilizing parked vehicles. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to efficiently find the solutions of the problem formulation. In addition, the proposed algorithm is combined with reinforcement learning to make more efficient resource allocation decisions, leveraging the vehicles' movement and parking status collected from the smart environment of the city. Our simulation results show that our VFC resource allocation algorithm can achieve higher service satisfaction compared to conventional resource allocation algorithms.},

abstract={It is commonly assumed that in a smart city there will be thousands of mostly mobile/wireless smart devices (e.g. sensors, smart-phones, etc.) that will continuously generate big amounts of data. Data will have to be collected and processed in order to extract knowledge out of it, to feed users' and smart city applications. A typical approach to process such big amounts of data is to i) gather all the collected data on the cloud through wireless pervasive networks, and ii) perform data analysis operations exploiting machine learning techniques. However, according to many studies, this centralised cloud-based approach may not be sustainable from a networking point of view. The joint effect of data-intensive users' multimedia applications and smart cities monitoring and control applications may result in severe network congestions making applications hardly usable. To cope with this problem, in this paper we propose a distributed machine learning approach that does not require to move data in a centralised cloud platform, but processes it directly where it is collected. Specifically, we exploit Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL) to build a distributed machine learning framework. In our framework we train a series of partial models, each ''residing'' in a location where a subset of the dataset is generated. We then refine the partial models by exchanging them between locations, thus obtaining a unique complete model. Using an activity classification task on a reference dataset as a concrete example, we show that the classification accuracy of the HTL model is comparable with that of a model built out of the complete dataset, but the cost in term of network overhead is dramatically reduced. We then perform a sensitiveness analysis to characterise how the overhead depends on key parameters. It is also worth noticing that the HTL approach is suitable for applications dealing with privacy sensitive data, as data can stay where they are generated, and do not need to be transferred to third parties, i.e., to a cloud provider, to extract knowledge out of it.},

The correlation between various traffic parameters such as traffic flow, speed and occupancy are considered for the prediction. We performed the experiment with Recurrent Neural Network based multivariate Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model.

abstract={Meeting user demand is one of the most challenging problems arising in public bicycle sharing systems. Various factors, such as daily commuting patterns or topographical conditions, can lead to an unbalanced state where the numbers of rented and returned bicycles differ significantly among the stations. This can cause spatial imbalance of the bicycle inventory which becomes critical when stations run completely empty or full, and thus prevent users from renting or returning bicycles. To prevent such service disruptions, we propose to forecast user demand in terms of expected number of bicycle rentals and returns and accordingly to estimate number of bicycles that need to be manually redistributed among the stations by maintenance vehicles. As opposed to traditional solutions to this problem, which rely on short-term demand forecasts, we aim to maximise the time within which the stations remain balanced by forecasting user demand multiple steps ahead of time. We propose a multi-input multi-output deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory networks to forecast user demand over long future horizons. Conducted experimental study over real-world dataset confirms the efficiency and accuracy of our approach.},

abstract={At present, the traditional heuristic method to solve the problem of virtual network embedding (VNE) is still the mainstream. In the environment of network virtualization (NV), a more efficient VNE algorithm is needed to serve the construction of smart city. Using heuristic algorithm to solve the problem of VNE does not meet its development requirements. In this paper, a VNE algorithm based on node probability is proposed by using reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The algorithm extracts three attributes of each substrate node to form a feature matrix, which is used as the input of the policy network to train the agent. The purpose is to deduce the mapping probability of each node and rank the base nodes according to this probability, then embed the virtual nodes in this order. Finally, the breadth first search (BFS) strategy is used to map the links. Simulation results show that our algorithm is superior to a representative algorithm based on node ranking in terms of the acceptance rate of virtual network requests (VNR), long-term revenue consumption ratio and long-term average revenue.},

abstract={Looking for available parking slots has become a serious issue in contemporary urban mobility. The selection of suitable car parks could be influenced by multiple factors-e.g., the walking distance to destination, driving and waiting time, parking prices, availability, and accessibility-while the availability of unused parking slots might depend on parking location, events in the area, traffic flow, and weather conditions. This paper presents a set of metrics and techniques to predict the number of available parking slots in city garages with gates. With this aim, we have considered three different predictive techniques, while comparing different approaches. The comparison has been performed according to the data collected in a dozen of garages in the area of Florence by using Sii-Mobility National Research Project and Km4City infrastructure. The resulting solution has demonstrated that a Bayesian regularized neural network exploiting historical data, weather condition, and traffic flow data can offer a robust approach for the implementation of reliable and fast predictions of available slots in terms of flexibility and robustness to critical cases. The solution adopted in a Smart City Apps in the Florence area for sustainable mobility has been welcomed with broad appreciation or has been praised as successful.},

abstract={Smart cities aim for the optimization and enhancement of all domains of application, as well as strive for more sustainable ecosystems. Emerging and disruptive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence are transforming the way we uncover and bring value, making them optimal when it comes to building and maintaining a smart city. Artificial Intelligence has become a driving force behind many technological innovations and proved significant in different fields including medicine, education, marketing, food technology, banking, and green technology. Nowadays, people are more aware of pressing matters concerning the environment. They are more willing to opt for environmentally friendly solutions wherever possible. We aim to introduce a solution by which people's actions to limit environmental damage are not limited to merely purchasing ecofriendly products but extended to getting those products delivered in a way that is least harmful to the planet. Therefore, this paper proposes a CO2 emission predictive analysis using Artificial Intelligence that calculates and predicts the amounts of CO2 to be emitted from a cargo van in advance. The system takes into account the total distance to be traveled and the amount of gas needed to travel that distance and predict the emission accordingly. This paper proposes that such a system should also be embedded with self-driving cars, as in the smart cities of the future self-driving cars will become the norm. Relevant conceptual information used to develop the predictive analysis system is discussed. A discussion is also made on the development of the system as well as the preparation of the dataset. The system is analyzed based on the accuracy of the prediction. Finally, a future direction for the current approach of implementation is presented.},

abstract={Edge computing emerged as a promising paradigm that provides cloud-like services in the vicinity of mobile users. Benefitting from the geographical and social similarities among users, edge computing can intelligently provide on-demand services with low latency. However, the unprecedented amount of tasks along with the heterogeneous nature of applications in future smart cities such as healthcare, energy management, transportation, cybersecurity, and so on, have created a bottleneck on the performance of edge computing. Therefore, edge devices need to be equipped with adaptive machine learning techniques to cope with the continuously changing computing environment and to provide mobile users with reliable smart services. Furthermore, establishing a cloud-to-edge and edge-to-edge cooperative learning can help not only to relieve the burdens on edge servers but also to facilitate the learning process in which the knowledge earned by one computing node can be shared by other nodes in the network. In this paper, edge computing services are presented in light of state-of-the-art machine learning and computing technologies. In addition, a case study on edge-assisted multi-hop D2D communications for IoT devices is proposed aiming to provide seamless connectivity and reduce delay in dense IoT environments.},

abstract={When the positive and negative sample attribute characteristics of data are similar, most machine learning algorithms often fail to classify the data correctly in the diagnosis of a single disease. In this paper, we propose a confidence interval based neural network algorithm, which can overcome the above shortcomings very well. Firstly, the proposed algorithm normalizes the training samples. Secondly, it uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension to obtain the optimal features, and then uses the Back Propagation (BP) neural network to train the features to obtain the diagnostic model. Before using the diagnostic model to predict the samples, we firstly obtains a confidence interval for the distribution of the output values of the training samples, and then determines the final prediction result according to the confidence interval in which the predicted values fall. We run the proposed algorithm based on the disease data set in University of California Irvine (UCI) database to carry out single disease intelligent diagnosis, and compare it with other classical machine learning algorithms such as decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, K-nearest neighbor and so on. The results show that predicting accuracy of the proposed algorithm is significantly better than that of other classical algorithms mentioned above.},

abstract={In modern information warfare, radar must apply some anti-jamming technologies. Digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) and its technology can adapt to the complex threat signal environment and have an excellent jamming effect that other technical means in the past cannot match. Currently, traditional DRFM jamming identification is mainly based on the method of extracting and modeling radar signal features. It is unable to identify various types of jamming and lacks a large amount of radar data. In this work, we propose a three-phase framework to identify DRFM jamming. First, we design a hardware system based on PXI module to generate jamming signal data. Second, we perform range-doppler processing on the raw radar signal data to generate range-doppler map (RD-map) which can accurately represent jamming signals. Finally, we use deep learning to identify DRFM jamming and use pre-trained models to improve identification accuracy. We evaluate our proposed framework using real DRFM jamming data collected from PXI system. The valuation results confirm that our approach effectively identifies DRFM jamming, achieving an average accuracy of 84.4%.},

abstract={A recommender system (RS) is highly efficient in filtering people's desired information from high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) data. To date, a latent factor (LF)-based approach becomes highly popular when implementing a RS. However, current LF models mostly adopt single distance-oriented Loss like an L₂ norm-oriented one, which ignores target data's characteristics described by other metrics like an L₁ norm-oriented one. To investigate this issue, this article proposes an L₁-and-L₂-norm-oriented LF (L³F) model. It adopts twofold ideas: 1) aggregating L₁ norm's robustness and L₂ norm's stability to form its Loss and 2) adaptively adjusting weights of L₁ and L₂ norms in its Loss. By doing so, it achieves fine aggregation effects with L₁ norm-oriented Loss's robustness and L₂ norm-oriented Loss's stability to precisely describe HiDS data with outliers. Experimental results on nine HiDS datasets generated by real systems show that an L³F model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy for missing data of an HiDS dataset. Its computational efficiency is also comparable with the most efficient LF models. Hence, it has good potential for addressing HiDS data from real applications.},

abstract={Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications require a distributed architecture for decision making either because of a lack of a centralized system, failure-prone connectivity to a centralized system or because the imposed latency to contact such a system is too high for real-time applications. Often, these IoT applications fall in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), e.g., autonomous robot navigation in smart factories and traffic signal control in smart cities. However, RL-based applications require a long learning time. To overcome this limitation and scale with the number of agents, parallel RL (PRL) algorithms run multiple RL agents in parallel and on distributed environments. However, deploying PRL algorithms in such environments entails a communication overhead that increases the (actual) execution time. The state-of-the-art PRL algorithms are designed for reducing the learning time while assuming no (or limited) communication overhead. In this article, we present a novel partitioning algorithm that minimizes the communication overhead in PRL running on IoT environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on solving the communication overhead of distributing PRL algorithms without requiring any a priori knowledge about the structure of the problem. The proposed algorithm intelligently combines a dynamic state partitioning strategy, which exploits the agent's exploration capabilities to build partition knowledge while learning, with an efficient mapping of agents to partitions, which reduces the communication among agents. Performance evaluations show that the proposed algorithm can achieve almost no communication among PRL agents at the converged state.},

To mitigate such negative effects, several research groups have been working on predicting air quality using deep learning. However, the lack of high-quality air quality datasets is a major obstacle encountered to achieve high accuracy prediction. In this paper, we introduce an air monitoring data generator powered by learning distributed real sequences using the generative adversarial network (GAN), namely AirGen. An unsupervised adversarial loss is also employed in the network to minimize the difference between generated synthetic and original data in the training process. Experiments on real datasets indicate that the data generated by Airgen could significantly increase the prediction accuracy performed by deep learning models. The mean square error (MSE) is remarkably reduced from 0.024 to 0.015.},

abstract={The vision for smart cities is to provide a core infrastructure that enables a good quality of life for their citizens and the sustainable management of natural resources. Towards this vision, supporting the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EV) contributes to improved air quality, sustainable mobility, and utility distribution. Fostering EV adoption contends with concerns typically centered on vehicle range and costs. An understanding of EV charging patterns is therefore crucial for optimizing charging infrastructure placement and managing operational costs. Towards this end, this paper proposes an automated analytical workflow to gain insight from a large volume of real operational data from EV charging stations. The research goal is to establish a mechanism to descriptively analyse the EV charging data and to thoroughly diagnose whether low-demand charging station groupings can effectively be identified using spatio-temporal features and hierarchical clustering. Preliminary results suggest agglomerative clustering is effective at grouping similar charging stations together when considering spatial and temporal features of recharge events.},

Optimal decentralized controllers, on the other hand, are difficult to find. In this paper, we propose a framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn decentralized controllers from data. While GNNs are naturally distributed architectures, making them perfectly suited for the task, we adapt them to handle delayed communications as well. Furthermore, they are equivariant and stable, leading to good scalability and transferability properties. The problem of flocking is explored to illustrate the potential of GNNs in learning decentralized controllers.},

However, their penetration on transportation roads faces some obstacles that have not yet been fully tackled. For instance, the development of intelligent battery management systems needs to be further investigated taking into consideration the uncertainty linked to how vehicles will perform in different scenarios, such as traffic situation, driver behavior, and road profile. The work presented in this study is towards developing a battery management system by investigating new approaches for accurate estimation and prediction of remaining charge, the expected lifetime of the batteries and the remaining driving rang. We focus mainly on the integration of predictive analytics techniques for forecasting the state-of-charge.

abstract={As an important application scenario of the industrial Internet of things, the Internet of Vehicles can significantly improve road safety, improve traffic management efficiency, and improve people's travel experience. Due to the high dynamics of the Internet of vehicles environment, the traditional resource optimization technologies cannot meet the requirements of the Internet of vehicles for dynamic communication, computing and storage resources optimization management, and artificial intelligence algorithms can adaptively obtain dynamic resource allocation schemes through self-learning. Therefore, adopting artificial intelligence techniques to optimize the dynamic resource of the Internet of Vehicles is the research focus of this article. In this article, we first model the Internet of Vehicles resource allocation problem as a semi-Markov decision process that introduces a resource reservation strategy and a secondary resource allocation mechanism. Then, the reinforcement learning algorithm is used to solve the model. Thereafter, it theoretically analyzes the joint optimization of computing and communication resources, models it as a hierarchical architecture, and uses hierarchical reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal system resource allocation plan. Finally, the results of simulation experiments show that the dynamic resource allocation scheme of the Internet of vehicles based on the reinforcement learning in this article greatly improve resource utilization and user quality of experience with guaranteeing system quality of service compared with the traditional greedy algorithm.},

abstract={Vehicle detection and tracking play an important role in autonomous vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. Adverse weather conditions such as the presence of heavy snow, fog, rain, dust or sandstorm situations are dangerous restrictions on camera’s function by reducing visibility, affecting driving safety. Indeed, these restrictions impact the performance of detection and tracking algorithms utilized in the traffic surveillance systems and autonomous driving applications. In this article, we start by proposing a visibility enhancement scheme consisting of three stages: illumination enhancement, reflection component enhancement, and linear weighted fusion to improve the performance. Then, we introduce a robust vehicle detection and tracking approach using a multi-scale deep convolution neural network. The conventional Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter based tracker is utilized jointly with hierarchical data associations (HDA), which splits into detection-to-track and track-to-track associations. Herein, the cost matrix of each phase is solved using the Hungarian algorithm to compensate for the lost tracks caused by missed detection. Only detection information (i.e., bounding boxes with detection scores) is used in HDA without visual features information for rapid execution. We have also introduced a novel benchmarking dataset designed for research in applications of autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions called DAWN. It consists of real-world images collected with different types of adverse weather conditions. The proposed method is tested on DAWN, KITTI, and MS-COCO datasets and compared with 21 vehicle detectors. Experimental results have validated effectiveness of the proposed method which outperforms state-of-the-art vehicle detection and tracking approaches under adverse weather conditions.},

abstract={Most of the commercial navigation products provide route planning service for users. However, they only consider a single metric such as distance, time, or other costs, while ignoring a critical criterion: safety. In a smart city, people may prefer to find a safe walking route to avoid the potential crime risk as well as obtain a short distance. This problem can be specified as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). Many methods were proposed in the past to solve the multi-objective route planning, the multi-objective evolutionary approach (MOEA) is considered as the most popular one. However, MOEA is non-optimized when used in a large-scale road network and becomes computationally expensive when handling a large population size. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective hyper-heuristic (MOHH) framework for walking route planning in a smart city. In the search framework, we design a set of low level heuristics to generate new routes. Moreover, we adopt reinforcement learning mechanism to select good low-level heuristics to accelerate searching speed. We further improve the reinforcement learning-based multi-objective hyper-heuristic (RL-MOHH) algorithm and implement a parallel version (RL-PMOHH) on general purpose graphic process unit. Extensive experiments are conducted on the safety-index map constructed from the historical urban data of the New York city. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed RL-PMOHH is almost 173, 5.3, and 3.1 times faster than the exact multi-objective optimization algorithm, the RL-MOHH algorithm, and the parallel NSGA-II algorithm, respectively. Moreover, both RL-MOHH and RL-PMOHH can obtain more than 80% Pareto optimal solutions in a large-scale road network.},

This limits their potential applications, e.g., in mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a lightweight pyramid networt (LPNet) for single-image deraining. Instead of designing a complex network structure, we use domain-specific knowledge to simplify the learning process. In particular, we find that by introducing the mature Gaussian-Laplacian image pyramid decomposition technology to the neural network, the learning problem at each pyramid level is greatly simplified and can be handled by a relatively shallow network with few parameters. We adopt recursive and residual network structures to build the proposed LPNet, which has less than 8K parameters while still achieving the state-of-the-art performance on rain removal. We also discuss the potential value of LPNet for other low- and high-level vision tasks.},

The obtained results show the applicability and efficiency of our proposal in providing timely notification of social distancing violations.},

abstract={We introduce a permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT) design for crowdsourced smart mobility applications. This architecture is based on a directed acyclic graph architecture (similar to the IOTA tangle) and uses both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Position mechanisms to provide protection against spam attacks and malevolent actors. In addition to enabling individuals to retain ownership of their data and to monetize it, the architecture is also suitable for distributed privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms, is lightweight, and can be implemented in simple internet-of-things (IoT) devices. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply this framework to reinforcement learning settings where a third party is interested in acquiring information from agents. In particular, one may be interested in sampling an unknown vehicular traffic flow in a city, using a DLT-type architecture and without perturbing the density, with the idea of realizing a set of virtual tokens as surrogates of real vehicles to explore geographical areas of interest. These tokens, whose authenticated position determines write access to the ledger, are thus used to emulate the probing actions of commanded (real) vehicles on a given planned route by ``jumping'' from a passing-by vehicle to another to complete the planned trajectory. Consequently, the environment stays unaffected (i.e., the autonomy of participating vehicles is not influenced by the algorithm), regardless of the number of emitted tokens. The design of such a DLT architecture is presented, and numerical results from large-scale simulations are provided to validate the proposed approach.},

abstract={Multi-robot system has been adopted as a kind of ubiquitous intelligent systems to perform critical tasks in various fields. In multi-robot systems, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is regarded as a promising technology to support decision-making. However, existing MARL approaches assume either a predefined system configuration or a unified model for agents with identical roles, and thus cannot effectively deal with the dynamic change in the number of robots, which is very common in the real world. This kind of "adaptation" problem seriously hinders the development of intelligence in multi-robot systems. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-MADDPG approach to enable new robots to integrate into an existing multi-robot system quickly. We build on the MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm and distill the meta-knowledge of a specific robot team by training a meta-actor and a meta-critic simultaneously. The meta-actor can learn an experienced policy net for new robots to perform reasonable actions directly if the situation is urgent, while the meta-critic trains a value net to criticize the current situation for better evolution of new robots. Our experiments on a typical application case (multi-robot collision avoidance) indicate that the meta-knowledge can significantly improve the fast adaptation for the newcomers.

abstract={The automatic pulmonary nodule detection in thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis of lung cancer. In this paper, we propose a novel framework with a 3D convolutional network (ConvNet) for pulmonary nodule detection. To improve the efficiency and flexibility, we adopt one-stage process without the false positive reduction stage. Specially, the great challenge of the nodule detection is the recall rate of small nodules. We propose two methods to solve this issue. Firstly, we set the classification label by the intersection over union (IoU) self-normalization, which enables to eliminate the loss of regression information caused by misleading classification confidence. Secondly, pulmonary nodules differ in size, shape and density, leading to large intra-class variations. We introduce maxout unit to solve this problem. Overall, we achieve an average FROC score of 0.912 on LUNA16 dataset, outperforming all other one-stage models as far as we know.},

abstract={Device authentication, encryption, and key distribution are of vital importance to any Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, such as the new smart city infrastructures. This is due to the concern that attackers could easily exploit the lack of strong security in IoT devices to gain unauthorized access to the system or to hijack IoT devices to perform denial-of-service attacks on other networks. With the rise of fog and edge computing in IoT systems, increasing numbers of IoT devices have been equipped with computing capabilities to perform data analysis with deep learning technologies. Deep learning on edge devices can be deployed in numerous applications, such as local cardiac arrhythmia detection on a smart sensing patch, but it is rarely applied to device authentication and wireless communication encryption. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight IoT device authentication, encryption, and key distribution approach using neural cryptosystems and binary latent space. The neural cryptosystems adopt three types of end-to-end encryption schemes: symmetric, public-key, and without keys. A series of experiments were conducted to test the performance and security strength of the proposed neural cryptosystems. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of this novel approach as a promising security and privacy solution for the next-generation of IoT systems.},

abstract={Nowadays, Illegal dumping of garbage in residential area is a troublesome problem for both inhabitants and civic administration. So, government authorities are struggling to solve this issue in efficient way. The automatization of garbage collection process is an essential requirement and one of the major needs to proceed toward smart cities. The atomization of garbage collection requires the detection and localization of garbage automatically. The stated task is not an easy work as to train any machine learning system; it is needed corresponding dataset with its ground truth. The ground truth acquisition is a tedious task as it is needed to annotate every pixel in the image with its corresponding class. This needs a lot of manual work which is expensive in term of time and money both. In this paper, a garbage detection and localization system is proposed based on Convolutional Neural Network, which is trained on images labeled as garbage or non-garbage. The labeling of images in two classes as garbage or non-garbage is a simple and relatively fast task. The system yields better results in comparison to existing weekly-supervised methods; it also produces competitive results with respect to supervised learning method. The performance of the system is evaluated with pixel level of accuracy and it is also evaluated qualitatively by human experts.},

abstract={Under the paradigm of Edge Computing, the enormous data generated at the network edge can be processed locally. Machine learning methods are often adopted to make full utilization of these data, among which the deep learning is a promising one. When considering the inherent distributed feature of these data, it is appeal to conduct distributed deep learning tasks directly at the edge. We focus on an edge computing system that conduct distributed deep learning tasks using gradient descent based approaches. To ensure the system's performance, there are at least two major challenges to cope with: how to offload the training jobs with multiple data source nodes and how to allocate the limited resources on each edge server among training jobs. In this paper, we jointly consider the two challenges, aiming to maximize the system throughput while ensuring the system's quality of service (QoS). We formulate the joint problem as an integer non-linear program and propose an efficient approximation algorithm based on reformulation and randomized rounding technique. Simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm can improve 56% of the system throughput and 53% of resource utilization when compared to the conventional baseline algorithms.},

abstract={Due to an increasing share of renewable energy sources the balancing of energy production and consumption is getting a lot of interest considering future smart grids. In this context, many investigations on demand-response programs are being conducted to achieve flexibility from different energy storages and loads. As space heating is an important schedulable load for flexibility simulations, there are different modelling approaches due to its interdisciplinary nature. Models can be built from the civil engineering or electrical engineering point of view, depending on the computational expense and accuracy level. Scheduling optimizations need a lot of simulations, preferably with computationally light models. Thus, this work will use a computationally light neural network load prediction model for space heating which is based on a detailed civil engineering model. Simulations with different scheduling times were conducted to see the long- and short-term effects of the demand response action. Results show, that applying the same demand response action at different times results in different behaviors of the system resp. energy consumption, which requires further studies for developing optimized scheduling methods.},

abstract={Unlicensed taxis are widely considered as major obstacles to city traffic regulation and public safety. Thus, many governments have issued restrictions for car-hailing services and alleged that the use of unlicensed vehicles was illegal. However, it is very challenging that traffic administrative enforcements face limited manpower to prohibit unlicensed taxis, due to costly and time-consuming procedure of on-site evidence collection. In this paper, we propose an effective service to incorporate human mobility mechanism into unlicensed taxis detection from massive city-wide vehicles. We first extract 276 spatio-temporal features, which are grouped into two categories, including daily behaviors and sustainable behaviors to capture the mobility characteristics of unlicensed taxis. Second, we investigate the detection accuracy of three machine learning techniques, viz. support vector machines, decision tree, and logical regression. We illustrate our approach using real-world vehicle license plate recognition dataset in Xiamen, China, which contains 336 million passing records for 6.2 million vehicles filmed by 439 devices in August 2016. Experimental results reveal that LR outperforms SVM and DT in prediction accuracy and F-score measurement, while SVM is capable of identifying the largest number of unlicensed taxis.},

abstract={Robust road boundary extraction and completion play an important role in providing guidance to all road users and supporting high-definition (HD) maps. The significant challenges remain in remarkable and accurate road boundary recovery from poor road boundary conditions. This paper presents a novel deep learning framework, named BoundaryNet, to extract and complete road boundaries by using both mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds and high-resolution satellite imagery. First, road boundaries are extracted by conducting a curb-based extraction method. Such extracted 3D road boundary lines are used as inputs to feed into a U-shaped network for erroneous boundary denoising. Then, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is proposed to complete the road boundaries. Next, to achieve more complete and accurate road boundaries, a conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (c-DCGAN) with the assistance of road centerlines extracted from satellite images is developed. Finally, according to the completed road boundaries, the inherent road geometries are calculated. The proposed methods were evaluated using satellite imagery and four MLS point cloud datasets with varying densities and road conditions in urban environments. The quality evaluation metrics of 82.88%, 82.43%, 88.86%, and 84.89% were achieved for four data sets. The experimental results indicate that the BoundaryNet model can provide a promising solution for road boundary completion and road geometry estimation.},

abstract={Fully convolutional neural networks have made promising progress in joint liver and liver tumor segmentation. Instead of following the debates over 2D versus 3D networks (for example, pursuing the balance between large-scale 2D pretraining and 3D context), in this paper, we novelly identify the wide variation in the ratio between intra- and inter-slice resolutions as a crucial obstacle to the performance. To tackle the mismatch between the intra- and inter-slice information, we propose a slice-aware 2.5D network that emphasizes extracting discriminative features utilizing not only in-plane semantics but also out-of-plane coherence for each separate slice. Specifically, we present a slice-wise multi-input multi-output architecture to instantiate such a design paradigm, which contains a Multi-Branch Decoder (MD) with a Slice-centric Attention Block (SAB) for learning slice-specific features and a Densely Connected Dice (DCD) loss to regularize the inter-slice predictions to be coherent and continuous. Based on the aforementioned innovations, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) dataset. Besides, we also test our model on the ISBI 2019 Segmentation of THoracic Organs at Risk (SegTHOR) dataset, and the result proves the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method in other segmentation tasks.},

abstract={The ever-increasing and unbalanced traffic load in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) networks have increased the network congestion and led to user dissatisfaction. To relieve the network congestion and improve the traffic load balance, in this paper, we propose an intelligent software defined C-V2X network framework to enable flexible and low-complexity traffic offloading by decoupling the network data plane from the control plane. In the data plane, the cellular traffic offloading and the vehicle assisted traffic offloading are jointly performed. In the control plane, deep learning is deployed to reduce the software defined network (SDN) control complexity and improve the traffic offloading efficiency. Under the proposed framework, we investigate the traffic offloading problem, which can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Specifically, the first objective maximizes the cellular access point (AP) throughput with consideration of the load balance by associating the users with the APs. The second objective maximizes the vehicle throughput with consideration of the vehicle trajectory by associating the delay-insensitive users with the vehicles. The two objectives are coupled by the association between the cellular APs and the vehicles. A deep learning based online-offline approach is proposed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The online stage decouples the optimization problem into two sub-problems and utilizes the `Pareto optimal' to find the solutions. The offline stage utilizes deep learning to learn from the historical optimization information of the online stage and helps predict the optimal solutions with reduced complexity. Numerical results are provided to validate the advantages of our proposed traffic offloading approach via deep learning in C-V2X networks.},

abstract={Smart health is one of the most popular and important components of smart cities. It is a relatively new context-aware healthcare paradigm influenced by several fields of expertise, such as medical informatics, communications and electronics, bioengineering, ethics, to name a few. Smart health is used to improve healthcare by providing many services such as patient monitoring, early diagnosis of disease and so on. The artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning models, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN), are the most commonly used machine learning approaches where they proved to be performance in most cases. Voice disorders are rapidly spreading especially with the development of medical diagnostic systems, although they are often underestimated. Smart health systems can be an easy and fast support to voice pathology detection. The identification of an algorithm that discriminates between pathological and healthy voices with more accuracy is needed to obtain a smart and precise mobile health system. The main contribution of this paper consists of proposing a multiclass-pathologic voice classification using a novel multileveled textural feature extraction with iterative feature selector. Our approach is a simple and efficient voice-based algorithm in which a multi-center and multi threshold based ternary pattern is used (MCMTTP). A more compact multileveled features are then obtained by sample-based discretization techniques and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) is applied to select features iteratively. These features are finally integrated with MCMTTP to achieve an accurate voice-based features detection. Experimental results of six classifiers with three diagnostic diseases (frontal resection, cordectomy and spastic dysphonia) show that the fused features are more suitable for describing voice-based disease detection.},

abstract={3D objects detected from real-world data are usually incomplete in different degrees. Objects with different degrees of incompleteness should be treated and processed separately. This paper proposes a framework for partial 3D object retrieval and completeness evaluation in an urban street scene based on mobile laser scanning (MLS) point cloud data. The framework consists of three parts. A deep learning method is first used to detect objects from 3D point cloud data. Then, for each detected object, the most similar object in the reference dataset, which contains complete objects, is obtained by a partial 3D shape retrieval method. Last, a completeness evaluation of the detected object is conducted by calculating the completeness index that reflects the integrity of the detected object, and a missing part prediction is given to guide further completion. The proposed framework is validated on the public dataset KITTI and our own point cloud dataset. The experiment includes 3D detection, the partial 3D shape retrieval, and the completeness evaluation. Results show the good performance of the object detection and partial shape retrieval, also a reasonable evaluation of objects completeness.},

abstract={The threat of incendiary and often, catstrophical terrorist attacks is a major challenge for the urban administrators. The urban landscape is changing at a fast pace with the emphasis moving toward “smart cities”. Terrorists, for obvious reasons, prefer attacking cities compared to rural areas. Smart cities are expected to absorb larger populations of inhabitants in smaller area implying the damage inflicted by these attacks would be maximum unless some preventive mechanisms exist in the smart city ecosystem. There exist very few methodologies for attack forecasting due to lack of real-time data (confidentiality and reluctance of law enforement in sharing data). In this paper, we propose a way to predict future attacks, weapons used and likely targets using a class of powerful machine learning algorithms known as ensemble learning.

abstract={The purpose is to explore the spatial-temporal dynamic prediction performance of urban road network traffic flow based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) of deep learning. A dynamic prediction model of road network traffic flow based on STGCN-BiLSTM (spatial-temporal graph convolution network Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory) is designed in view of the complex and highly nonlinear traffic data in the actual environment. Finally, the simulation experiment is conducted on the constructed model to verify its performance which is compared with that of the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, CNN model, RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model, AlexNet model and STGCN model. The results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed algorithm model are 4.60%, 5.46% and 7.73%, respectively. The training time is stable at about 45s, the test time is stable at about 33s, and the delay is close to 1.86x10⁻⁴s. Additionally, the traffic flow of the test section in the next 15 min, 30 min, 1 h and 2 h is further predicted. Compared with other algorithms, the predicted value of the proposed algorithm is the closest to the actual value, along with the best prediction effect. Therefore, the constructed dynamic prediction model of road network traffic flow can achieve high accuracy and better robustness under the premise of low error, which can provide experimental basis for the spatial-temporal dynamic digital development of transportation in smart cities.},

abstract={Driven by the demand of artificial intelligent, high-performance computing, electric vehicle and smart city, semiconductor industry is building high performance and high integrated systems. To increase the energy efficiency of these complicated systems, particularly in power modules, reducing the power consumption is needed. Thinning the die is one of the solutions, which can provide a lot of advantages including faster heat dissipation, low junction temperature, low electrical resistance, etc. However, due to its sensitivity of stress, processing of thin die is a challenging, including die pick-up process. In this paper, we proposed a methodology using machine learning and finite element method (FEM) to optimize the pin designs with the objective to minimize the stress in the die during pick-up process. A dynamic numerical model was first built up to simulate the stress distribution in the die during pick-up process, and a Gaussian process regression was applied to generate the relationships between pin parameters and die stress. Meanwhile, a Bayesian optimization was used to optimize the parameters. The optimized pin designs using the above methodology was further validated by FEM. Compared with traditional DOE method, the proposed methodology using machine learning and FEM exhibits much higher effectiveness in parameter optimization with less testing cost and efforts.},

abstract={In smart city framework, the water monitoring through an efficient, low-cost, low-power and IoT-oriented sensor technology is a crucial aspect to allow, with limited resources, the analysis of contaminants eventually affecting wastewater. In this sense, common interfering substances, as detergents, cannot be classified as dangerous contaminants and should be neglected in the classification. By adopting classical machine learning approaches having a finite set of possible responses, each alteration of the sensor baseline is always classified as one out of the predetermined substances. Consequently, we developed an anomaly detection system based on one-class classifiers, able to discriminate between a recognized set of substances and an interfering source. In this way, the proposed detection system is able to provide detailed information about the water status and distinguish between harmless detergents and dangerous contaminants.},

abstract={Road extraction from remote sensing images is an attractive but difficult task. Gray-value distribution and structure feature information are both crucial for road extraction task. However, existing methods mainly focus on structure feature information which contains morphological shape features and machine learning features, suffering from lots of false positives which are generated at positions having similar structure features but different gray-value distribution with roads. To effectively fuse the two complementary gray-value distribution and structure feature information, we propose a coarse-to-fine road extraction algorithm from remote sensing images. First, at the coarse level, we introduce a local Dirichlet mixture models (LDMM) which utilizing gray-value distribution information to pre-segment images into potential roads and backgrounds. Thus, most backgrounds having different gray-value distribution with roads can be removed firstly. Compared with original Dirichlet mixture models, the LDMM is much faster and more accurate. Next, at the fine level, we introduce a multiscale-high-order deep learning strategy based on ResNet model which can learn robust structure context features for final road extraction step. Based on the results of LDMM, the multiscale-high-order strategy can further remove false positives which have different structure features with roads. Compared with a single scanning size ResNet, our multiscale-high-order strategy can learn higher-order context information, leading to better performances. We test our algorithm on Shaoshan dataset. Experiments illustrate our better performance compared with other six state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={High utility itemsets mining provides more information, which can help manager to make better decisions. However, there are too many redundant high utility itemsets which makes it difficult for users to find useful information in a large set of high utility itemsets. To solve this problem, this paper proposed an approach for mining non-redundant high-utility association rules (NR-HAR) efficiently in both dense and sparse datasets, which make more timely decisions on business strategy. This approach includes two phases: (1) building an extended high utility itemsets Lattice(EHUIL) and identify generator and closed itemsets within this. (2) Proposing an efficient algorithm for mining NR-HAR from the built EHUIL. The new algorithm is based on utility-confidence framework and the lattice structure, obtaining semantic relationships among HUIs.

abstract={Vienna, among other cities, has the aspirations of transforming into a smart city of tomorrow. To enable this transformation and to cope with the challenges for a smarter and more resilient grid, the grid operators have to improve the utilization of new and existing high voltage power cable systems in urban areas. Anyhow, due to the missing of international experience and the lack of suitable standards, intensive research and validation has to be done before. Therefore, for more than 2 years now, load scenarios have been carried out on a 400-kVcable test setup under realistic circumstances. The measured data, which consists of more than 90 different sensors, which are tracking temperatures, but also environmental parameters, are not only used to validate calculation results, but furthermore, to develop a digital twin of the cable system. One key part to do so is the modelling of the environment. Therefore, a statistical evaluation of the correlation of different environmental parameters on the cable temperature has been carried out. The resulting parameters of influence have then been modelled using supervised learning methods. In a final step, the models have been tested with empirical data from the test setup. In this paper, the investigation and modelling of environmental parameters as well as the evaluation of the obtained models will be discussed. Furthermore, the benefits of the derived models for thermal rating calculation are indicated by comparison to the analytical method given by the IEC 60287 on an example. Accurate mathematical models with real time calculation capabilities and prediction accuracies in the range of 98 to 99% could be derived on the basis of relatively small data sets and implementation of external data.},

abstract={Traffic speed prediction is among the key problems in intelligent transportation system (ITS). Traffic patterns with complex spatial dependency make accurate prediction on traffic networks a challenging task. Recently, a deep learning approach named Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN) has achieved state-of-the-art results in traffic speed prediction by jointly exploiting the spatial and temporal features of traffic data. Nonetheless, applying STGCN to large-scale urban traffic network may develop degenerated results, which is due to redundant spatial information engaging in graph convolution. In this work, we propose a motif-based graph-clustering approach to apply STGCN to large-scale traffic networks. By using graph clustering, we partition a large urban traffic network into smaller clusters to prompt the learning effect of graph convolution. The proposed approach is evaluated on two real-world datasets and is compared with its variants and baseline methods. The results show that graph-clustering approaches generally outperform the other methods, and the proposed approach obtains the best performance.},

abstract={The estimation of crowd count in images has a wide range of applications such as video surveillance, traffic monitoring, public safety and urban planning. Recently, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches have been shown to be more effective in crowd counting than traditional methods that use handcrafted features. However, the existing CNN-based methods still suffer from large number of parameters and large storage space, which require high storage and computing resources and thus limit the real-world application. Consequently, we propose a deeply-recursive network (DR-ResNet) based on ResNet blocks for crowd counting. The recursive structure makes the network deeper while keeping the number of parameters unchanged, which enhances network capability to capture statistical regularities in the context of the crowd. Besides, we generate a new dataset from the video-monitoring data of Beijing bus station. Experimental results have demonstrated that proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art methods with far less number of parameters.},

abstract={Multisource data are captured from different sensors or generated with different generation mechanisms. Ground camera images (images taken from ground-based camera) and rendered images (synthesized by the position information from 3-D image-based point cloud) are different-source geospatial data, called cross-domain images. Particularly, in outdoor environments, the registration relationship between the above cross-domain images is available to establish the spatial relationship between 2-D and 3-D space, which is an indirect solution for virtual-real registration of augmented reality (AR). However, the traditional handcrafted feature descriptors cannot match the above cross-domain images because of the low quality of rendered images and the domain gap between cross-domain images. In this article, inspired by the success achieved by deep learning in computer vision, we first propose an end-to-end network, DIFD-Net, to learn domain invariant feature descriptors (DIFDs) for cross-domain image patches. The DIFDs are used for cross-domain image patch retrieval to the registration of ground camera and rendered images. Second, we construct a domain-kept consistent loss function, which balances the feature descriptors for narrowing the gap in different domains, to optimize DIFD-Net. Specially, the negative samples are generated from positive during training, and the introduced constraint of intermediate feature maps increases extra supervision information to learn feature descriptors. Finally, experiments show the superiority of DIFDs for the retrieval of cross-domain image patches, which achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Additionally, we use DIFDs to match ground camera images and rendered images, and verify the feasibility of the derived AR virtual-real registration in open outdoor environments.},

abstract={Sensory navigation device is an important trend in the field of machine learning and data science. Nowadays, more and more sensory navigation devices are built for blind people. The core of such sensory navigation devices for blind people usually is implemented by an Image Recognition Method. To build an image recognition model, many tools and online machine learning platforms are proposed. However, these tools or platforms are not able to completely satisfy the requirements for sensory navigation device. To build a sensory navigation device with satisfying requirements for blind people, an ability of reducing the cost of model training and a capability of user-centric image recognition are the two main issues. Therefore, to address the above issues, we propose a novel approach, namely, DLSNF (Deep-Learning-based Sensory Navigation Framework). Our proposed DLSNF is built based on the YOLO architecture to deal with the reducing cost of model training and NVIDIA Jetson TX2 to take the user-centric image recognition into account. Based on our proposed DLSNF, the real-time image recognition can be trained well and conduct a sensory navigation to help blind people. At the same time, the train model is embedded in NVIDIA Jetson TX2 which is the fastest, most power-efficient embedded AI computing device. For the experiments, we evaluated our proposed DLSNF with a real-world dataset consisting of 4,570 images collected by part-time workers. The extensive experimental results show that our proposed DLSNF more effectively and efficiently beyond the existing baselines.},

Rather than using low-order descriptors, a multilayer feature generation model is created to obtain high-order feature representations for 3-D local patches through deep learning techniques. To handle cars with different levels of incompleteness caused by data acquisition ways and occlusions, a hierarchical visibility estimation model is developed to augment Hough voting. Considering scale and orientation variations in the azimuth direction, a set of multiscale Hough forests is constructed to rotationally cast votes to estimate cars' centroids. Quantitative assessments show that the proposed algorithm achieves average completeness, correctness, quality, and F1-measure of 0.94, 0.96, 0.90, and 0.95, respectively, in detecting 3-D cars. Comparative studies also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other four existing algorithms in accurately and completely detecting 3-D cars from large-scale 3-D point clouds.},

However, running data has the characteristics of multi-dimensional and long time series. It is difficult to process running data using traditional analysis methods, and the prediction accuracy is low. In response to this problem, this paper proposes an analysis method based on the Attention-LSTM model for injury prediction. In this model, LSTM uses the timing-related characteristics of the data for deep learning, which improves the long-term dependence of the RNN model, and adds an Attention mechanism to eliminate data redundancy and improve prediction accuracy. Take the athlete running training data set as an example, use the first 80% of the data set to train the model, and use the last 20% of the data set to test. The Attention-LSTM model and the RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM and Attention-BiLSTM models were used for experimental comparison. The results show that the MSE, RMSE, and MAE values predicted by the Attention-LSTM model are lower than the RNN and LSTM models, the R_Squred value is greater than the RNN and LSTM models, and the Attention-LSTM model calculation time is less than the BiLSTM and Attention-BiLSTM models. Comprehensively measuring the prediction effect and time cost factors, the Attention-LSTM model can effectively eliminate data redundancy, reduce prediction errors and improve prediction accuracy. It is suitable as a method for running data analysis.},

abstract={The purpose of the Multi-View Stereo is to restore the target 3D geometric model from multi-perspective images. There are several problems with the existing approaches based on deep learning, such as missing the detailed information in the predicted depth map, the low surface accuracy, and the incomplete reconstructed 3D point cloud model. In order to overcome these problems, we propose the Attention-guided Multiview Stereo Network For 3D Depth Estimation(AG-MVSNet). We combine the camera geometry with the deep neural network. And we adopt the coarse-to-fine deep learning framework to restore the target 3D geometry model. High-quality detailed feature information has an important influence on multi-view 3D reconstruction, and reference images in the natural environment contain detailed feature information which is needed in the reconstruction process. Therefore, we use the detailed feature information from different scales of reference images to restore the lost details of the high-level features. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more complete than the common multi-view 3D reconstruction algorithms.},

abstract={Women safety is a very important issue due to rising crimes against women these days. Presently there is indeed no good solution to this problem. The existing applications and devices are not much effective as they need lot of human interaction to operate. These existing devices use to read the human temperature and heartbeat to generate alarm in case of emergency. When a person runs, every human may have different body temperature and heartbeat pattern and thus keeping a fixed threshold for finding out emergency situation and then generating alarm is not correct way and this is where the existing devices are failing to correctly generate alarm in case of emergency. In this paper the devices are customized to learn the individual pattern of temperature and heartbeat and then it finds out the threshold for generating alarm. Thus this paper deals to design a wearable women safety device that automatically reads and create patterns such as body temperature and pulse rate during running. If readings are higher than the normal readings then it will automatically call and message more than one person along with the location so that actions can be taken. We have used temperature and pulse sensors that will detect the activity of the woman and that data of sensors will be sent to cloud where machine learning algorithm (logistic regression) is applied to analyse the data generated. The data is first collected by sensors in non-danger conditions to train the algorithm, after that data is used for testing to gauge the accuracy and how close it is to our trained data. More is the accuracy more is the surety of danger and the emergency alarm will be there on emergency contacts. Thirdly, this paper deals with scenarios where there is no internet facility. To overcome the problem of internet we have used ZigBee mesh network, which helped the device to send the data to multiple hop distance.},

abstract={large amount of digital data is being generated across a wide variety of fields and Data Mining (DM) techniques are used transform it into useful information so as to identify hidden patterns. One of the key areas of the application of Education Data Mining (EDM) is the development of student performance prediction models that would predict the student's performance in educational institutions. We build a model which can notify students (in introductory programming course) about their probable outcomes at an early stage of the semester (when evaluated for 15% grades). We applied 11 Machine Learning algorithms (from 5 categories) over a data source using WEKA and concluded that Decision Tree (J48) is giving higher accuracy in terms of correctly identified instances, F-Measure rate and true positive detections. This study will help to the students to identify their probable final grades and modify their academic behavior accordingly to achieve higher grades.},

abstract={Fires continue to occur all over the world, destroying cities, families, and -workplaces. The threat is even greater -when a fire breaks out in a high-rise building. This article presents a novel Internet of Things (IoT) architecture in order to improve fire safety in high-rise buildings.The proposed five-layered architecture facilitates secure evacuation and reduces the risk of asphyxiation as the main cause of death by fire. In addition, this IoT architecture calculates and locates the potential inhabitants stuck in the building and transmits the information to the rescue teams. A program is written in "Python 3" in order to examine the IOT architecture’s decision-making layer in the high-rise "La Marseillaise" in Marseilles, France. This program by using machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) succeeds in classifying the different zones of "La Marseillaise" according to the lethality of smoke with the accuracy of 98%. Based on this classification program sends the smart orders to the smoke extraction system to ventilate the in-danger zones further and thus reduce asphyxiation},
