ABSTRACT = {The exponential evolution of technology and the growth of the elderly population are two phenomena that will inevitably interact with increasing frequency in the future. This paper analyses scientific literature as a means of furthering progress in sustainable technology for senior living. We carried out a bibliometric analysis of papers published in this area and compiled by the Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus, examining the main participants and advances in the field from 2000 to the first quarter of 2021. The study describes some interesting research projects addressing three different aspects of older adults’ daily lives—health, daily activities and wellbeing—and policies to promote healthy aging and improve the sustainability of the healthcare system. It also looks at lines of research into transversal characteristics of technology. Our analysis showed that publications mentioning sustainability technologies for older adults have been growing progressively since the 2000s, but that the big increase in the number of research works in this area took place during the period 2016–2021. These more recent works show a tendency to study those factors that improve healthy aging, ensure the social inclusion of the elderly through technology and prolong the time in which they can live independent lives thanks to smart environments. Current research gaps in the literature are also discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical entity, with dynamic, bi-directional links between the physical entity and its corresponding twin in the digital domain. Digital twins are increasingly used today in different industry sectors. Applied to medicine and public health, digital twin technology can drive a much-needed radical transformation of traditional electronic health/medical records (focusing on individuals) and their aggregates (covering populations) to make them ready for a new era of precision (and accuracy) medicine and public health. Digital twins enable learning and discovering new knowledge, new hypothesis generation and testing, and in silico experiments and comparisons. They are poised to play a key role in formulating highly personalised treatments and interventions in the future. This paper provides an overview of the technology’s history and main concepts. A number of application examples of digital twins for personalised medicine, public health, and smart healthy cities are presented, followed by a brief discussion of the key technical and other challenges involved in such applications, including ethical issues that arise when digital twins are applied to model humans.},

ABSTRACT = {High resolution air quality models combining emissions, chemical processes, dispersion and dynamical treatments are necessary to develop effective policies for clean air in urban environments, but can have high computational demand. We demonstrate the application of task farming to reduce runtime for ADMS-Urban, a quasi-Gaussian plume air dispersion model. The model represents the full range of source types (point, road and grid sources) occurring in an urban area at high resolution. Here, we implement and evaluate the option to automatically split up a large model domain into smaller sub-regions, each of which can then be executed concurrently on multiple cores of a HPC or across a PC network, a technique known as task farming. The approach has been tested for a large model domain covering the West Midlands, UK (902 km2), as part of modelling work in the WM-Air (West Midlands Air Quality Improvement Programme) project. Compared to the measurement data, overall, the model performs well. Air quality maps for annual/subset averages and percentiles are generated. For this air quality modelling application of task farming, the optimisation process has reduced weeks of model execution time to approximately 35 h for a single model configuration of annual calculations.},

ABSTRACT = {The revolutionary idea of the internet of things (IoT) architecture has gained enormous popularity over the last decade, resulting in an exponential growth in the IoT networks, connected devices, and the data processed therein. Since IoT devices generate and exchange sensitive data over the traditional internet, security has become a prime concern due to the generation of zero-day cyberattacks. A network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) can provide the much-needed efficient security solution to the IoT network by protecting the network entry points through constant network traffic monitoring. Recent NIDS have a high false alarm rate (FAR) in detecting the anomalies, including the novel and zero-day anomalies. This paper proposes an efficient anomaly detection mechanism using mutual information (MI), considering a deep neural network (DNN) for an IoT network. A comparative analysis of different deep-learning models such as DNN, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and its different variants, such as Gated Recurrent Unit and Long Short-term Memory is performed considering the IoT-Botnet 2020 dataset. Experimental results show the improvement of 0.57–2.6% in terms of the model’s accuracy, while at the same time reducing the FAR by 0.23–7.98% to show the effectiveness of the DNN-based NIDS model compared to the well-known deep learning models. It was also observed that using only the 16–35 best numerical features selected using MI instead of 80 features of the dataset result in almost negligible degradation in the model’s performance but helped in decreasing the overall model’s complexity. In addition, the overall accuracy of the DL-based models is further improved by almost 0.99–3.45% in terms of the detection accuracy considering only the top five categorical and numerical features.},

ABSTRACT = {From the end of 2019, the world has been facing the threat of COVID-19. It is predicted that, before herd immunity is achieved globally via vaccination, people around the world will have to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic using precautionary steps. This paper suggests a COVID-19 identification and control system that operates in real-time. The proposed system utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) platform to capture users’ time-sensitive symptom information to detect potential cases of coronaviruses early on, to track the clinical measures adopted by survivors, and to gather and examine appropriate data to verify the existence of the virus. There are five key components in the framework: symptom data collection and uploading (via communication technology), a quarantine/isolation center, an information processing core (using artificial intelligent techniques), cloud computing, and visualization to healthcare doctors. This research utilizes eight machine/deep learning techniques—Neural Network, Decision Table, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, OneR, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), Dense Neural Network (DNN), and the Long Short-Term Memory technique—to detect coronavirus cases from time-sensitive information. A simulation was performed to verify the eight algorithms, after selecting the relevant symptoms, on real-world COVID-19 data values. The results showed that five of these eight algorithms obtained an accuracy of over 90%. Conclusively, it is shown that real-world symptomatic information would enable these three algorithms to identify potential COVID-19 cases effectively with enhanced accuracy. Additionally, the framework presents responses to treatment for COVID-19 patients.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things has become a cutting-edge technology that is continuously evolving in size, connectivity, and applicability. This ecosystem makes its presence felt in every aspect of our lives, along with all other emerging technologies. Unfortunately, despite the significant benefits brought by the IoT, the increased attack surface built upon it has become more critical than ever. Devices have limited resources and are not typically created with security features. Lately, a trend of botnet threats transitioning to the IoT environment has been observed, and an army of infected IoT devices can expand quickly and be used for effective attacks. Therefore, identifying proper solutions for securing IoT systems is currently an important and challenging research topic. Machine learning-based approaches are a promising alternative, allowing the identification of abnormal behaviors and the detection of attacks. This paper proposes an anomaly-based detection solution that uses unsupervised deep learning techniques to identify IoT botnet activities. An empirical evaluation of the proposed method is conducted on both balanced and unbalanced datasets to assess its threat detection capability. False-positive rate reduction and its impact on the detection system are also analyzed. Furthermore, a comparison with other unsupervised learning approaches is included. The experimental results reveal the performance of the proposed detection method.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, many scholars have dedicated their research to the development of low-cost sensors for monitoring of various parameters. Despite their high number of applications, the state of the art related to low-cost sensors in building monitoring has not been addressed. To fill this gap, this article presents a systematic review, following well-established methodology, to analyze the state of the art in two aspects of structural and indoor parameters of buildings, in the SCOPUS database. This analysis allows to illustrate the potential uses of low-cost sensors in the building sector and addresses the scholars the preferred communication protocols and the most common microcontrollers for installation of low-cost monitoring systems. In addition, special attention is paid to describe different areas of the two mentioned fields of building monitoring and the most crucial parameters to be monitored in buildings. Finally, the deficiencies in line with limited number of studies carried out in various fields of building monitoring are overviewed and a series of parameters that ought to be studied in the future are proposed.},

ABSTRACT = {A reflectarray antenna with an optimized sectorial beam is designed for the surveillance channel of a DVB-S-based passive radar (PR). The employment of satellite illuminators requires a high gain antenna to counteract the losses due to the great distance from the transmitter, but without forgetting a beamwidth wide enough to provide angular coverage. A method based on optimizing the position of several contiguous beams is proposed to achieve the required sectorial pattern. Different reflectarray elements are designed to achieve S-curves with smooth slopes and covering all the required phases (the S-curve represents the reflection phase of a single element, as a function of size, rotation and incidence angle). The real phase and modulus of the reflection coefficient of each element are considered in the optimization process to achieve the best real prototype. Geometry has been studied and adapted to employ commercial elements for the feed, feed-arm and the structure that holds the aperture. The designed prototype has been characterized in an anechoic chamber achieving a stable gain greater than 19 dBi in almost the complete DVB-S band, from 10.5 GHz to 12 GHz with a sectorial beam of 8.7∘×5.2∘. The prototype has also been validated in PR trials in terrestrial scenarios allowing the detection of cars at distances up to 600 m away from the PR, improving the performance achieved with commercial parabolic dish antennas.},

ABSTRACT = {Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operators have been integrated in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification through the OWA layer. This layer lets the CNN integrate global information about the image in the early stages, where most CNN architectures only allow for the exploitation of local information. As a side effect of this integration, the OWA layer becomes a practical method for the determination of OWA operator weights, which is usually a difficult task that complicates the integration of these operators in other fields. In this paper, we explore the weights learned for the OWA operators inside the OWA layer, characterizing them through their basic properties of orness and dispersion. We also compare them to some families of OWA operators, namely the Binomial OWA operator, the Stancu OWA operator and the exponential RIM OWA operator, finding examples that are currently impossible to generalize through these parameterizations.},

ABSTRACT = {A successful application of low-cost 3D cameras in combination with artificial intelligence (AI)-based 3D object detection algorithms to outdoor mobile mapping would offer great potential for numerous mapping, asset inventory, and change detection tasks in the context of smart cities. This paper presents a mobile mapping system mounted on an electric tricycle and a procedure for creating on-street parking statistics, which allow government agencies and policy makers to verify and adjust parking policies in different city districts. Our method combines georeferenced red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) imagery from two low-cost 3D cameras with state-of-the-art 3D object detection algorithms for extracting and mapping parked vehicles. Our investigations demonstrate the suitability of the latest generation of low-cost 3D cameras for real-world outdoor applications with respect to supported ranges, depth measurement accuracy, and robustness under varying lighting conditions. In an evaluation of suitable algorithms for detecting vehicles in the noisy and often incomplete 3D point clouds from RGB-D cameras, the 3D object detection network PointRCNN, which extends region-based convolutional neural networks (R-CNNs) to 3D point clouds, clearly outperformed all other candidates. The results of a mapping mission with 313 parking spaces show that our method is capable of reliably detecting parked cars with a precision of 100% and a recall of 97%. It can be applied to unslotted and slotted parking and different parking types including parallel, perpendicular, and angle parking.},

ABSTRACT = {The recent advances in computing technologies and the increasing availability of large amounts of data in smart grids and smart cities are generating new research opportunities in the application of Machine Learning (ML) for improving the observability and efficiency of modern power grids. However, as the number and diversity of ML techniques increase, questions arise about their performance and applicability, and on the most suitable ML method depending on the specific application. Trying to answer these questions, this manuscript presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art studies implementing ML techniques in the context of power systems, with a specific focus on the analysis of power flows, power quality, photovoltaic systems, intelligent transportation, and load forecasting. The survey investigates, for each of the selected topics, the most recent and promising ML techniques proposed by the literature, by highlighting their main characteristics and relevant results. The review revealed that, when compared to traditional approaches, ML algorithms can handle massive quantities of data with high dimensionality, by allowing the identification of hidden characteristics of (even) complex systems. In particular, even though very different techniques can be used for each application, hybrid models generally show better performances when compared to single ML-based models.},

ABSTRACT = {High costs for the repair of concrete structures can be prevented if damage at an early stage of degradation is detected and precautionary maintenance measures are applied. To this end, we use numerical wave propagation simulations to identify simulated damage in concrete using convolutional neural networks. Damage in concrete subjected to compression is modeled at the mesoscale using the discrete element method. Ultrasonic wave propagation simulation on the damaged concrete specimens is performed using the rotated staggered finite-difference grid method. The simulated ultrasonic signals are used to train a CNN-based classifier capable of classifying three different damage stages (microcrack initiation, microcrack growth and microcrack coalescence leading to macrocracks) with an overall accuracy of 77%. The performance of the classifier is improved by refining the dataset via an analysis of the averaged envelope of the signal. The classifier using the refined dataset has an overall accuracy of 90%.},

ABSTRACT = {The detection of building footprints and road networks has many useful applications including the monitoring of urban development, real-time navigation, etc. Taking into account that a great deal of human attention is required by these remote sensing tasks, a lot of effort has been made to automate them. However, the vast majority of the approaches rely on very high-resolution satellite imagery (&lt;2.5 m) whose costs are not yet affordable for maintaining up-to-date maps. Working with the limited spatial resolution provided by high-resolution satellite imagery such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) makes it hard to detect buildings and roads, since these labels may coexist within the same pixel. This paper focuses on this problem and presents a novel methodology capable of detecting building and roads with sub-pixel width by increasing the resolution of the output masks. This methodology consists of fusing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data (at 10 m) together with OpenStreetMap to train deep learning models for building and road detection at 2.5 m. This becomes possible thanks to the usage of OpenStreetMap vector data, which can be rasterized to any desired resolution. Accordingly, a few simple yet effective modifications of the U-Net architecture are proposed to not only semantically segment the input image, but also to learn how to enhance the resolution of the output masks. As a result, generated mappings quadruplicate the input spatial resolution, closing the gap between satellite and aerial imagery for building and road detection. To properly evaluate the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology, a data-set composed of 44 cities across the Spanish territory have been considered and divided into training and testing cities. Both quantitative and qualitative results show that high-resolution satellite imagery can be used for sub-pixel width building and road detection following the proper methodology.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last few decades, agriculture has played an important role in the worldwide economy. The need to produce more food for a rapidly growing population is creating pressure on crop and animal production and a negative impact to the environment. On the other hand, smart farming technologies are becoming increasingly common in modern agriculture to assist in optimizing agricultural and livestock production and minimizing the wastes and costs. Precision agriculture (PA) is a technology-enabled, data-driven approach to farming management that observes, measures, and analyzes the needs of individual fields and crops. Precision livestock farming (PLF), relying on the automatic monitoring of individual animals, is used for animal growth, milk production, and the detection of diseases as well as to monitor animal behavior and their physical environment, among others. This study aims to briefly review recent scientific and technological trends in PA and their application in crop and livestock farming, serving as a simple research guide for the researcher and farmer in the application of technology to agriculture. The development and operation of PA applications involve several steps and techniques that need to be investigated further to make the developed systems accurate and implementable in commercial environments.},

ABSTRACT = {The unique art that was developed in Byzantine times is widely accepted as a precursor to the Renaissance and is still evident in monuments either from or influenced by the Byzantium. Visiting such a site is a unique experience due to the lavishly painted interior for both tourists and scholars. Taking advantage of the emerging 5G technologies, cloud/fog computing, and Augmented/Mixed Reality mechanisms, a common smart device (e.g., smartphone, tablet) could be employed to give a better experience to the end-users. The proposed framework is intended to provide visitors with interpretative information regarding the visited monuments and their paintings. Under the framework introduced in this paper, camera input is uploaded to a cloud/fog computing infrastructure where appropriate algorithms and services provide monument and painting recognition and the mobile application retrieves and projects the related information. In addition, the designed immersive user interfaces assist visitors in contributing in cases of monuments and paintings for which no available information exists. This paper presents the state of the art in approaches for immersive experiences in Digital Culture, reviews the current image recognition approaches and their suitability for Byzantine paintings, proposes interaction techniques appropriately designed for observation and interaction of paintings, and discusses the overall framework architecture that is needed to support the described functionality while stressing the challenging issues of the above aspects thus paving the road for future work and providing guidelines for a test-bed implementation.},

ABSTRACT = {Critical infrastructures (e.g., energy and transportation systems) are essential lifelines for most modern sectors and have utmost significance in our daily lives. However, these important domains can fail to operate due to system failures or natural disasters. Though the major disturbances in such critical infrastructures are rare, the severity of such events calls for the development of effective resilience assessment strategies to mitigate relative losses. Traditional critical infrastructure resilience approaches consider that the available critical infrastructure agents are resource-sufficient and agree to exchange local data with the server and other agents. Such assumptions create two issues: (1) uncertainty in reaching convergence while applying learning strategies on resource-constrained critical infrastructure agents, and (2) a huge risk of privacy leakage. By understanding the pressing need to construct an effective resilience model for resource-constrained critical infrastructure, this paper aims at leveraging a distributed machine learning technique called Federated Learning (FL) to tackle an agent’s resource limitations effectively and at the same time keep the agent’s information private. Particularly, this paper is focused on predicting the probable outage and resource status of critical infrastructure agents without sharing any local data and carrying out the learning process even when most of the agents are incapable of accomplishing a given computational task. To that end, an FL algorithm is designed specifically for a resource-constrained critical infrastructure environment that could facilitate the training of each agent in a distributed fashion, restrict them from sharing their raw data with any other external entities (e.g., server, neighbor agents), choose proficient clients by analyzing their resources, and allow a partial amount of computation tasks to be performed by the resource-constrained agents. We considered a different number of agents with various stragglers and checked the performance of FedAvg and our proposed FedResilience algorithm with prediction tasks for a probable outage, as well as checking the agents’ resource-sharing scope. Our simulation results show that if the majority of the FL agents are stragglers and we drop them from the training process, then the agents learn very slowly and the overall model performance is negatively affected. We also demonstrate that the selection of proficient agents and allowing them to complete only parts of their tasks can significantly improve the knowledge of each agent by eliminating the straggler effects, and the global model convergence is accelerated.},

ABSTRACT = {Short-term electric load forecasting plays a significant role in the safe and stable operation of the power system and power market transactions. In recent years, with the development of new energy sources, more and more sources have been integrated into the grid. This has posed a serious challenge to short-term electric load forecasting. Focusing on load series with non-linear and time-varying characteristics, an approach to short-term electric load forecasting using a “decomposition and ensemble” framework is proposed in this paper. The method is verified using hourly load data from Oslo and the surrounding areas of Norway. First, the load series is decomposed into five components by variational mode decomposition (VMD). Second, a support vector regression (SVR) forecasting model is established for the five components to predict the electric load components, and the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is used to optimize the cost and gamma parameters of SVR. Finally, the predicted values of the five components are superimposed to obtain the final electric load forecasting results. In this paper, the proposed method is compared with GWO-SVR without modal decomposition and using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to test the impact of VMD on prediction. This paper also compares the proposed method with the SVR model using VMD and other optimization algorithms. The four evaluation indexes of the proposed method are optimal: MAE is 71.65 MW, MAPE is 1.41%, MSE is 10,461.32, and R2 is 0.9834. This indicates that the proposed method has a good application prospect for short-term electric load forecasting.},

ABSTRACT = {Studying population prediction under micro-spatiotemporal granularity is of great significance for modern and refined urban traffic management and emergency response to disasters. Existing population studies are mostly based on census and statistical yearbook data due to the limitation of data collecting methods. However, with the advent of techniques in this information age, new emerging data sources with fine granularity and large sample sizes have provided rich materials and unique venues for population research. This article presents a new population prediction model with micro-spatiotemporal granularity based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) and cellular automata (CA) models. We aim at designing a hybrid data-driven model with good adaptability and scalability, which can be used in more refined population prediction. We not only try to integrate these two models, aiming to fully mine the spatiotemporal characteristics, but also propose a method that fuses multi-source geographic data. We tested its functionality using the data from Chongming District, Shanghai, China. The results demonstrated that, among all scenarios, the model trained by three consecutive days (ordinary dates), with the granularity of one hour, incorporated with road networks, achieves the best performance (0.905 as the mean absolute error) and generalization capability.},

ABSTRACT = {Cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are generally considered to be the next generation of engineered systems. However, the actual application of CPSs in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is still at a low level. The sensing method in the construction process plays a very important role in the establishment of CPSs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the application potential of computer vision-based sensing methods and provide practical suggestions through a literature review. This paper provides a review of the current application of CPSs in the AEC industry, summarizes the current knowledge gaps, and discusses the problems with the current construction site sensing approach. Considering the unique advantages of the computer vision (CV) method at the construction site, the application of CV for different construction entities was reviewed and summarized to achieve a CV-based construction site sensing approach for construction process CPSs. The potential of CPS can be further stimulated by providing rich information from on-site sensing using CV methods. According to the review, this approach has unique advantages in the specific environment of the construction site. Based on the current knowledge gap identified in the literature review, this paper proposes a novel concept of visual-based construction site sensing method for CPS application, and an architecture for CV-based CPS is proposed as an implementation of this concept. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a CPS architecture using computer vision as the main information acquisition method based on the literature review. This architecture innovatively introduces computer vision as a sensing method of construction sites, and realizes low-cost and non-invasive information acquisition in complex construction scenarios. This method can be used as an important supplement to on-site sensing to further promote the automation and intelligence of the construction process.},

ABSTRACT = {An accurate understanding of urban objects is critical for urban modeling, intelligent infrastructure planning and city management. The semantic segmentation of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds is a fundamental approach for urban scene analysis. Over the last years, several methods have been developed to segment urban furniture with point clouds. However, the traditional processing of large amounts of spatial data has become increasingly costly, both time-wise and financially. Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have been increasingly used for 3D segmentation tasks. Yet, most of these deep neural networks (DNNs) were conducted on benchmarks. It is, therefore, arguable whether DL approaches can achieve the state-of-the-art performance of 3D point clouds segmentation in real-life scenarios. In this research, we apply an adapted DNN (ARandLA-Net) to directly process large-scale point clouds. In particular, we develop a new paradigm for training and validation, which presents a typical urban scene in central Europe (Munzingen, Freiburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany). Our dataset consists of nearly 390 million dense points acquired by Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS), which has a rather larger quantity of sample points in comparison to existing datasets and includes meaningful object categories that are particular to applications for smart cities and urban planning. We further assess the DNN on our dataset and investigate a number of key challenges from varying aspects, such as data preparation strategies, the advantage of color information and the unbalanced class distribution in the real world. The final segmentation model achieved a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) score of 54.4% and an overall accuracy score of 83.9%. Our experiments indicated that different data preparation strategies influenced the model performance. Additional RGB information yielded an approximately 4% higher mIoU score. Our results also demonstrate that the use of weighted cross-entropy with inverse square root frequency loss led to better segmentation performance than when other losses were considered.},

ABSTRACT = {Disasters pose a real threat to the lives and property of citizens; therefore, it is necessary to reduce their impact to the minimum possible. In order to achieve this goal, a framework for enhancing the current disaster management system was proposed, called the smart disaster management system. The smart aspect of this system is due to the application of the principles of information and communication technology, especially the Internet of Things. All participants and activities of the proposed system were clarified by preparing a conceptual design by using The Unified Modeling Language diagrams. This effort was made to overcome the lack of citizens’ readiness towards the use of information and communication technology as well as increase their readiness towards disasters. This study aims to develop conceptual design that can facilitate in development of smart management system for flooding disaster. This will assist in the design process of the Internet of Things systems in this regard.},

ABSTRACT = {The shift to e-commerce has changed many business areas. Real estate is one of the applications that has been affected by this modern technological wave. Recommender systems are intelligent models that assist users of real estate platforms in finding the best possible properties that fulfill their needs. However, the recommendation task is substantially more challenging in the real estate domain due to the many domain-specific limitations that impair typical recommender systems. For instance, real estate recommender systems usually face the clod-start problem where there are no historical logs for new users or new items, and the recommender system should provide recommendations for these new entities. Therefore, the recommender systems in the real estate market are different and substantially less studied than in other domains. In this article, we aim at providing a comprehensive and systematic literature review on applications of recommender systems in the real estate market. We evaluate a set of research articles (13 journal and 13 conference papers) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the field of real estate recommender systems. These papers have been reviewed and categorized based on their methodological approaches, the main challenges that they addressed, and their evaluation procedures. Based on these categorizations, we outlined some possible directions for future research.},

ABSTRACT = {The COVID-19 pandemic has been a worldwide catastrophe. Its impact, not only economically, but also socially and in terms of human lives, was unexpected. Each of the many mechanisms to fight the contagiousness of the illness has been proven to be extremely important. One of the most important mechanisms is the use of facemasks. However, the wearing the facemasks incorrectly makes this prevention method useless. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and especially facial recognition techniques can be used to detect misuses and reduce virus transmission, especially indoors. In this paper, we present an intelligent method to automatically detect when facemasks are being worn incorrectly in real-time scenarios. Our proposal uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with transfer learning to detect not only if a mask is used or not, but also other errors that are usually not taken into account but that may contribute to the virus spreading. The main problem that we have detected is that there is currently no training set for this task. It is for this reason that we have requested the participation of citizens by taking different selfies through an app and placing the mask in different positions. Thus, we have been able to solve this problem. The results show that the accuracy achieved with transfer learning slightly improves the accuracy achieved with convolutional neural networks. Finally, we have also developed an Android-app demo that validates the proposal in real scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) workflow applications have been rapidly growing in practice. These internet-based applications can run on the distributed healthcare sensing system, which combines mobile computing, edge computing and cloud computing. Offloading and scheduling are the required methods in the distributed network. However, a security issue exists and it is hard to run different types of tasks (e.g., security, delay-sensitive, and delay-tolerant tasks) of IoMT applications on heterogeneous computing nodes. This work proposes a new healthcare architecture for workflow applications based on heterogeneous computing nodes layers: an application layer, management layer, and resource layer. The goal is to minimize the makespan of all applications. Based on these layers, the work proposes a secure offloading-efficient task scheduling (SEOS) algorithm framework, which includes the deadline division method, task sequencing rules, homomorphic security scheme, initial scheduling, and the variable neighbourhood searching method. The performance evaluation results show that the proposed plans outperform all existing baseline approaches for healthcare applications in terms of makespan.},

ABSTRACT = {Blockage of culverts by transported debris materials is reported as the salient contributor in originating urban flash floods. Conventional hydraulic modeling approaches had no success in addressing the problem primarily because of the unavailability of peak floods hydraulic data and the highly non-linear behavior of debris at the culvert. This article explores a new dimension to investigate the issue by proposing the use of intelligent video analytics (IVA) algorithms for extracting blockage related information. The presented research aims to automate the process of manual visual blockage classification of culverts from a maintenance perspective by remotely applying deep learning models. The potential of using existing convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms (i.e., DarkNet53, DenseNet121, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MobileNet, ResNet50, VGG16, EfficientNetB3, NASNet) is investigated over a dataset from three different sources (i.e., images of culvert openings and blockage (ICOB), visual hydrology-lab dataset (VHD), synthetic images of culverts (SIC)) to predict the blockage in a given image. Models were evaluated based on their performance on the test dataset (i.e., accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1 score, Jaccard Index, region of convergence (ROC) curve), floating point operations per second (FLOPs) and response times to process a single test instance. Furthermore, the performance of deep learning models was benchmarked against conventional machine learning algorithms (i.e., SVM, RF, xgboost). In addition, the idea of classifying deep visual features extracted by CNN models (i.e., ResNet50, MobileNet) using conventional machine learning approaches was also implemented in this article. From the results, NASNet was reported most efficient in classifying the blockage images with the 5-fold accuracy of 85%; however, MobileNet was recommended for the hardware implementation because of its improved response time with 5-fold accuracy comparable to NASNet (i.e., 78%). Comparable performance to standard CNN models was achieved for the case where deep visual features were classified using conventional machine learning approaches. False negative (FN) instances, false positive (FP) instances and CNN layers activation suggested that background noise and oversimplified labelling criteria were two contributing factors in the degraded performance of existing CNN algorithms. A framework for partial automation of the visual blockage classification process was proposed, given that none of the existing models was able to achieve high enough accuracy to completely automate the manual process. In addition, a detection-classification pipeline with higher blockage classification accuracy (i.e., 94%) has been proposed as a potential future direction for practical implementation.},

ABSTRACT = {With the exponential growth of science, Internet of Things (IoT) innovation, and expanding significance in renewable energy, Smart Grid has become an advanced innovative thought universally as a solution for the power demand increase around the world. The smart grid is the most practical trend of effective transmission of present-day power assets. The paper aims to survey the present literature concerning predictive maintenance and different types of faults that could be detected within the smart grid. Four databases (Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science) were searched between 2012 and 2020. Sixty-five (n = 65) were chosen based on specified exclusion and inclusion criteria. Fifty-seven percent (n = 37/65) of the studies analyzed the issues from predictive maintenance perspectives, while about 18% (n = 12/65) focused on factors-related review studies on the smart grid and about 15% (n = 10/65) focused on factors related to the experimental study. The remaining 9% (n = 6/65) concentrated on fields related to the challenges and benefits of the study. The significance of predictive maintenance has been developing over time in connection with Industry 4.0 revolution. The paper’s fundamental commitment is the outline and overview of faults in the smart grid such as fault location and detection. Therefore, advanced methods of applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques can enhance and improve the reliability and resilience of smart grid systems. For future direction, we aim to supply a deep understanding of Smart meters to detect or monitor faults in the smart grid as it is the primary IoT sensor in an AMI.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent technological advancements in geomatics and mobile sensing have led to various urban big data, such as Tencent street view (TSV) photographs; yet, the urban objects in the big dataset have hitherto been inadequately exploited. This paper aims to propose a pedestrian analytics approach named vectors of uncountable and countable objects for clustering and analysis (VUCCA) for processing 530,000 TSV photographs of Hong Kong Island. First, VUCCA transductively adopts two pre-trained deep models to TSV photographs for extracting pedestrians and surrounding pixels into generalizable semantic vectors of features, including uncountable objects such as vegetation, sky, paved pedestrian path, and guardrail and countable objects such as cars, trucks, pedestrians, city animals, and traffic lights. Then, the extracted pedestrians are semantically clustered using the vectors, e.g., for understanding where they usually stand. Third, pedestrians are semantically indexed using relations and activities (e.g., walking behind a guardrail, road-crossing, carrying a backpack, or walking a pet) for queries of unstructured photographic instances or natural language clauses. The experiment results showed that the pedestrians detected in the TSV photographs were successfully clustered into meaningful groups and indexed by the semantic vectors. The presented VUCCA can enrich eye-level urban features into computational semantic vectors for pedestrians to enable smart city research in urban geography, urban planning, real estate, transportation, conservation, and other disciplines.},

ABSTRACT = {Many smart city and society applications such as smart health (elderly care, medical applications), smart surveillance, sports, and robotics require the recognition of user activities, an important class of problems known as human activity recognition (HAR). Several issues have hindered progress in HAR research, particularly due to the emergence of fog and edge computing, which brings many new opportunities (a low latency, dynamic and real-time decision making, etc.) but comes with its challenges. This paper focuses on addressing two important research gaps in HAR research: (i) improving the HAR prediction accuracy and (ii) managing the frequent changes in the environment and data related to user activities. To address this, we propose an HAR method based on Soft-Voting and Self-Learning (SVSL). SVSL uses two strategies. First, to enhance accuracy, it combines the capabilities of Deep Learning (DL), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and AdaBoost classifiers using soft-voting. Second, to classify the most challenging data instances, the SVSL method is equipped with a self-training mechanism that generates training data and retrains itself. We investigate the performance of our proposed SVSL method using two publicly available datasets on six human activities related to lying, sitting, and walking positions. The first dataset consists of 562 features and the second dataset consists of five features. The data are collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope smartphone sensors. The results show that the proposed method provides 6.26%, 1.75%, 1.51%, and 4.40% better prediction accuracy (average over the two datasets) compared to GLM, DL, RF, and AdaBoost, respectively. We also analyze and compare the class-wise performance of the SVSL methods with that of DL, GLM, RF, and AdaBoost.},

ABSTRACT = {Address is a structured description used to identify a specific place or point of interest, and it provides an effective way to locate people or objects. The standardization of Chinese place name and address occupies an important position in the construction of a smart city. Traditional address specification technology often adopts methods based on text similarity or rule bases, which cannot handle complex, missing, and redundant address information well. This paper transforms the task of address standardization into calculating the similarity of address pairs, and proposes a contrast learning address matching model based on the attention-Bi-LSTM-CNN network (ABLC). First of all, ABLC use the Trie syntax tree algorithm to extract Chinese address elements. Next, based on the basic idea of contrast learning, a hybrid neural network is applied to learn the semantic information in the address. Finally, Manhattan distance is calculated as the similarity of the two addresses. Experiments on the self-constructed dataset with data augmentation demonstrate that the proposed model has better stability and performance compared with other baselines.},

ABSTRACT = {The problem of structural imbalance in terms of supply and demand due to changes in traffic patterns by time zone has been continuously raised in the mobility market. In Korea, unlike large overseas cities, the waiting time tolerance increases during the daytime when supply far exceeds demand, resulting in a large loss of operating profit. The purpose of this study is to increase taxi demand and further improve driver’s profits through real-time fare discounts during off-peak daytime hours in Seoul, Korea. To this end, we propose a real-time fare bidding system among taxi drivers based on a dynamic pricing scheme and simulate the appropriate fare discount level for each regional time zone. The driver-to-driver fare competition system consists of simulating fare competition based on the multi-agent Deep Q-Network method after developing a fare discount index that reflects the supply and demand level of each region in 25 districts in Seoul. According to the optimal fare discount level analysis in the off-peak hours, the lower the OI Index, which means the level of demand relative to supply, the higher the fare discount rate. In addition, an analysis of drivers’ profits and matching rates according to the distance between the origin and destination of each region showed up to 89% and 65% of drivers who actively offered discounts on fares. The results of this study in the future can serve as the foundation of a fare adjustment system for varying demand and supply situations in the Korean mobility market.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial intelligence applications in fire safety of agricultural structures have practical economic and technological benefits on commercial agriculture. The FAO estimates that wildfires result in at least USD 1 billion in agriculture-related losses due to the destruction of livestock pasture, destruction of agricultural buildings, premature death of farm animals, and general disruption of agricultural activities. Even though artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs), probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference systems (ANFISs), among others, have proven useful in fire prevention, their application is limited in real farm environments. Most farms rely on traditional/non-technology-based methods of fire prevention. The case for AI in agricultural fire prevention is grounded on the accuracy and reliability of computer simulations in smoke movement analysis, risk assessment, and postfire analysis. In addition, such technologies can be coupled with next-generation fire-retardant materials such as intumescent coatings with a polymer binder, blowing agent, carbon donor, and acid donor. Future prospects for AI in agriculture transcend basic fire safety to encompass Society 5.0, energy systems in smart cities, UAV monitoring, Agriculture 4.0, and decentralized energy. However, critical challenges must be overcome, including the health and safety aspects, cost, and reliability. In brief, AI offers unlimited potential in the prevention of fire hazards in farms, but the existing body of knowledge is inadequate.},

ABSTRACT = {The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) data represent a source of information in real time not only about electricity consumption but also as an indicator of other social, demographic, and economic dynamics within a city. This paper presents a Data Analytics/Big Data framework applied to AMI data as a tool to leverage the potential of this data within the applications in a Smart City. The framework includes three fundamental aspects. First, the architectural view places AMI within the Smart Grids Architecture Model-SGAM. Second, the methodological view describes the transformation of raw data into knowledge represented by the DIKW hierarchy and the NIST Big Data interoperability model. Finally, a binding element between the two views is represented by human expertise and skills to obtain a deeper understanding of the results and transform knowledge into wisdom. Our new view faces the challenges arriving in energy markets by adding a binding element that gives support for optimal and efficient decision-making. To show how our framework works, we developed a case study. The case implements each component of the framework for a load forecasting application in a Colombian Retail Electricity Provider (REP). The MAPE for some of the REP’s markets was less than 5%. In addition, the case shows the effect of the binding element as it raises new development alternatives and becomes a feedback mechanism for more assertive decision making.},

ABSTRACT = {This research focuses on a photovoltaic system that powers an Electric Vehicle when moving in realistic scenarios with partial shading conditions. The main goal is to find an efficient control scheme to allow the solar generator producing the maximum amount of power achievable. The first contribution of this paper is the mathematical modelling of the photovoltaic system, its function and its features, considering the synthesis of the step-up converter and the maximum power point tracking analysis. This research looks at two intelligent control strategies to get the most power out, even with shading areas. Specifically, we show how to apply two evolutionary algorithms for this control. They are the “particle swarm optimization method” and the “grey wolf optimization method”. These algorithms were tested and evaluated when a battery storage system in an Electric Vehicle is fed through a photovoltaic system. The Simulink/Matlab tool is used to execute the simulation phases and to quantify the performances of each of these control systems. Based on our simulation tests, the best method is identified.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart city is a collective term for technologies and concepts that are directed toward making cities efficient, technologically more advanced, greener and more socially inclusive. These concepts include technical, economic and social innovations. This term has been tossed around by various actors in politics, business, administration and urban planning since the 2000s to establish tech-based changes and innovations in urban areas. The idea of the smart city is used in conjunction with the utilization of digital technologies and at the same time represents a reaction to the economic, social and political challenges that post-industrial societies are confronted with at the start of the new millennium. The key focus is on dealing with challenges faced by urban society, such as environmental pollution, demographic change, population growth, healthcare, the financial crisis or scarcity of resources. In a broader sense, the term also includes non-technical innovations that make urban life more sustainable. So far, the idea of using IoT-based sensor networks for healthcare applications is a promising one with the potential of minimizing inefficiencies in the existing infrastructure. A machine learning approach is key to successful implementation of the IoT-powered wireless sensor networks for this purpose since there is large amount of data to be handled intelligently. Throughout this paper, it will be discussed in detail how AI-powered IoT and WSNs are applied in the healthcare sector. This research will be a baseline study for understanding the role of the IoT in smart cities, in particular in the healthcare sector, for future research works.},

ABSTRACT = {The epidemic disease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) called COVID-19 has become a more frequently active disease. Managing and monitoring COVID-19 patients is still a challenging issue for advanced technologies. The first and foremost critical issue in COVID-19 is to diagnose it timely and cut off the chain of transmission by isolating the susceptible and patients. COVID-19 spreads through close interaction and contact with an infected person. It has affected the entire world, and every country is facing the challenges of having adequate medical facilities along with the availability of medical staff in rural and urban areas that have a high number of patients due to the pandemic. Due to the invasive method of treatment, SARS-COVID is spreading swiftly. In this paper, we propose an intelligent health monitoring framework using wearable Internet of Things (IoT) and Geo-fencing for COVID-19 susceptible and patient monitoring, and isolation and quarantine management to control the pandemic. The proposed system consists of four layers, and each layer has different functionality: a wearable sensors layer, IoT gateway layer, cloud server layer, and client application layer for visualization and analysis. The wearable sensors layer consists of wearable biomedical and GPS sensors for physiological parameters, and GPS and Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator acquisition for health monitoring and user Geo-fencing. The IoT gateway layer provides a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi based wireless body area network and IoT environment for data transmission anytime and anywhere. Cloud servers use Raspberry Pi and ThingSpeak cloud for data analysis and web-based application layers for remote monitoring based on user consent. The susceptible and patient conditions, real-time sensor’s data, and Geo-fencing enables minimizing the spread through close interaction. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

ABSTRACT = {Using reinforcement learning technologies to learn offloading strategies for multi-access edge computing systems has been developed by researchers. However, large-scale systems are unsuitable for reinforcement learning, due to their huge state spaces and offloading behaviors. For this reason, this work introduces the centralized training and decentralized execution mechanism, designing a decentralized reinforcement learning model for multi-access edge computing systems. Considering a cloud server and several edge servers, we separate the training and execution in the reinforcement learning model. The execution happens in edge devices of the system, and edge servers need no communication. Conversely, the training process occurs at the cloud device, which causes a lower transmission latency. The developed method uses a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to optimize offloading strategies. The simulated experiment shows that our method can learn the offloading strategy for each edge device efficiently.},

ABSTRACT = {Internet of Things (IoT) can help to pave the way to the circular economy and to a more sustainable world by enabling the digitalization of many operations and processes, such as water distribution, preventive maintenance, or smart manufacturing. Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries. Overall, this article provides guidelines that will help future developers to face the challenges that will arise when creating the next generation of Edge-AI G-IoT systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In the greenhouse environment, the application of complex event processing (CEP) technology can effectively tackle the problem of recognition of the complex patterns that appeared in greenhouse conditions. In the existing research, few scholars have proposed a scheme to integrate complicated scenes within the greenhouse environment with high efficiency, convenience, and low coupling. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of hard recognition and fusion of complex patterns in the greenhouse environment, based on the characteristics of the greenhouse, this paper proposes a complex event processing method for greenhouse control. Our method has high applicability and high expansibility, including 13 types of event processing agents and 21 types of typical events involved in greenhouse automatic control. This method has the advantages of low information coupling and multi-domain integration, which can be directly used by agricultural experts and related workers and is of great significance to promote the extensive application of CEP technology in the greenhouse field. Our experiment successfully realized a greenhouse intelligent control system based on CEP technology is successfully realized in our experiment. The experimental statistics shows that the structure of the control system was accessible and effective.},

ABSTRACT = {Energy consumption in Bangladesh increased for economic, industrial, and digitalization growth. Reductions in conventional sources such as natural gas (54%) and coal (5.6%) are calls to enhance renewable resources. This paper aims to investigate the atmospheric variables for potential wind zones and develop a statistical power-forecasting model. The study-site is Bangladesh, focusing on eight divisions across two regions. First, the southern zone includes Dhaka (Capital), Chittagong, Barishal, and Khulna. The northern regions are Rajshahi, Rangpur, Mymensingh, and Sylhet. This investigation illustrates wind (m/s) speeds at various heights (m) and analyzes the boundary layer height (BLH) from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast reanalysis 5th generation (ERA5). The data is from a period of 40 years from 1979 to 2018, assessing with a climatic base of 20 years (1979 to 2000). The climatological analysis comprises trends, time series, anomalies, and linear correlations. The results for the wind speed (BLH) indicate that the weakest (lower) and strongest (higher) regions are Sylhet and Barishal, respectively. Based on power-curve relationships, a simple power predictive model (SPPM) is developed using global wind atlas (GWA) data (sample: 1100) to estimate the power density (W/m2) and found an accuracy of 0.918 and 0.892 for Exponential (EXP) and Polynomial (PN) with mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 22.92 and 21.8%, respectively. For validation, SPPM also forecasts power incorporating historical observations for Chittagong and obtains correlations of 0.970 and 0.974 for EXP and PN with a MAPE of 10.26 and 7.69% individually. Furthermore, calculations for annual energy production reveal an average megawattage of 1748 and 1070 in the southern and northern regions, with an MAPE of 15.71 and 5.85% for EXP and PN models, except Sylhet. The SPPM’s predictability can be improved with observed wind speeds and turbine types. The research wishes to apply SPPM for estimating energy in operational power plants.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban modeling and visualization are highly useful in the development of smart cities. Buildings are the most prominent features in the urban environment, and are necessary for urban decision support; thus, buildings should be modeled effectively and efficiently in three dimensions (3D). In this study, with the help of Gaofen-7 (GF-7) high-resolution stereo mapping satellite double-line camera (DLC) images and multispectral (MUX) images, the boundary of a building is segmented via a multilevel features fusion network (MFFN). A digital surface model (DSM) is generated to obtain the elevation of buildings. The building vector with height information is processed using a 3D modeling tool to create a white building model. The building model, DSM, and multispectral fused image are then imported into the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) to complete the urban scene level, vividly rendered with environmental effects for urban visualization. The results of this study show that high accuracy of 95.29% is achieved in building extraction using our proposed method. Based on the extracted building vector and elevation information from the DSM, building 3D models can be efficiently created in Level of Details 1 (LOD1). Finally, the urban scene is produced for realistic 3D visualization. This study shows that high-resolution stereo mapping satellite images are useful in 3D modeling for urban buildings and can support the generation and visualization of urban scenes in a large area for different applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning (ML) techniques learn a system by observing it. Events and occurrences in the network define what is expected of the network’s operation. It is for this reason that ML techniques are used in the computer network security field to detect unauthorized intervention. In the event of suspicious activity, the result of the ML analysis deviates from the definition of expected normal network activity and the suspicious activity becomes apparent. Support vector machines (SVM) are ML techniques that have been used to profile normal network activity and classify it as normal or abnormal. They are trained to configure an optimal hyperplane that classifies unknown input vectors’ values based on their positioning on the plane. We propose to use SVM models to detect malicious behavior within low-power, low-rate and short range networks, such as those used in the Internet of Things (IoT). We evaluated two SVM approaches, the C-SVM and the OC-SVM, where the former requires two classes of vector values (one for the normal and one for the abnormal activity) and the latter observes only normal behavior activity. Both approaches were used as part of an intrusion detection system (IDS) that monitors and detects abnormal activity within the smart node device. Actual network traffic with specific network-layer attacks implemented by us was used to create and evaluate the SVM detection models. It is shown that the C-SVM achieves up to 100% classification accuracy when evaluated with unknown data taken from the same network topology it was trained with and 81% accuracy when operating in an unknown topology. The OC-SVM that is created using benign activity achieves at most 58% accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a problem-solving paradigm that uses knowledge of relevant past experiences (cases) to interpret or solve new problems. CBR systems allow generating explanations easily, as they typically organize and represent knowledge in a way that makes it possible to reason about and thereby generate explanations. An improvement of this paradigm is ontology-based CBR, an approach that combines, in the form of formal ontologies, case-specific knowledge with domain one in order to improve the effectiveness and explanation capability of the system. Intelligent systems make daily activities more easily, efficiently, and represent a real support for sustainable economic development. On the one hand, they improve efficiency, productivity, and quality, and, on the other hand, can reduce costs and cut waste. In this way, intelligent systems facilitate sustainable development, economic growth, societal progress, and improve efficiency. Aim: In this vision, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new generation of intelligent decision support systems for Business Model having the ability to provide explanations to increase confidence in proposed solutions. Findings/result: The performance results obtained show the benefits of the proposed solution with different requirements of an explanatory decision support system. Consequently, applying this paradigm for software tools of business model development will make a great promise for supporting business model design, sustainability, and innovation.},

ABSTRACT = {To sustain the complexity of growing demand, the conventional grid (CG) is incorporated with communication technology like advanced metering with sensors, demand response (DR), energy storage systems (ESS), and inclusion of electric vehicles (EV). In order to maintain local area energy balance and reliability, microgrids (MG) are proposed. Microgrids are low or medium voltage distribution systems with a resilient operation, that control the exchange of power between the main grid, locally distributed generators (DGs), and consumers using intelligent energy management techniques. This paper gives a brief introduction to microgrids, their operations, and further, a review of different energy management approaches. In a microgrid control strategy, an energy management system (EMS) is the key component to maintain the balance between energy resources (CG, DG, ESS, and EVs) and loads available while contributing the profit to utility. This article classifies the methodologies used for EMS based on the structure, control, and technique used. The untapped areas which have scope for investigation are also mentioned.},

ABSTRACT = {Experts confirm that 85% of the world’s population is expected to live in cities by 2050. Therefore, cities should be prepared to satisfy the needs of their citizens and provide the best services. The idea of a city of the future is commonly represented by the smart city, which is a more efficient system that optimizes its resources and services, through the use of monitoring and communication technology. Thus, one of the steps towards sustainability for cities around the world is to make a transition into smart cities. Here, sensors play an important role in the system, as they gather relevant information from the city, citizens, and the corresponding communication networks that transfer the information in real-time. Although the use of these sensors is diverse, their application can be categorized in six different groups: energy, health, mobility, security, water, and waste management. Based on these groups, this review presents an analysis of different sensors that are typically used in efforts toward creating smart cities. Insights about different applications and communication systems are provided, as well as the main opportunities and challenges faced when making a transition to a smart city. Ultimately, this process is not only about smart urban infrastructure, but more importantly about how these new sensing capabilities and digitization developments improve quality of life. Smarter communities are those that socialize, adapt, and invest through transparent and inclusive community engagement in these technologies based on local and regional societal needs and values. Cyber security disruptions and privacy remain chief vulnerabilities.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial intelligence (AI) programs are applied to methods such as diagnostic procedures, treatment protocol development, patient monitoring, drug development, personalized medicine in healthcare, and outbreak predictions in global health, as in the case of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Machine learning (ML) is a field of AI that allows computers to learn and improve without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can also analyze large amounts of data called Big data through electronic health records for disease prevention and diagnosis. Wearable medical devices are used to continuously monitor an individual’s health status and store it in cloud computing. In the context of a newly published study, the potential benefits of sophisticated data analytics and machine learning are discussed in this review. We have conducted a literature search in all the popular databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. This paper describes the utilization of concepts underlying ML, big data, blockchain technology and their importance in medicine, healthcare, public health surveillance, case estimations in COVID-19 pandemic and other epidemics. The review also goes through the possible consequences and difficulties for medical practitioners and health technologists in designing futuristic models to improve the quality and well-being of human lives.},

ABSTRACT = {Travel surveys can uncover information regarding travel behaviour, needs, and more. Collected information is utilised to make choices when reorganising or planning built environments. Over the years, methods for conducting travel surveys have changed from interviews and forms to automated travel diaries in order to monitor trips made by travellers. With the fast progression of technological advancements, new possibilities for operationalising such travel diaries can be implemented, changing from utilising mobile to wearable devices. Wearable devices are often equipped with sensors which collect continuous biometric data from sources that are not reachable from standard mobile devices. Data collected through wearable devices range from heart rate and blood pressure to temperature and perspiration. This advancement opens new possible layers of information in the collection of travel data. Such biometric data can be used to derive psychophysiological conditions related to cognitive load, which can uncover in-depth knowledge regarding stress and emotions. This paper aims to explore the possibilities of data analysis on the data collected through a software combining travel survey data, such as position and time, with heartrate, to gain knowledge of the implications of such data. The knowledge about the implications of spatial configurations can be used to create more accessible environments.},

ABSTRACT = {With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing importance of e-commerce, the study of online consumer behavior is of particular relevance. The purpose of this study was to form a methodological approach to assess the relationships and the level of influence of the factors activating the purchasing behavior of online consumers against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research methodology was based on the transformation of Cattell’s questionnaire and the implementation of correlation analysis. To determine the predisposition of online consumer behavior at the time of making a purchase decision, this study used the questionnaire method. The survey was conducted among online shoppers in the top 10 countries in terms of e-commerce market growth. The scientific contribution is the proposed methodological toolkit to assess the purchasing behavior of online consumers, which identifies the most influential factors in their purchasing behavior and provides an opportunity to assess the dynamics of their activity during the study period, to identify key trends and determine changes in their behavior. The research revealed what changes in online consumer buying behavior are typical in the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of consumer awareness and experience has increased. Online consumers have become more experienced, which has influenced the activity of their buying behavior. This study proved the shifting influence of online consumer purchasing behavior factors during the pandemic. The increasing importance of the speed of decision making by consumers when purchasing goods and services online was determined.},

ABSTRACT = {The evolution of IoT has come with the challenge of connecting not only a massive number of devices, but also providing an always wider variety of services. In the next few years, a big increase in the number of connected devices is expected, together with an important increase in the amount of traffic generated. Never before have wireless communications permeated so deeply in all industries and economic sectors. Therefore, it is crucial to correctly forecast the spectrum needs, which bands should be used for which services, and the economic potential of its utilization. This paper proposes a methodology for spectrum forecasting consisting of two phases: a market study and a spectrum forecasting model. The market study determines the main drivers of the IoT industry for any country: services, technologies, frequency bands, and the number of devices that will require IoT connectivity. The forecasting model takes the market study as the input and calculates the spectrum demand in 5 steps: Defining scenarios for spectrum contention, calculating the offered traffic load, calculating a capacity for some QoS requirements, finding the spectrum required, and adjusting according to key spectral efficiency determinants. This methodology is applied for Colombia’s IoT spectrum forecast. We provide a complete step-by-step implementation in fourteen independent spectrum contention scenarios, calculating offered traffic, required capacity, and spectrum for cellular licensed bands and non-cellular unlicensed bands in a 10-year period. Detailed results are presented specifying coverage area requirements per economic sector, frequency band, and service. The need for higher teledensity and higher spectral efficiency turns out to be a determining factor for spectrum savings.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a multifunctional interdisciplinary framework that makes four scientific contributions towards the development of personalized ambient assisted living (AAL), with a specific focus to address the different and dynamic needs of the diverse aging population in the future of smart living environments. First, it presents a probabilistic reasoning-based mathematical approach to model all possible forms of user interactions for any activity arising from user diversity of multiple users in such environments. Second, it presents a system that uses this approach with a machine learning method to model individual user-profiles and user-specific user interactions for detecting the dynamic indoor location of each specific user. Third, to address the need to develop highly accurate indoor localization systems for increased trust, reliance, and seamless user acceptance, the framework introduces a novel methodology where two boosting approaches—Gradient Boosting and the AdaBoost algorithm are integrated and used on a decision tree-based learning model to perform indoor localization. Fourth, the framework introduces two novel functionalities to provide semantic context to indoor localization in terms of detecting each user’s floor-specific location as well as tracking whether a specific user was located inside or outside a given spatial region in a multi-floor-based indoor setting. These novel functionalities of the proposed framework were tested on a dataset of localization-related Big Data collected from 18 different users who navigated in 3 buildings consisting of 5 floors and 254 indoor spatial regions, with an to address the limitation in prior works in this field centered around the lack of training data from diverse users. The results show that this approach of indoor localization for personalized AAL that models each specific user always achieves higher accuracy as compared to the traditional approach of modeling an average user. The results further demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms all prior works in this field in terms of functionalities, performance characteristics, and operational features.},

ABSTRACT = {The connectivity of our surrounding objects to the internet plays a tremendous role in our daily lives. Many network applications have been developed in every domain of life, including business, healthcare, smart homes, and smart cities, to name a few. As these network applications provide a wide range of services for large user groups, the network intruders are prone to developing intrusion skills for attack and malicious compliance. Therefore, safeguarding network applications and things connected to the internet has always been a point of interest for researchers. Many studies propose solutions for intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems. Network communities have produced benchmark datasets available for researchers to improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems. The scientific community has presented data mining and machine learning-based mechanisms to detect intrusion with high classification accuracy. This paper presents an intrusion detection system based on the ensemble of prediction and learning mechanisms to improve anomaly detection accuracy in a network intrusion environment. The learning mechanism is based on automated machine learning, and the prediction model is based on the Kalman filter. Performance analysis of the proposed intrusion detection system is evaluated using publicly available intrusion datasets UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017. The proposed model-based intrusion detection accuracy for the UNSW-NB15 dataset is 98.801 percent, and the CICIDS2017 dataset is 97.02 percent. The performance comparison results show that the proposed ensemble model-based intrusion detection significantly improves the intrusion detection accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Edge intelligence (EI) has received a lot of interest because it can reduce latency, increase efficiency, and preserve privacy. More significantly, as the Internet of Things (IoT) has proliferated, billions of portable and embedded devices have been interconnected, producing zillions of gigabytes on edge networks. Thus, there is an immediate need to push AI (artificial intelligence) breakthroughs within edge networks to achieve the full promise of edge data analytics. EI solutions have supported digital technology workloads and applications from the infrastructure level to edge networks; however, there are still many challenges with the heterogeneity of computational capabilities and the spread of information sources. We propose a novel event-driven deep-learning framework, called EDL-EI (event-driven deep learning for edge intelligence), via the design of a novel event model by defining events using correlation analysis with multiple sensors in real-world settings and incorporating multi-sensor fusion techniques, a transformation method for sensor streams into images, and lightweight 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) models. To demonstrate the feasibility of the EDL-EI framework, we presented an IoT-based prototype system that we developed with multiple sensors and edge devices. To verify the proposed framework, we have a case study of air-quality scenarios based on the benchmark data provided by the USA Environmental Protection Agency for the most polluted cities in South Korea and China. We have obtained outstanding predictive accuracy (97.65% and 97.19%) from two deep-learning models on the cities’ air-quality patterns. Furthermore, the air-quality changes from 2019 to 2020 have been analyzed to check the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.},

ABSTRACT = {Environmental Sound Recognition has become a relevant application for smart cities. Such an application, however, demands the use of trained machine learning classifiers in order to categorize a limited set of audio categories. Although classical machine learning solutions have been proposed in the past, most of the latest solutions that have been proposed toward automated and accurate sound classification are based on a deep learning approach. Deep learning models tend to be large, which can be problematic when considering that sound classifiers often have to be embedded in resource constrained devices. In this paper, a classical machine learning based classifier called MosAIc, and a lighter Convolutional Neural Network model for environmental sound recognition, are proposed to directly compete in terms of accuracy with the latest deep learning solutions. Both approaches are evaluated in an embedded system in order to identify the key parameters when placing such applications on constrained devices. The experimental results show that classical machine learning classifiers can be combined to achieve similar results to deep learning models, and even outperform them in accuracy. The cost, however, is a larger classification time.},

ABSTRACT = {Data scientists spend much time with data cleaning tasks, and this is especially important when dealing with data gathered from sensors, as finding failures is not unusual (there is an abundance of research on anomaly detection in sensor data). This work analyzes several aspects of the data generated by different sensor types to understand particularities in the data, linking them with existing data mining methodologies. Using data from different sources, this work analyzes how the type of sensor used and its measurement units have an important impact in basic statistics such as variance and mean, because of the statistical distributions of the datasets. The work also analyzes the behavior of outliers, how to detect them, and how they affect the equivalence of sensors, as equivalence is used in many solutions for identifying anomalies. Based on the previous results, the article presents guidance on how to deal with data coming from sensors, in order to understand the characteristics of sensor datasets, and proposes a parallelized implementation. Finally, the article shows that the proposed decision-making processes work well with a new type of sensor and that parallelizing with several cores enables calculations to be executed up to four times faster.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning methods predicated on convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks have enabled significant improvement in node classification and prediction when applied to graph representation with learning node embedding to effectively represent the hierarchical properties of graphs. An interesting approach (DiffPool) utilises a differentiable graph pooling technique which learns ‘differentiable soft cluster assignment’ for nodes at each layer of a deep graph neural network with nodes mapped on sets of clusters. However, effective control of the learning process is difficult given the inherent complexity in an ‘end-to-end’ model with the potential for a large number parameters (including the potential for redundant parameters). In this paper, we propose an approach termed FPool, which is a development of the basic method adopted in DiffPool (where pooling is applied directly to node representations). Techniques designed to enhance data classification have been created and evaluated using a number of popular and publicly available sensor datasets. Experimental results for FPool demonstrate improved classification and prediction performance when compared to alternative methods considered. Moreover, FPool shows a significant reduction in the training time over the basic DiffPool framework.},

ABSTRACT = {Industry 4.0, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are generating ever more data. This opens new opportunities for companies, as they can monitor development and production processes, improve their products, and offer additional services. However, companies are often overwhelmed by Big Data, as they cannot handle its volume, velocity, and variety. Additionally, they mostly do not follow a strategy in the collection and usage of data, which leads to unexploited business potentials. This paper presents the implementation of a Digital Twin module in an industrial case study, applying a concept for guiding companies on their way from data to value. A standardized use case template and a procedure model support the companies in (1) formulating a value proposition, (2) analyzing the current process, and (3) conceptualizing a target process. The presented use case entails an anomaly detection algorithm based on Gaussian processes to detect defective products in real-time for the extrusion process of aluminum profiles. The module was initially tested in a relevant environment; however, full implementation is still missing. Therefore, technology readiness level 6 (TRL6) was reached. Furthermore, the effect of the target process on production efficiency is evaluated, leading to significant cost reduction, energy savings, and quality improvements.},
