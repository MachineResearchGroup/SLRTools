abstract = {Despite growing recognition that cumulative adversity (total stressor exposure, including complex trauma), increases the risk for psychopathology and impacts development, assessment strategies lag behind: Adversity-related mental health needs (symptoms, functional impairment, maladaptive coping) are typically assessed in response to only one qualifying Criterion-A traumatic event. This is especially problematic for youth at-risk for health and academic disparities who experience cumulative adversity, including non-qualifying events (separation from caregivers) which may produce more impairing symptomatology. Data from 118 delinquent girls demonstrate: (1) an average of 14 adverse Criterion-A and non-Criterion event exposures; (2) serious maladaptive coping strategies (self-injury) directly in response to cumulative adversity; (3) more cumulative adversity-related than worst-event related symptomatology and functional impairment; and (4) comparable symptomatology, but greater functional impairment, in response to non-Criterion events. These data support the evaluation of mental health needs in response to cumulative adversity for optimal identification and tailoring of services in high-risk populations to reduce disparities.}

We consider two contexts where Norwegian displays variable word order, viz. subject placement in main and embedded clauses, and the variable word order found inside the DP in possessive constructions. We identify the conditions under which each word order is chosen in the target language, both with respect to syntax and information structure, and investigate the frequency of the different orders in child-directed speech. In both cases it is shown that the children have both word orders in place from the onset of production of relevant utterances and that they are sensitive to the distinctions between the two from early on. Nevertheless, in their earliest production, the children seem to have a preference for the word order that is the least frequent one in the input. These findings indicate that frequency by itself is not sufficient to explain children's preferences in early production. Instead, the findings in the child data are accounted for in terms of an economy principle of movement that is argued to be operative in early child language.}

No differences were found on word decoding across the grades, kindergarten grapheme knowledge, phoneme isolation, or short term memory (STM). Despite L2 learners' delay in reading comprehension and language-related precursors, the developmental paths and structural relations of L2 learners were highly similar to those of L1 learners. For both groups, RAN, grapheme knowledge and STM predicted word decoding development. Word decoding, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, and STM predicted reading comprehension. There were strong autoregressive effects of both word decoding and reading comprehension. In kindergarten, L2 learners showed delays in RAN, phonological awareness, and vocabulary.

The young people with ASD (mean age 12 years 10 months) completed the SCAS-C, while their caregivers completed the SCAS-P, the Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised and the Developmental Behavior Checklist. There was overall moderately good agreement between caregivers and children's reporting of anxiety symptoms. Intra-class correlations were highest in the Separation Anxiety, Generalized Anxiety and Physical Injury subscales. Fourteen of the 38 SCAS items, most of which described overt anxiety symptoms, showed strong or moderate inter-rater agreement. Higher severity of autism symptoms was associated with poorer agreement in the Generalized Anxiety, Panic and Obsessions/Compulsions SCAS subscales. These preliminary findings suggest that the SCAS may be a useful measure for reporting anxiety symptoms in terms of satisfactory agreement between caregivers and young people in non-referred settings. Implications for screening for anxiety in non-referred young people with ASD are also discussed.}

abstract = {Purpose
: Motor theories indicate that focusing attention on well-practiced movements interferes with skilled performance; however, specific forms of attention (alerting vs. orienting vs. executive control) associated with this effect are not well understood. The present study explored this question in relation to stuttering, and examined whether dual task conditions that engaged sustained attention or working memory (WM) affected speech fluency in different ways. We also considered whether fluency changes were associated with changes in speech rate and language.
Methods
: Nineteen adults who stutter (AWS) and 20 controls produced spontaneous speech under a baseline condition and two dual task conditions: one involving a sustained attention task, the other involving WM demands.
Results
: Both groups produced fewer stutter-like disfluencies under dual task relative to baseline conditions and this reduction did not differ between the two dual tasks (attention vs. WM). Speech rate and language variables, which were potentially influenced by attention conditions, were not affected by dual tasks in the same way as disfluencies, and appeared to be unassociated with fluency results.
Conclusions
: Findings indicate that atypical disfluencies decrease when attention is divided, even when secondary task demands are minimal, as they were in the sustained attention task. For simple secondary tasks, fluency changes do not appear to be a byproduct of slowed rate and are not accompanied by observable changes in language. These results demonstrate that simple manipulations of attention can induce measurable effects on aspects of speech production, and may be a useful tool for facilitating fluency in clinical intervention.}

abstract = {Objective
The purpose of this study was to provide a description of the language and speech (intelligibility, voice, resonance, articulation) in a 7-year-old Dutch speaking boy with Nager syndrome. To reveal these features comparison was made with an age and gender related child with a similar palatal or hearing problem.
Methods
Language was tested with an age appropriate language test namely the Dutch version of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals. Regarding articulation a phonetic inventory, phonetic analysis and phonological process analysis was performed. A nominal scale with four categories was used to judge the overall speech intelligibility. A voice and resonance assessment included a videolaryngostroboscopy, a perceptual evaluation, acoustic analysis and nasometry.
Results
The most striking communication problems in this child were expressive and receptive language delay, moderately impaired speech intelligibility, the presence of phonetic and phonological disorders, resonance disorders and a high-pitched voice. The explanation for this pattern of communication is not completely straightforward. The language and the phonological impairment, only present in the child with the Nager syndrome, are not part of a more general developmental delay. The resonance disorders can be related to the cleft palate, but were not present in the child with the isolated cleft palate. One might assume that the cul-de-sac resonance and the much decreased mandibular movement and the restricted tongue lifting are caused by the restricted jaw mobility and micrognathia. To what extent the suggested mandibular distraction osteogenesis in early childhood allows increased mandibular movement and better speech outcome with increased oral resonance is subject for further research.
Conclusion
According to the results of this study the speech and language management must be focused on receptive and expressive language skills and linguistic conceptualization, correct phonetic placement and the modification of hypernasality and nasal emission.}

The role of frequency and (morphological) regularity of verbs in agrammatism is also explored. For these investigations a sentence completion task was developed. Overall, Aspect was found significantly more impaired than Tense, and Tense significantly more impaired than Agreement. No dissociation was observed between past and future Tense, or between perfective and imperfective Aspect, for any of the two agrammatic participants. No verb regularity effect was detected and only a verb frequency effect in the Tense condition was observed for one of the participants. It is suggested that the two agrammatic participants have a morphosyntactic deficit, while one of them has an additional lexical deficit. Moreover, it is argued that the increased processing demands of Tense and Aspect, which carry interpretable features, render them more vulnerable compared to Agreement, which bears an uninterpretable feature and is a local, strictly grammatical operation. The significantly worse performance of the two agrammatic participants on Aspect than on Tense is attributed to the more “subjective” nature of the former category.}

Underspecification theory says that the phonemes that have unmarked feature values are even more abstract in that the feature is omitted from the representation altogether. This makes phoneme representations in words more sparse than the fully specified phonetic representations of the same words. Eulitz and Lahiri (2004) demonstrated that this theory predicts certain asymmetries in the Mismatch Negativity (MMN) response to phoneme contrasts. We expand on this research by demonstrating underspecification-driven asymmetry in the brain response to laryngeal feature contrasts in English (i.e. what makes /d/ and /t/ different). We add a new test by showing that the asymmetry disappears if the MMN paradigm is modified to encourage the formation of phonetic memory traces instead of phonemic memory traces. This result adds further neurobiological evidence that long-term phonological representations are more sparsely represented than phonetic representations.}

The SVR model strongly influences current education practices, although its validity is still questioned. This review identified 56 studies on the three components of the SVR model in English-speaking children attending elementary school. A meta-analysis on these data showed that decoding and linguistic comprehension are moderately correlated, and that both decoding and linguistic comprehension are highly correlated with reading comprehension. Decoding and linguistic comprehension explain 50% of the variance of reading comprehension, and measurement error explains an additional 22%. Further research is needed to identify other variables that could predict reading comprehension after controlling for decoding and linguistic comprehension. Word reading accuracy was the assessment approach to decoding that best relates to reading comprehension. Various approaches to the assessment of linguistic comprehension produced similar results. In conclusion, reading comprehension is a more complex phenomenon than that described by the SVR model. However, decoding and linguistic comprehension, two variables that are simple to evaluate, provide a good approximation to reading comprehension measures for children in elementary school.
Resumen
La Concepción Simple de la Lectura (CSL) es un modelo que trata de explicar la comprensión lectora a partir de dos factores: la descodificación y la comprensión general del lenguaje. La CSL está teniendo una notable influencia en la práctica educativa aunque su validez aún se pone en duda. En esta revisión se identificaron cincuenta y seis investigaciones en las que se incluían los tres componentes de la CSL en alumnos de Educación Primaria hablantes de inglés. En el metanálisis de los datos obtenidos se encontró que había una correlación moderada entre descodificación y comprensión del lenguaje, y que ambas variables tenían una correlación alta con la comprensión lectora. La descodificación y la comprensión del lenguaje explicaban un 50% de la varianza de la comprensión lectora, y el error de medida explicaba un 22% adicional. Es necesaria más investigación sobre otras variables que puedan predecir la comprensión lectora tras controlar el efecto de la descodificación y la comprensión del lenguaje. La precisión en la lectura de palabras era la forma de evaluación de la descodificación que más se relacionaba con la comprensión lectora. Las distintas formas de medir la comprensión del lenguaje produjeron resultados similares. Se concluye que la comprensión lectora es un fenómeno más complejo que lo que se describe en la CSL. Sin embargo, la descodificación y la comprensión del lenguaje, que son variables fáciles de medir, permiten un buen acercamiento a la comprensión lectora de los alumnos de Educación Primaria.}

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that verbal and non-verbal intelligence can be dissociated and focal cortical regions corresponding to each have been demonstrated. However, the pattern of structural covariance corresponding to verbal and non-verbal intelligence remains unexplored. In this study, we used 586 longitudinal anatomical MRI scans of subjects aged 6–18 years, who had concurrent intelligence quotient (IQ) testing on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Structural covariance networks (SCNs) were constructed using interregional correlations in cortical thickness for low-IQ (Performance IQ=100±8, Verbal IQ=100±7) and high-IQ (PIQ=121±8, VIQ=120±9) groups. From low- to high-VIQ group, we observed constrained patterns of anatomical coupling among cortical regions, complemented by observations of higher global efficiency and modularity, and lower local efficiency in high-VIQ group, suggesting a shift towards a more optimal topological organization. Analysis of nodal topological properties (regional efficiency and participation coefficient) revealed greater involvement of left-hemispheric language related regions including inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri for high-VIQ group. From low- to high-PIQ group, we did not observe significant differences in anatomical coupling patterns, global and nodal topological properties. Our findings indicate that people with higher verbal intelligence have structural brain differences from people with lower verbal intelligence – not only in localized cortical regions, but also in the patterns of anatomical coupling among widely distributed cortical regions, possibly resulting to a system-level reorganization that might lead to a more efficient organization in high-VIQ group.}

Resumen
Antecedentes: El interés en las necesidades de apoyo de las personas con discapacidad intelectual debe centrarse en la evaluación del patrón e intensidad de los apoyos requeridos para realizar las actividades diarias. Cuando se evalúan estas necesidades en niños, se debe considerar además la influencia de la edad. Método: Se evaluaron 450 personas con discapacidad intelectual (5-16 años) mediante la versión española de la SIS-C. La invarianza de medida y las diferencias latentes fueron analizadas relacionando la muestra española con la muestra normativa de la versión en inglés. Los modelos desarrollados para la creación de baremos se utilizaron para estudiar las equivalencias de medida en los distintos grupos de edad y las diferencias latentes de sus medias, varianzas y desviaciones típicas. Resultados: Los ítems de la versión española de la SIS-C son fiables para medir las necesidades de apoyo en personas de entre 5 y 16 años. A nivel latente, los datos mostraron diferencias en las medias de las puntuaciones de diferentes grupos de edad. Conclusiones: Pueden utilizarse los mismos ítems para medir las necesidades de apoyo de niños y adolescentes, pero debe considerarse la influencia de la edad tanto en la creación de baremos como en la planificación de apoyos.}

Results of latent profile analysis revealed three distinct teacher profiles of talk during book reading that we termed: Moderate Comprehenders (MC, 68% of sample), Discuss & Reflect Comprehenders (DRC, 19%), and Preview & Discuss Comprehenders (PDC, 12%). These profiles differed most in the timing (e.g., before versus after reading for PDC and DRC, respectively) and content of talk (e.g., low- versus high-cognitive demand topics for MC vs. PDC/DRC). The less common DRC and PDC teacher profiles were associated with higher amounts of child talk and more elaborate child utterances within the reading session. However, no teacher profiles or features of teacher/child utterances during this one reading session predicted children's gains in language and literacy skills across the school year. Notably, the first profile in the present study differed from a past, seminal study of shared reading; however, the other two profiles were similar to earlier work on holistic styles of shared reading.}

abstract = {Convergent evidence from human and non-human animal studies suggests aerobic exercise and increased aerobic capacity may be beneficial for brain health and cognition. It is thought growth factors may mediate this putative relationship, particularly by augmenting plasticity mechanisms in the hippocampus, a brain region critical for learning and memory. Among these factors, glucocorticoids, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hormones that have considerable and diverse physiological importance, are thought to effect normal and exercise-induced hippocampal plasticity. Despite these predictions, relatively few published human studies have tested hypotheses that relate exercise and fitness to the hippocampus, and none have considered the potential links to all of these hormonal components. Here we present cross-sectional data from a study of recognition memory; serum BDNF, cortisol, IGF-1, and VEGF levels; and aerobic capacity in healthy young adults. We measured circulating levels of these hormones together with performance on a recognition memory task, and a standard graded treadmill test of aerobic fitness. Regression analyses demonstrated BDNF and aerobic fitness predict recognition memory in an interactive manner. In addition, IGF-1 was positively associated with aerobic fitness, but not with recognition memory. Our results may suggest an exercise adaptation-related change in the BDNF dose–response curve that relates to hippocampal memory.}

These complementary measures are derived from keystroke logging data, which were collected from an experiment among 68 students who wrote two descriptive texts, one in their mother tongue and the other in their second language. By using correlation and principal component analyses, we have reduced the set of variables and created a new multidimensional model to better address the complexity of fluency in writing. This model consists of four dimensions: (a) production, (b) process variation, (c) revision, and (d) pause behavior. These four components together create a multidimensional perspective on writing, which enables us to differentiate between fluent and less fluent writers.}

This study examined the long-term effects of Head Start on foster children's developmental outcomes from ages 3–4 to 8–9.
Method
187 children in the care of foster parents (either relatives or non-relatives) were selected among 4442 children from the Head Start Impact study data, collected during 2002-2009. Children’s cognitive, social-emotional, and health outcomes were measured at three time points: ages 3–4, 5–6, and 8–9.
Results
Regression analysis was used to examine interaction effects of Head Start at the three measured time points. Results indicated that children in foster care who participated in Head Start had overall higher cognitive, social-emotional, and health outcomes compared to children in foster care who did not participate in Head Start. The positive impacts of Head Start on children in foster care were more prevalent when children were 8–9 years old.
Implications
Social workers should evaluate, identify and connect adequate social services to children in foster care. Future studies should be conducted to identify the barriers of accessing Head Start among children in foster care.}

abstract = {Background
Since the introduction of consensus criteria for symptomatic remission in 2005, most first-episode studies focused on cross-sectional relationship between remission status and functional outcome. Predictive validity of the proposed remission definition was under-studied. Relationship of remission with subjective quality of life (QoL) was inadequately addressed with inconsistent findings being observed.
Method
One hundred and four Hong Kong Chinese aged 18 to 55years presenting with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were studied. Socio-demographics, baseline clinical and functioning profiles were obtained. Psychopathological and functional reassessments were conducted at 6, 12 and 24months. Subjective QoL was measured at 12 and 24months. Symptomatic remission was operationally defined according to the consensus criteria developed by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group (RSWG), comprising both symptom-severity and 6-month duration components.
Results
At 12months, 59.6% of patients achieved symptomatic remission. Remitted patients had significantly lower symptom severity, more favorable psychosocial functioning and better subjective QoL at 12months than non-remitted counterparts. Attainment of remission at 12months was significantly associated with fewer positive, negative, depressive and disorganization symptoms, higher levels of functioning and subjective QoL at 24months. Linear regression analysis indicated that remission status independently predicted functional outcome even when the effects of educational level, baseline functioning and negative symptom scores were controlled for.
Conclusion
The operationally defined symptomatic remission formulated by the RSWG represented a clinically valid construct that was found to be closely related to both concurrent and longitudinal outcomes on psychopathology, functioning and subjective QoL in the early stage of schizophrenia.}

abstract = {Congenital amusia is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder of fine-grained pitch processing. In this fMRI study, we examined the neural bases of congenial amusia in speakers of a tonal language – Cantonese. Previous studies on non-tonal language speakers suggest that the neural deficits of congenital amusia lie in the music-selective neural circuitry in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, it is unclear whether this finding can generalize to congenital amusics in tonal languages. Tonal language experience has been reported to shape the neural processing of pitch, which raises the question of how tonal language experience affects the neural bases of congenital amusia. To investigate this question, we examined the neural circuitries sub-serving the processing of relative pitch interval in pitch-matched Cantonese level tone and musical stimuli in 11 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 11 musically intact controls. Cantonese-speaking amusics exhibited abnormal brain activities in a widely distributed neural network during the processing of lexical tone and musical stimuli. Whereas the controls exhibited significant activation in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the lexical tone condition and in the cerebellum regardless of the lexical tone and music conditions, no activation was found in the amusics in those regions, which likely reflects a dysfunctional neural mechanism of relative pitch processing in the amusics. Furthermore, the amusics showed abnormally strong activation of the right middle frontal gyrus and precuneus when the pitch stimuli were repeated, which presumably reflect deficits of attending to repeated pitch stimuli or encoding them into working memory. No significant group difference was found in the right IFG in either the whole-brain analysis or region-of-interest analysis. These findings imply that the neural deficits in tonal language speakers might differ from those in non-tonal language speakers, and overlap partly with the neural circuitries of lexical tone processing (e.g. right STG).}

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive tool that induces neuromodulation in the brain. Several studies have shown that rTMS improves language recovery in patients with post-stroke aphasia.
Objective
This systematic review summarizes the role of rTMS in aphasia rehabilitation.
Methods
We searched MEDLINE via PubMed and Scopus on 30October, 2020, for English articles (1996–2020). Eligible studies involved post-stroke aphasia rehabilitation with rTMS. In some of these studies, rTMS was also combined with speech therapy.
Results
In total, seven meta-analyses and 59studies (23randomized clinical trials) were included in this systematic review. The methods used in these studies were heterogeneous. Only six studies did not find that rTMS had a significant effect on language performance.
Conclusions
The evidence from the peer-reviewed literature suggests that rTMS is an effective tool in post-stroke aphasia rehabilitation. However, the precise mechanisms that underlie the effects of rTMS and the reorganization of language networks in patients who have had a stroke remain unclear. We discuss these crucial challenges in the context of future studies.}

Using a visual world paradigm at test, eye tracking results indicated faster recognition of non-words that were produced compared with heard-only during training. In Experiment 2, non-words were correctly pronounced or mispronounced at test. Participants showed a different pattern of recognition for mispronunciation on non-words that were produced compared with heard-only during training.

Results suggested a developmental pattern where 3-year-olds’ performance on the magnitude comparison task was worst when EF was taxed the most.

Within non-generativist approaches to language acquisition, children's language acquisition is often viewed an emergent response to a highly patterned linguistic environment, at least some of which is tailored by caregivers to children's cognitive and social needs. Some cross-cultural research, however, has disputed whether caregivers modify speech to children in all cultures, and whether or to what extent special infant- or child-directed speech is necessary for successful language acquisition. In this paper we present new cross-linguistic and cross-cultural data on baby talk or janyarrp among Gurindji people. Using a corpus of naturalistic family interactions and interviews with Gurindji people of northern Australia we describe the phonological modifications and specific lexicon of baby talk and investigate its possible functions. Several phonological reductions were found which are familiar from baby talk and child speech in other languages, including rhotic replacement and cluster reduction. More unusually, baby talk neutralizes the three-way coronal contrast in Gurindji Kriol, the language which Gurindji children learn at home. The functions of baby talk for Gurindji people likewise seem to comprise familiar baby talk functions like holding attention as well as less familiar functions, such facilitating children's imitations in production.}

In the study, Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) were recorded while subjects performed a sentence acceptability task. Target BOI words were preceded by rich or poor sensorimotor sentential contexts. The behavioural results replicated previous findings in that high BOI words received a response faster than low BOI words. In addition to this, however, there was a context effect in the sensorimotor region as well as a BOI effect in the parietal region (involved in object representation). The results indicate that the sentential sensorimotor context contributes to the subsequent BOI processing and that action-and perception-related language leads to the activation of the same brain areas, which is consistent with the embodiment theory.}

Both patients were scanned prior to speech therapy (T0), after 3 months of anomia-specific rehabilitation (T1) and following 6 months of conventional language rehabilitation (T2). Irrespectively of lesion lateralization, fMRI data disclosed a grounding role for homologue naming-specific areas (respectively, LIFG and RIFG) in determining the progressive pattern of behavioural naming recovery throughout different disease phases. Thus, functional recovery, parallelled by improvement in behavioural naming performance, seems to be strictly related to recruitment of homologue areas in the hemisphere opposite to the aphasiogenic lesion.}

abstract = {Purpose
A longstanding finding in persons who stutter is that stuttering frequency significantly reduces during choral reading when compared to the solo reading condition. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this decrease in stuttering frequency may be because speech of the normal speaker dictates the speech rhythm of a person who stutters. We used an automated, sensitive acoustic technique—Envelope Modulation Spectral (EMS) analysis— that allowed us to document speech rhythm.
Method
Seventeen adults who stutter (AWS) read sentences under two conditions: solo reading and choral reading. Percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS), the rate of speech, and speech rhythm were calculated from the recorded sentences from AWS. Further, AWS speech rhythm during solo reading was compared with typical adults. EMS was extracted for the full signal and seven-octave bands. From the extracted envelope six predictor variables (peak frequency, peak amplitude, energy in the spectrum 3–6 Hz, energy in the spectrum from 0 to 4 Hz, energy in the spectrum from 4 to 10 Hz, and the ratio of energy below4 Hz/above 4 Hz) were computed.
Results
Significant decrease in stuttering frequency and rate of speech was noticed in choral reading when compared to the solo reading condition. Further, analysis of EMS results suggested the statistically significant difference between two reading conditions (for peak frequency and peak amplitude), and between two groups for all predictor variables.
Conclusion
Overall, current results highlight that decreases in stuttering during the choral reading is characterized by a decrease in rate and changes in some aspects of speech rhythm in Kannada speaking AWS.}

It is therefore important to better understand how age-related differences in neurostructural factors such as cortical thickness (CT) and cortical surface area (CSA) are related to neurophysiological sensitivity to speech cues in younger and older adults. Age-related differences in CT and CSA of bilateral auditory-related areas were extracted using FreeSurfer in younger and older adults with normal peripheral hearing. Behavioral and neurophysiological sensitivity to prosodic speech cues (word stress and fundamental frequency of oscillation) was evaluated using discrimination tasks and a passive oddball paradigm, while EEG was recorded, to quantify mismatch negativity responses. Results revealed (a) higher neural sensitivity (i.e., larger mismatch negativity responses) to word stress in older adults compared to younger adults, suggesting a higher importance of prosodic speech cues in the speech processing of older adults, and (b) lower CT in auditory-related regions in older compared to younger individuals, suggesting neuronal loss associated with aging. Within the older age group, less neuronal loss (i.e., higher CT) in a right auditory-related area (i.e., the supratemporal sulcus) was related to better performance in fundamental frequency discrimination, while higher CSA in left auditory-related areas was associated with higher neural sensitivity toward prosodic speech cues as evident in the mismatch negativity patterns. Overall, our results offer evidence for neurostructural changes in aging that are associated with differences in the extent to which left and right auditory-related areas are involved in speech processing in older adults. We argue that exploring age-related differences in brain structure and function associated with decline in speech perception in older adults may help develop much needed rehabilitation strategies for older adults with central age-related hearing loss.}

abstract = {Age-related decline in hearing abilities is a ubiquitous part of aging, and commonly impacts speech understanding, especially when there are competing sound sources. While such age effects are partially due to changes within the cochlea, difficulties typically exist beyond measurable hearing loss, suggesting that central brain processes, as opposed to simple peripheral mechanisms (e.g., hearing sensitivity), play a critical role in governing hearing abilities late into life. Current training regimens aimed to improve central auditory processing abilities have experienced limited success in promoting listening benefits. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that in young adults, musical training positively modifies neural mechanisms, providing robust, long-lasting improvements to hearing abilities as well as to non-auditory tasks that engage cognitive control. These results offer the encouraging possibility that musical training might be used to counteract age-related changes in auditory cognition commonly observed in older adults. Here, we reviewed studies that have examined the effects of age and musical experience on auditory cognition with an emphasis on auditory scene analysis. We infer that musical training may offer potential benefits to complex listening and might be utilized as a means to delay or even attenuate declines in auditory perception and cognition that often emerge later in life.

Using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) we tracked the frontal aslant tract (FAT), arcuate fasciculus (AF), and AF segments (anterior, long, posterior) in 19 typical 5–8-year-olds, an age range in which significant improvement in speech and language function occurs. While the microstructural properties of the FAT and the right AF did not show age-related differences over the age range we investigated, the left AF evidenced increasing fractional anisotropy with age. Microstructural properties of the AF in both hemispheres, however, predicted receptive and expressive language. Length of the left FAT also predicted receptive language, which provides initial suggestion that this pathway is important for language development. These findings have implications for models of language development and for models of the neurobiology of language more broadly.}

Recent work in humans suggests that exercise training induces changes in hippocampal volume, but it is not known if aerobic exercise and fitness also impact the entorhinal cortex. In animal models, aerobic exercise increases expression of growth factors, including brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). This exercise-enhanced expression of growth hormones may boost synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival and differentiation, potentially supporting function and structure in brain areas including but not limited to the hippocampus. Here, using voxel based morphometry and a standard graded treadmill test to determine cardio-respiratory fitness (Bruce protocol; ·VO2 max), we examined if entorhinal and hippocampal volumes were associated with cardio-respiratory fitness in healthy young adults (N=33). In addition, we examined if volumes were modulated by recognition memory performance and by serum BDNF, a putative marker of synaptic plasticity. Our results show a positive association between volume in right entorhinal cortex and cardio-respiratory fitness. In addition, average gray matter volume in the entorhinal cortex, bilaterally, was positively associated with memory performance. These data extend prior work on the cerebral effects of aerobic exercise and fitness to the entorhinal cortex in healthy young adults thus providing compelling evidence for a relationship between aerobic fitness and structure of the medial temporal lobe memory system.}

In previous studies, the N1 component of the ERP was shown to reflect print tuning but also to be sensitive to lexical effects. It remains unclear, however, whether these two aspects of orthographic processing occur at the same time or in different time windows during the lengthy N1 component. Moreover, it is unclear whether these processes develop late or occur already at early stages of literacy acquisition and whether this is similar for native languages and languages acquired later in life. To address these questions, 27 children were tested longitudinally, i.e. before (mean: 7.6 years) and after one year of classroom-based English instruction. Additionally, 22 adult speakers of English as a foreign language (mean: 25.1 years) were investigated. A 128-channel EEG was recorded while participants performed a one-back task with native German words, English words, pseudowords and false-font strings. The event-related EEG analysis of early and late N1 phases revealed early effects related to print tuning and late effects related to lexical processing in the native, but not in the second language of adult readers. In the absence of lexicality effects in children, print tuning effects were found across both early and late N1 segments. The temporally distinct N1 sensitivities to print and lexicality reflect temporal dynamics of visual word processing, which seem to depend on reading expertise or maturation.}

The present study aims to address this knowledge gap. The present sample included 21 adolescents with BD and 26 healthy adolescents, ages 13 to 19. Participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol using the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. Behavioral performance was similar between groups. Group differences in BOLD activation during target anticipation and feedback anticipation periods of the task were examined using whole-brain analyses, as were group differences in age effects. During both target anticipation and feedback anticipation, adolescents with BD, compared to adolescents without psychopathology, exhibited decreased engagement of frontal regions involved in cognitive control (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Healthy adolescents exhibited age-related decreases, while adolescents with BD exhibited age-related increases, in activity of other cognitive control frontal areas (i.e., right inferior frontal gyrus), suggesting altered development in the BD group. Longitudinal research is needed to examine potentially abnormal development of cognitive control during reward pursuit in adolescent BD and whether early therapeutic interventions can prevent these potential deviations from normative development.}

Most previous lexical-semantic functional MRI (fMRI) studies have been limited to single-word or word-pair tasks, outside a sentence context. Our objective was to investigate the development of lexical-semantic language networks in typically developing children using a more ‘ecological’ sentence-embedded semantic task that permitted performance monitoring while minimizing head movement by avoiding overt speech. Sixteen adults and 23 children completed two fMRI runs of an auditory lexical-semantic decision task with a button-press response, using reverse speech as control condition. Children and adults showed similar activation in bilateral temporal and left inferior frontal regions. Greater activation in adults than in children was seen in left inferior parietal, premotor, and inferior frontal regions, and in bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA). Specifically for semantically incongruous sentences, adults also showed greater activation than children in left inferior frontal cortex, possibly related to enhanced ‘top-down’ control. Age-dependent activation increases in motor-related regions were shown to be unrelated to overt motor responses, but could be associated with covert speech accompanying semantic decision. Unlike previous studies, age-dependent differences were not detected in posterior sensory cortices (such as extrastriate cortex), nor in middle temporal gyrus.}

Sixty-five children aged between 4 and 8 years, who had experienced abuse and/or neglect participated in the study. Fourteen percent were Aboriginal. A speech pathologist undertook an assessment for each child and the results were compared with the information on the Small Talk tool.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) were acquired from 33 children from lower SES and 14 children from higher SES backgrounds during a dichotic listening task. The lower SES group was followed longitudinally for one year. At age four, the higher SES group exhibited a significant attention effect (larger ERP response to attended compared to unattended condition), an effect not observed in the lower SES group. At age five, the lower SES group exhibited a significant attention effect comparable in overall magnitude to that observed in the 4-year-old higher SES group, but with poorer distractor suppression (larger response to the unattended condition). Together, these findings suggest both a maturational delay and divergent developmental pattern in neural mechanisms for selective attention in young children from lower compared to higher SES backgrounds. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of studying neurodevelopment within narrow age ranges and in children from diverse backgrounds.}

For this purpose, 46 papers published between 2002 and 2016 on text comprehension in individuals with DS were analysed and reported. It emerged that, although most people with DS learn to read, text comprehension represents an area of particular weakness. Failure in text comprehension is determined by poor oral linguistic skills (vocabulary, morphosyntax) and difficulties in cognitive abilities (inference making) as well as in verbal memory. On the other hand, text comprehension is supported by some general cognitive abilities such as the ability to learn from a context and the knowledge of the story structure. The results are discussed in relation to their theoretical account and the practical relevance for literacy teaching and intervention.}

In preschool, kindergarten, and first grade we found significant positive correlations among measures of language, phonological awareness, and letter-word knowledge, and cross-age continuity in constructs. Using path and mediational analysis, we found effects of early language on later code-related skills and grade one reading. We also found effects of code-based skills on language. Vocabulary plays a central role in carrying early language effects and is the language ability most strongly associated with early reading. Discourse abilities have direct and indirect effects on emerging language abilities. Letter-word knowledge strongly predicts later letter-word knowledge and grade one reading and decoding. We found effects of early letter-word knowledge and phonological skills awareness in prekindergarten and kindergarten on first grade reading and decoding, accounting for intelligence, age, and gender. The direct and indirect effect combination of those early skills accounted for 32.1% of the variance in first grade reading and 29.3% of the variance in first grade decoding. Early language skills accounted for 9.5% of first grade reading and 7.8% of first grade decoding. Our results call into question the assumption of the Simple View of Reading that reading comprehension draws on two strands of competence that are initially distinct.}

As these studies have only used behavioral measures, we exploited the fine-grained temporal resolution of EEG/ERPs to examine neural signatures of foreign- and native-accented sentence comprehension in older adults. Older adults, all normal-hearing monolingual English speakers, listened to foreign Chinese-accented and native English-accented sentences while ERPs were recorded. Foreign- and native-accented sentences contained semantic or pronoun errors, or were semantically and grammatically correct. We also gathered behavioral measures of sentence comprehension, and examined how neural activity during sentence processing relates to individual differences in listeners’ attitudes towards accented speakers, linguistic and cognitive skills, and hearing acuity. Older adults showed high comprehension accuracy of both foreign-accented and native-accented sentences. In contrast, ERP data showed different neural responses to foreign- and native-accented sentences: Semantic errors elicited an N400 effect in native-accented sentences, but not in foreign-accented sentences. Grammatical errors elicited a P600, not further qualified by accent type. Hearing acuity and individual differences in language attitudes, cognitive and linguistic variables did not systematically correlate with ERP patterns. These findings suggest that older adults are ultimately engaging in foreign-accented sentence comprehension, but non-native pre-lexical speech signals do not attain activation needed for strong lexical activation during online processing, resulting in strained and more effortful higher-level processing of semantics downstream the sentence.}

In this large-scale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, involving 336 subjects between the ages of 5 and 18 years, we investigated the neural correlates of covert verb generation in children. Using group independent component analysis (ICA), seven task-related components were identified including the mid-superior temporal gyrus, the most posterior aspect of the superior temporal gyrus, the parahippocampal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the angular gyrus, and medial aspect of the parietal lobule (precuneus/posterior cingulate). A highly left-lateralized component was found including the medial temporal gyrus, the frontal gyrus, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the angular gyrus. The associated independent component (IC) time courses were analyzed to investigate developmental changes in the neural elements supporting covert verb generation. Observed age effects may either reflect specific local neuroplastic changes in the neural substrates supporting language or a more global transformation of neuroplasticity in the developing brain. The results are analyzed and presented in the framework of two theoretical models for neurocognitive brain development. In this context, group ICA of fMRI data from our large sample of children aged 5–18 years provides strong evidence in support of the regionally weighted model for cognitive neurodevelopment of language networks.}

Findings suggest several themes related to relationship formation with non-parental adults, including barriers (e.g., youth's fears of being hurt) and facilitators (e.g., patience from the adult). Distinct themes were also identified relating to the ongoing development and longevity of these relationships. Youth also described multiple types of support and positive contributions to their development. Proposed intervention strategies include systematic incorporation of important non-parental adults into transition planning, enhanced training and matching procedures within formal mentoring programs, assistance for youth to strengthen their interpersonal awareness and skills, and the targeting of specific periods of need when linking youth to sources of adult support. Recommended research includes the development, pilot-testing, and evaluation of proposed strategies.}

Upon completion of the training, effects were also found on the teachers' implicit beliefs. Finally, positive ratings were received by both the pre-service and in-service teachers.}

abstract = {The estimated incidence of sensorineural hearing impairment (>40 dB HL) at birth is 1.86 per 1000 newborns in developed countries and 30–40% of these are unilateral. Profound sensorineural unilateral hearing impairment or single sided deafness (SSD) can be treated with a cochlear implant. However, this treatment is costly and invasive and unnecessary in the eyes of many. Very young children with SSD often do not exhibit language and cognitive delays and it is hard to imagine that neurocognitive skills will present difficulties with one good ear. In the current paper we review the most recent evidence on the consequences of unilateral hearing impairment for auditory and neurocognitive factors. While data of both adults and children are discussed, we focus on developmental factors, congenital deafness and a window of opportunity for intervention. We discuss which etiologies qualify for a cochlear implant and present our multi-center prospective study on cochlear implants in infants with one deaf ear. The large, state-of-the art body of research allows for evidence-based decisions regarding management of unilateral hearing loss in children.}

For example, the question “What’s that?” was coded as a basic referential question and the question “What will happen next?” was coded as a more advanced inferential question. Contingency was indicated when child contributions preceded (child-to-mother sequence) or followed (mother-to-child sequence) maternal questions at likelihoods greater than chance. Across all ethnic groups, maternal questions and child contributions were contingent on one another, with the magnitudes of mother-to-child effects being larger than child-to-mother effects. Children’s responsive contributions and mothers’ responsive questions were matched in their cognitive level. Children actively shape the inputs they receive during book-sharing interactions, and in turn benefit from questions at different cognitive levels.}

Latent change score analyses revealed positive associations between API and gains in word comprehension, both in the total sample and at all grade levels.

This paper examines how people rely, understand and trust tornado alerts and the Early Warning Systems (EWS) that disseminate them, if socio-demographics cause specific groups to experience greater risk, whether these factors have affected the rise in fatalities and what mitigation measures could reverse this. Ford County, Kansas, was selected as a case study. Interviews were conducted with officials and an online survey marketed through Facebook was undertaken, receiving 547 responses. Results showed white men were particularly vulnerable to tornadoes as they were more likely to ignore warnings. Hispanics, older people and those with tornado experience were also at higher risk if they heard an alert from an EWS they distrusted or did not understand. Population growth in these groups and technology changes have helped cause the recent fatality rise and, unless changes are made to the EWS, the continued increase in size of these groups will lead to more people becoming at risk from, or perishing in, tornadoes. Recommendations to prevent this include federal regulation and improved education materials for sirens, alerts translated into Spanish, discontinuing NOAA radio and developing an official forecast and alerting app.}

To broadly synthesize literature regarding decision aids (DAs) supporting decision making about diet, physical activity, sleeping and substance use a scoping review was performed.
Methods
Multiple sources were used: (1) Scientific literature searches, (2) excluded references from a Cochrane review regarding DAs for treatments and screenings, and (3) results from additional searches. Interventions had to (1) support informed decision making and (2) provide information and help to choose between at least two options. Two researchers screened titles and abstracts. Relevant information was extracted descriptively.
Results
Thirty-five scientific articles and four DAs (grey literature) were included. Results were heterogeneous. Twenty-nine (94%) studies described substance use DAs. All DAs offered information and value and/or preference clarification. Many other elements were included (e.g., goal-setting). DA’s effects were mixed. Few studies used standardized measures, e.g., decisional conflict (n = 4, 13%). Some positive behavioral effects were reported: e.g., smoking abstinence (n = 1).
Conclusions
This research shows only some positive behavioral effects of DAs. However, studies reported heterogeneous results/outcomes, impeding knowledge synthesis. Areas of improvement were identified, e.g., establishing which intervention elements are effective regarding health behavior decision making.
Practice implications
DAs can potentially be beneficial in supporting people to change health behaviors – especially regarding smoking.}

Our goal was to characterize (a) the implementation fidelity, to describe the teaching functions and implementation procedures for teaching those language intervention strategies and (b) the intervention fidelity with which caregivers used strategies for facilitating their children’s language development. Because training procedures are not well described in the implementation and professional development literature, a new framework was developed and its feasibility was assessed in an attempt to characterize the teaching functions and specific implementation procedures used across studies. Among the 270 intervention studies reviewed, there were 124 in which caregivers were taught to implement language intervention strategies. Teaching functions included a variety of implementation procedures, with 95% of studies sharing information, 80% incorporating modeling, 65% providing feedback, and only 18% using prompting/guiding/scaffolding. Seventy-two of these studies (58%) reported intervention fidelity, with an increasing proportion reporting fidelity in recent years. Of these 72 studies, 81% were rated as having a ‘moderate to strong’ description of fidelity measures, and 50% reported high levels of intervention fidelity (i.e., >70% fidelity). These analyses demonstrate the need for reporting more detailed and precise information on intervention fidelity and the teaching functions and procedures used to teach caregivers to implement language interventions.}

A total of 151 peer-reviewed research articles were sampled through systematic searches in four databases, covering the period 1997–2016. Inspired by critical approaches in policy analysis, we draw on the concept of problem representations to identify dominant discourses in the research material. The analysis identifies nine problem representations; absence from school, academic achievement, socioeconomic issues, cultural differences, invisibility, teachers’ competencies, hostility, segregation and misguided policy and action. The content of these problem representations suggests that Roma is often framed as either victims or problems in educational research, and that cultural differences are much more dominant as a problem representation in the field than structural aspects such as socioeconomic issues. This critical review can contribute to raise awareness regarding how we frame research questions in the field of Roma and education.}

Structural equation modeling was used to estimate paths from (a) background characteristics to student–teacher relationship quality and risky behavior, (b) temperament to student–teacher relationship quality and risky behavior, and (c) student–teacher relationship quality to risky behavior. Findings indicate that students' family income, gender, receipt of special services, and more difficult temperament were associated with risky behavior. In addition, student–teacher conflict was a mediator. Students with more difficult temperaments were more likely to report risky behavior and to have conflict in their relationships with teachers. More conflict predicted more risky behavior. Closer student–teacher relationships were associated with less risky behavior. Results suggest negative relationships, specifically student–teacher relationships, may increase the risk that certain adolescents will engage in risky behavior.}

In this paper we present the first step in developing the LeFCA framework, that will be used for teaching children with autism basic skills and concepts. Within the pilot project, we produced four games for developing matching, pointing out (based on visual and auditory stimuli) and labeling skills, which are considered to be primary skills needed for learning. The results of our preliminary study showed that the created software in native language is completely clear and user friendly for kids with Autism and other special needs, and that is systematically and developmentally appropriately sequenced for learning. Additionally, we found that children were able to generalize learned skills, through a transfer to a new medium or environment without any needed training (i.e. computer). All four participants mastered all programs without any instructional tactic needed.}

Despite this, educational performance in children with CI continues to lag behind their hearing peers. From animal models and human neuroimaging studies it has been proposed the integrative functions of auditory cortex are compromised by crossmodal plasticity. This has been argued to result partly from the use of a visual language. Here we argue that ‘cochlear implant sensitive periods’ comprise both auditory and language sensitive periods, and thus cannot be fully described with animal models. Despite prevailing assumptions, there is no evidence to link the use of a visual language to poorer CI outcome. Crossmodal reorganisation of auditory cortex occurs regardless of compensatory strategies, such as sign language, used by the deaf person. In contrast, language deprivation during early sensitive periods has been repeatedly linked to poor language outcomes. Language sensitive periods have largely been ignored when considering variation in CI outcome, leading to ill-founded recommendations concerning visual language in CI habilitation.}

abstract = {Gestures accompany speech and enrich human communication. When aphasia interferes with verbal abilities, gestures become even more relevant, compensating for and/or facilitating verbal communication. However, small-scale clinical studies yielded diverging results with regard to a therapeutic gesture benefit for lexical retrieval. Based on recent functional neuroimaging results, delineating a speech-gesture integration network for lexical learning in healthy adults, we hypothesized that the commonly observed variability may stem from differential patholinguistic profiles in turn depending on lesion pattern. Therefore we used a controlled novel word learning paradigm to probe the impact of gestures on lexical learning, in the lesioned language network. Fourteen patients with chronic left hemispheric lesions and mild residual aphasia learned 30 novel words for manipulable objects over four days. Half of the words were trained with gestures while the other half were trained purely verbally. For the gesture condition, rootwords were visually presented (e.g., Klavier, [piano]), followed by videos of the corresponding gestures and the auditory presentation of the novel words (e.g., /krulo/). Participants had to repeat pseudowords and simultaneously reproduce gestures. In the verbal condition no gesture-video was shown and participants only repeated pseudowords orally. Correlational analyses confirmed that gesture benefit depends on the patholinguistic profile: lesser lexico-semantic impairment correlated with better gesture-enhanced learning. Conversely largely preserved segmental-phonological capabilities correlated with better purely verbal learning. Moreover, structural MRI-analysis disclosed differential lesion patterns, most interestingly suggesting that integrity of the left anterior temporal pole predicted gesture benefit. Thus largely preserved semantic capabilities and relative integrity of a semantic integration network are prerequisites for successful use of the multimodal learning strategy, in which gestures may cause a deeper semantic rooting of the novel word-form. The results tap into theoretical accounts of gestures in lexical learning and suggest an explanation for the diverging effect in therapeutical studies advocating gestures in aphasia rehabilitation.}

abstract = {We describe MH who presents with agrammatic aphasia and anomia, and who produces semantic errors in the absence of a central semantic impairment. This pattern of performance implies damage to syntactic processes operating between semantics and phonological output. Damage here may lead to lexical selection errors and a deficit in combining words to form phrases. We investigated MH's knowledge and processing of noun syntax in mass and count nouns. She produced more count nouns than mass nouns. She showed impaired knowledge of noun syntax in judgement tasks and production tasks, with mass noun syntax being more impaired than count. We interpret these results in terms of a two-stage model of lexical retrieval. We propose that syntactic information represented at the lemma level is activated even in bare noun production, and can be differentially impaired across noun categories. That same damage can lead to semantic errors in production. For MH limited syntactic options are available to support production, and these favour count noun production. The data provide a new account of output semantic errors.}

To answer this question, we review research on the neural correlates of colour categories, and categorical responses in preverbal infants and non-human animals. With respect to language, the reviewed findings suggest that colour categorisation often involves automatic language processing. At the same time, evidence from non-human animals, infants, and patients with brain lesions indicates that colour categorisation may also occur in the absence of language. Concerning perception, there is little convincing evidence that the bottom-up processes of colour perception are the origin of colour categories. Instead, colour categorisation might simply build upon the continuous colour perception and interact with perception through the direction of attention to colour differences that are relevant to categorisation. We make three suggestions for future research. First, future research in all areas requires methodological improvements, in particular in stimulus control. Second, future research should overcome the universalist-realist debate and go beyond a simple contrast between perception and language. Third, the link between object colours and colour categories provides an alternative approach that might reveal the ecological origin of colour categories. The ecological approach promises establishing evolutionary and developmental continuity between categorical responses in non-human animals, infants and adult humans.}

Traditional neurological models of language were based on a single neural pathway (the dorsal pathway underpinned by the arcuate fasciculus). Contemporary neuroscience indicates that anterior temporal regions and the “ventral” language pathway also make a significant contribution, yet there is no computationally-implemented model of the dual pathway, nor any synthesis of normal and aphasic behavior. The “Lichtheim 2” model was implemented by developing a new variety of computational model which reproduces and explains normal and patient data but also incorporates neuroanatomical information into its architecture. By bridging the “mind-brain” gap in this way, the resultant “neurocomputational” model provides a unique opportunity to explore the relationship between lesion location and behavioral deficits, and to provide a platform for simulating functional neuroimaging data.}

The properties of the Italian nominal system were exploited since it allows to explore exhaustively fine-grained phenomena in the inflectional processing. An event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment was carried out where Italian masculine and feminine nouns were visually presented to 50 healthy participants in an overt inflectional task: the generation of the plural from the singular and vice versa. The grammatical gender and the citation form suffix of nouns were manipulated in a factorial design. Functional data showed that inflectional operations for nouns activate an extensive cortical network involving the left inferior and right superior frontal gyri, the left and right middle temporal gyri, the posterior cingulate cortex and the cerebellum. Activations were variably modulated by the distributional features of gender-dependent properties of nouns. Particularly, cortical activity increased during inflectional operations for small and/or scarcely consistent inflectional classes. These findings demonstrate the relevance of specific morphological (inflectional suffixes) and distributional features (size and consistency) shared by groups of words (inflectional classes) in a language, particularly when implementing cognitive operations required for language processing.}

Paradoxically, insight is associated with positive outcomes, such as better treatment adherence and recovery, and negative outcomes, such as depression, hopelessness, low self-esteem, and quality of life. Self-stigma as a moderating variable can be decisive whether more insight leads to better or worse outcome. On the other hand, self-stigma can act as a mediator between insight and outcomes. We therefore examined self-stigma both as a moderator and a mediator.
Methods
Insight, self-stigma, demoralization, symptoms, and functioning were assessed among 145 outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders using questionnaires and structured interviews. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the cross-sectional data.
Results
Results confirmed self-stigma as a moderator: The association of insight and demoralization was stronger as self-stigma increased. Self-stigma also partially mediated the positive relationship between insight and demoralization. Moreover, demoralization fully mediated the adverse associations of self-stigma with psychotic symptoms and global functioning.
Discussion
Given the decisive role of self-stigma regarding the detrimental consequences of insight, interventions should address self-stigma, particularly if psychoeducational or other interventions have increased insight. Therapeutic implications for changes of dysfunctional beliefs related to illness and self and change of self-concept in the context of recovery at the level of narrative identity are discussed.}

abstract = {Introduction
Logopenic progressive aphasia (lv-PPA) is a form of primary progressive aphasia and is predominantly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The neuropsychological profiles of lv-PPA and typical clinical AD are, however, distinct. In particular, these two syndromes differ on attention span measures, where auditory attention span is more impaired in lv-PPA than in AD and visuospatial span appears more impaired in AD than in lv-PPA. The neural basis of these span profiles, however, remains unclear.
Method
Sixteen lv-PPA and 21 AD matched patients, and 15 education-matched healthy controls were recruited. All participants were assessed by a neurologist and completed a neuropsychological assessment that included the Wechsler Memory Scale–III Digit and Spatial Span tasks, and underwent a high-resolution structural brain MRI to conduct cortical thickness analyses.
Results
Patient groups were impaired on all span tasks compared to Controls. In addition, performance on Digit Span Forward (DSF) was significantly lower in the lv-PPA than the AD group, while Spatial Span Forward (SSF) was significantly lower in the AD than the lv-PPA group. No differences were found between patient groups on the Digit or Spatial Span Backward tasks. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that reduced DSF performance correlated to thinning of the left superior temporal gyrus in the lv-PPA group, whereas reduced SSF performance was related to bilateral precentral sulcus and parieto-occipital thinning in the AD group. Analyses of the backward span tasks revealed that reduced Spatial Span Backward (SSB) performance in the lv-PPA group related to cortical thinning of the left superior parietal lobule.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates that while lv-PPA and AD commonly share the same underlying neuropathology, their span profiles are distinct and are mediated by divergent patterns of cortical degeneration.}

It investigates how Gyeongsang-Korean (GK) and Seoul-Korean (SK) listeners process English lexical stress. GK does not have lexical stress but has lexical pitch accents, whereas SK has neither; GK listeners are thus hypothesized to be more sensitive to pitch as a cue to lexical contrasts than SK listeners. GK and SK listeners completed a task in which they recalled four-item sequences of Korean words differing suprasegmentally (pitch accent contrast) or segmentally (phonemic contrast). The results showed a significant L1-by-contrast-type interaction, with GK listeners outperforming SK listeners in the pitch accent contrast condition. These results confirm GK listeners’ greater sensitivity to pitch in the L1. The same GK and SK listeners, who were matched in English proficiency, and native English listeners completed a similar task with English words differing suprasegmentally (stress contrast) or segmentally (phonemic contrast). The results showed a significant L1-by-contrast-type interaction, with GK listeners outperforming SK (and English) listeners in the stress-contrast condition. These results provide robust evidence for a cue-based transfer approach to L2 lexical stress processing.}

Building on this assumption, we contrastively examined the 4-, 5-, and 6-word lexical bundles in a 4,370,630-word corpus comprising RAs in psychology (RAP) divided into two sub-corpora: English corpus (EC) and Persian corpus (PC). Four hundred and sixteen (254 4-word, 115 5-word, and 47 6-word) and 316 (116 4-word, 104 5-word, and 96 6-word) lexical bundles were identified in EC and PC, respectively. Thirty-seven 4-word, 16 5-word, and 8 6-word lexical bundles were shared between EC and PC, respectively. The findings also showed that Persian writers employed fewer lexical bundles, using them structurally and functionally differently than did English writers.

The clinical evidence for the transmodal function of vATL is largely based on studies of semantic dementia patients with severe anomia, who also show impaired performance on nonverbal tasks that involve the retrieval of knowledge about objects and their prototypical use, such as the production of tool use pantomimes. Yet, evidence from patients with apraxia and functional neuroimaging studies in healthy adults does not implicate vATL in pantomime production. We, therefore, compared semantic retrieval of object-action associations for overt verb and pantomime production from picture and word stimuli. Our results show that, independent of stimulus modality, the retrieval of object-action associations for verb, but not pantomime, production is related to activity in bilateral vATL. Bilateral vATL activation was also observed for meaningless verbal responses that did not require the retrieval of object-action associations. Taken together, our results suggest that bilateral vATL is not engaged in the retrieval of object-action associations per se, but rather supports semantic representations that are functionally specialized for language. These findings have implications for the semantic cognition framework and our understanding of the dependence of conceptual knowledge on language.}

Meta-analytic structural equation modelling showed two distinct but related pathways from preschool linguistic comprehension abilities to reading comprehension in school. One pathway consists of code-related skills (letter knowledge and phonological awareness), and it affects reading comprehension through word recognition. A second pathway consists of linguistic comprehension skills (vocabulary and grammar), and it has a direct influence on reading comprehension. Early interventions to facilitate language development appear to provide a promising approach to facilitate the later development of reading comprehension skills.}

Participants made choices between gambles, each with monetary outcomes. After every choice, subjects learned the consequences of both gambles and rated their emotional response to the outcome. Normal subjects and lesion control subjects tended to make better choices and reported post-decision emotions that were sensitive to regret comparisons. VMPFC patients tended to make worse choices, and, contrary to our predictions, they reported emotions that were sensitive to regret comparisons. In contrast, LOFC patients made better choices, but reported emotional reactions that were insensitive to regret comparisons.

Dentro del desarrollo intelectual de estos niños, el desarrollo del lenguaje juega un papel muy importante, pues es la base de un desenvolvimiento futuro seguro, a nivel social y emocional. Debido a las condiciones que rodean a la adopción, los niños y niñas adoptados pueden presentar trayectorias de desarrollo retrasadas o diferentes a las de los que viven con sus familias biológicas en hogares monolingües o multilingües. Dentro de la población de niños adoptados, los padres y educadores de los niños provenientes de adopción internacional (NAI) pueden encontrar incertidumbre a la hora de decidir si es necesaria, y cuándo, una intervención profesional temprana.

Esta evidencia nos indicará el nivel de desarrollo típico para cada edad en los NAI, así como los avances que cabe esperar tras una intervención profesional.
There has been a significant increase in international adoption in the last few years, with nearly 46% being 1-to-4-year-old children. Given the special conditions of vulnerability that children adopted from abroad experience from birth, and the variety of contexts to which they arrive upon adoption, an exhaustive study of factors influencing their social and cognitive development is necessary (with the aim of strengthening those that promote it). Language development plays an important role in children's general development, since it is the foundation of their future security at a social and emotional level. Because of the special conditions surrounding international adoption, children adopted from abroad may present delayed or different trajectories from children growing up with their biological families (in monolingual or multilingual homes). With children adopted from abroad, parents and educators can run into difficulties when deciding if and when they should seek professional intervention. A solid evidence-based practice can overcome such uncertainty, indicating the typical development for children in each age group and the expected result after professional intervention.}

This raised the issue of how the intrinsic organization of Broca's region effects by different language experiences in light of its subdivisions. To address this question, we used multi-center resting-state fMRI data to explore the cross-cultural consistency and diversity of Broca's region in terms of its subdivisions, connectivity patterns and modularity organization in Chinese and German speakers. A consistent topological organization of the 13 subdivisions within the extended Broca's region was revealed on the basis of a new in-vivo parcellation map, which corresponded well to the previously reported receptorarchitectonic map. Based on this parcellation map, consistent functional connectivity patterns and modularity organization of these subdivisions were found. Some cultural difference in the functional connectivity patterns was also found, for instance stronger connectivity in Chinese subjects between area 6v2 and the motor hand area, as well as higher correlations between area 45p and middle frontal gyrus. Our study suggests that a generally invariant organization of Broca's region, together with certain regulations of different language experiences on functional connectivity, might exists to support language processing in human brain.}

The main goal is to determine the best combination of different mention classifiers and the most relevant set of features for anaphora resolution.

Experiments on the benchmark datasets of ICON-2011 Shared Task on Anaphora Resolution in Indian Languages show that our proposed approach attains good level of accuracies, which are often better with respect to the state-of-the-art systems. It achieves the F-measure values of 71.89%, 59.61%, 52.55% 34.45% and 72.52% for Muc, Bcub, Ceafm, Ceafe and Blanc, respectively, for Bengali language. For Hindi we obtain the F-measure values of 33.27%, 63.06%, 49.59%, 49.06% and 55.45% for Muc, Bcub, Ceafm, Ceafe and Blanc metrics, respectively. In order to further show the efficacy of our proposed algorithm, we evaluate with Tamil, a language that belongs to a different family. This shows the F-measure values of 31.79%, 64.67%, 46.81%, 45.29% and 52.80% for Muc, Bcub, Ceafm, Ceafe and Blanc metrics, respectively. Experiments on Dutch show the F-measure values of 17.67%, 74.43%, 58.08%, 59.21% and 55.58% for Muc, Bcub, Ceafm, Ceafe and Blanc metrics, respectively.}

The relationships between sub-components of premorbid adjustment and outcomes on symptoms and cognition in first-episode schizophrenia were under-studied. In the current study, we prospectively followed up 93 patients aged 18–55 years presenting with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. Psychopathological and cognitive assessments were conducted at baseline, clinical stabilization, 12, 24 and 36 months. Premorbid adjustment was sub-divided into discrete functional domains, developmental stages and premorbid-course types based on ratings of the Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS). The study focused on early developmental stages to minimize contamination by prodromal symptoms. Results indicated that gender differences in premorbid functioning were primarily related to early-adolescence adjustment and academic domain. Social domain was more strongly related to negative symptoms, while academic domain was more consistently linked to cognitive outcome (Wisconsin Card Sorting test and verbal fluency). Patients with stable-poor premorbid course had more severe negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. In conclusion, in a Chinese cohort of first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, sub-components of early premorbid adjustment were shown to be differentially related to clinical and cognitive measures. The results highlighted the importance of applying a more refined delineation of premorbid functioning in studying illness outcome.}

The current study investigates the development of different working memory components (phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, central executive), the influence of different aspects of the teacher-student relationship (closeness, conflict, dependency) and its predictive value for academic achievement (reading, spelling, mathematics) across the transition from kindergarten to first grade. The sample consisted of 107 kindergarten children. Working memory tasks were administered at the end of kindergarten and first grade. Teachers reported on teacher-student relationship quality in the middle of first grade. Standardized tests were used to assess academic achievement at the end of first grade. Results indicate moderate to large increases in the phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad and large gains in the central executive. Dependency of the student towards the teacher significantly predicted visuospatial sketchpad performance at the end of first grade. Reading was significantly predicted by the visuospatial sketchpad and phonological loop in kindergarten, while for spelling the visuospatial sketchpad was important. Finally, mathematics was predicted by performance on the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad. The current study indicates the importance of the affective quality of the teacher-student relationship for working memory performance, which in turn is important for academic achievement. It is therefore critical to attend to the early detection and prevention or intervention of working memory problems in the classroom in order to prevent future academic problems. Additionally, maintaining a positive relationship with students and encouraging their independent exploration may be important when preventing such problems, complementary to cognitive or other types of training and intervention.}

It questions the validity of the results obtained with the Weird Word Order methodology (Akhtar, 1999) in which children are presented with ungrammatical sentences. These results have previously been considered as major evidence for the constructivist, usage-based approach to word order development according to which young children initially encode word order as a verb-specific lexical property which only slowly develops into abstract knowledge at age 3 or 4 (e.g., Abbot-Smith et al., 2001, Matthews et al., 2005, Matthews et al., 2007). The critical review presented here addresses various problems with the results and their interpretation. The discussion questions the relationship between theory and data as well as methodological issues related to the small number of observations and the discarding of data not missing at random. It is argued that the data not only fail to support the constructivist account, but they actually bring evidence for the alternative hypothesis according to which children, from early on, represent word order abstractly.}

The multi-layered architecture takes as input raw images of objects (referents) and streams of word’s phonemes (labels), builds an adequate representation, recognizes the current context, and associates label with referents incrementally, by employing a Self-Organizing Map which creates new association nodes (prototypes) as required, adjusts the existing prototypes to better represent the input stimuli and removes prototypes that become obsolete/unused. The model takes into account the current context to retrieve the correct meaning of words with multiple meanings. Simulations show that the model can reach up to 78% of word–referent association accuracy in ambiguous situations and approximates well the learning rates of humans as reported by three different authors in five Cross-Situational Word Learning experiments, also displaying similar learning patterns in the different learning conditions.}

Latent growth models indicated that both Spanish and English proficiency in kindergarten predicted levels of English reading in third through eighth grade, but that only English proficiency was uniquely predictive. English productive vocabulary was found to be a better predictor of later English reading than more complex measures, i.e., listening comprehension and story retell, contrary to findings for native English speakers. Oral language did not predict later growth rates. Findings suggest the need for educational efforts to develop oral language during early childhood for this underserved population. Findings further suggest that such early efforts may be necessary, but insufficient to accelerate ELLs' reading trajectories as they move into adolescence.}

abstract = {Previous research has shown that Danish-learning children lag behind in early lexical acquisition compared with children learning a number of other languages. This delay has been ascribed to the opaque phonetic structure of Danish, which appears to have fewer reliable segmentation cues than other closely related languages. In support of this hypothesis, recent work has shown that the phonetic properties of Danish negatively affect online language processing in young Danish children. In this study, we used eye-tracking to investigate whether the challenges associated with processing Danish also affect how Danish-learning children between 24 and 35 months of age establish and learn novel label–object mappings. The children were presented with a series of novel mappings, either ostensively (one novel object presented alone on the screen) or ambiguously (one novel object presented together with a familiar one), through carrier phrases with different phonetic structures (more vs less opaque). Our results showed two main trends. First, Danish-learning children performed poorly on the task of mapping novel labels onto novel objects. Second, when learning did occur, accuracy was affected by the phonetic opacity of the speech stimuli. We suggest that this finding results from the interplay of a perceptually challenging speech input and a slower onset of early vocabulary experience, which in turn may delay the onset of word learning skills in Danish-learning children.}

An eye-tracker recorded children’s attention to videos while they were taught novel words with a gaze cue or an arrow cue. Videos included objects when they were static or when they were manipulated to demonstrate the object’s function. Word learning was measured immediately after videos and one week later. In contrast to an arrow cue, children in both groups looked longer at a gaze cue and had more contingent looks from the gaze cue to the referent. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that across both groups, children with higher versus lower social competence skills recalled more semantic features about the referent in the gaze condition. We discuss how these findings add to our theoretical understanding of how gaze supports word learning.}

Additionally, performance in these three areas was used to predict early school achievement (in terms of mathematics, reading, and spelling) at the end of participants’ first grade. Correlational analyses and structural equation modeling revealed that fine motor skills, non-verbal intelligence and executive functioning were significantly interrelated. Both fine motor skills and intelligence had significant links to later school achievement. However, when executive functioning was additionally included into the prediction of early academic achievement, fine motor skills and non-verbal intelligence were no longer significantly associated with later school performance suggesting that executive functioning plays an important role for the motor-cognitive performance link.}

The current study aimed at investigating the behavioural and neurobiological predictors of advanced L2 learning. Our behavioural results showed that phonetic coding ability and empathy, but not phonological working memory, predict L2 pronunciation aptitude in advanced learners. Second, functional neuroimaging revealed this behavioural trait to be correlated with hemodynamic responses of the cerebral network of speech motor control and auditory-perceptual areas. We suggest that the acquisition of L2 pronunciation aptitude is a dynamic process, requiring a variety of neural resources at different processing stages over time.}

To assess the involvement of inhibition, we conducted delta plot analyses of naming RTs and examined the N2 component of the ERP. We found longer mean naming RTs and a larger N2 amplitude in the low relative to the high name agreement condition. For action naming we found a negative correlation between the slopes of the slowest delta segment and the difference in N2 amplitude between the low and high name agreement conditions.

abstract = {Purpose
In this descriptive study, phonological processes were examined in the speech of children aged 5;0–7;6 (years; months) with mild to profound hearing loss using hearing aids (HAs) and cochlear implants (CIs), in comparison to their peers. A second aim was to compare phonological processes of HA and CI users.
Method
Children with hearing loss (CWHL, N = 25) were compared to children with normal hearing (CWNH, N = 30) with similar age, gender, linguistic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Speech samples obtained from a list of 88 words, derived from three standardized speech tests, were analyzed using the CASALA (Computer Aided Speech and Language Analysis) program to evaluate participants’ phonological systems, based on lax (a process appeared at least twice in the speech of at least two children) and strict (a process appeared at least five times in the speech of at least two children) counting criteria.
Results
Developmental phonological processes were eliminated in the speech of younger and older CWNH while eleven developmental phonological processes persisted in the speech of both age groups of CWHL. CWHL showed a similar trend of age of elimination to CWNH, but at a slower rate. Children with HAs and CIs produced similar phonological processes. Final consonant deletion, weak syllable deletion, backing, and glottal replacement were present in the speech of HA users, affecting their overall speech intelligibility.
Conclusions
Developmental and non-developmental phonological processes persist in the speech of children with mild to profound hearing loss compared to their peers with typical hearing. The findings indicate that it is important for clinicians to consider phonological assessment in pre-school CWHL and the use of evidence-based speech therapy in order to reduce non-developmental and non-age-appropriate developmental processes, thereby enhancing their speech intelligibility.}
