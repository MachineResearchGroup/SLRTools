abstract = {A filtering method called Grid Filtration Filter (GFF) is proposed based on Bayesian inference. First, we select the high-probability region of the current state according to the confidence parameter α, and obtain samples uniformly in this region. Second, these samples are regarded as discretized “potential states” and their posterior weights are calculated based on the Bayesian inference. Third, the grid filtration method is used to choose these “potential states” with high weights, and these selected “potential states” and their normalized weights are used to represent the posterior distribution, and thus estimate the state. we finally verify the feasibility of the GFF algorithm in a typical two-dimensional linear non-Gaussian filtering scenario. Results show that the GFF has a slightly better accuracy than the particle filter (PF) algorithm, and the calculation speed is better by a factor of approximately 45 compared with the PF with 10,000 particles. We finally validate the GFF algorithm in a collaborative target tracking scenario. Results show that the accuracy of the GFF estimation is slightly better than that of the extended Kalman filtering and that of the unscented Kalman filtering, while the advantage of the estimation accuracy of velocity and acceleration is more obvious.}

abstract = {By combining integral sliding mode control with nonlinear H∞ optimal control theory, a novel nonlinear control scheme is proposed for uncertain nonlinear systems with actuator faults and unmatched disturbances. The effect of the actuator faults and the separated matched disturbance component can be reduced by a properly designed discontinuous sliding mode controller, while unmatched disturbance component is attenuated by a nonlinear H∞ control obtained by approximately solving HJI equations for equivalent sliding mode dynamics. An adaptive dynamic program (ADP) algorithm based on three neural networks (NNs) is applied to solve the HJI equation. Lyapunov techniques are used to demonstrate the convergence of the NN weight errors in the sense of uniform ultimate bounded. Some simulation results are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed control scheme.}

abstract = {The path planning of UAV deals with the process of figuring the most optimal path from the source to the destination and avoiding obstacles on course to avoid collisions in a given environment. This particular problem is classified as an optimisation problem in high dimension and comes under the category of NP-Hard. Due to the usage of UAVs in many domains like the army, communications, security, disaster management, survey mapping etc., the provisioning of time efficiency as well as accuracy is a critical and challenging task in a 3-D environment. Moreover, the ability of the UAVs can be enhanced if there is coordination between them to find the best cost-effective target in a dynamic manner. However, a majority of the solutions reported theoretically are not efficient concerning time efficiency, accuracy and coordination simultaneously for many applications. Drawing motivation from this, the paper gives a novel way of solving the problem of planning of path for UAVs in 3-D while maintaining the coordination for choosing the target. A new algorithm based on Multiverse optimizer (MVO) algorithm is applied to the problem. Munkres algorithm is applied for coordination of UAVs in case of multiple targets. By carrying out the simulations, on three different maps over 50 iterations the results shows that MVO algorithm perform better in the most of the cases for finding optimized path cost with minimum average execution time when compared to meta-heuristics GSO and BBO.}

At present, several artificial intelligence (AI) projects in a single business field are competing with each other, and the interfaces between the systems lack unified specifications. Therefore, it is imperative to establish a comprehensive service platform. In this paper, an AI platform framework for power fields is proposed; it adopts the deep learning technology to support natural language processing and computer vision services. On one hand, it can provide an algorithm, a model, and service support for power- enterprise applications, and on the other hand, it can provide a large number of heterogeneous data processing, algorithm libraries, intelligent services, model managements, typical application scenarios, and other services for different levels of business personnel. The establishment of the platform framework could break data barrier, improve portability of technology, avoid the investment waste caused by repeated constructions, and lay the foundation for the construction of “platform + application + service” ecological chain.}

The present study examined classification accuracies for ANNs trained on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded while participants performed the same (within task) and different (cross) tasks for short periods of time with little or no prior exposure to the tasks. Participants performed three working memory tasks at two difficulty levels with order of task and difficulty level counterbalanced.

In this paper, we study the problem of offloading decision and system design in the intelligent secure mobile edge computing (MEC) system with a UAV eavesdropper, where the eavesdropper can overhear the secure computational task from the user to the computational access point (CAP). The proposed framework is aimed to ensure the physical-layer security and decrease the latency and energy consumption in communication and computation. We firstly formulate the optimization of the MEC networks as a multi-objective optimization problem and then use a linear combination of the latency and energy consumption to measure the system cost. We devise an adaptive offloading strategy by incorporating the wireless bandwidth allocation and the transmit power allocation among users through the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. In particular, we propose a deep Q-network (DQN) based strategy to automatically solve the optimization problem by designing the system state, action, and the reward function at detail. At last, we demonstrate the usefulness of the considered intelligent offloading strategy for the design of the MEC networks by comparing with the other schemes. The proposed strategy can perform significant system cost saving of the considered MEC networks.}

The UAV's position, attitude, and velocity relative to the runway and the ship motion information are estimated. The ship motion information is utilized to predict the position of the intended landing point at the touchdown moment through the Autoregressive algorithm.

However, due to their high dimensional, both robust and intelligent methods are required to extract information from these datasets. Therefore, we explore the processing of hyperspectral data with artificial intelligence methods joined with clustering techniques to detect insect herbivory damage in maize plants. We measured the leaf spectral response from three different groups of maize plants: control (undamaged plants); damaged by Spodoptera frugiperda herbivory, and damaged by Dichelops meiacanthus. Data were collected with a FieldSpec 3.0 Spectroradiometer from 350 to 2500 nm for eight consecutive days. We adjusted eight machine learning methods. We also determined the most contributive wavelengths to differentiate undamaged from damaged plants by insect herbivore attack using clustering strategy. For that, we applied the clusterization method based on a self-organizing map (SOM). The Random Forest (RF) model is the overall best learner, and up to the 5th day of analysis represents the most adequate day to segregate maize undamaged from damaged maize. RF was able to separate the three groups of treatments with an F1-measure of up to 96.7% (Recall of 96.7% and Precision of 96.7%). Additionally, we found out that the most representative spectral regions are located in the near-infrared range. Our approach consists of an original contribution to early differentiate the undamaged plant from the damaged one due to insect-attack, highlighting the most contributive wavelengths to map this occurrence.}

Due to the nature of this kind of node, the structure of a FANET is dynamic, changing very often. Since it has applications in military scenarios and other mission-critical systems, an agile and reliable network is essential with robust and efficient routing protocols. Nonetheless, maintaining an acceptable network delay generated by the selection of routes remains a considerable challenge, owing to the nodes’ high mobility. This article addresses this problem by proposing a routing scheme based on an improved Q-Learning algorithm to reduce network delay in scenarios with high-mobility, called Q-FANET. This proposal has its performance evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art methods using the WSNET simulator. The experiments provide evidence that the Q-FANET presents lower delay, a minor increase in packet delivery ratio, and significant lower jitter compared with other reinforcement learning-based routing protocols.}

A prominent hurdle on this path arises from the multiscale, multiphysics, dynamic, and stochastic nature of many manufacturing systems, which motivated many innovations at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics, and manufacturing sciences. This study reviews recent advances in Mechanistic-AI, defined as a methodology that combines the raw mathematical power of AI methods with mechanism-driven principles and engineering insights. Mechanistic-AI solutions are systematically analyzed for three aspects of manufacturing processes, i.e., modeling, design, and control, with a focus on approaches that can improve data requirements, generalizability, explainability, and capability to handle challenging and heterogeneous manufacturing data. Additionally, we introduce a corpus of cutting-edge Mechanistic-AI methods that have shown to be very promising in other scientific fields but yet to be applied in manufacturing. Finally, gaps in the knowledge and under-explored research directions are identified, such as lack of incorporating manufacturing constraints into AI methods, lack of uncertainty analysis, and limited reproducibility and established benchmarks. This paper shows the immense potential of the Mechanistic-AI to address new problems in manufacturing systems and is expected to drive further advancements in manufacturing and related fields.}

abstract = {The idea of cooperative carrying using a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been viewed as a widely applicable and deployable use of unmanned multi-agent systems, yet there are very few working systems that can successfully perform such tasks due to the complexities involved. One of the primary challenges is the limited control authority of the cooperative team due to the scale of the individual agents being necessarily much smaller than the load. Here, we propose a general method that can be used to optimise the control authority of a UAV team in the case where the agents are rigidly mounted to the payload. Firstly, a tilt angle for each UAV relative to the payload is introduced to improve the yaw control of the system, as a large wide payload will invariably have a large moment of inertia in the yaw axis. The positional placement of the UAVs and the value of the tilt angle that maximises control authority was then found using an evolutionary algorithm. The optimised solution based on a case study task involves using four UAVs placed at the corner of a square payload with an inward tilt, which can be effectively controlled as a single large quadrotor. Testing results show that the full system carrying the payload can execute given trajectories autonomously with high accuracy and precision, effectively performing the task of cooperative carrying. The proposed system was successfully demonstrated at the 2017 International Micro Air Vehicles Competition.}

Further, the tree fruit architecture contributes to the light interception and improves tree growth, fruit quality, and fruit yield, in addition to easing the process of orchard management and harvest. Currently tree architectural traits are measured manually by researchers or growers, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, the remote sensing techniques were evaluated to phenotype critical architectural traits with the final goal to assist tree fruit breeders, physiologists and growers in collecting architectural traits efficiently and in a standardized manner. For this, a consumer-grade red–green–blue (RGB) camera was used to collect apple tree side-images, while an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) integrated RGB camera was programmed to image tree canopy at 15 m above ground level to evaluate multiple tree fruit architectures. The sensing data were compared to ground reference data associated with tree orchard blocks within three training systems (Spindle, V-trellis, Bi-axis), two rootstocks (‘WA 38 trees grafted on G41 and M9-Nic29) and two pruning methods (referred as bending and click pruning). The data were processed to extract architectural features from ground-based 2D images and UAV-based 3D digital surface model. The traits extracted from sensing data included box-counting fractal dimension (DBs), middle branch angle, number of branches, trunk basal diameter, and tree row volume (TRV). The results from ground-based sensing data indicated that there was a significant (P < 0.0001) difference in DBs between Spindle and V-trellis training systems, and correlations between DBs with tree height (r = 0.79) and total fruit yield per unit area (r = 0.74) were significant (P < 0.05). Moreover, correlations between average or total TRV and ground reference data, such as tree height and total fruit yield per unit area, were significant (P < 0.05). With the reported findings, this study demonstrated the potential of sensing techniques for phenotyping tree fruit architectural traits.}

By adding a feedforward component to the networks, and by tuning their weights using recursive least squares, we can drastically reduce the number of hidden layer neurons while reducing their error. We demonstrate the improvement in the performance of ESN and compare their performance to that of WNN by application to the identification of an un-manned vehicle. Different ESN and WNN are utilized to identify the model of the vehicle and examine the effects of adding a feedforward term to ESN and WNN. Simulation results shows that adding a feedforward term to ESN and WNN can reduce the number of hidden nodes drastically while reducing the identification error of ESN. Because the number of internal units in ESN can be very high for nonlinear systems, adding this term makes ESN more suitable for online identification and control applications. Our results show that, even though both networks yield acceptable performance, ESN outperform WNN in terms of accuracy but have a slightly higher computational cost.}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide alternatives to manned aircraft and walk-over (WO) surveys. To support coastal managers with method selection, we compare the costs and benefits of the three techniques using the extent of bait collection (sediment scarring from manual digging) on intertidal mudflats from three UK sites. UAV and WO surveys were conducted in parallel and aerial photography was downloaded from the Channel Coastal Observatory (CCO). Digging was digitised from estimations on foot (WO) or by manually labelling imagery with confidence assigned (UAV/CCO). Method efficacy is compared with respect to spatial coverage, control over survey time/location, spatial resolution, positioning accuracy, and area of digging detected. Personnel hours and up-front costs (e.g. training/equipment), costs for personnel time standardised by shore area, personnel risk, and environmental impact are also compared. Regarding efficacy, CCO imagery had extensive shore coverage compared to UAV and WO, however, assessments are restricted to times/locations with available imagery. Each method's resolution was sufficient to detect digging. WO achieved the highest resolution (on foot), but the lowest positioning accuracy, in contrast to accurate feature delineation on aerial imagery. An additive two-way ANOVA revealed a significantly higher percent area of ‘dug’ sediment (all confidence levels) recorded by UAV than WO. CCO was the most cost-effective with no fieldwork/equipment costs. UAV had the highest up-front costs, but WO was more costly for personnel hours/km2 for survey time and digitisation. For all methods, digitisation was the most time-consuming aspect. Compared to WO, UAV achieved rapid shore surveys and the CCO and UAV methods minimise personnel risks. UAV and WO both cause wildlife disturbance, with trampling an additional WO impact. With each method suited to sediment disturbance assessment, selection will depend on resources and objectives and will be aided by this holistic cost-benefit analysis. Cost-effectiveness will improve with evolving regulations that facilitate UAV use and technological developments (e.g. machine learning for disturbance detection) that could significantly expedite imagery analysis and enable broadscale assessments from CCO or satellite imagery.}

SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis allowed us to study the individual predictions of the models, which is the most important contribution of this paper because this approach could eventually lead to the design and implementation of more tailored software and hardware for the analysis of spectral information. The obtained results validate the idea that using this approach actually obtains the spectral bands that are important for this task, since they are similar to PCA results, and they fall on the NIR part of the spectrum, which is widely used in moisture measurement of agricultural products and vegetation analysis.}

Researchers fail to determine the factor that is the most important cause of GHs occurrence. This study determines the morphological and physio-chemical soil features, the locations with significant GHs, and the soil and geomorphic parameters in the loess area of Golestan Province, Iran. The spatial distribution of GHs was determined by field surveys and analysis of 1 m-resolution aerial photography collected with an UAV. Physical and chemical features of soil samples were determined through lab analysis. The relationships between features and GHs were ranked by statistical significance using chi-square tests. Functional trees - (FT), naïve Bayes tree (NBTree), and random forest (RF) models were employed to generate GHs sensitivity maps. One-hundred and twenty-seven GHs were identified and randomly divided into a training dataset comprised of 70% (89) of the GHs, and a validation dataset encompassing 30% (38) of the GHs. Twenty-two GHs conditioning factors were input into the models. The results of the chi-square analysis confirmed land use (90.8%) had the greatest influence on GHs occurrence. The results of training indicated that the AUC value for the FT, NBTree, and RF models were 83.4%, 94.8%, and 96.5%, respectively. The confidence interval (CI) for these methods was 0.771–0.885, 0.905–0.975, and 0.926–0.987, respectively. The highest standard error (SE) was related to the FT model (0.0314), followed by NBTree (0.0151), and RF (0.0119). The validation results indicated an AUC of 0.888, 0.947, and 0.981 for these methods, respectively. Therefore, RF was found to be the most effective model for predicting and mapping GHs in the future.}

This paper presents a disturbance attenuation controller for horizontal position stabilization for hover and automatic landings of a Rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (RUAV) operating in rough seas. Based on a helicopter model representing aerodynamics during the landing phase, a nonlinear state feedback H∞ controller is designed to achieve rapid horizontal position tracking in a gusty environment. The resultant control variables are further treated in consideration of practical constraints (flapping dynamics, servo dynamics and time lag effect) for implementation purpose. The high-fidelity closed-loop simulation using parameters of the Vario helicopter verifies performance of the proposed position controller. It not only increases the disturbance attenuation capability of the RUAV, but also enables rapid position response when gusts occur. Comparative studies show that the H∞ controller exhibits great performance improvement and can be applied to ship/RUAV landing systems.}

In order to better target conservation efforts in these ecosystems, it is necessary to develop highly accurate models that account for the spatial nature of ecosystem structure, processes and functions. In this study, above-ground biomass was predicted at very high spatial resolution in nine study sites in Estonia. A combination of UAV-derived datasets were used to produce vegetation indices and micro topographic models. A random forest algorithm was used to generate above-ground biomass maps and assess the contribution of each predictor variable. The model successfully predicted above-ground biomass at very high accuracies. Additionally, grassland structural heterogeneity was assessed using UAV-derived datasets and vegetation indices. The results were subsequently related to management history at each study site, showing that continuous, monospecific grazing management tends to simplify grassland structure, which could in turn reduce the supply of a key regulation and maintenance ecosystem services: nursery and reproduction habitat for waders. These results also indicate that UAV-based surveys can serve as reliable grassland monitoring tools and could aid in the development of site-specific management strategies.}

However, incidents such as fatal system failures, malicious attacks, and disastrous misuses have raised concerns in the recent past. Security and viability concerns in drone-based applications are growing at an alarming rate. Besides, UAV networks (UAVNets) are distinctive from other ad-hoc networks. Therefore, it is necessary to address these issues to ensure proper functioning of these UAVs while keeping their uniqueness in mind. Furthermore, adequate security and functionality require the consideration of many parameters that may include an accurate cognizance of the working mechanism of vehicles, geographical and weather conditions, and UAVNet communication. This is achievable by creating a simulator that includes these aspects. A performance evaluation through relevant drone simulator becomes indispensable procedure to test features, configurations, and designs to demonstrate superiority to comparative schemes and suitability. Thus, it becomes of paramount importance to establish the credibility of simulation results by investigating the merits and limitations of each simulator prior to selection. Based on this motivation, we present a comprehensive survey of current drone simulators. In addition, open research issues and research challenges are discussed and presented.}

In this work, to secure communications during data acquisition and transmission, as well as diminish the probability of attacking by malicious manipulated UAVs, we propose a distributed UAVs scheme harnessing blockchain technology whose network has similar topology to IoT along with cloud server. Instead of directly using the typical blockchain technique which requires expensive computation and high bandwidth overhead, we propose a novel, secure, and lightweight blockchain architecture which mitigates the computation and storage overhead while retaining its privacy and security benefits. Moreover, multiples types of transactions are defined to describe various data access and a novel reputation-based consensus protocol is designed to ensure the reliability of the decentralized network. Finally, performance evaluation demonstrates our blockchain-based distributed scheme is secure and efficient.}

First, tan-type Barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is constructed to keep system output within constraint. Next, unknown nonlinear function is approximated by radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). Using the property of Gaussian radial basis function, the upper bound of the term containing the unknown nonlinear function is derived and the updating law is proposed to estimate the square of the norm of the neural network weights. Then, virtual control inputs are developed using backstepping design and their derivatives are obtained by fixed-time differentiator. Finally, the actual control input is designed based on deadzone inverse approach. Lyapunov stability analysis shows that the presented method guarantees fixed-time convergence of the tracking error to a small neighborhood around zero while all the other closed-loop signals keep bounded. The presented control strategy addresses algebraic-loop problem, overcomes explosion of complexity and reduces the number of adaptation parameters, which is easy to be implemented with less computation burden. The presented control scheme is applied to academic system, real electromechanical system and aircraft longitudinal system and simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness.}

In Ireland, traditionally wetland-monitoring is carried out by manual field visits which can be very time-consuming. To automate the process, this study extends the ability of remote sensing-based monitoring of wetlands by combining RGB image processing, machine learning algorithms, and satellite data analysis to create seasonal maps of vegetation communities within the wetlands. The methodology matches multispectral and broad coverage of open-source Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery with the high spatial granularity of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or drone images. Single sensor drone imagery was captured, colour corrected and classified using random forest (RF) classifier for a subset of the wetland. The classified imagery was upsampled to satellite imagery scale to create training data for vegetation-segmentation in the entire wetland. The process was repeated for multiple seasons, and an annual map was created utilising the majority voting. The proposed framework has been evaluated on various wetlands across Ireland, with results presented herein for an ombrotrophic peatland complex, Clara Bog. The accuracy of the maps was checked utilising a set of area-based performance metric. The application of this method thereby reduces the number of field surveys typically required to assess the long-term ecological change of such wetland habitats. The performance of the proposed method demonstrates that the technique is a robust, quick, and cost-effective way to map wetland habitats seasonally and to explore their ecohydrological synergies.}

The adaptive composite disturbance rejection control (ACDRC) is composed of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) and disturbance observer (DO) based on nominal inverse model, which is used to estimate wind disturbance, payload disturbance and propeller failure disturbance in real time. For the bandwidth tuning of the extended state observer (ESO), an online tuning method based on iterative learning control (ILC) is proposed to realize the adaptive extended state observer (ESO). And the stability of the composite anti-disturbance controller is analyzed. In the experiments, the wind disturbance experiments under the side-down flow and the horizontal flow, the failure experiments under the single propeller failure and twin propeller failure, and the composite disturbances experiments under the simultaneous action of the wind disturbance, propeller failure and payload disturbance are carried out. The experimental results show that under wind disturbance, the anti-disturbance performance of ACDRC is increased by 82.5%; under the disturbance of propeller fault, the anti-disturbance performance of ACDRC is increased by 60%; under the composite disturbance, the anti-disturbance performance of ACDRC is increased by 50%. Finally, the effectiveness of ACDRC is further verified in vegetable and cotton fields.}

For the two above mentioned cases, we are interested in the analysis of the convergence of the team to an optimal common language. The main contribution of the paper is the application of stochastic regular grammars, with learning capability, to generate the robots team’s language. Apart from the analysis of the convergence to a common language in the case of a fully autonomous robot team without human intervention we are also particularly interested in analyzing how the syntactic alignment of the robot team can be influenced or mediated by humans. The paper is organized as follows: first, we describe the syntactic language games, in particular the type of grammar and syntactic rules of the robots team’s language and the dynamic process of the language games which are based on dialogic communicative acts and a reinforcement learning policy that allows the robot team to converge to a common language. Afterwards, the experimental results are presented and discussed. The experimental work has been organized around the linguistic description of visual scenes of the blocks world type. The general conclusion of our experiments can be briefly stated in this way: “for the fully autonomous case (only robots) the final emergent grammar is arbitrary, while in the second case of including a human in the team the final emergent grammar is the one used by the human”.}

abstract = {The Iranian loess plateau is a unique area for its landscape and complex topography. There is however not any legacy soil data available for this region. Based on soil knowledge and previous evidences, it is known that various topographic attributes have considerable effects on soil development in such areas. To reach this goal, random forest (RF) models were used to relate a large set of environmental covariates and a total of 64 soil profiles in a part of the Iranian loess plateau. The prediction of a soil map at four soil taxonomic levels was first carried out in an area of about 5390 ha. Geomorphology, elevation and aspect were the most important covariates that impact on the predictive performances of the soil map at each taxonomic level. The accuracy of the RF models was tested by 10-fold cross-validation and reported using the overall accuracy and Kappa index, which were equal to 76% and 0.56 at suborder level, 72% and 0.51 at great group level, 54% and 0.31 at subgroup level, and 40% and 0.23 at family level, respectively. Conversely, the results of uncertainty, as reported by the confusion index (CI), indicated that the uncertainty tends to increase towards lower taxonomic categories (i.e., from suborder to family level). Having relied on the covariates importance, the impact of pixel size and accuracy of topographic attributes were assessed with the aim of improving the prediction at a comparison area of 210 ha. Two Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were considered. The first one was derived from topographic lines initially drawn at 1:25,000 scale and a spatial resolution of 5 m (DEM A), while the second one was obtained at a 0.3 m spatial resolution (DEM B) using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). At the suborder level, the overall accuracy was 95% and 78% for the predicted maps with 0.3 × 0.3 m and 5 × 5 m pixel sizes, respectively. It is thus shown that the extracted DEM from a UAV technique can lead to an improved accuracy for the spatial prediction of soil maps at different taxonomic levels. Though this methodology could be used in other regions with limited soil data, its applicability and benefits could also depend on the specific topography variations, pedology knowledge and covariates at hand.}

These rich datasets can be analysed using a variety of techniques, including minimum wavelength mapping and spectral indices, to accurately map geological objects from a distance. Reference spectra from spectral libraries, ground or laboratory measurements can also be included to derive supervised classifications using machine learning techniques. We demonstrate the potential of the hypercloud approach by integrating hyperspectral data from laboratory, tripod and unmanned aerial vehicle acquisitions to automatically map relevant lithologies and alterations associated with volcanic hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) mineralisation in the Corta Atalaya open-pit, Spain. These analyses allow quantitative and objective mineral mapping at the outcrop and open-pit scale, facilitating quantitative research and smart-mining approaches. Our results highlight the seamless sensor integration made possible with hylite and the power of data-driven mapping methods applied to hyperclouds. Significantly, we also show that random forests (RF) trained only on laboratory data from labelled hand-samples can be used to map appropriately corrected outcrop scale data.}

abstract = {This paper introduces and compares two robust control techniques estimating disturbances for small-scale unmanned helicopters: adaptive disturbance rejection control (ADRC) and disturbance observer based control (DOBC). The six-degree-of-freedom dynamics model of the unmanned helicopter includes modeling errors and uncertainties that degrade control performance. Furthermore, the external disturbance and complex internal coupling seriously affect the control stability of the small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), but this is difficult to be considered in advance for controller design. For this reason, ADRC and DOBC are designed using a minimum nominal model to compensate for internal uncertainties and external disturbances. Simulation results based on slalom maneuvers show that the proposed controller successfully compensates for disturbance and provides excellent performance compared to the case of using only the PID controller. Other than to unmanned helicopters, it is applicable to most dynamic systems that can be approximated as a double integrator system.}

abstract = {There have been recent efforts to increase the degree of automation and frequency of data collection for construction applications using Unmanned Aerial/Ground Vehicles (UAV/UGV). However, the current practice of data collection is traditionally performed, which is manual, costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. Developing vision-based mobile robotic systems that are aware of its surrounding and capable of autonomous navigation are becoming essential to many construction applications, namely surveying, monitoring, and inspection. Nevertheless, the systems above suffer from a series of performance issues. One major problem is inefficient navigation in indoor and cluttered scenes with many obstacles and barriers, where some places are inaccessible by a UGV. To provide a solution to this problem, this paper designs a UAV-UGV team that integrates two custom-built mobile robots. The UGV autonomously navigates through space, leveraging its sensors. The UAV acts as an external eye for the UGV, observing the scene from a vantage point that is inaccessible to the UGV. The relative pose of the UAV is estimated continuously, which allows it to maintain a fixed location that is relative to the UGV. The key aspects for the development of this system that is capable of autonomous navigation are the localization of both UAV and UGV, mapping of the surrounding environment, and efficient path planning using multiple sensors. The proposed system is tested in an indoor and cluttered construction-like environment. The performance of the system demonstrates the feasibility of developing and deploying a robust and automated data collection system for construction applications in the near future.}

A common taxonomy and interpretation of disaster management related constraints are critical to develop efficient technological solutions. This article proposes a process-driven and need-oriented framework to facilitate the review of technology based contributions in disaster management. The proposed framework aims to bring technological contributions and disaster management activities in a single frame to better classify and analyse the literature.

Furthermore, a set of basic requirements and constraints at each phase of a disaster management process have been proposed and cited literature has been analysed to highlight corresponding trends.

The pervasive aspect of these drones is due to their ability to answer people’s needs. Drones are providing users with a bird’s eye that can be activated and used almost anywhere and at any time. However, recently, the malicious use of drones began to emerge among criminals and cyber-criminals alike. The probability and frequency of these attacks are both high and their impact can be very dangerous with devastating effects. Therefore, the need for detective, protective and preventive counter-measures is highly required. The aim of this survey is to investigate the emerging threats of using drones in cyber-attacks, along the countermeasures to thwart these attacks. The different uses of drones for malicious purposes are also reviewed, along the possible detection methods. As such, this paper analyzes the exploitation of drones vulnerabilities within communication links, as well as smart devices and hardware, including smart-phones and tablets. Moreover, this paper presents a detailed review on the drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) usage in multiple domains (i.e civilian, military, terrorism, etc.) and for different purposes. A realistic attack scenario is also presented, which details how the authors performed a simulated attack on a given drone following the hacking cycle. This review would greatly help ethical hackers to understand the existing vulnerabilities of UAVs in both military and civilian domains. Moreover, it allows them to adopt and come up with new techniques and technologies for enhanced UAV attack detection and protection. As a result, various civilian and military anti-drones/UAVs (detective and preventive) countermeasures will be reviewed.}

abstract = {Nowadays, the field of mobile robotics has experienced an important evolution and these robots are more commonly proposed to solve different tasks autonomously. The use of visual sensors has played an important role in mobile robotics tasks during the past few years due to the advances in computer vision hardware and algorithms. It is worth remarking the use of AI tools to solve a variety of problems in mobile robotics based on the use of images either as the only source of information or combining them with other sensors such as laser or GPS. The improvement of the autonomy of mobile robots has attracted the attention of the scientific community. A considerable amount of works have been proposed over the past few years, leading to an extensive variety of approaches. Building a robust model of the environment (mapping), estimating the position within the model (localization) and controlling the movement of the robot from one place to another (navigation) are important abilities that any mobile robot must have. Considering this, this review focuses on analyzing these problems; how researchers have addressed them by means of AI tools and visual information; and how these approaches have evolved in recent years. This topic is currently open and a large number of works can be found in the related literature. Therefore, it can be of interest making an analysis of the current state of the topic. From this review, we can conclude that AI has provided robust solutions to some specific tasks in mobile robotics, such as information retrieval from scenes, mapping, localization and exploration. However, it is worth continuing to develop this line of research to find more integral solutions to the navigation problem so that mobile robots can increase their autonomy in large, complex and heterogeneous environments.}

Although many fleet routing protocols have been proposed, only partial inherent constraints of FANET (such as mobility, 3D movement and reliability) are taken into account. Therefore, we propose a new geocast routing protocol namely Geocast routing protocol for fleet of UAVs (GeoUAVs). This protocol aims at delivering information to a specific group of mobile UAVs identified by their geographical location. It takes into account the mobility of nodes, dynamic changing topology with 3D movement, and reliability. Simulations conducted in NS-3 simulator demonstrate that our proposal GeoUAVs outperforms AntHocNet and BeeAdHoc protocols by reducing the average delay by more than to 61% and increasing both the packet delivery ratio and throughput.}

This system uses the SPHP algorithm combined with the region growing algorithm based on difference images to generate a panorama image and to eliminate motion ghosts. It further adopts the popular image object detector Faster RCNN to detect objects while using knowledge about the scene categories to refine the classification scores of the objects.

This is also able to wipe out large acres of forest as well as the agricultural lands. Therefore, in this paper, a fire detection approach is presented in the nonsubsampled contourlet (NSCT) domain by extracting the fused fire regions of visible and infrared (IR) images using spatial fuzzy C-means clustering (SpFCM). Firstly, the NSCT is applied to decompose the source visible and IR images into one low and several high-frequency components. Low-frequency NSCT component is fused using a pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) motivated by the sum-modified Laplacian to retain the maximum information available in both the source images. Local log Gabor energy based fusion rule is employed to fuse the high-frequency NSCT components that are able to preserve the maximum detail information. Later, the fused image is reconstructed by applying the inverse NSCT. Finally, all the fire pixels are identified in the fused images and segmented using the fuzzy clustering approach having spatial information also. Furthermore, several experiments are conducted to evaluate the fire detection ability of the proposed framework in terms of visual appearance as well as several performance evaluation parameters. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed approach over the other existing fusion approaches by improving all the performance parameters.}

abstract = {Color cast of the UAV imagery is inevitable due to the temperature and illuminance changes during the UAV flight. Since color is an important feature in crop monitoring, color cast often produces misleading inference in estimation of crop stress, nutrient, and productivity. Therefore, color calibration is a necessary step to remove the negative effects of color variation for UAV based crop monitoring. Nowadays, the state of art color calibration methods usually use the semantic correspondences for accurate color transfer. However, the mainstream color calibration methods ignore the integration of semantic segmentation and style transfer, and suffer the problem of semantic mismatch. To address this problem, this study proposed a multi decoder architecture that builds the integration of sematic segmentation and style transfer for the color transfer in an end to end mode. Also, this paper introduced an Crop Oriented adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) method to estimate the color cast in the crop areas, and used that estimated information for color calibration over the whole image area with a local to global attention mechanism. Each proposed module was evaluated in ablation study to test its effectiveness, respectively. Also, the proposed method was evaluated on several crop types and compared with the state of art methods. Experimental results showed that our proposed method achieved state of art or close to state of art performance in all metrics. The research of this work is expected to obtain a general framework to remove the color cast of UAV imagery for crop monitoring, which may build a good foundation for the following data interpretation.

Researchers from academia and industry concentrate mostly on the control, design and communication of the quadrotors. Many forms of quadrotors are employed for many tasks; including search and rescue, defense industry, gaming & sports and delivery purposes. The dynamics of a quadrotor is already nonlinear, with that when there is payload/cargo which is not solid (i.e. a bottle containing fluid), the stability of the system becomes difficult to achieve. In this paper, an LQR controller is designed to maintain the stability of the quadrotor under the influences of a non-solid payload which is treated as a suspended load. First, nonlinear dynamics of the quadrotor is derived and it is extended by introducing the suspended load dynamics. A control-oriented linear model is obtained to evaluate the control gains. Finally, the controller is applied to the extended nonlinear model to quantify the controller. Results revealed that the controller considering the influence of the suspended load decreased the magnitude of oscillation on the altitude of the quadrotor and the swing angle of the pendulum up to 13.02% and 51.23%, respectively.}

Using a specific chaotic dynamic obtained from the Rössler system, CACOC provides waypoints for UAVs that aim to optimise the coverage of an unknown area while having unpredictable trajectories. Since the chaotic dynamics are obtained from a three differential equations system with parameters, it is possible to tune one parameter to obtain another chaotic dynamic, which will result in different UAV mobility behaviours. This work aims at optimising this parameter of the Rössler chaotic system to improve the coverage performance of CACOC. Since each evaluation of a solution requires a full simulation, global optimisation techniques (e.g., population-based heuristics) would be very time-consuming. We therefore considered a surrogate-based method to efficiently explore the parameter space of the Rössler system for CACOC, i.e., Bayesian optimisation. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach permits to improve the speed of coverage of the UAV swarm. In addition an analysis of the dynamical properties of the obtained chaotic system is provided.}

Above all, the interest in groups of UAVs working together (swarms) is gaining momentum. This interest emerges since swarms are able to undertake more sophisticated tasks. Furthermore, they can also increase task performance and/or robustness. However, organizing a multi-UAV flight is not easy, involving challenges in terms of (i) swarm formation definition, (ii) takeoff procedure, (iii) in-flight coordination, (iv) communication between the swarm elements, (v) swarm layout reconfiguration, (vi) handling the loss of swarms elements, and (vii) controlled landing. These and other issues still hold back the mainstream adoption of swarms in sectors such as agriculture, border surveillance, and parcel delivery. In this work we provide solutions for two of the main critical challenges: (a) swarm layout reconfiguration, and (b) handling the loss of swarm elements. A wide set of experiments were made using our own realistic UAV emulation tool (ArduSim) in order to validate our proposals. The experiments show that the chances of facing collisions during the reconfiguration are greatly reduced even in error-prone scenarios, and that, in many cases, the loss of a UAV is handled seamlessly; otherwise (in the worst-case scenarios) a delay of just a few seconds is introduced. Additionally, this work addresses cases where, due to the lack of proper communication between the swarm elements, a swarm splits up. Experiments show that with our swarm resilience mechanisms those cases are inherently solved by creating autonomous sub-swarms which will then complete their part of the mission independently.}

Previous simulation and experimental studies have demonstrated the usefulness of GS in rice breeding. However, several affecting factors and limitations require careful consideration when performing GS. In this review, we summarize the major genetics and statistical factors affecting predictive performance as well as current progress in the application of GS to rice breeding. We also highlight effective strategies to increase the predictive ability of various models, including GS models incorporating functional markers, genotype by environment interactions, multiple traits, selection index, and multiple omic data.

abstract = {This paper investigates the adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) for fixed-wing UAV using neural networks (NNs). Considering the wave effect during low-altitude flying, the wave height is identified based on autoregressive model while the model parameters are handled by recursive least square method. Considering the aerodynamic uncertainties caused by unknown sea environment, NNs are employed to deal with the system nonlinearities. For the update of neural weights, the prediction error that indicates the learning performance is constructed. Based on the information of neural approximation and wave height identification, the neural learning control is finally developed for the altitude subsystem. The neural SMC is accordingly constructed for the velocity subsystem. Under the proposed method, the uniformly ultimately bounded stability is achieved. Simulation is presented to show that the proposed method can achieve good tracking performance.}

In this paper, we apply model compression techniques to the problem of semantic segmentation, which is one of the most challenging problems in computer vision. Our results suggest that compressed models can approach the accuracy of full ensembles on this task, combining the diverse strengths of networks of very different architectures, while maintaining real-time performance.}

However, it is a time-consuming and, labour-intensive and expensive task. Recent remote sensing tools and methods provide a revolutionizing innovation for monitoring individual trees and crop recognition as an alternative to manual detection useful for long-term agricultural management. Our study adopted a Connected Components Labeling (CCL) algorithm to detect and count the citrus trees based on the high-resolution Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) images in two agricultural patches. The workflow consisted of applying morphological image operation algorithms on multi-spectral, 5-banded orthophoto imagery (derived from 1560 scenes) and 3,57 cm spatial resolution. Our approach was able to count 1462 out of 1506 trees resulting in accuracy and precision higher than 95% (average Recall: 0.97, Precision: 0.95) in heterogeneous agricultural patches (multiple trees and tree sizes). According to our understanding, the first time a CCL algorithm has been used with UAV multi-spectral images for detecting citrus trees. It performed significantly for geolocation and counting the trees individually in a heterogenous orchard. We concluded that our methodology provided satisfactory performance to predict the number of trees (in the citrus case study) in dense patches. Therefore it could be promising to replace the conventional tree detection techniques to detect the orchard trees in complex agricultural regions.}

This paper presents flap control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using shape memory alloy (SMA) wires as actuator. In this content, the mathematical model of the SMA wire is obtained through characterization tests then model of the proposed flap mechanism is derived. Later, based on these models, both flap angle and power dissipation of the SMA wire are controlled in two different loops employing compensated proportional-integral type and neural network-based control schemes. The angle commands are converted to power commands through the outer loop controller later which are updated based on the error in the flap angle induced because of the indirect control and external effects. In this study, power consumption of the wire is introduced as a new internal feedback variable instead of generally employed resistance feedback. Constructed simulation models are run and performance specifications of the proposed control systems are investigated. Eventually, it is shown that proposed controllers perform well in terms of achieving small tracking errors.}

The challenges include underactuation, model uncertainty, and actuator failure. The review also illustrates the state of the quadrotor control research in an attempt to find practical solutions for those challenges. By definition, a UMS has less number of control actions than the number of degrees of freedom to be controlled. Hence, traditional control strategies developed for fully actuated systems are not directly applicable to UMS. Research on UMS is one of the most interesting topics in the robotics and control community because of its relevance to a variety of applications. Examples include humanoid robots and most aerial and underwater vehicles. However similar to any other nonlinear systems, the stability and control of quadrotors suffer from intrinsic complexities exasperated by underactuation, model uncertainties and actuator failure. In this review article, we are going to address these problems and discuss the solutions mostly concerning the application of different control strategies presented in recent literature. We also present the frontiers and research directions towards improving performance of quadrotors for emerging and complex applications.}

When approaching structural analysis, one of the main inputs is given by the fracture orientations. Therefore, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles is a great benefit for acquiring in a very short time, a large georeferenced dataset for fractures distribution and orientation, even in normally non-accessible outcrops. Access during the fieldwork, as well as the ease of data processing and visualization, constitute great advantages provided by the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in structural analysis and modelling. In this study, data were acquired from two outcrops from the Lower Cretaceous Los Santos Formation sandstones, Mesa de Los Santos region (Colombia), El Duende and La Mojarra outcrops. The data was processed in photogrammetry software, based on the structure from motion technique, with which a dense point cloud was obtained for each outcrop. The dense point cloud was processed with the Discontinuity Set Extractor software, obtaining the main families of discontinuities and their associated clusters. Later, as a validation, these orientations, which obtained in a digital way, were contrasted with field data, previously acquired in the area, obtaining a good consistency between both datasets. Finally, the data was associated with the regional structural trends evidenced in the field data, generating more data to improve the structural models of the area.}

Because of the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication, the concerned quaternion-valued models separated into four real-valued parts to form the equivalent real-valued systems. Based on M-matrix properties and homomorphism mapping theories, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point of the system. Conditions for ensuring the global exponential stability of the equilibrium point of the system are obtained on the basis of the vector Lyapunov function method instead of the linear matrix inequality method. Using a similar method, the mixed-delay QVNNs with parameter uncertainties are also studied, and the conditions for ensuring the global robust exponential stability of the system are established directly. The adopted approach and the obtained results in this paper complement already the existing ones.

abstract = {Interval many-objective optimization problems (IMaOPS) are ubiquitous in practical applications. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the solving method for IMaOPS. However, there are fewer solving methods due to the uncertain interval of the objective function. In this paper, an improved NSGA-III algorithm (named LFOA-NSGA-III) is proposed to effectively solve these problems. Due to the uncertain interval in the IMaOPs, the original NSGA-III algorithm can ineffectively evaluate the relationship between the interval solution set and the reference point. So the matter-element extension model is introduced, which can make the optimized solution set close to the Pareto optimal solution. Furthermore, in order to improve the optimization performance and population diversity of the improved algorithm, the K-mean algorithm is used to solve the initial solution set, as well as a local fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) is combined with the genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, the LFOA-NSGA-III algorithm is empirically evaluated on eleven interval benchmark test problems and an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) path planning problem. Through simulation comparisons with other different algorithms, it is concluded that the hyper-volume value, the imprecision value and the IGD value indicators are significantly better than other comparison algorithms. In addition, from a simulation experiment in application of the multi-UAVs path planning problem, it can be seen that the LFOA-NSGA-III algorithm is more effective and applicative in the IMaOPs.}

Traditionally, human experts have been relied upon to diagnose anomalies in plants caused by diseases, pests, nutritional deficiencies or extreme weather. However, this is expensive, time consuming and in some cases impractical. To counter these challenges, research into the use of image processing techniques for plant disease recognition has become a hot research topic. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of recent studies carried out in the area of crop pest and disease recognition using image processing and machine learning techniques. We hope that this work will be a valuable resource for researchers in this area of crop pest and disease recognition using image processing techniques. In particular, we concentrate on the use of RGB images owing to the low cost and high availability of digital RGB cameras. We report that recent efforts have focused on the use of deep learning instead of training shallow classifiers using hand-crafted features. Researchers have reported high recognition accuracies on particular datasets but in many cases, the performance of those systems deteriorated significantly when tested on different datasets or in field conditions. Nevertheless, progress made so far has been encouraging. Experimental results showing the leaf disease recognition performance of ten CNN architectures in terms of recognition accuracy, recall, precision, specificity, F1-score, training duration and storage requirements are also presented. Subsequently, recommendations are made on the most suitable architectures to deploy in conventional as well as mobile/embedded computing environments. We also discuss some of the unresolved challenges that need to be addressed in order to develop practical automatic plant disease recognition systems for use in field conditions.}

Subsequently, the principal component analysis was used to reduce the redundancy of the constructed features, and the first 5 principal components, explaining over 95% variance ratio, were kept for further analysis. Furthermore, random forests as one of machine learning techniques were built for developing the classifier with three different combinations of features. Accuracy-oriented feature reduction was performed when choosing the optimal number of features for building the classification model. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning was explored for the optimal selection of random forest model. The results showed that the optimal random forest model with 30 important spectral features can achieve a mean correct classification rate of 1.0, 0.789, 0.691 and 0.752 for Zea mays, Convolvulus arvensis, Rumex and Cirsium arvense, respectively.

Following the philosophy of indirect adaptive control, a set of linear in weight neural networks are used to rapidly learn the unknown part of the system model online. This continuously updated model is simultaneously used in a dynamic inversion framework that results in an adaptive controller which is quite robust to the modeling inaccuracies (i.e. parametric uncertainties of the model) and external wind shear disturbance. The training rule of neural networks is obtained from Lyapunov stability theory, where a Sobolev norm based Lyapunov function is chosen. This leads to 'directional learning', resulting in fast learning without exciting too much of transient oscillations. Robust performance of this neuro-adaptive augmented nonlinear controller is successfully validated through six degree-of-freedom simulation studies.}

The model developed has a significant impact as we have tested our strategy in a scenario for searching an area covering 68517 km2, we have shown that 78% of the time, the lost object can be found within 32 km distance of the predicted trajectories limiting the significant search area to be about 5% of the whole searched area.}

Deep learning algorithms are implemented to efficiently detect defects from the collected images, and a simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm is adopted for site reconstruction with the acquired LiDAR data. Based on the images of detected defects, assessment is conducted to evaluate the defect conditions, complemented with the defect dimensions estimated from the aligned image and LiDAR data.

abstract = {In-field assessment of rice panicle yields accurately and automatically has been one of the key ways to realize high-throughput rice breeding in the modern smart farming. However, practical rice fields normally consist of many different, often very small sizes of panicles, particularly when large numbers of panicles are captured in the imagery. In these cases, the integrity of panicle feature is difficult to extract due to the limited panicle original information and substantial clutters caused by heavily compacted leaves and stems, which results in poor counting efficacy. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet effective method termed as Multi-Scale Hybrid Window Panicle Detect (MHW-PD), which focuses on enhance the panicle features to detect and count the large number of small-sized rice panicles in the in-field scene. On the basis of quantifying and analyzing the relationship among the receptive field, the size of input image and the average dimensions of panicles, the MHW-PD gives dynamic strategies for choosing the appropriate feature learning network and constructing adaptive multi-scale hybrid window (MHW), which maximizes the richness of panicle feature. Besides, a fusion algorithm is involved to remove the repeated counting of the broken panicles to get the final panicle number. With extensive experimental results, the MHW-PD has achieved ~87% of panicle counting accuracy; and the counting accuracy just decreases by ~8% when the number of panicles per image increases from 0 to 80, which shows better in stability than all the competing methods adopted in this work. The MHW-PD is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively that is able to deal with high density of panicles.}

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm design and mission application is a burgeoning area of research. The applications of swarm technology to unmanned systems are in the infancy of realization, although clear benefits from the enhanced capabilities can be easily envisioned for commercial and government missions including persistent search, long-term monitoring, sensor data collection, object retrieval, and offensive attack missions. Designing a UAV swarm architecture without considering the mission doctrine is imprudent, as is developing a mission doctrine without understanding the unique capabilities of swarm technology. This paper provides a literature review of current UAV swarm design architectures, most of which employ bottom-up methods with little consideration for an intended operational mission. The proposed top-down framework and modeling approach is focused on developing a modular UAV swarm playbook-type architecture by decomposing a subset of US Navy missions, and developing tactics that can be applied to those missions and support future missions. The framework proposed herein is derived from a consolidation of heuristics from the model-based systems engineering, robotics, human systems integration, biology, and computer science disciplines. The goal of this framework is to provide a standard methodology for designing and operating swarm unmanned systems that will meet the performance requirements for military missions. In this paper, an integrated framework for designing a UAV swarm system with swarm mission doctrine as a primary design factor is presented.}

abstract = {Image processing involved specifically with image recognition and image classification has taken a huge stride with the advent of high-performance GPU’s and the increase in the processing speeds of images by the computer systems. Also, the availability of huge datasets on different classes of images has helped in solving issues which can be addressed by huge number of annotated datasets in teaching a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the images. The present method of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of Wind Turbine Blade (WTB) inspection manually is involved with a great amount of risk and also takes a lot of time for inspection of each turbine and the operation time of each turbine comes down as the turbine should be at halt while inspecting. These problems are overcome by the inspection through drones and the basic idea of this research is to use deep learning with keras frame work written in python working on top of tensor flow to use the drone captured images to train a neural network model and classify into faulty and not faulty images of blades, which when deployed can be used in classifying new images. This method in turn reduces the maintenance time and inspection time and less risk for the inspection of WTB and in turn the SHM. In this research CNN’s are used to find whether the given image of WTB is having damage or not. Since the image data of wind turbine blades are not available easily with annotated images as like ImageNet and AlexNet, this project was developed from scratch right from acquiring the image data. Along the way, the focus was on the influence of certain hyper-parameters and on seeking theoretically founded ways to adapt them, all with the objective of progressing to satisfactory results as fast as possible. In the end, also a promising attempt in classifying WTB damages into a few different classes is presented and deploying the saved model using Flask such that the model can be used anywhere when required. Accuracies of around 94.94% for binary fault classification and 91% accuracy for multiple class fault classification has been achieved. The significance of the proposed method is that it is the first of its kind for WTB damage classification and detection for different classes of damage without using transfer learning but by training the model from the image dataset prepared by image augmentation methods and manual editing.}

abstract = {The complex confrontation in robot soccer match requires the decision-making system to learn the priori-knowledge given by humans and learn from its own experience. The two learning issues are usually addressed in two phases: off-line learning and on-line learning. Though lots of methods have been developed to address the two issues separately, the construction of a fully autonomous intelligent decision-making system remains challenging because of the difficulty of connecting the two phases. Most existing intelligent decision-making systems focus on only one of the two phases consequently. The model and algorithms of the Bayesian SOM neural network are proposed in this paper, based on which a fully autonomous intelligent decision-making system for robot soccer is built. This model provides a knowledge structure which can be shared by the off-line learning and on-line learning algorithms. By integrating the Bayesian classifier into each neuron, the whole neural network is equivalent to a multi-agent decision-making system. In the on-line learning phase, the Bayesian method is used to update each neuron's beliefs and the whole network's estimation of the state space. In matches with different opponents, this Bayesian SOM intelligent decision-making system showed outstanding learning ability and great adaptivity.}

To control the position of the UAV in three dimensional space as altitude and longitude–latitude location, three fuzzy logic modules are developed. These adjust the pitch angle, the roll angle and the throttle position of the UAV so that its altitude, the heading and the speed are controlled together. The implementation framework utilizes MATLAB’s standard configuration and the Aerosim Aeronautical Simulation Block Set which provides a complete set of tools for rapid development of detailed six degree-of-freedom nonlinear generic manned/unmanned aerial vehicle models. To demonstrate the performance and potential of the controllers, the Aerosonde UAV model is used. Flight Gear open source flight simulator and Gauges Block Set are deployed in order to get visual outputs that aid the designer in the evaluation of the controllers. Steep turn maneuvers which are used for basic training of pilots are applied to test the performance of the fuzzy logic controllers. Despite the simple design procedure, the simulated test flights indicate the capability of the approach in achieving the desired performance.}

We consider an uplink NOMA scenario for such a satellite-aerial-ground integrated network where multiple users communicate with satellite under the help of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as an aerial relay equipped with a phased array. Supposing that buffer-aided decode-and-forward protocol is adopted at the UAV relay, we first formulate an optimization problem to maximize Ergodic Sum Rate (ESR) of the considered system subject to individual power constraint and quality-of-service constraint of each user. Then, with known imperfect channel state information of each user, we propose a joint power allocation and robust BeamForming (BF) iterative algorithm to maximize ESR for the user-to-UAV link. Besides, to take the advantages of Free-Space Optical (FSO) and millimeter Wave (mmWave) communications, we present a switch-based hybrid FSO/mmWave scheme and a robust BF algorithm for the UAV-to-satellite link to achieve higher rate. Moreover, a closed-form ESR expression is derived. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed solutions are verified by numerical simulations, and the performance evaluation results show that the proposed solutions not only achieve performance enhancement and robustness, but also outperform the orthogonal multiple access significantly.}

In order to protect and restore these habitats and ensure the supply of valuable ecosystem services, it is necessary to know the extent and location of plant communities in coastal meadows. In this study, five plant communities were mapped at very high resolution in three different study sites in West Estonia. A fixed wing UAV was used to obtain multispectral images and derive a set of vegetation indices. Two different image classification techniques were used to cluster the vegetation indices maps and produce plant community distribution maps. The highest classification accuracy was obtained using a Random Forest classifier and 13 vegetation indices. Additionally, the spectral characteristics of the training samples were correlated with aboveground biomass and species diversity. Both biomass and species diversity were positively correlated with the spectral diversity of training samples and are thus likely to have an effect on the classification accuracy. The results of this study highlight the need to utilize a wide array of vegetation indices and assess the spectral characteristics of training samples in order to obtain high classification accuracies and understand the nature of misclassification errors. The resulting maps provide a solid foundation for global change impact assessment and habitat management and restoration in coastal meadows.}

Agriculture is and has always been a domain that adopts state of the art technologies in time, in order to optimize productivity, cost, convenience, and environmental protection. The deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in agriculture constitutes a recent example. A timely topic in UAV deployment is the transition from a single UAV system to a multi-UAV system. Collaboration and coordination of multiple UAVs can build a system that far exceeds the capabilities of a single UAV. However, one of the most important design problems multi-UAV systems face is choosing the right routing protocol which is prerequisite for the cooperation and collaboration among UAVs. In this study, an extensive review of Flying Ad-hoc network (FANET) routing protocols is performed, where their different strategies and routing techniques are thoroughly described. A classification of UAV deployment in agriculture is conducted resulting in six (6) different applications: Crop Scouting, Crop Surveying and Mapping, Crop Insurance, Cultivation Planning and Management, Application of Chemicals,and Geofencing. Finally, a theoretical analysis is performed that suggests which routing protocol can serve better each agriculture application, depending on the mobility models and the agricultural-specific application requirements.}

A back-propagation artificial neural network (BP ANN) was used to select the variables that contribute the most to the model's estimation of AGB, and then we built the model. Out of 13 variables, 5 variables were selected to build the BP ANN model, and we used cross validation for the accuracy assessment. The results show that: (1) the modeled mean AGB (2001–2016) provides a reasonable spatial distribution that is similar to the field measurements but reveals more details and has better spatial coverage than the limited field measurements are able to provide; (2) the overall trend of AGB in the TRHR is increasing more than decreasing (44.4% vs 29.2%, respectively) and has a stable area of 26.4%; and (3) the BP ANN model achieves better results than do the traditional multi-factor regression models (R2: 0.75–0.85 vs 0.40–0.64, RMSE: 355–462 vs 537–689kgDW/ha). This study presents an effective and operational BP ANN model that estimates grassland AGB for the study area with high accuracy at 500m spatial resolution, providing a scientific basis for the determination of reasonable stocking capacity and possible future development.}

A key limitation of these applications is that they have high energy footprints, which in turn hampers the quality of experience of users. While cloud and edge computing solutions can be applied to alleviate the problem, these solutions are hard to adopt in existing architecture and far from becoming ubiquitous. Fortunately, cloudlets are becoming portable enough, such that they can be transported and integrated into any environment easily and dynamically. In this article, we investigate how cloudlets can be transported by unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAV)s to provide computation support on the edge. Based on our study, we develop GEESE, a novel UAV-based system that enables the dynamic deployment of an edge computing infrastructure through the cooperation of multiple UAVs carrying cloudlets. By using GEESE, we conduct rigorous experiments to analyze the effort to deliver cloudlets using aerial, ground, and underwater UAVs.

Using radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) technique, we first propose a novel finite-time multivariable neural network disturbance observer (FMNNDO) to estimate the external disturbance and model uncertainty, where the neural network (NN) approximation errors can be dynamically compensated by adaptive law. Next, based on FMNNDO, a distributed finite-time formation tracking controller and a finite-time attitude tracking controller are designed using the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) method. In order to estimate the second derivative of the virtual desired attitude signal, a novel finite-time sliding mode integral filter is designed. Finally, Lyapunov analysis and multiple-time scale principle ensure the realization of control goal in finite-time.

abstract = {This paper proposes an efficient approach to the multiple source localization and contour mapping problem of radiation fields using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). A typical radiation field originating from a single hotspot can be generated by three spatial distributions of sources; scattered, clustered and biased. Of these, the clustered sources are relatively easy to localize, because the sources are located in a close proximity to the center of distribution. In other cases, it is not very straightforward, because, when multiple radiating sources generate a hotspot in a cumulative manner, sources do not coincide with the hotspot position. Regardless of our knowledge about the hotspot position, we attempt to solve the multiple radiation localization problem in two steps: the Region Of Interest (ROI) selection and the source localization. Existing algorithms eventually explore whole area, causing the problem of excessive use of UAV resources. We therefore propose a framework to reduce ROI in a radiation field that not only optimizes the resources but also increases the localization accuracy. For the source localization process, two different methods are employed interchangeably. Those methods are called the Hough Transform and the Variational Bayesian, adaptively selected with a switching technique and the overall performance is evaluated by balancing between the localization accuracy and the required exploration. In favor of the optimization, the prediction model defines the type of sources in a way that the adaptive switching methodology can converge to an optimal solution by selecting an appropriate method. Thus, the proposed framework enables the UAV to accurately localize the radiation sources in a fast manner. In order to verify the validity and the performance of the proposed strategies, we performed extensive numerical experiments with different numbers of sources and their positions. Our empirical results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms existing individual approaches.}

These adverse conditions make both the dynamic modeling and the control tasks more complex. Thus, it is necessary to employ an efficient control technique with acceptable performance without a complete knowledge of the disturbed model. This is because, in the classic feedback linearization control, the deviations between the model and the real plant may produce poor performance. Throughout the present paper, Dynamic Sliding Mode Control (DSMC) technique is designed to deal with the disturbances and which has never been used for quadrotors. Unlike the existing sliding mode techniques, the designed one uses an input-dependent sliding surface in order to enhance the robustness level of the classical feedback linearization control law. The effectiveness of this approach that ensures 3D trajectory tracking of quadrotor is demonstrated through numerical simulations.}

In plant breeding, phenotyping of genotypes is realized by time consuming and expensive visual plant ratings. During resistance reactions and during pathogenesis plants initiate different structural and biochemical defence mechanisms, which partly affect the optical properties of plant organs. Recently, intensive research has been conducted to develop innovative optical methods for an assessment of compatible and incompatible plant pathogen interaction. These approaches, combining classical phytopathology or microbiology with technology driven methods — such as sensors, robotics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence — are summarized by the term digital phenotyping. In contrast to common visual rating, detection and assessment methods, optical sensors in combination with advanced data analysis methods are able to retrieve pathogen induced changes in the physiology of susceptible or resistant plants non-invasively and objectively. Phenotyping disease resistance aims different tasks. In an early breeding step, a qualitative assessment and characterization of specific resistance action is aimed to link it, for example, to a genetic marker. Later, during greenhouse and field screening, the assessment of the level of susceptibility of different genotypes is relevant. Within this review, recent advances of digital phenotyping technologies for the detection of subtle resistance reactions and resistance breeding are highlighted and methodological requirements are critically discussed.}

abstract = {Invasive plants (IPs) are considered major threat to biodiversity and ecosystems due to their potential to compete for resources with other plants or crops. Timely and effective detection is important to prevent and control their growth. Recent advancements in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have brought an effective, inexpensive, and non-invasive approach to monitoring plants. The use of UAS is promising in the accurate and rapid identification of IPs in the field. However, challenges exist when using UAS for IP detection as they generate a huge number of images that must be interpreted by researchers manually. This time-consuming and error-prone process significantly limits the applicability of UAS in a variety of environmental and agriculture monitoring applications. To reduce processing time and increase detection accuracy, we develop an automatic and intelligent detection approach to identify IPs with high levels of efficiency and accuracy from images of the monitoring areas captured by UAS. First, the original field images are segmented into patch images using the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) superpixels algorithm. Then a novel two-level K-nearest neighbors (TLKNN) algorithm is proposed to classify the patch images into different IP categories. In it, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the features from the patch image and a kernel map function is utilized to obtain the kernel features. Two feature sets are fed to train two K-nearest neighbor (KNN) models. Finally, the final classification is determined by the selection results by KNN models. In the experiments, two public UAV image sets are employed to train and verify the proposed method. Several metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score, are used to evaluate the performance. The proposed TLKNN is compared with two newly proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) methods on the same datasets. Experimental results indicate the proposed TLKNN algorithm achieves better classification performance and reaches the highest accuracy, recall rate, precision rate, and F1-score. The improved performance not only means that IPs can be detected more accurately and automatically, but also that there are environmental benefits in developing an intelligent strategy for IP prevention and control.}

abstract = {The automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) represents a major change in flight tracking and it is one of the key components in building the next generation of air transportation systems. However, several concerns have been raised regarding its vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. In recent years, a new and promising approach of utilizing large-scale and publicly available flight recordings for training machine learning models that can detect anomalous flight patterns has been demonstrated as a valid countermeasure for several ADS-B attacks. The new approach differs significantly from previously proposed methods in the simplicity of its integration with the current ADS-B system. It also provides a valid countermeasure against highly sophisticated airborne attackers. However, previously proposed machine learning methods require training a different model for each flight route or geographic location to give acceptable results. This requirement limits the current solution to flights with a sufficient amount of historical data, which is unavailable in many cases such as business aviation, instructional flying, aerial work, and more. In this research, we address this limitation of previous work, by applying a differencing time-series transformation on the ADS-B data and utilizing a non-recurrent autoencoder classifier. The effectiveness of our method is compared to existing methods on several simulated trajectory modification attacks. The results of our experiments show that the proposed method achieves a ROC AUC value of 0.935-0.951, in comparison to 0.627 from existing methods when evaluated on flights that are absent from training data.}

This paper presents the results of the attitude determination using low-cost MEMS-based sensor. Aiming at the accumulative deviation incurring by low-cost MEMS gyroscope drifting and integration deviation, this study proposes a multi-sensor data fusion algorithm that uses benchmark reference vectors to detect and correct the gyro drift. The proposed algorithm adopts the method of attitude evaluation based on Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM). A BP neural network PID controller is used to compute gyro drift for real-time correction. Numerical simulation shows that the algorithm meets the requirements of the system. In order to test the actual performance of the system, a hardware platform of strap-down AHRS is designed, based on a three-axis gyroscope, a three-axis accelerometer, three-axis magnetic sensors and a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). Finally, the three-axis flight turntable table test results obtained, show that the static accuracy of the attitude angle is better than 0.5° and the dynamic accuracy is better than 3°. Moreover, the AHRS is tested on a micro-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and the practical application feasibility is validated.}

Remote sensing, as one of the sources for big data, is generating earth-observation data and analysis results daily from the platforms of satellites, manned/unmanned aircrafts, and ground-based structures. Agricultural remote sensing is one of the backbone technologies for precision agriculture, which considers within-field variability for site-specific management instead of uniform management as in traditional agriculture. The key of agricultural remote sensing is, with global positioning data and geographic information, to produce spatially-varied data for subsequent precision agricultural operations. Agricultural remote sensing data, as general remote sensing data, have all characteristics of big data. The acquisition, processing, storage, analysis and visualization of agricultural remote sensing big data are critical to the success of precision agriculture. This paper overviews available remote sensing data resources, recent development of technologies for remote sensing big data management, and remote sensing data processing and management for precision agriculture. A five-layer-fifteen-level (FLFL) satellite remote sensing data management structure is described and adapted to create a more appropriate four-layer-twelve-level (FLTL) remote sensing data management structure for management and applications of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture where the sensors are typically on high-resolution satellites, manned aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles and ground-based structures. The FLTL structure is the management and application framework of agricultural remote sensing big data for precision agriculture and local farm studies, which outlooks the future coordination of remote sensing big data management and applications at local regional and farm scale.}

Followers are driven into a convex hull spanned by all virtual leaders guided by desired parameterized paths. Multi-agent systems are driven to achieve the desired behavior. A containment maneuvering controller is developed based on an event-triggered modular-ISS neural network control method to decouple estimation and control. Specifically, in the estimation loop, an RBF-network-based predictor module is constructed to design the adaptation law, where an RBF network is employed to identify the uncertain nonlinear dynamics. An event-triggered communication mechanism is introduced to decrease the burden of followers communication. In the control loop, a control module is constructed by using the output of predictor module and a third-order linear tracking differentiator. An event-triggered actuation mechanism is introduced to reduce the actuator burden of followers. A path update law is constructed to achieve coordination among leaders. An event-triggered communication scheme is introduced for leaders to decrease the communication burden of leaders. The input-to-state stability of the total cascade system is demonstrated by using the cascade stability theorem.

The objective of this work was to use Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) to perform weed detection in soybean crop images and classify these weeds among grass and broadleaf, aiming to apply the specific herbicide to weed detected. For this purpose, a soybean plantation was carried out in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, and the Phantom DJI 3 Professional drone was used to capture a large number of crop images. With these photographs, an image database was created containing over fifteen thousand images of the soil, soybean, broadleaf and grass weeds. The Convolutional Neural Networks used in this work represent a Deep Learning architecture that has achieved remarkable success in image recognition. For the training of Neural Network the CaffeNet architecture was used. Available in Caffe software, it consists of a replication of the well known AlexNet, network which won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 (ILSVRC2012). A software was also developed, Pynovisão, which through the use of the superpixel segmentation algorithm SLIC, was used to build a robust image dataset and classify images using the model trained by Caffe software. In order to compare the results of ConvNets, Support Vector Machines, AdaBoost and Random Forests were used in conjunction with a collection of shape, color and texture feature extraction techniques. As a result, this work achieved above 98% accuracy using ConvNets in the detection of broadleaf and grass weeds in relation to soil and soybean, with an accuracy average between all images above 99%.}

To achieve the infrared small target detection, an efficient end-to-end network ISTDet is proposed in this paper. ISTDet mainly consists of two modules, including image filtering module and infrared small target detection module. The image filtering module is proposed to obtain the confidence map, aiming to enhance the response of infrared small targets and suppress the response of background. The infrared small target detection module takes the infrared image activated by the confidence map as input, aiming to speculate the category and position of the infrared small targets. Multi-task loss function is used to train the ISTDet in an end-to-end way. Finally, we do comparative experiments on five infrared small target sequences to demonstrate the detection performance of ISTDet. The results show ISTDet has better performance for infrared small target detection compared with other detectors.}

Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) consisting of UAVs is a new paradigm of wireless communication. However, the highly dynamic topology of FANETs and limited energy of UAVs have brought great challenges to the routing design of FANETs. It is difficult for existing routing protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) to adapt the high dynamics of FANETs. Moreover, few of existing routing protocols simultaneously meet the requirement of low delay and low energy consumption of FANETs. This paper proposes a novel Q-learning based Multi-objective optimization Routing protocol for FANETs to provide low-delay and low-energy service guarantees. Most of existing Q-learning based protocols use a fixed value for the Q-learning parameters. In contrast, Q-learning parameters can be adaptively adjusted in the proposed protocol to adapt to the high dynamics of FANETs. In addition, a new exploration and exploitation mechanism is also proposed to explore some undiscovered potential optimal routing path while exploiting the acquired knowledge. Instead of using past neighbor relationships, the proposed method re-estimates neighbor relationships in the routing decision process to select the more reliable next hop. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide higher packet arrival ratio, lower delay and energy consumption than existing good performing Q-learning based routing method.}

Based on the fact that the wavelength of human body radiation falls around 9.3 μm, thermal images have distinctive advantages for pedestrian detection in the nighttime. With the recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the vision community, how to properly explore information in color and thermal images using CNNs-based methods attracts the attention of researchers. Previous CNN-based multispectral pedestrian detectors focus on the design of network architectures. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, pixel-level image fusion are also extensively evaluated based on a state-of-the-art CNNs-based framework in the daytime and nighttime for pedestrian detection. Second, the effective strategies to combine pixel-level fusion methods and CNN-fusion architectures are studied based on extensive experimental results. Two combination strategies are designed and an exhaustive experimental analysis is performed to evaluate different combinations for all-day pedestrian detection. Extensive results based on a multispectral pedestrian benchmark show that some pixel-level image fusion methods can achieve similar or even better performance than CNN-fusion architectures, which emphasizes the importance of pixel-level fusion in CNN-based pedestrian detectors. The combination of both can usually more properly exploit multispectral information and further boost detection performance.}

Federated learning adheres to two major ideas: local computing and model transmission, which reduces some systematic privacy risks and costs brought by traditional centralized machine learning methods. The original data of the client is stored locally and cannot be exchanged or migrated. With the application of federated learning, each device uses local data for local training, then uploads the model to the server for aggregation, and finally the server sends the model update to the participants to achieve the learning goal. To provide a comprehensive survey and facilitate the potential research of this area, we systematically introduce the existing works of federated learning from five aspects: data partitioning, privacy mechanism, machine learning model, communication architecture and systems heterogeneity. Then, we sort out the current challenges and future research directions of federated learning.

We have first designed a suitable architecture for the same and designed a light-weight protocol to establish a secure communication among devices and the cloud via the relocatable drone. Our protocol also utilizes the benefits of Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) to generate, which is used to encrypt the message in communication. The well-popular Scyther simulator has been used to simulate the protocol and the results shows that the protocol is completely protected against leakage of private information. Considering the hardness problem of hash function and PUF, the informal analysis also confirms the high-level security protection against known attacks. The protocol is not only better in terms of security strength, but it also achieves better performance when compared to existing competitive works.}

Professional or trained technicians have to take much time and effort to interpret remote sensing images and locate landslides accordingly. Although conventional machine learning methods based on hand-crafted features for landslide susceptibility prediction (LSP) have acquired remarkable performance, they have certain requirements for prior knowledge. Aiming to learn complex and inherent visual patterns of landslides through minimal manual intervention and achieve fine-grained prediction, in this paper, we define LSP as a semantic segmentation problem on optical remote sensing images. Six widely used semantic segmentation models including Fully Convolutional Network, U-Net, Pyramid Scene Parsing Network, Global Convolutional Network (GCN), DeepLab v3 and DeepLab v3+ are introduced and evaluated for LSP. As the lack of landslide datasets, an open labeled landslide dataset of remote sensing imagery is created for research. The results show that GCN and DeepLab v3 are more applicable for this problem scenario, and the best Mean Intersection-over-Union and Pixel Accuracy of models are 54.2% and 74.0% respectively, which could be further improved by more targeted network architectures. In conclusion, semantic segmentation methods are demonstrated to be effctive for predicting new potential landslides based on remote sensing images.}

AI systems which perform relatively simple tasks in the early stages of the development period are expected to become fully or largely autonomous in the near future. Thanks to this, AI which includes the concepts of machine learning, deep learning, and autonomy, has begun to play an important role in producing and using smart arms. However, questions about AI-Based Lethal Weapon Systems (AILWS) and attacks that can be carried out by such systems have not been fully answered under legal aspect. More particularly, it is a controversial issue who will be responsible for the actions that an AILWS has committed. In this article, we discussed whether AILWS can commit offense in the context of the Rome Statute, examined the applicable law regarding the responsibility of AILWS, and tried to assess whether these systems can be held responsible in the context of international law, crime of aggression, and individual responsibility. It is our finding that international legal rules including the Rome Statute can be applied regarding the responsibility for the act/crime of aggression caused by AILWS. However, no matter how advanced the cognitive capacity of an AI software, it will not be possible to resort to the personal responsibility of this kind of system since it has no legal personality at all. In such a case, responsibility will remain with the actors who design, produce, and use the system. Last but not least, since no AILWS software does have specific codes of conduct that can make legal and ethical reasonings for today, at the end of the study it was recommended that states and non-governmental organizations together with manifacturers should constitute the necessary ethical rules written in software programs to prevent these systems from unlawful acts and to develop mechanisms that would restrain AI from working outside human control.}

The chlorophyll content of Yanghua 1 peanut leaves was generally higher than that of Yueyou 45, and the plant density had a greater influence on Yanghua 1 peanut. The one-dimensional linear regression models of NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and GNDVI(Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) had a much higher degree of fit and precision than the other indices; and the multiple linear regression model had a more accurate predictive ability than the one-dimensional linear regression model. After testing, BP neural network(Back Propagation Neural Network)is the most suitable model for monitoring the chlorophyll content of peanut with better fit and accuracy than the random forest model. The multispectral drone could rely on the highly accurate predictive model to quickly obtain information on the chlorophyll content in the field and infer the most suitable crop type and planting density for local planting.}

abstract = {Swarm is a collective motion phenomenon whose dynamic mechanism and cooperation structure could be identified based on observations. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is a special artificial swarm with unique rules and structures. Therefore, corresponding identification methods need to be developed. One critical identification problem is distinguishing the swarm’s cooperation structure, which is usually clustered and grouped to achieve stability of behaviors and low communication cost. This paper proposes a framework of Overlay Network Integrated Time series clustering (ONIT) to identify the UAV swarm structures based on trajectories. The framework consists of Snapshot, Net Growth and Net Split. It can fuse with most distance functions in time series clustering, achieving high accuracy, update ability, and fault tolerance with various datasets. We create point-based and sliding window-based snapshots, allowing the framework compatible with more methods. In particular, the Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) correspondence in point-based snapshots shows the high scalability of the framework, and the Euclidean Distance (ED) correspondence shows that the framework can still significantly improve the accuracy while maintaining the simplicity of calculation. The test results show that the fused ONIT-clustering algorithms, especially the point-based ones, outperform original time series clustering methods separately in simulation datasets of UAV swarms and UCR repository by 28% and 27%. In summary, the proposed framework is a flexible and scalable time series clustering method that can solve various time series clustering problems especially the trajectory clustering of the UAV swarm and has great potential for general time series analysis.}

abstract = {The paper proposes a bio-inspired coordination protocol for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) management in the agriculture domain. In precision agriculture the presence of parasites or the sudden climatic changes represent an important issue for farmers because of the degradation of crops and cultivation quality. Then, the use of the new technologies such as UAVs devices, the new networks such as Flying Ad-Hoc NETwork (FANET), and the utilization of new sensors and actuators inside UAVs can represent an important aid to the smart agriculture domain. An important aspect is, surely, the adequate management and coordination of these new devices in order to plan specific strategies able to support adequately the agriculture humans’ operators. Because drones are resource constrained and limited, scalable coordination techniques such those proposed can improve the network performance maintaining higher efficacy in the task execution.}

abstract = {Conveyor belt tearing real-time detection is essential for industrial transportation under multi-source interference environment. Here, a deep learning-based visual detection method named YOLOv4-BELT was proposed. The multi-condition belt tearing images dataset (MBTID) is firstly produced. Afterwards, the MBTID is pre-processed by the improved Cutmix algorithm for data augmentation, which aims to enrich image background and reduce over-fitting. Next, the deep convolutional neural network CSPDarknet53 is employed for multi-scale tear features extracting and fusion, which can effectively improve the recognition capability towards complex samples. Moreover, the training performance is significantly enhanced via a proper designed multi-stage transfer training strategy. Ultimately, the previous deep-level tear features are further utilized to classification and localization tasks. The results show that the precision, accuracy, recall and F1 score of YOLOv4-BELT are 96.6%, 99.1%, 98.1% and 97.4% respectively. The detection speed reaches 21.1FPS, which significantly improves the detection accuracy and robustness compared with the state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that, under the frame of sustainable farming, using the minimum water resources is a relevant requirement. In order to do that, precision irrigation aims at identifying the irrigation needs of plantations and irrigate accordingly. Artificial intelligence is a promising solution in this field as intelligent models are able to learn the soil moisture dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere system and then generating appropriate irrigation scheduling. This is a complex task as the phenology of plants and its water demand vary with soil properties and weather conditions. The present research contributes to this challenging task by proposing the application of neural networks in order to learn the time-series evolution of irrigation needs associated to a potato plantation. Several of such models are thoroughly compared, together with different interpolation methods, in order to find the best combination for accurately forecasting water needs. In order to predict the soil water content in a potato field crop, in which soil humidity probes were installed at 15, 30, and 45 cm depth during the whole cycle of a potato crop. This innovative study and its promising results provide with significant contributions to address the problem of predicting and managing groundwater for agricultural use in a sustainable way.}
