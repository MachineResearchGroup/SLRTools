abstract = {Resources and services between the servers in Mobile Augmented Reality Networks (MARN) are tedious to manage. These networks comprise users possessing Augmented Reality (AR)-Virtual Reality (VR) applications. Low latency, robustness, and tolerance are the key requirements of these networks, which can be attained by using near-user solutions such as edge computing. However, management of services and scheduling them to near-user servers in an integrated environment of edge and public/private infrastructure are complex tasks. These require an optimal solution, which can be obtained by using “Osmotic Computing”, that has been recently proposed as a paradigm for the integration of edge and public/private cloud. This paper uses osmotic computing for effectively migrating and scheduling the services between the servers of the different layers. The paper also presents the details on various components that are used for applying osmotic computing to a network followed by core applications, types, service classification, migration, and scheduling through the rules of osmotic game formulated for its operations. The evaluations are conducted on 100,000 requests and the proposed approach shows significant performance with the probability of the error being 0.1 at 55.72% conservation of the energy and memory resources for the entire network despite the increasing number of users. The proposed approach also satisfies the conditions of the joint optimization functions presented in the system model and demonstrates that the system holds true even with varying users, thus, proving its robustness and tolerance against the number of users.}

abstract = {Detection and identification of invertebrate pests in farming fields is a prerequisite necessity for integrated pest management (IPM), however, current sensing technologies do not meet the requirements for IPM. Currently, farmers have to first sample pests and then manually count and identify them, in a way that is time-consuming, labour-intensive and error-prone. Machine vision technology has taken over part of the work in a more efficient and accurate manner. However, current machine vision systems (MVSs) have limitations in detecting pests on crops and the counting and identification are constrained in laboratories or pest traps, resulting in the exact time and locations of pests being unknown, hindering more proper decisions and efficient actions. In this study, we developed a multispectral MVS to detect common invertebrate pests on green leaves in natural environment. First, it was found that, besides visible light and near-infrared, the ultraviolet is a good indicator to distinguish green leaves from other materials. Then for multispectral or hyperspectral data processing, we proposed two models, one named normalised hypercube and another named hyper-hue, which are less affected by uneven illumination and can reflect data distribution, resulting in more accurate classification than the normal method of spectral angle mapper (SAM). Further, the relationship between spectral angle and the relative angle of hyper-hue was studied and it was found that usually, data of hyper-hue has larger inter-class distances which could contribute to better classification. At last, to solve the practical problems of image registration and real-time infield applications, instead of registering 2D images, the MVS created and registered 3D point clouds. In an experiment of detecting twelve types of common invertebrate pests on crops, the proposed MVS showed acceptable accuracy.}

Two distributed adaptive event-triggered control algorithms are proposed for leaderless and leader-follower flocking, separately.

And it is proven that there is a positive lower limit of the interval between any two trigger events, which indicates that the Zeno behavior will not occur. As a result, communication bandwidth resources are effectively saved on the premise of stable flocking. Lastly, numerical simulations are presented to verify the availability of the theoretical results.}

From the network topology, the agents are categorized into two groups: those within the closed strong components (group 1) and those outside the closed strong components (group 2). It is shown that under allowable delay bound, the agents of group 1 reach synchronization while the agents of group 2 converge asymptotically to the convex hull spanned by the synchronized agents of group 1. The technique of semi-discretization is applied for computing the delay bound. For a specific time delay, the method is also feasible in finding an optimal coordination control gain with the fastest decay rate. A linear matrix inequality method is also given to show an alternative way to find the maximum allowable delay bound. An illustrative simulation is presented to validate our obtained theoretical results.}

abstract = {It is now common for coastal planning to anticipate changes anywhere from 70 to 100years into the future. The process models developed and used for scheme design or for large-scale oceanography are currently inadequate for this task. This has prompted the development of a plethora of alternative methods. Some, such as reduced complexity or hybrid models simplify the governing equations retaining processes that are considered to govern observed morphological behaviour. The computational cost of these models is low and they have proven effective in exploring morphodynamic trends and improving our understanding of mesoscale behaviour. One drawback is that there is no generally agreed set of principles on which to make the simplifying assumptions and predictions can vary considerably between models. An alternative approach is data-driven techniques that are based entirely on analysis and extrapolation of observations. Here, we discuss the application of some of the better known and emerging methods in this category to argue that with the increasing availability of observations from coastal monitoring programmes and the development of more sophisticated statistical analysis techniques data-driven models provide a valuable addition to the armoury of methods available for mesoscale prediction. The continuation of established monitoring programmes is paramount, and those that provide contemporaneous records of the driving forces and the shoreline response are the most valuable in this regard. In the second part of the paper we discuss some recent research that combining some of the hybrid techniques with data analysis methods in order to synthesise a more consistent means of predicting mesoscale coastal morphological evolution. While encouraging in certain applications a universally applicable approach has yet to be found. The route to linking different model types is highlighted as a major challenge and requires further research to establish its viability. We argue that key elements of a successful solution will need to account for dependencies between driving parameters, (such as wave height and tide level), and be able to predict step changes in the configuration of coastal systems.}

The whole vehicle dynamics is decomposed into the velocity subsystem and altitude subsystem, and the nonlinear disturbance observer based dynamic surface control is employed in the controller design within both subsystems. In order to tackle the input constraints, different hyperbolic tangent functions are carefully designed to approximate the non-smooth saturation functions. The compensators are further introduced for saturation approximations with the Nussbaum function technique. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, the closed-loop system is guaranteed to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, the tracking and estimation errors converge to an arbitrary small neighborhood around zero. Extensive simulation and evaluations verify the superiority of the proposed scheme.}

Terrorist networks are the most prominent instantiation of dark networks, and they are alive and well. Attempts to preemptively disrupt these networks and their activities have met with both success and failure. In this paper, we examine the impacts of four common strategies for dismantling terrorist networks. The four strategies are: leader-focused, grassroots, geographic, and random. Each of these strategies has associated pros and cons, and each has different impacts on the structure and capabilities of a terrorist network. Employing a computational experimentation methodology, we simulate a terrorist network and test the effects of each strategy on the resiliency of that network. In addition, we test scenarios in which the terrorist network has (or does not have) information about an impending attack. Our work takes a structural perspective to the challenge of addressing terrorist networks. Specifically, we show how various strategies impact the structure of the network in terms of its resiliency and capacity to carry out future attacks. This paper also provides a valuable overview of how to use agent-based modeling for the study of complex problems in the terrorism, conflict studies, and security study domains.}

This motion synchronization strategy improves the agents convergence to their desired positions, and this is useful for a multi-agent system with faulty agents. Moreover, the proposed motion synchronization strategy is not restricted to specific communication topologies, and sufficient conditions are provided to guarantee the multi-agent system stability in the presence of communication delays. Numerical simulations are presented for a team of five unmanned aircrafts to make a pentagon formation and confirm the accepted performance of the proposed control strategy.}

Multi-objective optimization model of automatic drilling and riveting sequence planning is built by expressing the efficiency and accuracy of riveting as functions of the points' coordinates. In order to search the sequences efficiently and improve the quality of the sequences, a new local pheromone updating rule is applied when the ants search sequences.

abstract = {This paper presents a feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for panoramic image sequences obtained from a multiple fisheye camera rig in a wide baseline mobile mapping system (MMS). First, the developed fisheye camera calibration method combines an equidistance projection model and trigonometric polynomial to achieve high-accuracy calibration from the fisheye camera to an equivalent ideal frame camera, which warrants an accurate transform from the fisheye images to a corresponding panoramic image. Second, we developed a panoramic camera model, corresponding bundle adjustment with a specific back propagation error function, and linear pose initialization algorithm. Third, the implemented feature-based SLAM pipeline consists of several specific strategies and algorithms in initialization, feature matching, frame tracking, and loop closing to overcome the difficulties in tracking wide baseline panoramic image sequences. We conducted experiments on large-scale MMS datasets of more than 15 km trajectories and 14,000 panoramic images as well as small-scale public video datasets. Our results show that the developed panoramic SLAM system PAN-SLAM can achieve fully-automatic camera localization and sparse map reconstruction in both small-scale indoor and large-scale outdoor environments including challenging scenes (e.g., dark tunnel) without the aid of any other sensors. The localization accuracy, which was measured by the absolute trajectory error (ATE), resembled the high-accuracy GNSS/INS reference of 0.1 m. PAN-SLAM also outperformed several feature-based fisheye and monocular SLAM systems with incomparable robustness in various environments. The system could be considered as a robust complementary solution and an alternative to expensive commercial navigation systems, especially in urban environments where signal obstruction and multipath interference are common.

During an iterative process, the so-called SB-RRT, the SB-RRT∗ and the Informed SB-RRT∗ find safe trajectories by meeting a user-defined safety threshold. Additionally, the last two techniques converge to solutions of minimum flight length. Through parallelization on graphical processing units the required computational times are reduced substantially to become compatible with near real-time operation. The proposed methods are tested considering a kinematic model of an aircraft flying between two waypoints at constant flight level and airspeed; the test scenario is based on a realistic weather forecast and assumed to be described by an ensemble of equally likely members. Lastly, the influence of the number of scenarios, safety margin and iterations on the results is analyzed. Results show that the SB-RRTs are able to find safe and, in two of the algorithms, close-to-optimum solutions.}

The project first part terminated in May 2012 with a final demonstration event that summarizes the technological results of research activities carried-out during a period the three years and half. The project developed virtual and hardware demonstrators for a range of technologies for the descent, soft landing and surface mobility of robotic and manned equipment for Moon and Mars exploration. The two key hardware demonstrators—a Mars Lander and a Lunar Rover—fit in a context of international cooperation for the exploration of Moon and Mars, as envisaged by Space Agencies worldwide. The STEPS project included also the development and utilization of a system of laboratories equipped for technology validation, teleoperations, concurrent design environments, and virtual reality simulation of the Exploration Systems in typical Moon and Mars environments. This paper presents the reached results in several technology domains like: vision-based GNC for the last portion of Mars Entry, Descent and Landing sequence, Hazard avoidance and complete spacecraft autonomy; Autonomous Rover Navigation, based on the determination of the terrain morphology by a stereo camera; Mobility and Mechanisms providing an Integrated Ground Mobility System, Rendezvous and Docking equipment, and protection from Environment effects; innovative Structures such as Inflatable, Smart and Multifunction Structures, an Active Shock Absorber for safe landing, balance restoring and walking; Composite materials Modelling and Monitoring; Human-machine interface features of a predictive Command and Control System; Energy Management systems based on Regenerative Fuel Cells; aerothermodynamic solutions for Atmospheric Re-entry of Commercial Transportation Systems; novel Design and Development Tools, such as a Rover S/W simulator and prototypes of the DEM viewer and of a S/W Rock Creator/visualizator.

abstract = {With increase in competition between OEMs of maritime assets and operators alike, the need to maximize the productivity of an equipment and increase operational efficiency and reliability is increasingly stringent and challenging. Also, with the adoption of availability contracts, maritime OEMs are becoming directly interested in understanding the health of their assets in order to maximize profits and to minimize the risk of a system's failure. The key to address these challenges and needs is performance optimization. For this to be possible it is important to understand that system failure can induce downtime which will increase the total cost of ownership, therefore it is important by all means to minimize unscheduled maintenance. If the state of health or condition of a system, subsystem or component is known, condition-based maintenance can be carried out and system design optimization can be achieved thereby reducing total cost of ownership. With the increasing competition with regards to the maritime industry, it is important that the state of health of a component/sub-system/system/asset is known before a vessel embarks on a mission. Any breakdown or malfunction in any part of any system or subsystem on board vessel during the operation offshore will lead to large economic losses and sometimes cause accidents. For example, damages to the fuel oil system of vessel's main engine can result in huge downtime as a result of the vessel not being in operation. This paper presents a prognostic and health management (PHM) development process applied on a fuel oil system powering diesel engines typically used in various cruise and fishing vessels, dredgers, pipe laying vessels and large oil tankers. This process will hopefully enable future PHM solutions for maritime assets to be designed in a more formal and systematic way.}

abstract = {Crop lodging - the bending of crop stems from their upright position or the failure of root-soil anchorage systems - is a major yield-reducing factor in wheat and causes deterioration of grain quality. The severity of lodging can be measured by a lodging score (LS)- an index calculated from the crop angle of inclination (CAI) and crop lodged area (LA). LS is difficult and time consuming to measure manually meaning that information on lodging occurrence and severity is limited and sparse. Remote sensing-based estimates of LS can provide more timely, synoptic and reliable information on crop lodging across vast areas. This information could improve estimates of crop yield losses, inform insurance loss adjusters and influence management decisions for subsequent seasons. This research - conducted in the 600 ha wheat sown area in the Bonifiche Ferraresi farm, located in Jolanda di Savoia, Ferrara, Italy - evaluated the performance of RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 data to discriminate and classify lodging severity based on field measured LS. We measured temporal crop status characteristics related to lodging (e.g. lodged area, CAI, crop height) and collected relevant meteorological data (wind speed and rainfall) throughout May-June 2018. These field measurements were used to distinguish healthy (He) wheat from lodged wheat with different degrees of lodging severity (moderate, severe and very severe). We acquired multi-incidence angle (FQ8-27° and FQ21-41°) RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 (40°) images and derived multiple metrics from them to discriminate and classify lodging severity. As a part of our data exploration, we performed a correlation analysis between the image-based metrics and LS. Next, a multi-temporal discriminant analysis approach, including a partial least squares (PLS-DA) method, was developed to classify lodging severities. We used the area under the curve-receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) and confusion matrices to evaluate the accuracy of the PLS-DA classification models. Results show that (1) volume scattering components were highly correlated with LS at low incidence angles while double and surface scattering was more prevalent at high incidence angles; (2) lodging severity was best classified using low incidence angle R-FQ8 data (overall accuracy 72%) and (3) the Sentinel-1 data-based classification model was able to correctly identify 60% of the lodging severity cases in the study site. The results from this first study on classifying lodging severity using satellite-based SAR platforms suggests that SAR-based metrics can capture a substantial proportion of the observed variation in lodging severity, which is important in the context of operational crop lodging assessment in particular, and sustainable agriculture in general.}

Lateral ground displacements along 24 transects perpendicular to the quay walls in the two port areas were directly measured by ground surveys. Liquefaction of gravel-size fills was observed throughout the ports and was more pronounced in Lixouri port where ground motions were higher. The maximum cumulative horizontal ground displacements ranged from 3 cm to 152 cm, depending on the transect location and height of free face, whereas the inland extent of lateral ground movement ranged from 10 m to 90 m. Lateral movement of the quay walls in Argostoli Port was lower compared to Lixouri Port. Strong motion recordings in the two port areas as well as pertinent seismotectonic data are also presented along with the available geotechnical data compiled by integrating information from exploratory borings, trial pits, site geology and eye-witness accounts of the reclamation history of the areas. Average cumulative lateral displacements for groups of transects, characterized by similar height of quay wall and field conditions were derived and compared to lateral spreading predictions using an empirical relationship for free field conditions. It was found that the magnitude of lateral spreading behind the gravity-type quay walls was significantly lower compared to empirical predictions based on the assumption of free field conditions. The reduction of lateral ground movement depends on the height of quay wall and may even be an order of magnitude lower for wall heights of 6 m or greater. The findings of this study contribute in assessing quay wall movement in port areas especially when liquefaction has occurred behind the wall.}

Such failures of multiple nodes may split the network into several clusters. These clusters are unaware of their own size, surviving nodes and links as well as size and location of other survivor clusters. A distributed and autonomous approach of reconnecting disjoint clusters in a short time is proposed, in which each survivor cluster undergoes a self-discovery process where it compiles information of connected survivors and then sends a negotiator to participate in a round table negotiation and decision-making process. All such negotiators exchange information and decide upon reconnection paths between clusters through known dead node locations and then assign nodes to be deployed on those paths, using available nodes. The negotiators then return to their respective clusters, convey the decision and the reconnection process is carried out. Analytical results of the self-discovery process have been obtained and simulation results on a large network are presented to illustrate the process. It is shown through a detailed comparison with existing methods that the proposed approach achieves reconnection in significantly lower time and compares favorably with respect to other performance metrics as well.}

This paper proposes coordinated control protocols with or without time delay for the coordination control problem of multiple AUVs under switching communication topologies based on discrete information. Firstly, the state feedback linearization method is used to convert coupled nonlinear AUV kinematics and kinetic equations into second-order affine forms, and a mathematical model is given in discrete time. Because the leader AUV is equipped with more accurate sensors, the leader-follower type of formation structure is adopted, leader AUV sends status information to followers, and the follower AUVs communicate with themselves randomly. Secondly, the coordination control protocols are designed for the cases of no time delay and time delay, and sufficient conditions for the consensus algorithm are analyzed and given based on the matrix theory. Finally, the correctness of the proposed coordinated control protocols is proved by simulation experiments and the trajectories of multiple AUVs converge to the desired trajectory.}

The conditions for these developments are traced through the institutional and operational dynamics among key stakeholders at international, State and local levels. The article is presented as a case study and is based on reports, field observations and interviews with relevant stakeholders. Overall, the article finds that the increasing recognition, use and value of data for disaster management activities since the earthquake, is contributing to a number of interrelated economic, technical and legal processes and challenges for data sharing among stakeholders in the country. Economic findings are primarily centered around the impact which donor funding, project based work and “new market” dymnamics are having on data sharing. These issues feed into technical findings, where the increasing number of stakeholders and geospatial based projects has led to data access uncertainty and quality concerns among stakeholders. Lastly, legal findings are generally concerned with uncertainty regarding license conditions. Underlying each of these findings is the increasing value and implication of open data. The article concludes with an analytical discussion which frames these main findings within broader developments taking place in the global disaster management sector.}

Compared with the conventional sliding mode surface (SMS) constructed by a linear combination of the errors, the new SMS manifold is selected as the last back-step error to improve independence of the adjustment of the controller gains. Furthermore, a nonlinear disturbance-observer is designed to process unknown disturbance inputs and improve the BSMC performances. The closed-loop system of trajectory tracking control plant is proved to be globally asymptotically stable by using Lyapunov theory. By comparing with traditional backstepping control and SMC design, the results obtained demonstrate the capacity of the airship to execute a realistic trajectory tracking mission, even in the presence of unknown disturbances, and aerodynamic coefficient uncertainties.}

abstract = {Global lakes have suffered from algae blooms and loss or expansion of aquatic vegetations in recent decades. Remote sensing is considered as an effective approach to monitor aquatic vegetations and algae blooms. However, individual spectral index is unable to separate them due to the similarity in spectral features. In this paper, spectral characteristics analyses were conducted to find suitable spectral indices for distinguishing emergent vegetation, submerged aquatic vegetation and floating yellow algae in a complex aquatic environment, Ulansuhai Lake, China. It was found that near infrared band was appropriate to extract open water, and short-wave infrared band was suitable for extracting emergent vegetation, whereas the green and red bands were the characteristic spectra for distinguishing submerged aquatic vegetation and yellow algae. Hence, we firstly used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to extract open water, and the emergent vegetation spectral index (EVSI) to extract emergent vegetation. Then, a new developed macroalgae index (MAI) was used for distinguishing submerged aquatic vegetation and yellow algae. The applicability of the spectral indices was tested against both in situ measurements and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. The results indicated that the combination of these spectral indices was an effective method to separate aquatic vegetations and yellow algae. The proposed method was then applied to time-series Landsat images for investigating the seasonal and inter annual dynamics of aquatic vegetations and yellow algae and their responses to air temperature in the Ulansuhai Lake. The results show that emergent vegetation area increased from May to its maximum in July. The submerged aquatic vegetation area gradually increased from May to its maximum coverage in August, and decreased from late September. The yellow algae appeared in late May, and reached its maximum area in June or July, and disappeared in October. The long-term variation analyses showed that emergent vegetation area increased from 1986 to 2014, and was decreasing from 2014. The area of submerged aquatic vegetation increased during 1986–2008, and sharply decreased from 2009 to 2013, followed by a significant increasing from 2014. The yellow algae bloom mainly outbroke during the period of 1998 to 2010. We also found that the yellow algae area was more sensitive to short term mean temperature, while the area of emergent vegetation was sensitive to longer timescale of temperature. The submerged aquatic vegetation area had no significant correlation with air temperature. Besides, our study also indicated that the MAI concept can be extendable and applicable to other high-resolution satellite sensors (e.g., GF-2 PMS) and other regions with different algae blooms (e.g., Yellow Sea).}

abstract = {In this paper, we present a simple, efficient, and robust algorithm for 2D coarse registration of two point clouds. In the proposed algorithm, the locations of some distinct objects are detected from the point cloud data, and a rotation- and translation-invariant feature descriptor vector is computed for each of the detected objects based on the relative locations of the neighboring objects. Subsequently, the feature descriptors obtained for the different point clouds are compared against one another by using the Euclidean distance in the feature space as the similarity criterion. By using the nearest neighbor distance ratio, the most promising matching object pairs are found and further used to fit the optimal Euclidean transformation between the two point clouds. Importantly, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm scales quadratically in the number of objects detected from the point clouds. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm in the context of forest inventory by performing coarse registration between terrestrial and airborne point clouds. To this end, we use trees as the objects and perform the coarse registration by using no other information than the locations of the detected trees. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using both simulations and three test sites located in a boreal forest. We show that the algorithm is fast and performs well for a large range of stem densities and for test sites with up to 10 ​000 trees. Additionally, we show that the algorithm works reliably even in the case of moderate errors in the tree locations, commission and omission errors in the tree detection, and partial overlap of the data sets. We also demonstrate that additional tree attributes can be incorporated into the proposed feature descriptor to improve the robustness of the registration algorithm provided that reliable information of these additional tree attributes is available. Furthermore, we show that the registration accuracy between the terrestrial and airborne point clouds can be significantly improved if stem positions estimated from the terrestrial data are matched to stem positions obtained from the airborne data instead of matching them to tree top positions estimated from the airborne data. Even though the 2D coarse registration algorithm is demonstrated in the context of forestry, the algorithm is not restricted to forest data and it may potentially be utilized in other applications, in which efficient 2D point set registration is needed.}

abstract = {This paper deals with the finite-time boundedness (FTB) of linear time-varying (LTV) systems; in this context, the novel contribution of our work goes in several directions. The first result is a sufficient condition for FTB when the plant input is generated by an exo-system; it is worth noting that constant, norm bounded signals, which most part of the previous literature has considered so far, belong to such class of inputs. To this regard, it is possible to compare our result with the existing literature, which shows that our approach yields less conservative conditions. The second result provided in the paper, is a sufficient condition for FTB when the input belongs to  L2, the class of square integrable signals, which have never been considered so far. In both cases, the proposed results require the solution of a feasibility problem constrained by differential linear matrix inequalities (DLMIs). A third contribution of the paper proves that, from the system-theoretic point of view, the obtained FTB conditions can be interpreted in terms of the norm of a suitable input–output operator. As a consequence of this fact, we are able to find alternative and equivalent conditions for FTB, both for the exogenous and the L2 cases, which are based on the solution of differential Lyapunov equations (DLEs), which are much more efficient from the computational point of view. The DLMI-based condition, however, is fundamental to solve the design problem, which is also investigated in the paper. Some examples show that the proposed technique is less conservative with respect to the previous literature, when exogenous inputs are considered, and its effectiveness when L2 signals are considered. Moreover, one example is devoted to show that the analysis approach, based on the solution of DLE, is much more efficient from the computational point of view with respect to the one based on DLMIs; finally the last example investigates the application of the state feedback control technique.}

abstract = {In aircraft wing design, engineers aim to provide the best possible aerodynamic performance under cruise flight conditions in terms of lift-to-drag ratio. Conventional control surfaces such as flaps, ailerons, variable wing sweep and spoilers are used to trim the aircraft for other flight conditions. The appearance of the morphing wing concept launched a new challenge in the area of overall wing and aircraft performance improvement during different flight segments by locally altering the flow over the aircraft’s wings. This paper describes the development and application of a control system for an actuation mechanism integrated in a new morphing wing structure. The controlled actuation system includes four similar miniature electromechanical actuators disposed in two parallel actuation lines. The experimental model of the morphing wing is based on a full-scale portion of an aircraft wing, which is equipped with an aileron. The upper surface of the wing is a flexible one, being closed to the wing tip; the flexible skin is made of light composite materials. The four actuators are controlled in unison to change the flexible upper surface to improve the flow quality on the upper surface by delaying or advancing the transition point from laminar to turbulent regime. The actuators transform the torque into vertical forces. Their bases are fixed on the wing ribs and their top link arms are attached to supporting plates fixed onto the flexible skin with screws. The actuators push or pull the flexible skin using the necessary torque until the desired vertical displacement of each actuator is achieved. The four vertical displacements of the actuators, correlated with the new shape of the wing, are provided by a database obtained through a preliminary aerodynamic optimization for specific flight conditions. The control system is designed to control the positions of the actuators in real time in order to obtain and to maintain the desired shape of the wing for a specified flight condition. The feasibility and effectiveness of the developed control system by use of a proportional fuzzy feed-forward methodology are demonstrated experimentally through bench and wind tunnel tests of the morphing wing model.}

The tracking task is completed by the collaboration of multi-layer subtasks. Different subtasks correspond to the tracking of different parts in the target area. The correspondences of the subtasks among the adjacent frames are consistent and smooth. The proposed model introduces hyper-graph regularizer to preserve the global and local intrinsic geometrical structures among and inside target candidates or trained samples, and decomposes the representative matrix of the subtasks into two components: low-rank property captures the subtask relationship, group-sparse property identifies the outlier subtasks. Moreover, a collaborate metric scheme is developed to find the best candidate, by concerning both discrimination reliability and representation accuracy. We show that the proposed multi-layer multi-subtask learning based tracker is a general model, which accommodates most existing multi-task trackers with the respective merits. Encouraging experimental results on a large set of public video sequences justify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed tracker, and achieve comparable performance against many state-of-the-art methods.}

This recursive algorithm does not only overcome the problem of “explosion of complexity” to improve computational efficiency, but also suppresses the high-frequency noise arising from time derivatives of states and virtual controls. Unlike other existing control methodologies, it does not require the knowledge of a Lyapunov function in principle. The boundedness of all mappings and their analytic derivatives can be ultimately guaranteed by using the internal stability of filters. Also, this bottom-up algorithm is able to provide the modularized design of the controller, where real-time applications can be to some extent realized.

In 2013⿿2014, studies were conducted in the upper Biebrza River basin to develop a remote sensing method for alkaline fen classification ⿿ a protected Natura 2000 habitat (code 7230) ⿿ using remote sensing technologies. High resolution airborne true colour (RGB) and color infrared (CIR) orthophotomaps, the laser scanning point cloud and thermal day and night images were obtained in August 2013 in the Biebrza River basin. At the same time, botanical studies were conducted in this area using conventional phytosociological methods. The random forest classification method was used to distinguish patches (phytocoenoses) of alkaline fens in the study area. The developed method of wetland identification has an accuracy of 91.5%. The night land surface temperature (LST) appears to have the greatest indicator potential. The obtained inventory results were compared with the results of the traditional habitat 7230 mapping method, carried out in 2011⿿2013 by another team of authors, under the Management Plan (MP, 2014). The obtained results suggest that the developed method has a wide application in nature conservation. Remote sensing methods are alternatives to traditional methods and can be used to identify alkaline fens on a larger scale.}

For the proposed aircraft, comprehensive controllability analysis is performed to evaluate the controllability of each state as well as the margin to reject mismatched disturbance without any knowledge of the controller. Mismatched disturbance attenuation is ensured through a structured H-infinity controller tuned by a non-smooth optimization algorithm. Embedded with the H-infinity controller, an adaptive control law is proposed in order to mitigate matched system uncertainty and actuator fault. Input saturation is also considered by the modified reference model. Numerical simulation of the novel ducted fan aircraft is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation results reveal that the proposed adaptive controller achieves better transient response and more robust performance than classic Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) method, even with serious actuator saturation.}

A Normalized Sunlit Shaded Index (NSSI) was developed to characterize the status of the wheat crop grown under moisture stress conditions at different growth stages. Results demonstrated that Thermal image-based NSSI (TI-NSSI) had the best correlations with all the measured crop biophysical parameters than the visible image (VI-NSSI). However, the r2 decreased with an increase in moisture stress. Among the different biophysical parameters tested in this study, TI-NSSI showed the highest significant negative correlation (−0.962***) with Radiation use efficiency (RUE). In general, irrespective of the moisture stress VI-NSSI gave the least relationship with all the biophysical parameters tested. Further regression analysis showed that TI-NSSI could explain the variations in RUE under different moisture stress conditions with R2 > 0.960. Regression analysis with yield showed that TI-NSSI under peak vegetative growth stage (83 DAS) adequately captured the variations in crop yield under moisture stress conditions.}

abstract = {Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising candidate for Future Internet Architecture (FIA), where the focus of communication is the content itself rather than the source of the requested content. NDN is one of the implementations of Information-Centric Networking (ICN). Among other salient features, NDN provides intrinsic security where security is provided to the content directly, rather than securing the communication channel. However, despite promising features offered by NDN, it is still susceptible to various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, mainly Interest Flooding Attacks (IFA). Various mitigation solutions exist in the literature; however, legitimate users and their traffic are usually affected by these solutions. In this paper, we propose a lightweight mechanism called MSIDN, to mitigate sophisticated interest flooding-based DoS and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks in NDN. MSIDN aims to mitigate attacks at the source of communication without affecting the legitimate users. MSIDN relies on data producers’ feedback which is used by the routers to employ precise rate-limiting and block the attackers. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the proposed MSIDN in terms of its robustness during various attack scenarios, dealing with malicious traffic without affecting the legitimate requests, and mitigating attacks at the source side of the communication.}

As a consequence, shape sensing techniques based on discrete surface strains measurements have seen a consistent expansion in the last few years. In this paper, the three main shape sensing methods, the Modal Method, the Ko's displacements theory and the inverse Finite Element Method, are presented. The most recent and also novel improvements are discussed and added to the methods' formulations. Then, the three methods are numerically applied to a complex aerospace structure such as that of a composite wing box experiencing bending and twisting deformations. For the first time, a detailed investigation on the optimal strain sensors configuration is performed for all the three techniques simultaneously. Finally, the methods' performances, in terms of accuracy of the reconstruction and of number of required sensors, are compared. The three methods show different characteristics that make them suitable for different applications, depending on the level of accuracy and the number of strain information required. The iFEM is proven to be the more accurate but the more demanding in terms of required sensors; the Ko's displacement theory is capable of giving a rough estimation of the displacement field, but requires a small amount of sensors; the Modal Method represents a trade-off between the other two in terms of accuracy and number of sensors required.}

Personal and activity-travel information are often lacking, making it necessary to deduce this information with data mining techniques. However, some studies predict many unique activity type classes (ATCs), while others merge multiple activity types into larger ATCs. This action enhances the activity inference estimation, but destroys important activity information. Previous studies do not provide a strong justification for this practice. An objectively optimized set of ATCs, balancing model prediction accuracy and preserving activity information from the original data, becomes essential. Previous research developed a classification methodology in which the optimal set of ATCs was identified by analyzing all possible ATC combinations. However, this approach is practically impossible in a finite amount of time for e.g. the US National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) 2009 data set, which comprises 36 ATCs (home activity excluded), since there would be 3.82⋅1030 unique combinations (an exponential increase). The aim of this paper is to optimize which original ATCs should be grouped into a new class, and this for data sets for which it is impossible or impractical to simply calculate all ATC combinations. The proposed method defines an optimization parameter U (based on classification accuracy and information retention) which is maximized in an iterative local search algorithm. The optimal set of ATCs for the NHTS 2009 data set was determined. A comparison finds that this optimum is considerably better than many expert opinion activity type classification systems. Convergence was confirmed and large performance gains were found.}

abstract = {The advent of big data analytics and cloud computing technologies has resulted in wide-spread research on the data placement problem. Since data-intensive services require access to multiple datasets within each transaction, traditional schemes of uniformly partitioning the data into distributed nodes, as employed by many popular data stores like HDFS or Cassandra, may cause network congestion thereby affecting system throughput. In this article, we propose a scalable and unified framework for data-intensive service data placement into geographically distributed clouds. The proposed framework introduces a new paradigm for partitioning a set of data-items into geo-distributed clouds using Spectral Clustering on Hypergraphs, and is therefore called SpeCH. Scaling spectral methods to large workloads is challenging, since computing the spectra of the hypergraph laplacian is a computationally intensive task. SpeCH provides two solutions to tackle this problem: (1) an algorithm, called SpectralApprox, that leverages randomized techniques for obtaining low-rank approximations of the hypergraph matrix with bounded guarantees, thereby significantly improving the efficiency of spectral clustering while also providing high quality solutions in practice; (2) an algorithm, called SpectralDist, that exploits the highly parallel nature of the spectral clustering algorithm and uses Apache Spark to speed-up the process while retaining the same quality guarantees as the exact algorithm. Additionally, being distributed in nature, SpectralDist enables SpeCH to perform data placement on workloads that require resources beyond the capacity of a single machine. Experiments on a real-world trace-based online social network dataset show that the SpeCH is effective, efficient, and scalable. Empirically, SpectralApprox is comparable in efficacy on the evaluated metrics, while being up to 10 times faster in execution time when compared to state-of-the-art techniques. On the other hand, though SpectralApprox is 7–8 times faster when compared to SpectralDist, in terms of efficacy on the evaluated metrics the latter is up to 50% better.}

The first strategy geometrically constructs the vertical flight trajectory as function of the along-the-track distance and altitude constraints associated with each way point in the flight plan, and a preferred gradient value described as a function of the flight phase and altitude. The second strategy employs a preferred gradient value dependent only on the flight phase. The optimization criterion is represented by the minimization of the total number of climb, horizontal, and descent trajectory segments. The comparison of the optimized trajectories generated using the two strategies are performed relative to the number of trajectory segments and their gradient values. The novelty and the advantage of the presented algorithm is the fact that it allows the construction of an optimal vertical flight trajectory without performing time and resources-intensive computations employing an aircraft performance model.}

This has been coupled with the limited capabilities of mobile devices and the high level of user expectations in terms of both quality of experience (QoE) and cost. An attractive enhancement technique is to utilize the co-existence of multiple interfaces in wireless devices to connect simultaneously to different access networks including cooperation over device-to-device (D2D) links. To this end, we present in this work optimized user-centric traffic splitting strategies in heterogeneous networks to achieve a high QoE level for video on demand applications with low cost and energy consumption for end users. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem considering different pricing models with prediction whereby a user can estimate the links’ performance for future time slots and make suitable decisions accordingly. We evaluate the proposed strategies and demonstrate their effectiveness using parameters determined via experimental measurements to provide an evaluation under realistic operational conditions. Results provide useful insights on the tradeoffs between energy consumption, cost and quality of experience.}

Importantly, decision makers need to answer the question on the number and location of charging stations in a way to satisfy customer recharging demand and meet certain restrictions imposed by real-life considerations. In this context, we consider the charging station location problem (CSLP), which belongs to the category of facility location problems and seeks to optimize the locations of charging stations. A growing body of literature has developed on this subject in recent years. Various approaches have been proposed to model the problem taking into account different features, constraints, decisions and performance measures as well as the dynamic and stochastic components inherent to the problem. Moreover, efficiently solving CSLP, particularly when applied to real-life case-studies, might be challenging in practice. Considerable effort has thus been made by researchers to develop innovative solution methods based on exact or heuristic approaches to obtain good quality solutions within short computation times. Therefore, we provide in this paper a comprehensive review on the literature relevant to CSLP, with a particular focus on modeling and solving the problem. We analyze the literature from different perspectives including demand representation, demand coverage approaches, objective functions, side constraints, decision variables, model structure as well as time dependency and uncertainty on the problem parameters. We also present various ways of classifying existing works, which allows readers to capture different aspects of the problem that researchers have tended to focus on and identify opportunities for further developments. We believe our work could be helpful to researchers by providing an overview of the CSLP literature and suggesting perspectives for future research in the field.}

The original cascaded dynamics of quadrotor is derived in a strict form with additive disturbances. Then, the adaptive RISE feedback controllers are respectively constructed in position and attitude loop, in which the control gains in RISE terms are adaptively updated online to ensure the robustness against uncertainties. In addition, to alleviate the measurement noise effect arising from the actual velocity signals, the velocity states in the model-based feedforward control are replaced with their desired values, then the desired compensation adaptive RISE controllers that depend on the desired trajectory and output tracking errors are synthesized, where the design conservatism on selecting the control gain in RISE is eliminated without knowing the prior bound of uncertainties, and enhanced performance robustness is also retained in the absence of velocity information. It is shown via Lyapunov analysis that the proposed method can guarantee the tracking errors to converge to the origin with asymptotic performance despite of bounded disturbances. The effectiveness and superiority of proposed method are validated through extensive simulations and comparisons.}

abstract = {Node replication attack (also known as replica attack) is one of the common attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In this attack, the adversary captures the sensor node(s) and extracts all important information, properties, and functions. Then, it disrupts the network operation by generating several malicious nodes having the same ID(s) as that of the captured node(s). Since the malicious nodes (i.e., replica nodes) have valid keying material, they can intentionally interfere with the network operation. Motivated by this, a three-step mechanism is proposed to detect replica nodes. The proposed mechanism benefits from watchdog nodes and is based on the idea that all nodes in the network (which are identified by their unique IDs) should have the same chance to be met by watchdog nodes. Accordingly, watchdog nodes monitor the network traffic and silently overhear the channel to see if there is any node with an abnormally higher chance of being met. If so, the ID of the node is advertised as the replica node. To evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism in terms of probability of detecting replica nodes and false detection probability, a comprehensive set of simulations has been carried out using the J-SIM simulator. The simulation results reveal that the proposed mechanism detects almost all replica nodes while the false detection probability is below 0.005%. It outperforms state-of-the-art protocols with imposing ignorable processing and memory overhead.}

abstract = {In this paper, novel task matching mechanisms with two-sided preferences of workers and requesters are proposed for blockchain-based crowdsourcing. Existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing frameworks match workers to tasks using allocation mechanisms considering metrics such as cost, location, and workers’ reputation to answer requesters’ requirements. However, they still match workers to tasks through mechanisms that are requester-biased with no consideration for workers’ preferences. This may lead to workers rejecting or neglecting their allocated tasks. As a solution, we propose two-sided preferences task matching mechanisms for blockchain-based crowdsourcing, namely SenseChain+, and Gale–Shapley Matching (GSM). In order to do the matching, the proposed mechanisms utilize the preferences of workers based on a proposed Quality-of-Task (QoT) metric, and the preferences of tasks based on a Quality-of-Information (QoI) metric. To ensure their autonomous, reliable, and transparent execution, these matching mechanisms are integrated in an existing blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework, implemented using smart contracts. The mechanisms and framework are implemented using Solidity on a private blockchain and evaluated using a real dataset. They are benchmarked to the Nearest Neighbor Matching (NNM) mechanism. The proposed mechanisms demonstrate higher performance compared to the benchmark in terms of workers’ QoI, payment, satisfaction, and confidence. To demonstrate the need for each mechanism, the performance under different demand to supply contexts is measured in terms of the workers’ QoI, confidence, and the minimum payment. Each proposed matching mechanism was found to outperform the others in a range of demand to supply ratios. Finally, the proposed matching mechanisms are stable and feasible on-chain with reasonable execution cost.}

Efficient path planning and mission scheduling are principle requirement toward advance autonomy and facilitate the vehicle to handle long-range operations. A single vehicle cannot carry out all tasks in a large scale terrain; hence, it needs a certain degree of autonomy in performing robust decision making and awareness of the mission/environment to trade-off between tasks to be completed, managing the available time, and ensuring safe deployment at all stages of the mission. In this respect, this research introduces a modular control architecture including higher/lower level planners, in which the higher level module is responsible for increasing mission productivity by assigning prioritized tasks while guiding the vehicle toward its final destination in a terrain covered by several waypoints; and the lower level is responsible for vehicle’s safe deployment in a smaller scale encountering time-varying ocean current and different uncertain static/moving obstacles similar to actual ocean environment. Synchronization between higher and lower level modules is efficiently configured to manage the mission time and to guarantee on-time termination of the mission. The performance and accuracy of two higher and lower level modules are tested and validated using ant colony and firefly optimization algorithm, respectively. After all, the overall performance of the architecture is investigated in 10 different mission scenarios. The analysis of the captured results from different simulated missions confirms the efficiency and inherent robustness of the introduced architecture in efficient time management, safe deployment, and providing beneficial operation by proper prioritizing the tasks in accordance with mission time.}

abstract = {Building damage assessment is a critical task following major hurricane events. Use of remotely sensed data to support building damage assessment is a logical choice considering the difficulty of gaining ground access to the impacted areas immediately after hurricane events. However, a remote sensing based damage assessment approach is often only capable of detecting severely damaged buildings. In this study, an airborne LiDAR based approach is proposed to assess multi-level hurricane damage at the community scale. In the proposed approach, building clusters are first extracted using a density-based algorithm. A novel cluster matching algorithm is proposed to robustly match post-event and pre-event building clusters. Multiple features including roof area and volume, roof orientation, and roof shape are computed as building damage indicators. A hierarchical determination process is then employed to identify the extent of damage to each building object. The results of this study suggest that our proposed approach is capable of 1) recognizing building objects, 2) extracting damage features, and 3) characterizing the extent of damage to individual building properties.}

Folded-concave penalization methods have demonstrated surprising developments in sparse learning problems due to their nice practical and theoretical properties. To share the same light of folded-concave penalization methods, we propose a new tensor completion model via folded-concave penalty for estimating missing values in tensor data. Two typical folded-concave penalties, the minmax concave plus (MCP) penalty and the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty, are employed in the new model. To solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, we develop a local linear approximation augmented Lagrange multiplier (LLA-ALM) algorithm which combines a two-step LLA strategy to search a local optimum of the proposed model efficiently. Finally, we provide numerical experiments with phase transitions, synthetic data sets, real image and video data sets to exhibit the superiority of the proposed model over the nuclear norm penalization method in terms of the accuracy and robustness.}

The application of conventional adaptive control is severely limited by the problems of construction of Lyapunov function and parameter drift because of non-parametric uncertainties. The proposed adaptive control that is on the basis of the immersion and invariance theory and σ-modification can be used to deal with these problems to some extent. It turns out to be a structured design method without requiring a Lyapunov function in the design level and robust to non-parametric uncertainties. Moreover, constrained command filter backstepping is adopted to meet the amplitude and rate constraints on the states and actuators. The uniformly ultimately bounded stability of the closed-loop system has been analyzed by Lyapunov theory with parametric and non-parametric uncertainties of the controlled model. To demonstrate the design flexibility, the method is applied to the position tracking control system design of a mass-damper-spring system and the flight control system design of a scramjet-powered air-breathing hypersonic vehicle. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive control method is illustrated by numerical simulations.}

There is uncertainty about the class label of mixed pixels as they represent the average energy emitted from different objects present within their spatial extent. Rough set theory can address the vagueness in data. Therefore, in this work rough set concept is used to identify the mixed pixels. In a multi-player environment, the Game theory is a science of making rational decisions. We propose a game theory-based approach to approximate the mixed pixels to lower approximations of a class. For pixel approximation, we have applied the spatial information of neighbouring pixels. Experiment for the implementation of the proposed approach is carried on six Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper images with a different region of interest. These datasets vary in size and have different dominant classes. The impact of the proposed method on the quality of clusters is studied with the help of cluster quality parameters. The results of the percentage of approximation demonstrate the significant number of mixed pixels approximated to one of the class.}

The control protocol is designed by using the exact discrete state of neighbors and the dynamics of each agent is described by a hybrid system. It is shown that the whole multi-agent system may exhibit not only aggregation but also divergence and periodic oscillation, which are depended on dynamic property of each agent and the sampling time period, as well as the algebraic characterization of network topology.

The inverse tangent function is proposed as a novel switching term for conventional sliding mode controller (CSMC), and the simulation proves that this function can effectively reduce the chattering phenomenon of the CSMC. To further reduce the occurrence of chattering, this paper proposes applying the DSMC to work-class ROV trajectory tracking. The singular perturbation theory and the variable change speed concept illustrate how to divide the cascaded system into two subsystems: the inner-loop control system (velocity loop) and outer-loop control system (position loop). The stability of the full closed-loop cascaded system is proven. Simulation results compare the expected performances of the proposed DSMC with the performance of the CSMC and fuzzy SMC. In the presence of external disturbances and system uncertainties and considering the sensor measurement noise, the DSMC errors converge to a small neighbourhood of zero. The chattering of the DSMC is also obviously reduced compared with that of the CSMC.}

This RNDF, which relies on a Multiclass Support Vector Machine(MSVM)-based trajectory generation method, will be used by an autonomous vehicle for transporting people in closed, unstructured areas for which no previous information is available, such as residential areas or industrial parks. The advantages of using this technique are the generation of a safe and smooth trajectory graph (making the trip more comfortable for riders by having trajectories pass as far away as possible from obstacles). Moreover, although there exist other previous Support Vector Machine (SVM) path planning methods, this is the first to use a MSVM. The advantages of doing so are that by obtaining a decision boundary for each object in the scene, all possible trajectories are computed and joined to form a graph. This is done through a combination of a Nearest-Neighbor Graph (NNG) and a Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG). The method was tested with real data and in real conditions, yielding good results. At the end of the paper, results for two kinds of studies are presented. The first set of tests is intended to determine the best parameter values for the proposed methodology. In the second set of evaluations, the approach is compared with other state-of-the-art SVM-based methods, as well as with a classical approach, demonstrating that the method outperforms them in some aspects. Furthermore, the source code of the method is available for testing, as are some videos in which the output of the method is shown, including a comparison with previous methods.}

The stochastic networked system with correlated noises is firstly transformed to an equivalent one, whose process noise is independent of sensor measurement noises. To increase the efficiency of limited communication resource, a closed-loop event-triggered mechanism is designed based on the measurement innovation and Mahalanobis transformation, where data transmission is triggered only when the predefined condition is satisfied. The phenomenon of measurement missing is characterized as a series of independent Bernoulli sequences. For every sensor subsystem, optimal local event-triggered state estimators including filter, predictor and smoother are given in terms of Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE). The statistical knowledge of event-triggered sampling and missing measurements is utilized in the design of local estimators. Then, based on the linear minimum variance criterion, the corresponding globally optimal event-triggered fusion estimators are proposed by a matrix-weighted combination of all available local estimates from sensor subsystems. The proposed decentralized fusion estimators have good abilities in reliability, fault tolerance and computation efficiency due to the netted parallel structure. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by a numerical example.}

While plot and inventory data provide our most detailed information on forest carbon, energy, and water cycling, applying this understanding to broader spatial and temporal domains requires scaling approaches. Remote sensing provides a powerful resource for “upscaling” process understanding to regional and continental domains. The increased range of available remote sensing modalities, including interferometric radar, lidar, and hyperspectral imagery, allows the retrieval of a broad range of forest attributes. This paper reviews the application of remote sensing for upscaling forest attributes from the plot scale to regional domains, with particular emphasis on how remote sensing products can support parameterization and validation of ecosystem process models. We focus on four key ecological attributes of forests: composition, structure, productivity and evapotranspiration, and disturbance dynamics. For each attribute, we discuss relevant remote sensing technologies, provide examples of their application, and critically evaluate both strengths and challenges associated with their use.}

The key requirement for achieving this team autonomy is to provide the robots with a collaborative ability to accurately map an environment. This problem is referred to as cooperative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In this research, the mapping process is extended to multiple robots with a novel occupancy grid map fusion algorithm. Map fusion is achieved by transforming individual maps into the Hough space where they are represented in an abstract form. Properties of the Hough transform are used to find the common regions in the maps, which are then used to calculate the unknown transformation between the maps. Results are shown from tests performed on benchmark datasets and real-world experiments with multiple robotic platforms.}

Geographic information system (GIS) is one such technology that pushes the current methods to precision agriculture. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of 120 research papers on various applications of big GIS analytics (BGA) in agriculture. The selected papers are classified into two broad categories; the level of analytics and GIS applications in agriculture. The GIS applications viz., land suitability, site search and selection, resource allocation, impact assessment, land allocation, and knowledge-based systems are considered in this study. The outcome of this study is a proposed BGA framework for agriculture supply chain.

abstract = {The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture. Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices. The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes, predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network. The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector, their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards its propagation is presented.}

The focus of this paper is on automatically synthesizing reactive controllers for cyber-physical systems subject to signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. We build on recent work that encodes STL specifications as mixed integer linear constraints on the variables of a discrete-time model of the system and environment dynamics. To obtain a reactive controller, we present solutions to the worst-case model predictive control (MPC) problem using a suite of mixed integer linear programming techniques. We demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of several existing worst-case MPC techniques, when applied to the problem of control subject to temporal logic specifications; our empirical results emphasize the need to develop specialized solutions for this domain.}

A literature overview is then presented. According to the literature overview, turbofans may be described as the most investigated type of aircraft gas turbine engines. The combustion chamber is found to be the most irreversible component, and the gas turbine component needs less exergetic improvement compared to all other components of an aircraft gas turbine engine. Finally, the need for analyses of exergy, exergo-economic, exergo-environmental and exergo-sustainability for aircraft gas turbine engines is emphasized. A lack of agreement on exergy analysis paradigms and assumptions is noted by the authors. Exergy analyses of aircraft gas turbine engines, fed with conventional fuel as well as alternative fuel using advanced exergy analysis methodology to understand the interaction among components, are suggested to those interested in thermal engineering, aerospace engineering and environmental sciences.}

Parametric modeling of the multi-bubble pressure cabin structure is automatic generated using UG secondary development. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is employed to study the structural performance using the commercial software ANSYS.

It is the responsibility of the network operator to efficiently allocate the available resources to the service requests in such a way to honor KPI requirements, while accounting for the limited quantity of available resources and their cost. A critical challenge is that requests may be highly varying over time, requiring a solution that accounts for their dynamic generation and termination. With this motivation, we seek to make joint decisions for request admission, resource activation, VNF placement, resource allocation, and traffic routing. We do so by considering real-world aspects such as the setup times of virtual machines, with the goal of maximizing the mobile network operator profit. To this end, first, we formulate a one-shot optimization problem which can attain the optimum solution for small size problems given the complete knowledge of arrival and departure times of requests over the entire system lifespan. We then propose an efficient and practical heuristic solution that only requires this knowledge for the next time period and works for realistically-sized scenarios. Finally, we evaluate the performance of these solutions using real-world services and large-scale network topologies. Results demonstrate that our heuristic solution performs better than a state-of-the-art online approach and close to the optimum.}

abstract = {In this paper, two nonlinear control approaches using optimal fractional high-order fast terminal sliding mode (FHOFTSM) control are proposed to maximize the captured wind energy and minimize the mechanical loads in the variable speed wind turbines (VSWTs). The optimal condition of the system which uses the presented approaches is achieved by creating a compromise between maximizing the energy extraction and minimizing the control input. So, the mechanical stress on the drive-train is reduced by minimizing the control input. To achieve this compromise, the behavior of the wind turbine system should be precisely modeled. Fractional calculus theory is an effective method for modeling the VSWT, which provides a more accurate description of the system performance compared with integer-order modeling. Based on the fractional-order modeling of the system, the optimal approach is designed by calculating the error dynamics of the system and defining two types of performance indexes, integer-order and fractional-order performance indexes. Hence, the design procedure of an optimal FHOFTSM control for each performance index requires two-stages process. At first phase, an optimal controller is presented for the system nominal error to minimize the quadratic performance index. Then a switching controller is offered in the second phase that is obtained by defining the fractional high-order sliding manifold and fractional nonsingular fast terminal sliding manifold to overcome the unknown disturbance. Hence, the order of the controllers is smaller than the second order. The optimal strategy is applied to minimize the control input, whereas the FHOFTSM method is used to obtain the maximum wind power extraction, reduce mechanical loads, attenuate the chattering, and achieve fast finite-time convergence. The closed-loop stability of the control system is approved by the fractional Lyapunov direct method and the Mittag-Leffler stability theorem. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the proposed controllers are compared with some already existing controllers. The performance of controllers is verified through three scenarios, i.e., random variation of wind speed, step change of wind speed, and robustness against parameter uncertainties, in which the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.}

However, the reconstruction performance of the existing matching pursuit algorithms, the most popular reconstruction algorithms, is closely related to the signal sparsity, which is hard to determinate apriori. As well, the researches on the reconstruction algorithms are developed independently with the design of measurement matrix. So, in this paper, we originally conduct a joint study of design of measurement matrix and signal reconstruction algorithm. RIP criterion is used to quantitatively analyze the relationship between the signal sparsity and the measurement matrix, and then an efficient joint compression and sparsity estimation matching pursuit (JCSEMP) algorithm is proposed. JCSEMP algorithm constructs a chaotic measurement matrix, a sparsity estimation algorithm based on the chaotic measurement matrix, and a variable atom selection criterion which use the variation between the residuals to adaptively adjust the number of atoms to select. Experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm can provide a better reconstruction performance and a lower reconstruction period.}

The Lushan shock triggered a large number of landslides with various types, including highly disrupted shallow slides and rock falls, deep-seated landslides and large-scale rock avalanches. Post-earthquake high resolution aerial photographs and satellite images, as well as a series of pre-earthquake high resolution satellite images were collected to construct a detailed, accurate, objective, and complete coseismic landslide database/inventory, which was validated by field investigation in selected areas. Based on the aerial photographs (0.2 or 0.6m resolution) that partly cover the affected area and pre-earthquake satellite images, 14,580 coseismic landslides were recognized and mapped. In those areas without post-earthquake aerial photographs coverage, we mapped 7,948 more coseismic landslides based on post-earthquake satellite images (Rapideye images with 5m resolution and ZY-3 images including panchromatic images with 2.1m resolution and multi-spectral images with 5.8m resolution) and pre-earthquake satellite images. The 22,528 coseismic landslides, with a horizontal projection area of 18.88km2 and an estimated total volume of 41.56×106m3, were distributed in a nearly elliptic area of about 5,400km2. Correlations between coseismic landslide abundances and topographic, geologic, and seismic factors were analyzed on 15,546 landslides of area ≥100m2. Scatter plots between regional slope angle and landslide abundances in generalized homogeneous lithology combinations show no obvious relationship is present between them, which challenges the conclusions of previous studies. Combining the Lushan earthquake-triggered landslides with other events on reverse and/or thrust faults such as the 1999 Chi-Chi and 2008 Wenchuan shocks, we found that coseismic landslides tend to occur in areas enveloped by two or more imbricated reverse and/or thrust faults, rather than only along the seismogenic fault. The Lushan event shows a higher ability of triggering landslides compared with other earthquakes of similar magnitudes, which is likely due to the steep and rugged topography and fractured and densely jointed lithology resulted from long-term tectonic activity. The blind reverse seismogenic fault is likely also another significant factor. Based on detailed coseismic landslide inventory maps and databases of several recent major earthquakes such as the 2008 Wenchuan, 2010 Haiti, 2010 Yushu, and 2013 Lushan temblors, we suggest that the empirical correlations between earthquake magnitude and coseismic landslides need to be updated.}

abstract = {Sea-surface temperature (SST) was one of the first ocean variables to be studied from earth observation satellites. Pioneering images from infrared scanning radiometers revealed the complexity of the surface temperature fields, but these were derived from radiance measurements at orbital heights and included the effects of the intervening atmosphere. Corrections for the effects of the atmosphere to make quantitative estimates of the SST became possible when radiometers with multiple infrared channels were deployed in 1979. At the same time, imaging microwave radiometers with SST capabilities were also flown. Since then, SST has been derived from infrared and microwave radiometers on polar orbiting satellites and from infrared radiometers on geostationary spacecraft. As the performances of satellite radiometers and SST retrieval algorithms improved, accurate, global, high resolution, frequently sampled SST fields became fundamental to many research and operational activities. Here we provide an overview of the physics of the derivation of SST and the history of the development of satellite instruments over half a century. As demonstrated accuracies increased, they stimulated scientific research into the oceans, the coupled ocean-atmosphere system and the climate. We provide brief overviews of the development of some applications, including the feasibility of generating Climate Data Records. We summarize the important role of the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) in providing a forum for scientists and operational practitioners to discuss problems and results, and to help coordinate activities world-wide, including alignment of data formatting and protocols and research. The challenges of burgeoning data volumes, data distribution and analysis have benefited from simultaneous progress in computing power, high capacity storage, and communications over the Internet, so we summarize the development and current capabilities of data archives. We conclude with an outlook of developments anticipated in the next decade or so.}

abstract = {This study proposed an approach for the preliminary risk assessment of slopes with a potential for large volume failure. In this framework, risk is the combined consideration of landslide hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. The level of hazard is classified according to the combination of landslide susceptibility (in space) and activity (in time). The incorporation of landslide susceptibility and activity enables the examination of long-term stability at the site for hazard classification. Several empirical relations were established using regression that incorporated various exceedance probabilities. These relations included (1) that between the landslide source area and the area of slopes prone to large failure (PLF slope), (2) the landslide volume and landslide area, and (3) the equivalent coefficient of friction and the landslide volume. These relations were used together with exceedance probability to determine the area and volume of the landslide source as well as the runout distance. The landslide source was estimated by referring to the slope geomorphology. The influence zone was delineated in reference to the runout distance and the width of the landslide source, and it was partitioned into subzones to distinguish vulnerabilities. With the delineated influenced zone, all the elements at risk (EaR) and their individual vulnerabilities could be identified. This approach classifies the vulnerability level of each EaR according to its location within the affected zone. Each EaR in the affected zone has a different vulnerability weight according to its location. The weighted average of all EaR determines the overall vulnerability of the site. As the end product, potential risks are classified into five levels based on the assessments of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, which can be easily calculated from the grades of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the applicability of the proposed approach for three PLF slopes in southern Taiwan. The proposed approach to risk classification may serve as a feasible tool for analyzing and ranking the risk level of PLF slopes prior to risk management–related decision-making under conditions of limited available resources.}

Administrations have recently expressed growing interest in sharing photogrammetric datasets on public repositories, providing opportunities to exploit these resources and detect natural and anthropogenic topographic changes. The SfM-MVS photogrammetric technique was applied to scanned historical black and white aerial photos of the Serra de Fontcalent (Alicante, Spain), as well as to recent high-quality digital aerial photos. Ground control points (GCPs) extracted from a LiDAR-derived three-dimensional point cloud were used to georeference the results with non-linear deformations. Two point clouds obtained with SfM-MVS were compared with the LiDAR-derived reference point cloud. Based on the result, the quality of the models was analysed through the comparison of the stages on stable areas, i.e., lands where no variations were detected, and active areas, with quarries, new infrastructures, fillings, excavations or new buildings. This study also indicates that errors are higher for old aerial photos (up to 5 m on average) than recent digital photos (up to 0.5 m). The application of SfM-MVS to open access data generated 3D models that enhance the geomorphological analysis, compared to stereophotogrammetry, and effectively detected activities in quarries and building of landfills.}

Lahars are a type of debris flow restricted to volcanic debris. Both water-rich mass flows, having solid concentration from 40 to 80 % volume and density from 1,300 to 2,400kg/m3, exhibit velocities ranging between 3 and 30m/s, peak discharge as high as 48,000 m3/s, volume as large as 100 million m3, and can flow down valley as far as 100km from the source. The review presents the array of methods and tools used in the field-based and experimental study of hydraulic, physical and rheological characteristics of volcanic and non-volcanic debris flows worldwide. These mass flows share several characteristics and effects with floods, but fewer studies have analyzed the wide range of impacts produced by lahars and debris flows. Damages are induced by three principal forces driving impacts: (1) hydrodynamic pressure, (2) hydrostatic pressure, and (3) the collisional forces of boulders acting as missiles. The impacts of debris flows are diverse, cascading and interacting because the size, the velocity and the proportion of rock debris mixed with water constantly change down valley. The review will complement previous studies in three ways: 1) we investigate how debris-flow characteristics and processes lead to damage mechanisms on buildings, infrastructure and lifelines; 2) we explore the broad range of valuable assets impacted by debris flows, and; 3) we analyze the physical vulnerability of valuables, leading to a review of indicators, matrices and fragility functions, which may lead to better understand loss. The review shows that economic impacts of lahars and debris flows extend well beyond the immediate costs of loss of life and asset damage. Enhanced understanding of flows and their impacts can improve risk mitigation and land use planning.}

The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review on the evolution and current status of research into temporal variation impacts on human task performance.
Methods
This review details the findings from a systematic review of peer reviewed literature identified via keyword searches in ISI Web of Science, Engineering Village Compendex, IEEE Explore, PsycINFO, Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) online, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and Google Scholar. Proceeding articles, peer reviewed journals, cited grey literature, and government technical reports relevant to temporal variability in human performance were identified and used in this review. Both statistical and contents analysis were conducted in this paper.
Results
Results suggest that the current state of research in human temporal variability is evolving but still has shortcomings in terms of integrating all aspects of interplay between the physical and cognitive components of human response. In light of this, research supporting the sustained development and use of refined cognitive-physical models is gaining momentum and sensible efforts to use task analysis tools that provide integration of both the cognitive and physical components of human response are underway.
Conclusions
This article identifies that although considerable advancements have been made in understanding the temporal variability of human performance, substantial research regarding the factors affecting it, their impacts, and the practical implications are still required.
Originality/value
This study is unique in both the breadth and range of literature considered regarding the factors affecting temporal variability in human performance as well as their implications. Successful consideration of these elements in human-centered complex adaptive systems establishes mechanisms for efficient and effective manpower and risk mitigation planning.}

abstract = {Metal hydrides are known as a potential efficient, low-risk option for high-density hydrogen storage since the late 1970s. In this paper, the present status and the future perspectives of the use of metal hydrides for hydrogen storage are discussed. Since the early 1990s, interstitial metal hydrides are known as base materials for Ni – metal hydride rechargeable batteries. For hydrogen storage, metal hydride systems have been developed in the 2010s [1] for use in emergency or backup power units, i. e. for stationary applications. With the development and completion of the first submarines of the U212 A series by HDW (now Thyssen Krupp Marine Systems) in 2003 and its export class U214 in 2004, the use of metal hydrides for hydrogen storage in mobile applications has been established, with new application fields coming into focus. In the last decades, a huge number of new intermetallic and partially covalent hydrogen absorbing compounds has been identified and partly more, partly less extensively characterized. In addition, based on the thermodynamic properties of metal hydrides, this class of materials gives the opportunity to develop a new hydrogen compression technology. They allow the direct conversion from thermal energy into the compression of hydrogen gas without the need of any moving parts. Such compressors have been developed and are nowadays commercially available for pressures up to 200 bar. Metal hydride based compressors for higher pressures are under development. Moreover, storage systems consisting of the combination of metal hydrides and high-pressure vessels have been proposed as a realistic solution for on-board hydrogen storage on fuel cell vehicles. In the frame of the “Hydrogen Storage Systems for Mobile and Stationary Applications” Group in the International Energy Agency (IEA) Hydrogen Task 32 “Hydrogen-based energy storage”, different compounds have been and will be scaled-up in the near future and tested in the range of 500 g to several hundred kg for use in hydrogen storage applications.}

abstract = {Prairie productivity is largely affected by temperature and precipitation and is vulnerable to a changing climate. In this study, we used 5-years of growing season eddy covariance and satellite data (MODIS MAIAC) from two adjacent field sites in southern Alberta (Canada) prairie to monitor intra- and inter-annual variation in prairie productivity using remote sensing. Three MODIS vegetation indices were examined to track seasonal variation of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP): the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the NIRv, and the chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI). The productivity of these prairie ecosystems was mainly driven by precipitation, with temperature affecting the starting time of the growing season. The three vegetation indices captured distinct aspects of GPP phenology. CCI, which is sensitive to chlorophyll and carotenoid pigment ratios, followed seasonal GPP dynamics more closely than NDVI and NIRv. Consequently, less hysteresis occurred with the seasonal CCI-GPP relationship than with the NDVI-GPP or NIRv-GPP relationships. Relative to 16-day composite data, daily MODIS data provided a more detailed GPP phenology. However, relationships between all vegetation indices and GPP improved with temporal aggregation up to one month, demonstrating that the degree of data aggregation affects the ability of reflectance-based indices to track GPP. Results from a multivariable regression revealed a strong relationship between GPP and a linear combination of 3 MODIS bands (B1, B2 and B11), which indicates that additional spectral information provided by the MODIS ocean band (band 11) can help track grassland GPP better than typical 2-band broad-band indices (e.g. NDVI or NIRv) only. Improved monitoring of prairie ecosystems using these enhanced approaches, can lead to a better understanding of the effects of changing weather and climate on the productivity of prairie ecosystems.}

abstract = {Introduction
Pedestrians are vulnerable road users exposed at risk during their interaction with vehicles in uncontrolled urban areas. In this paper, a critical overview of the literature and meta-analyses were conducted on the topic of pedestrian gap acceptance choice during midblock street crossings.
Method
Α large number of studies examining personal and contextual factors affecting midblock crossing choices were identified. In an effort to condense research outputs, a quantitative approach was adopted alongside qualitative assessments. Meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the impacts of various predictor variables on pedestrian gap acceptance probabilities from binary logistic models in midblock locations. After application of a rigorous set of criteria, 14 publications were considered appropriate to conduct meta-analyses on beta coefficients of four factors: vehicle speed (VS), gap size (GS), waiting time (WT) and frequency of attempts (FA).
Results
Statistically significant results were obtained for VS, GS and FA. Specifically, it was determined that for one unit increase in incoming VS, there is a 10% decrease (OR=0.9) in the odds of pedestrians crossing the road (accepting the incoming time gap) for pedestrians. For one unit increase in temporal GS, the odds of crossing the road become 7.22 times larger for pedestrians. For each crossing attempt, as measured by FA, the odds of crossing the road become 16.6 times larger for pedestrians. WT was determined to have a non-significant impact on pedestrian crossing odds.
Conclusions
To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that a meta-analysis of the critical factors influencing gap acceptance of pedestrians in midblock street crossings is carried out. Study findings are useful for practitioners and policymakers to formulate appropriate management plans to reduce interactions of pedestrians and vehicles at uncontrolled urban midblock locations. Future research is needed to further understand the determinants of gap choice decision making.}

The identified plant is then used for model predictive controllers in the outer loop. The overall control law demonstrates improved robustness to measurement noise, modeling uncertainties, multiple faults and severe wind turbulence and gusts. In addition, the flight control system employs filters and dead-zone nonlinear elements to reduce chattering and improve handling quality. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed controller using conventional fighter aircraft without control redundancy.}

The use of 3D point cloud modeling by the construction industry has been significantly increased in recent years especially for recording the as-is conditions of facilities. The high-precision and dense 3D point clouds generated by photogrammetry can facilitate the process of asset condition assessment. This paper presents an automated computer-vision based method that detects, classifies, and localizes traffic signs via street-level image-based 3D point cloud models. The proposed pipeline integrates 3D object detection algorithm. An improved Structure-from-Motion (SfM) procedure is developed to create a 3D point cloud of roadway assets from the street level imagery. In order to assist with accurate 3D recognition and localization by color and texture features extraction, an automated process of point cloud cleaning and noise removal is proposed. Using camera pose information from SfM, the points within the bounding box of detected traffic signs are then projected into the cleaned point cloud by using the triangulation method (linear and non-linear) and the 3D points corresponding to the traffic sign in question are labeled and visualized in 3D. The proposed framework is validated using real-life data, which represent the most common types of traffic signs. The robustness of the proposed pipeline is evaluated by analyzing the accuracy in detection of traffic signs as well as the accuracy in localization in 3D point cloud model. The results promise to better and more accurate visualize the location of the traffic signs with respect to other roadway assets in 3D environment.}

abstract = {The standard Differential Evolution Algorithm (sDE) is a stochactic search method commonly used in evolutionary computing. The problem solving success of sDE is highly sensitive to the genetic operators used and the initial values of the parameters of these operators. Since a universal Differential Evolution Algorithm (uDE) is not sensitive to the structure and parameter values of the genetic operators used, it is parameter-free in practice and easier to control than sDE. uDE does not need a trial-and-error process when selecting the genetic operators and initial values of intrinsic parameter of related genetic operators to solve the problem, unlike the sDE. Therefore, the use and adaptation of a uDE to solve different types of numerical engineering problems is easy and time-consuming compared to sDE. In this paper, a new uDE, Bernstain-Search Differential Evolution Algorithm (BSD), is introduced. BSD is new and easily controllable, simple structured, non-recursive, highly efficient, fast and practically parameter-free uDE. BSD have a too feasible random crossover and mutation process and does not have a control-parameter setting process, contrary to sDE and its improved variants. In this paper, 30 benchmark problems of CEC’2014, 60 classic benchmark problems, image evolution problems for 12 test images and one Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) refinement problem were used in the experiments performed to investigate the problem solving success of BSD, statistically. Four tested methods (i.e., ABC, JADE, CUCKOO, WDE) were used in the conducted experiments. Problem solving successes of BSD and tested methods were statistically compared by using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test piecewisely. Results obtained from the performed tests showed that in general, problem solving success of BSD is statistically better than the tested methods that have been used in this paper.}

This method provides a test engineer with key insights into the software’s decision-making engine and how those decisions affect transitions between performance modes. We achieve this via adaptive, simulation-based testing of the autonomous system where each sample represents a simulated scenario. The test scenario, i.e the system input, represents a given configuration of environmental or mission parameters and the resulting outputs are the system’s performance based on high-level success criteria. For realistic testing scenarios, the dimensionality of the configuration space and the computational expense of high-fidelity simulations precludes exhaustive or uniform sampling. Thus, we have developed specialized adaptive search algorithms designed to discover performance boundaries of the autonomy using a minimal number of samples. Further, unsupervised clustering techniques are presented that can group test scenarios by the resulting performance modes and sort them by those which are most effective at diagnosing changes in the autonomous system’s behavior. The result is a testing framework that gives the test engineer a set of diverse scenarios that exercises the decision boundaries of the autonomous system under test.}

Based on partial differential equations, the methodology rigorously leverages the level-set equation that governs time-optimal reachability fronts for a given relative vehicle-speed function. To set up the energy optimization, the relative vehicle-speed and headings are considered to be stochastic and new stochastic Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) level-set equations are derived. Their solution provides the distribution of time-optimal reachability fronts and corresponding distribution of time-optimal paths. An optimization is then performed on the vehicle’s energy-time joint distribution to select the energy-optimal paths for each arrival time, among all stochastic time-optimal paths for that arrival time. Numerical schemes to solve the reduced stochastic DO level-set equations are obtained, and accuracy and efficiency considerations are discussed. These reduced equations are first shown to be efficient at solving the governing stochastic level-sets, in part by comparisons with direct Monte Carlo simulations. To validate the methodology and illustrate its accuracy, comparisons with semi-analytical energy-optimal path solutions are then completed. In particular, we consider the energy-optimal crossing of a canonical steady front and set up its semi-analytical solution using a energy-time nested nonlinear double-optimization scheme. We then showcase the inner workings and nuances of the energy-optimal path planning, considering different mission scenarios. Finally, we study and discuss results of energy-optimal missions in a wind-driven barotropic quasi-geostrophic double-gyre ocean circulation.}

Second, a sigmoid function based novel tracking differentiator (STD) with global fast convergence property, simple structure and chattering-free in differential estimation is developed to handle the “explosion of term” problem in back-stepping TLC design. In addition, dynamical performance and noise-attenuation ability of STD are analyzed in frequency domain by describing function method. Third, how to convert between sigmoid function based disturbance observer (SDO) and STD is given, and based on the estimates of uncertainties provided by SDO in attitude and angular rate loop, the back-stepping robust TLC is synthesized to track the respective commands in dual-loop.

Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) is used to assess ecosystem health, land cover and carbon stocks, hence accurately measuring FVC is an important task for scientists and land managers. Many methods have been proposed to measure FVC and simple linear models are commonly used. We created an experiment that allowed us to: 1) acquire very detailed hyperspectral imagery (1 mm pixel size) from a simulated mangrove forest, 2) measure the effect of water depth on FVC estimations, and 3) compare the relationship of eight spectral bands and indices with FVC using linear and non-linear models. After acquiring the imagery we corrected for dark signal and a white reference, performed spectral and spatial resampling, and created linear and non-linear models across four pixel sizes. Our results suggest that 1) linear and beta models have similar performance across all pixel sizes; 2) Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index2 (MSAVI2) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) perform better than the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and, 3) our models perform better at fine pixel sizes than coarse scales. We tested our results on high-resolution satellite imagery with similar results and, therefore, recommend using SAVI, EVI or MSAVI2 when predicting FVC instead of NDVI.}

This work proposes a novel Slowing Mechanism (SM) that provides Power Workload Proportionality for a wired network equipment to reduce power consumption. The Slowing will be achieved by adjusting the Operational Rate (OPR) of components according to traffic load. To meet applications’ (VoIP, Data and Video) performance requirements, a Safety Gap (SG) is proposed in the Slowing Mechanism. Many parameters need to be carefully set for performance requirements within Slowing Mechanism. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation dynamically set to respond to the variable incoming traffic pattern determines these parameters. Thus, this work is a GA and the Slowing Mechanism integration to provide an insight into how GA optimisation can be employed in a network environment, and to optimise parameters in real-time. The results demonstrate that a considerable amount of saving is achievable. With the default hardware configuration, the SM optimises the parameters and offers a saving of over 60% for typical stable traffic, with acceptable packet delay and no packet loss. This saving is reduced to 17% saving for a bursty traffic pattern with acceptable performance degradation.}

abstract = {This paper investigates one robust adaptive controller for hypersonic flight dynamics. The altitude tracking is transformed into the control problem of the attitude subsystem, which is composed of flight path angle, pitch angle and pitch rate. Different from previous design using back-stepping related technique, this paper analyzed the tracking control without back-stepping where the controller is synthesized with high gain observer and minimal-learning-parameter technique. The highlight is that the design procedure is greatly simplified and the computation burden of parameter updating is reduced. It is proved that the filtered tracking error is guaranteed in the semiglobal sense. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design.}

abstract = {The utility of micro air vehicles (MAVs) has expanded significantly in the last decade, and there are now numerous commercial systems available at relatively low cost. This expansion has arisen mainly due to the miniaturisation of flight control systems and advances in energy storage and propulsion technologies. Several emerging applications involve routine operation of MAVs in complex urban environments such as parcel delivery, communications relay and environmental monitoring. However, MAVs currently rely on one or more operators-in-the-loop and, whilst desirable, full autonomous operation has not yet been achieved. In this review paper, autonomous MAV operation in complex environments is explored with conceptualisation for future MAV operation in urban environments. Limitations of current technologies are systematically examined through consideration of the state-of-the-art and future trends. The main limitations challenging the realisation of fully autonomous MAVs are mainly attributed to: computational power, communication and energy storage. These limitations lead to poor sensing and planning capabilities, which are essential components of autonomous MAVs. Possible solutions are explored with goal of enabling MAVs to reliably operate autonomously in urban environments.}

abstract = {This paper investigates a backstepping sliding mode fault-tolerant tracking control problem for a hydro-turbine governing system with consideration of external disturbances, actuator faults and dead-zone input. To reduce the effects of the unknown random disturbances, the nonlinear disturbance observer is designed to identify and estimate the disturbance term. To drastically decrease the complexity of stability functions selection and controller design, the recursive processes of the backstepping technique are employed. Additionally, based on the nonlinear disturbance observer and the backstepping technique, the sliding mode fault-tolerant tracking control approach is developed for the hydro-turbine governing system (HTGS). The stability of HTGS is rigorously demonstrated through Lyapunov analysis which is capable to satisfy a tracking control performance. Finally, comprehensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.}
