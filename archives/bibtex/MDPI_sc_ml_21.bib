ABSTRACT = {In the context of logistics and transportation, this paper discusses how simheuristics can be extended by adding a fuzzy layer that allows us to deal with complex optimization problems with both stochastic and fuzzy uncertainty. This hybrid approach combines simulation, metaheuristics, and fuzzy logic to generate near-optimal solutions to large scale NP-hard problems that typically arise in many transportation activities, including the vehicle routing problem, the arc routing problem, or the team orienteering problem. The methodology allows us to model different components–such as travel times, service times, or customers’ demands–as deterministic, stochastic, or fuzzy. A series of computational experiments contribute to validate our hybrid approach, which can also be extended to other optimization problems in areas such as manufacturing and production, smart cities, telecommunication networks, etc.},

ABSTRACT = {Mobile healthcare service has become increasingly popular thanks to the significant advances in the wireless body area networks (WBANs). It helps medical professionals to collect patient’s healthcare data remotely and provides remote medical diagnosis. Since the health data are privacy-related, they should provide services with privacy-preserving, which should consider security and privacy at the same time. Recently, some lightweight patient healthcare authentication protocols were proposed for WBANs. However, we observed that they are vulnerable to tracing attacks because the patient uses the same identifier in each session, which could leak privacy-related information on the patient. To defeat the weakness, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving authentication protocol for WBANs in healthcare service. The proposed protocol is only based on one-way hash function and with exclusive-or operation, which are lightweight operations than asymmetric cryptosystem operations. We performed two rigorous formal security proofs based on BAN logic and ProVerif tool. Furthermore, comparison results with the relevant protocols show that the proposed protocol achieves more privacy and security features than the other protocols and has suitable efficiency in computational and communicational concerns.},

ABSTRACT = {The current state of technological progress offers extensive opportunities for the development of urban infrastructure and the construction of Smart Cities, but the city will only become intelligent if it raises the living standards of all citizens in it. The Smart City uses information and communication technologies to improve its functionality and long-term sustainability and to increase the living standards of its citizens. In this context, it is necessary to address the issue of mutual communication between the city and the citizen and its implementation. The aim of the paper is to design a suitable smart solution that would streamline two-way communication between the city and its citizens. This solution is an urban mobile application, which is also a simple and yet sufficiently effective solution for the transformation of cities into Smart Cities. The main benefit is the implementation of research assessing the requirements of the citizens of a particular city for the services and functions that the application should offer. After analysing the results, a specific urban application design was processed using User Interface and User Interface design. The proposal consists of seven consecutive phases. All phases were completed in solving the design and the result can be seen in the resulting interactive prototype, which was finally tested by authors and random users representing all age categories. The results of the prototype usability tests enabled a gradual improvement of the solution, which culminated in the confirmation of its effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Climate change is one of the most challenging problems that humanity has ever faced. With the rapid development in technology, a key feature of 5G networks is the increased level of connectivity between everyday objects, facilitated by faster internet speeds with smart facilities indicative of the forthcoming 5G-driven revolution in Internet of Things (IoT). This study revisited the benefits of 5G network technologies to enhance the efficiency of the smart city and minimize climate change impacts in Singapore, thus creating a clean environment for healthy living. Results revealed that the smart management of energy, wastes, water resources, agricultures, risk factors, and the economy adopted in Singapore can remarkably contribute to reducing climate change, thus attaining the sustainability goals. Hence, future studies on cost-effective design and implementation are essential to increase the focus on the smart city concept globally.},

ABSTRACT = {As an emerging business model, the sharing economy has gained a large amount of academic attention; the pricing problem in the sharing economy has also been widely investigated. Aiming to capture the current state-of-the-art research on pricing strategies in the sharing economy and foreseeing directions for future research, this article conducts a systematic literature review and content analysis of 158 articles from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. As a result, first, this review proposes an extended definition covering B2C and C2C models and a model structure covering the entire supply chain, based on which 158 articles are categorized into nine sub-models covering 30 scenarios. Second, the general characteristics (i.e., research fields, time and journal distributions, research themes and scenarios) and technical details (i.e., theories, methodologies, approaches, models, and conclusions) of the 158 articles are reviewed and summarized by the pricing party, business mode, and scenario. Finally, this review proposes some future research directions of existing scenarios from the perspectives of information asymmetry, market competition, and empirical approaches, and discusses some extensions, including uninvestigated scenarios and COVID-19-related topics; correspondingly, this review suggests some analytical models and empirical approaches that can be employed to fill these gaps. The proposed research directions and corresponding approaches can be references for future research.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning (ML) techniques learn a system by observing it. Events and occurrences in the network define what is expected of the network’s operation. It is for this reason that ML techniques are used in the computer network security field to detect unauthorized intervention. In the event of suspicious activity, the result of the ML analysis deviates from the definition of expected normal network activity and the suspicious activity becomes apparent. Support vector machines (SVM) are ML techniques that have been used to profile normal network activity and classify it as normal or abnormal. They are trained to configure an optimal hyperplane that classifies unknown input vectors’ values based on their positioning on the plane. We propose to use SVM models to detect malicious behavior within low-power, low-rate and short range networks, such as those used in the Internet of Things (IoT). We evaluated two SVM approaches, the C-SVM and the OC-SVM, where the former requires two classes of vector values (one for the normal and one for the abnormal activity) and the latter observes only normal behavior activity. Both approaches were used as part of an intrusion detection system (IDS) that monitors and detects abnormal activity within the smart node device. Actual network traffic with specific network-layer attacks implemented by us was used to create and evaluate the SVM detection models. It is shown that the C-SVM achieves up to 100% classification accuracy when evaluated with unknown data taken from the same network topology it was trained with and 81% accuracy when operating in an unknown topology. The OC-SVM that is created using benign activity achieves at most 58% accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is a problem-solving paradigm that uses knowledge of relevant past experiences (cases) to interpret or solve new problems. CBR systems allow generating explanations easily, as they typically organize and represent knowledge in a way that makes it possible to reason about and thereby generate explanations. An improvement of this paradigm is ontology-based CBR, an approach that combines, in the form of formal ontologies, case-specific knowledge with domain one in order to improve the effectiveness and explanation capability of the system. Intelligent systems make daily activities more easily, efficiently, and represent a real support for sustainable economic development. On the one hand, they improve efficiency, productivity, and quality, and, on the other hand, can reduce costs and cut waste. In this way, intelligent systems facilitate sustainable development, economic growth, societal progress, and improve efficiency. Aim: In this vision, the purpose of this paper is to propose a new generation of intelligent decision support systems for Business Model having the ability to provide explanations to increase confidence in proposed solutions. Findings/result: The performance results obtained show the benefits of the proposed solution with different requirements of an explanatory decision support system. Consequently, applying this paradigm for software tools of business model development will make a great promise for supporting business model design, sustainability, and innovation.},

ABSTRACT = {To sustain the complexity of growing demand, the conventional grid (CG) is incorporated with communication technology like advanced metering with sensors, demand response (DR), energy storage systems (ESS), and inclusion of electric vehicles (EV). In order to maintain local area energy balance and reliability, microgrids (MG) are proposed. Microgrids are low or medium voltage distribution systems with a resilient operation, that control the exchange of power between the main grid, locally distributed generators (DGs), and consumers using intelligent energy management techniques. This paper gives a brief introduction to microgrids, their operations, and further, a review of different energy management approaches. In a microgrid control strategy, an energy management system (EMS) is the key component to maintain the balance between energy resources (CG, DG, ESS, and EVs) and loads available while contributing the profit to utility. This article classifies the methodologies used for EMS based on the structure, control, and technique used. The untapped areas which have scope for investigation are also mentioned.},

ABSTRACT = {Experts confirm that 85% of the world’s population is expected to live in cities by 2050. Therefore, cities should be prepared to satisfy the needs of their citizens and provide the best services. The idea of a city of the future is commonly represented by the smart city, which is a more efficient system that optimizes its resources and services, through the use of monitoring and communication technology. Thus, one of the steps towards sustainability for cities around the world is to make a transition into smart cities. Here, sensors play an important role in the system, as they gather relevant information from the city, citizens, and the corresponding communication networks that transfer the information in real-time. Although the use of these sensors is diverse, their application can be categorized in six different groups: energy, health, mobility, security, water, and waste management. Based on these groups, this review presents an analysis of different sensors that are typically used in efforts toward creating smart cities. Insights about different applications and communication systems are provided, as well as the main opportunities and challenges faced when making a transition to a smart city. Ultimately, this process is not only about smart urban infrastructure, but more importantly about how these new sensing capabilities and digitization developments improve quality of life. Smarter communities are those that socialize, adapt, and invest through transparent and inclusive community engagement in these technologies based on local and regional societal needs and values. Cyber security disruptions and privacy remain chief vulnerabilities.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial intelligence (AI) programs are applied to methods such as diagnostic procedures, treatment protocol development, patient monitoring, drug development, personalized medicine in healthcare, and outbreak predictions in global health, as in the case of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Machine learning (ML) is a field of AI that allows computers to learn and improve without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms can also analyze large amounts of data called Big data through electronic health records for disease prevention and diagnosis. Wearable medical devices are used to continuously monitor an individual’s health status and store it in cloud computing. In the context of a newly published study, the potential benefits of sophisticated data analytics and machine learning are discussed in this review. We have conducted a literature search in all the popular databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. This paper describes the utilization of concepts underlying ML, big data, blockchain technology and their importance in medicine, healthcare, public health surveillance, case estimations in COVID-19 pandemic and other epidemics. The review also goes through the possible consequences and difficulties for medical practitioners and health technologists in designing futuristic models to improve the quality and well-being of human lives.},

ABSTRACT = {The demand for wearable devices to measure respiratory activity is constantly growing, finding applications in a wide range of scenarios (e.g., clinical environments and workplaces, outdoors for monitoring sports activities, etc.). Particularly, the respiration rate (RR) is a vital parameter since it indicates serious illness (e.g., pneumonia, emphysema, pulmonary embolism, etc.). Therefore, several solutions have been presented in the scientific literature and on the market to make RR monitoring simple, accurate, reliable and noninvasive. Among the different transduction methods, the piezoresistive and inertial ones satisfactorily meet the requirements for smart wearable devices since unobtrusive, lightweight and easy to integrate. Hence, this review paper focuses on innovative wearable devices, detection strategies and algorithms that exploit piezoresistive or inertial sensors to monitor the breathing parameters. At first, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of innovative piezoresistive wearable devices for measuring user’s respiratory variables. Later, a survey of novel piezoresistive textiles to develop wearable devices for detecting breathing movements is reported. Afterwards, the state-of-art about wearable devices to monitor the respiratory parameters, based on inertial sensors (i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes), is presented for detecting dysfunctions or pathologies in a non-invasive and accurate way. In this field, several processing tools are employed to extract the respiratory parameters from inertial data; therefore, an overview of algorithms and methods to determine the respiratory rate from acceleration data is provided. Finally, comparative analysis for all the covered topics are reported, providing useful insights to develop the next generation of wearable sensors for monitoring respiratory parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) enables various underwater objects be connected to accommodate a wide range of applications, such as oil and mineral exportations, disaster detection, and tracing tracking systems. As about 71% of our earth is covered by water and one-fourth of the population lives around this, the IoUT expects to play a vital role. It is imperative to pursue reliable communication in this vast domain, as human beings’ future depends on water activities and resources. Therefore, there is a urgent need for underwater communication to be reliable, end-to-end secure, and collision/void node-free, especially when the routing path is established between sender and sonobuoys. The foremost issue discussed in this area is its routing path, which has high security and bandwidth without simultaneous multiple reflections. Short communication range is also a problem (because of an absence of inter-node adjustment); the acoustic signals have short ranges and maximum-scaling factors that cause a delay in communication. Therefore, we proposed Rotational Orbit-Based Inter Node Adjustment (ROBINA) with variant Path-Adjustment (PA-ROBINA) and Path Loss (PL-ROBINA) for IoUTs to achive reliable communication between the sender and sonobuoys. Additionally, the mathematical-based path loss model was discussed to cover the PL-ROBINA strategy. Extensive simulations were conducted with various realistic parameters and the results were compared with state-of-the-art routing protocols. Extensive simulations proved that the proposed routing scheme outperformed different realistic parameters; for example, packet transmission 45% increased with an average end-to-end delay of only 0.3% respectively. Furthermore, the transmission loss and path loss (measured in dB) were 25 and 46 dB, respectively, compared with other algorithms, for example, EBER2 54%, WDFAD-BDR 54%, AEDG 49%, ASEGD 55%, AVH-AHH-VBF 54.5%, and TANVEER 39%, respectively. In addition, the individual parameters with ROBINA and TANVEER were also compared, in which ROBINA achieved a 98% packet transmission ratio compared with TANVEER, which was only 82%.},

ABSTRACT = {In most countries, three-dimensional (3D) property units are registered utilizing two-dimensional (2D) documentation and textual description. This approach has several limitations as it is unable to represent the actual extent of complicated 3D property units in space. As traditional procedures often lead to increased costs and long delays in 2D cadastral surveying, a fast, cost-effective, and reliable solution is needed to cope with the remaining global cadastral surveying needs. Crowdsourcing has claimed a critical role as a reliable methodology with huge potential regarding the realization of 2D and 3D cadastral registration in both an affordable and a timely manner. Many large modern constructions are now planned and constructed based on BIM technology all over the world. The utilization of 3D digital models, such as building information models (BIMs), and the establishment of a connection with the international standard of the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) could be a solution for the rapid integration of these units into a 3D crowdsourced cadaster with a better representation of the cadastral boundaries of these units, a detailed visualization of complex infrastructures, and an enhancement in the interoperability between different parties and organizations. In this paper, the potential linkage between the BIM, the LADM, and crowdsourcing techniques is investigated in order to provide an effective technical solution for the integration of large new constructions into 3D crowdsourced cadastral surveys. The proposed framework is tested on a building block in Athens, Greece. The potential, perspectives, and reliability of such an implementation are assessed and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Travel surveys can uncover information regarding travel behaviour, needs, and more. Collected information is utilised to make choices when reorganising or planning built environments. Over the years, methods for conducting travel surveys have changed from interviews and forms to automated travel diaries in order to monitor trips made by travellers. With the fast progression of technological advancements, new possibilities for operationalising such travel diaries can be implemented, changing from utilising mobile to wearable devices. Wearable devices are often equipped with sensors which collect continuous biometric data from sources that are not reachable from standard mobile devices. Data collected through wearable devices range from heart rate and blood pressure to temperature and perspiration. This advancement opens new possible layers of information in the collection of travel data. Such biometric data can be used to derive psychophysiological conditions related to cognitive load, which can uncover in-depth knowledge regarding stress and emotions. This paper aims to explore the possibilities of data analysis on the data collected through a software combining travel survey data, such as position and time, with heartrate, to gain knowledge of the implications of such data. The knowledge about the implications of spatial configurations can be used to create more accessible environments.},

ABSTRACT = {The evolution of IoT has come with the challenge of connecting not only a massive number of devices, but also providing an always wider variety of services. In the next few years, a big increase in the number of connected devices is expected, together with an important increase in the amount of traffic generated. Never before have wireless communications permeated so deeply in all industries and economic sectors. Therefore, it is crucial to correctly forecast the spectrum needs, which bands should be used for which services, and the economic potential of its utilization. This paper proposes a methodology for spectrum forecasting consisting of two phases: a market study and a spectrum forecasting model. The market study determines the main drivers of the IoT industry for any country: services, technologies, frequency bands, and the number of devices that will require IoT connectivity. The forecasting model takes the market study as the input and calculates the spectrum demand in 5 steps: Defining scenarios for spectrum contention, calculating the offered traffic load, calculating a capacity for some QoS requirements, finding the spectrum required, and adjusting according to key spectral efficiency determinants. This methodology is applied for Colombia’s IoT spectrum forecast. We provide a complete step-by-step implementation in fourteen independent spectrum contention scenarios, calculating offered traffic, required capacity, and spectrum for cellular licensed bands and non-cellular unlicensed bands in a 10-year period. Detailed results are presented specifying coverage area requirements per economic sector, frequency band, and service. The need for higher teledensity and higher spectral efficiency turns out to be a determining factor for spectrum savings.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a multifunctional interdisciplinary framework that makes four scientific contributions towards the development of personalized ambient assisted living (AAL), with a specific focus to address the different and dynamic needs of the diverse aging population in the future of smart living environments. First, it presents a probabilistic reasoning-based mathematical approach to model all possible forms of user interactions for any activity arising from user diversity of multiple users in such environments. Second, it presents a system that uses this approach with a machine learning method to model individual user-profiles and user-specific user interactions for detecting the dynamic indoor location of each specific user. Third, to address the need to develop highly accurate indoor localization systems for increased trust, reliance, and seamless user acceptance, the framework introduces a novel methodology where two boosting approaches—Gradient Boosting and the AdaBoost algorithm are integrated and used on a decision tree-based learning model to perform indoor localization. Fourth, the framework introduces two novel functionalities to provide semantic context to indoor localization in terms of detecting each user’s floor-specific location as well as tracking whether a specific user was located inside or outside a given spatial region in a multi-floor-based indoor setting. These novel functionalities of the proposed framework were tested on a dataset of localization-related Big Data collected from 18 different users who navigated in 3 buildings consisting of 5 floors and 254 indoor spatial regions, with an to address the limitation in prior works in this field centered around the lack of training data from diverse users. The results show that this approach of indoor localization for personalized AAL that models each specific user always achieves higher accuracy as compared to the traditional approach of modeling an average user. The results further demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms all prior works in this field in terms of functionalities, performance characteristics, and operational features.},

ABSTRACT = {The connectivity of our surrounding objects to the internet plays a tremendous role in our daily lives. Many network applications have been developed in every domain of life, including business, healthcare, smart homes, and smart cities, to name a few. As these network applications provide a wide range of services for large user groups, the network intruders are prone to developing intrusion skills for attack and malicious compliance. Therefore, safeguarding network applications and things connected to the internet has always been a point of interest for researchers. Many studies propose solutions for intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems. Network communities have produced benchmark datasets available for researchers to improve the accuracy of intrusion detection systems. The scientific community has presented data mining and machine learning-based mechanisms to detect intrusion with high classification accuracy. This paper presents an intrusion detection system based on the ensemble of prediction and learning mechanisms to improve anomaly detection accuracy in a network intrusion environment. The learning mechanism is based on automated machine learning, and the prediction model is based on the Kalman filter. Performance analysis of the proposed intrusion detection system is evaluated using publicly available intrusion datasets UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS2017. The proposed model-based intrusion detection accuracy for the UNSW-NB15 dataset is 98.801 percent, and the CICIDS2017 dataset is 97.02 percent. The performance comparison results show that the proposed ensemble model-based intrusion detection significantly improves the intrusion detection accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Continuous and emerging advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have enabled Internet-of-Things (IoT)-to-Cloud applications to be induced by data pipelines and Edge Intelligence-based architectures. Advanced vehicular networks greatly benefit from these architectures due to the implicit functionalities that are focused on realizing the Internet of Vehicle (IoV) vision. However, IoV is susceptible to attacks, where adversaries can easily exploit existing vulnerabilities. Several attacks may succeed due to inadequate or ineffective authentication techniques. Hence, there is a timely need for hardening the authentication process through cutting-edge access control mechanisms. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based Multi-Factor authentication model that uses an embedded Digital Signature (MFBC_eDS) for vehicular clouds and Cloud-enabled IoV. Our proposed MFBC_eDS model consists of a scheme that integrates the Security Assertion Mark-up Language (SAML) to the Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for a connected edge to cloud ecosystem. MFBC_eDS draws an essential comparison with the baseline authentication scheme suggested by Karla and Sood. Based on the foundations of Karla and Sood’s scheme, an embedded Probabilistic Polynomial-Time Algorithm (ePPTA) and an additional Hash function for the Pi generated during Karla and Sood’s authentication were proposed and discussed. The preliminary analysis of the proposition shows that the approach is more suitable to counter major adversarial attacks in an IoV-centered environment based on the Dolev–Yao adversarial model while satisfying aspects of the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad.},

ABSTRACT = {Building footprints and road networks are important inputs for a great deal of services. For instance, building maps are useful for urban planning, whereas road maps are essential for disaster response services. Traditionally, building and road maps are manually generated by remote sensing experts or land surveying, occasionally assisted by semi-automatic tools. In the last decade, deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated their capabilities to extract these elements automatically and accurately from remote sensing imagery. The building footprint and road network detection problem can be considered a multi-class semantic segmentation task, that is, a single model performs a pixel-wise classification on multiple classes, optimizing the overall performance. However, depending on the spatial resolution of the imagery used, both classes may coexist within the same pixel, drastically reducing their separability. In this regard, binary decomposition techniques, which have been widely studied in the machine learning literature, are proved useful for addressing multi-class problems. Accordingly, the multi-class problem can be split into multiple binary semantic segmentation sub-problems, specializing different models for each class. Nevertheless, in these cases, an aggregation step is required to obtain the final output labels. Additionally, other novel approaches, such as multi-task learning, may come in handy to further increase the performance of the binary semantic segmentation models. Since there is no certainty as to which strategy should be carried out to accurately tackle a multi-class remote sensing semantic segmentation problem, this paper performs an in-depth study to shed light on the issue. For this purpose, open-access Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery (at 10 m) are considered for extracting buildings and roads, making use of the well-known U-Net convolutional neural network. It is worth stressing that building and road classes may coexist within the same pixel when working at such a low spatial resolution, setting a challenging problem scheme. Accordingly, a robust experimental study is developed to assess the benefits of the decomposition strategies and their combination with a multi-task learning scheme. The obtained results demonstrate that decomposing the considered multi-class remote sensing semantic segmentation problem into multiple binary ones using a One-vs.-All binary decomposition technique leads to better results than the standard direct multi-class approach. Additionally, the benefits of using a multi-task learning scheme for pushing the performance of binary segmentation models are also shown.},

ABSTRACT = {Edge intelligence (EI) has received a lot of interest because it can reduce latency, increase efficiency, and preserve privacy. More significantly, as the Internet of Things (IoT) has proliferated, billions of portable and embedded devices have been interconnected, producing zillions of gigabytes on edge networks. Thus, there is an immediate need to push AI (artificial intelligence) breakthroughs within edge networks to achieve the full promise of edge data analytics. EI solutions have supported digital technology workloads and applications from the infrastructure level to edge networks; however, there are still many challenges with the heterogeneity of computational capabilities and the spread of information sources. We propose a novel event-driven deep-learning framework, called EDL-EI (event-driven deep learning for edge intelligence), via the design of a novel event model by defining events using correlation analysis with multiple sensors in real-world settings and incorporating multi-sensor fusion techniques, a transformation method for sensor streams into images, and lightweight 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) models. To demonstrate the feasibility of the EDL-EI framework, we presented an IoT-based prototype system that we developed with multiple sensors and edge devices. To verify the proposed framework, we have a case study of air-quality scenarios based on the benchmark data provided by the USA Environmental Protection Agency for the most polluted cities in South Korea and China. We have obtained outstanding predictive accuracy (97.65% and 97.19%) from two deep-learning models on the cities’ air-quality patterns. Furthermore, the air-quality changes from 2019 to 2020 have been analyzed to check the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital twins (DTs) is a promising technology in the revolution of the industry and essential for Industry 4.0. DTs play a vital role in improving distributed manufacturing, providing up-to-date operational data representation of physical assets, supporting decision-making, and avoiding the potential risks in distributed manufacturing systems. Furthermore, DTs need to collaborate within distributed manufacturing systems to predict the risks and reach consensus-based decision-making. However, DTs collaboration suffers from single failure due to attack and connection in a centralized manner, data interoperability, authentication, and scalability. To overcome the above challenges, we have discussed the major high-level requirements for the DTs collaboration. Then, we have proposed a conceptual framework to fulfill the DTs collaboration requirements by using the combination of blockchain, predictive analysis techniques, and DTs technologies. The proposed framework aims to empower more intelligence DTs based on blockchain technology. In particular, we propose a concrete ledger-based collaborative DTs framework that focuses on real-time operational data analytics and distributed consensus algorithms. Furthermore, we describe how the conceptual framework can be applied using smart transportation system use cases, i.e., smart logistics and railway predictive maintenance. Finally, we highlighted the future direction to guide interested researchers in this interesting area.},

ABSTRACT = {Environmental Sound Recognition has become a relevant application for smart cities. Such an application, however, demands the use of trained machine learning classifiers in order to categorize a limited set of audio categories. Although classical machine learning solutions have been proposed in the past, most of the latest solutions that have been proposed toward automated and accurate sound classification are based on a deep learning approach. Deep learning models tend to be large, which can be problematic when considering that sound classifiers often have to be embedded in resource constrained devices. In this paper, a classical machine learning based classifier called MosAIc, and a lighter Convolutional Neural Network model for environmental sound recognition, are proposed to directly compete in terms of accuracy with the latest deep learning solutions. Both approaches are evaluated in an embedded system in order to identify the key parameters when placing such applications on constrained devices. The experimental results show that classical machine learning classifiers can be combined to achieve similar results to deep learning models, and even outperform them in accuracy. The cost, however, is a larger classification time.},

ABSTRACT = {Data scientists spend much time with data cleaning tasks, and this is especially important when dealing with data gathered from sensors, as finding failures is not unusual (there is an abundance of research on anomaly detection in sensor data). This work analyzes several aspects of the data generated by different sensor types to understand particularities in the data, linking them with existing data mining methodologies. Using data from different sources, this work analyzes how the type of sensor used and its measurement units have an important impact in basic statistics such as variance and mean, because of the statistical distributions of the datasets. The work also analyzes the behavior of outliers, how to detect them, and how they affect the equivalence of sensors, as equivalence is used in many solutions for identifying anomalies. Based on the previous results, the article presents guidance on how to deal with data coming from sensors, in order to understand the characteristics of sensor datasets, and proposes a parallelized implementation. Finally, the article shows that the proposed decision-making processes work well with a new type of sensor and that parallelizing with several cores enables calculations to be executed up to four times faster.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning methods predicated on convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks have enabled significant improvement in node classification and prediction when applied to graph representation with learning node embedding to effectively represent the hierarchical properties of graphs. An interesting approach (DiffPool) utilises a differentiable graph pooling technique which learns ‘differentiable soft cluster assignment’ for nodes at each layer of a deep graph neural network with nodes mapped on sets of clusters. However, effective control of the learning process is difficult given the inherent complexity in an ‘end-to-end’ model with the potential for a large number parameters (including the potential for redundant parameters). In this paper, we propose an approach termed FPool, which is a development of the basic method adopted in DiffPool (where pooling is applied directly to node representations). Techniques designed to enhance data classification have been created and evaluated using a number of popular and publicly available sensor datasets. Experimental results for FPool demonstrate improved classification and prediction performance when compared to alternative methods considered. Moreover, FPool shows a significant reduction in the training time over the basic DiffPool framework.},

ABSTRACT = {The constant advancements in Information Technology have been the main driver of the Big Data concept’s success. With it, new concepts such as Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 are arising. Due to the increase in data volume, velocity, and variety, organizations are now looking to their data analytics infrastructures and searching for approaches to improve their decision-making capabilities, in order to enhance their results using new approaches such as Big Data and Machine Learning. The implementation of a Big Data Warehouse can be the first step to improve the organizations’ data analysis infrastructure and start retrieving value from the usage of Big Data technologies. Moving to Big Data technologies can provide several opportunities for organizations, such as the capability of analyzing an enormous quantity of data from different data sources in an efficient way. However, at the same time, different challenges can arise, including data quality, data management, and lack of knowledge within the organization, among others. In this work, we propose an approach that can be adopted in the logistics department of any organization in order to promote the Logistics 4.0 movement, while highlighting the main challenges and opportunities associated with the development and implementation of a Big Data Warehouse in a real demonstration case at a multinational automotive organization.},

ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the cornerstone of the current Internet of Things era. They have limited resources and features, a smaller packet size than other types of networks, and dynamic multi-hop transmission. WSNs can monitor a particular area of interest and are used in many different applications. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, WSNs have been used to measure social distancing/contact tracing among people. However, the major challenge faced by WSN protocols is limited battery energy. Therefore, the whole WSN area is divided into odd clusters using k-means++ clustering to make a majority rule decision to reduce the amount of additional data sent to the base station (or sink) and achieve node energy-saving efficiency. This study proposes an energy-efficient binarized data aggregation (EEBDA) scheme, by which, through a threshold value, the collected sensing data are asserted with binary values. Subsequently, the corresponding cluster head (CH), according to the Hamming weight and the final majority decision, is calculated and sent to the base station (BS). The EEBDA is based on each cluster and divides the entire WSN area into four quadrants. All CHs construct a data-relay transmission link in the same quadrant; the binary value is transferred from the CHs to the sink. The EEBDA adopts a CH rotation scheme to aggregate the data based on the majority results in the cluster. The simulation results demonstrate that the EEBDA can reduce redundant data transmissions, average the energy consumption of nodes in the cluster, and obtain a better network lifetime when compared to the LEACH, LEACH-C, and DEEC algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Industry 4.0, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are generating ever more data. This opens new opportunities for companies, as they can monitor development and production processes, improve their products, and offer additional services. However, companies are often overwhelmed by Big Data, as they cannot handle its volume, velocity, and variety. Additionally, they mostly do not follow a strategy in the collection and usage of data, which leads to unexploited business potentials. This paper presents the implementation of a Digital Twin module in an industrial case study, applying a concept for guiding companies on their way from data to value. A standardized use case template and a procedure model support the companies in (1) formulating a value proposition, (2) analyzing the current process, and (3) conceptualizing a target process. The presented use case entails an anomaly detection algorithm based on Gaussian processes to detect defective products in real-time for the extrusion process of aluminum profiles. The module was initially tested in a relevant environment; however, full implementation is still missing. Therefore, technology readiness level 6 (TRL6) was reached. Furthermore, the effect of the target process on production efficiency is evaluated, leading to significant cost reduction, energy savings, and quality improvements.},

ABSTRACT = {Imaging spectroscopy has emerged as a reliable analytical method for effectively characterizing and quantifying quality attributes of agricultural products. By providing spectral information relevant to food quality properties, imaging spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be a potential method for rapid and non-destructive classification, authentication, and prediction of quality parameters of various categories of tubers, including potato and sweet potato. The imaging technique has demonstrated great capacities for gaining rapid information about tuber physical properties (such as texture, water binding capacity, and specific gravity), chemical components (such as protein, starch, and total anthocyanin), varietal authentication, and defect aspects. This paper emphasizes how recent developments in spectral imaging with machine learning have enhanced overall capabilities to evaluate tubers. The machine learning algorithms coupled with feature variable identification approaches have obtained acceptable results. This review briefly introduces imaging spectroscopy and machine learning, then provides examples and discussions of these techniques in tuber quality determinations, and presents the challenges and future prospects of the technology. This review will be of great significance to the study of tubers using spectral imaging technology.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a thorough and definitive evaluation of Predictive Optimal Energy Management Strategy (POEMS) applications in connected vehicles using 10 to 20 s predicted velocity is conducted for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). The presented methodology includes synchronous datasets gathered in Fort Collins, Colorado using a test vehicle equipped with sensors to measure ego vehicle position and motion and that of surrounding objects as well as receive Infrastructure to Vehicle (I2V) information. These datasets are utilized to compare the effect of different signal categories on prediction fidelity for different prediction horizons within a POEMS framework. Multiple artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms use the collected data to output future vehicle velocity prediction models. The effects of different combinations of signals and different models on prediction fidelity in various prediction windows are explored. All of these combinations are ultimately addressed where the rubber meets the road: fuel economy (FE) enabled from POEMS. FE optimization is performed using Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a Dynamic Programming (DP) optimizer. FE improvements from MPC control at various prediction time horizons are compared to that of full-cycle DP. All FE results are determined using high-fidelity simulations of an Autonomie 2010 Toyota Prius model. The full-cycle DP POEMS provides the theoretical upper limit on fuel economy (FE) improvement achievable with POEMS but is not currently practical for real-world implementation. Perfect prediction MPC (PP-MPC) represents the upper limit of FE improvement practically achievable with POEMS. Real-Prediction MPC (RP-MPC) can provide nearly equivalent FE improvement when used with high-fidelity predictions. Constant-Velocity MPC (CV-MPC) uses a constant speed prediction and serves as a “null” POEMS. Results showed that RP-MPC, enabled by high-fidelity ego future speed prediction, led to significant FE improvement over baseline nearly matching that of PP-MPC.},

ABSTRACT = {Concrete is an important construction material. Its characteristics depend on the environmental conditions, construction methods, and mix factors. Working with concrete is particularly tricky in a hot climate. This study predicts the properties of concrete in hot conditions using the case study of Rawalpindi, Pakistan. In this research, variable casting temperatures, design factors, and curing conditions are investigated for their effects on concrete characteristics. For this purpose, water–cement ratio (w/c), in-situ concrete temperature (T), and curing methods of the concrete are varied, and their effects on pulse velocity (PV), compressive strength (fc), depth of water penetration (WP), and split tensile strength (ft) were studied for up to 180 days. Quadratic regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models have been formulated to forecast the properties of concrete in the current study. The results show that T, curing period, and moist curing strongly influence fc, ft, and PV, while WP is adversely affected by T and moist curing. The ANN model shows better results compared to the quadratic regression model. Furthermore, a combined ANN model of fc, ft, and PV was also developed that displayed higher accuracy than the individual ANN models. These models can help construction site engineers select the appropriate concrete parameters when concreting under hot climates to produce durable and long-lasting concrete.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) deployments have shown their potential for aiding the realisation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Concerns regarding how the IoT can specifically drive SDGs 6, 11 and 9 in developing countries have been raised with respect to the challenges of deploying licensed and unlicensed low-power wide area network (LPWAN) IoT technologies and their opportunities for IoT consumers and service providers. With IoT infrastructure and protocols being ubiquitous and each being proposed for different SDGs, we review and compare the various performance characteristics of LoRaWAN and NB-IoT networks. From the performance analysis of our networks, NB-IoT, one of the standardised promising cellular IoT solutions for developing countries, is more expensive and less energy-efficient than LoRaWAN. Utilising the same user equipment (UE), NB-IoT consumed an excess of 2 mAh of power for joining the network and 1.7 mAh more for a 44-byte uplink message compared to LoRaWAN. However, NB-IoT has the advantage of reliably and securely delivering higher network connection capacity in IoT use cases, leveraging existing cellular infrastructure. With a maximum throughput of 264 bps at 837 ms measured latency, NB-IoT outperformed LoRaWAN and proved robust for machine-type communications. These findings will help IoT consumers and service providers understand the performance differences and deployment challenges of NB-IoT and LoRaWAN and establish new research directions to tackle IoT issues in developing countries. With Nigeria as a case study, for consumers and organisations at a crossroads in their long-term deployment decisions, the proposed LPWAN integrated architecture is an example of the deployment opportunities for consumer and industrial IoT applications in developing countries.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent times, health applications have been gaining rapid popularity in smart cities using the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Many real-time solutions are giving benefits to both patients and professionals for remote data accessibility and suitable actions. However, timely medical decisions and efficient management of big data using IoT-based resources are the burning research challenges. Additionally, the distributed nature of data processing in many proposed solutions explicitly increases the threats of information leakages and damages the network integrity. Such solutions impose overhead on medical sensors and decrease the stability of the real-time transmission systems. Therefore, this paper presents a machine-learning model with SDN-enabled security to predict the consumption of network resources and improve the delivery of sensors data. Additionally, it offers centralized-based software define network (SDN) architecture to overcome the network threats among deployed sensors with nominal management cost. Firstly, it offers an unsupervised machine learning technique and decreases the communication overheads for IoT networks. Secondly, it predicts the link status using dynamic metrics and refines its strategies using SDN architecture. In the end, a security algorithm is utilized by the SDN controller that efficiently manages the consumption of the IoT nodes and protects it from unidentified occurrences. The proposed model is verified using simulations and improves system performance in terms of network throughput by 13%, data drop ratio by 39%, data delay by 11%, and faulty packets by 46% compared to HUNA and CMMA schemes.},

ABSTRACT = {As in other countries of the world, the Turkish government is implementing many preventive partial and total lockdown practices against the virus’s infectious effect. When the first virus case has been detected, the public authorities have taken some restriction to reduce people and traffic mobility, which has also turned into some positive affect in air quality. To this end, the paper aims to examine how this pandemic affects traffic mobility and air quality in Istanbul. The pandemic does not only have a human health impact. This study also investigates the social and environmental effects. In our analysis, we observe, visualize, compare and discuss the impact of the post- and pre-lockdown on Istanbul’s traffic mobility and air quality. To do so, a geographic information system (GIS)-based approach is proposed. Various spatial analyses are performed in GIS with the statistical data used; thus, the environmental effects of the pandemic can be better observed. We test the hypothesis that this has reduced traffic mobility and improved air quality using traffic density cluster set and air monitoring stations (five air pollutant parameters) data for five months. The results shows that there are positive changes in terms of both traffic mobility and air quality, especially in April–May. PM10, SO2, CO, NO2 and NOx parameter values improved by 21.21%, 16.55%, 18.82%, 28.62% and 39.99%, respectively. In addition, there was a 7% increase in the average traffic speed. In order for the changes to be permanent, it is recommended to integrate e-mobility and sharing systems into the current transportation network.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things provides manufacturing with rich data for increased automation. Beyond company-internal data exploitation, the sharing of product and manufacturing process data along and across supply chains enables more efficient production flows and product lifecycle management. Even more, data-based automation facilitates short-lived ad hoc collaborations, realizing highly dynamic business relationships for sustainable exploitation of production resources and capacities. However, the sharing and use of business data across manufacturers and with end customers add requirements on data accountability, verifiability, and reliability and needs to consider security and privacy demands. While research has already identified blockchain technology as a key technology to address these challenges, current solutions mainly evolve around logistics or focus on established business relationships instead of automated but highly dynamic collaborations that cannot draw upon long-term trust relationships. We identify three open research areas on the road to such a truly accountable and dependable manufacturing enabled by blockchain technology: blockchain-inherent challenges, scenario-driven challenges, and socio-economic challenges. Especially tackling the scenario-driven challenges, we discuss requirements and options for realizing a blockchain-based trustworthy information store and outline its use for automation to achieve a reliable sharing of product information, efficient and dependable collaboration, and dynamic distributed markets without requiring established long-term trust.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate smartphone-based outdoor localization systems in deep urban canyons are increasingly needed for various IoT applications. As smart cities have developed, building information modeling (BIM) has become widely available. This article, for the first time, presents a semantic Visual Positioning System (VPS) for accurate and robust position estimation in urban canyons where the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) tends to fail. In the offline stage, a material segmented BIM is used to generate segmented images. In the online stage, an image is taken with a smartphone camera that provides textual information about the surrounding environment. The approach utilizes computer vision algorithms to segment between the different types of material class identified in the smartphone image. A semantic VPS method is then used to match the segmented generated images with the segmented smartphone image. Each generated image contains position information in terms of latitude, longitude, altitude, yaw, pitch, and roll. The candidate with the maximum likelihood is regarded as the precise position of the user. The positioning result achieved an accuracy of 2.0 m among high-rise buildings on a street, 5.5 m in a dense foliage environment, and 15.7 m in an alleyway. This represents an improvement in positioning of 45% compared to the current state-of-the-art method. The estimation of yaw achieved accuracy of 2.3°, an eight-fold improvement compared to the smartphone IMU.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite the unique characteristics of urban forests, the motivating factors of urban forest visitors have not been clearly differentiated from other types of the forest resource. This study aims to identify the motivating factors of urban forest visitors, using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling based on social big data. A total of 57,449 cases of social text data from social blogs containing the keyword “urban forest” were collected from Naver and Daum, the major search engines in South Korea. Then, 17,229 cases were excluded using morpheme analysis and stop word elimination; 40,110 cases were analyzed to identify the motivating factors of urban forest visitors through LDA topic modeling. Seven motivating factors—“Cafe-related Walk”, “Healing Trip”, “Daily Leisure”, “Family Trip”, “Wonderful View”, “Clean Space”, and “Exhibition and Photography”—were extracted; each contained five keywords. This study elucidates the role of forests as a place for healing, leisure, and daily exercise. The results suggest that efforts should be made toward developing various programs regarding the basic functionality of urban forests as a natural resource and a unique place to support a diversity of leisure and cultural activities.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: Retail chains aim to maintain a competitive advantage by ensuring product availability and fulfilling customer demand on-time. However, inefficient scheduling and vehicle routing from the distribution center may cause delivery delays and, thus, stock-outs on the store shelves. Therefore, optimization of vehicle routing can play a vital role in fulfilling customer demand. Methods: In this research, a case study is formulated for a chain of retail stores in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Orders from various stores are combined, grouped, and scheduled for Region-1 and Region-2 of Dhaka City. The ‘vehicle routing add-on’ feature of Google Sheets is used for scheduling and navigation. An android application, Intelligent Route Optimizer, is developed using the shortest path first algorithm based on the Dijkstra algorithm. The vehicle navigation scheme is programmed to change the direction according to the shortest possible path in the google map generated by the intelligent routing optimizer. Results: With the application, the improvement of optimization results is evident from the reductions of traveled distance (8.1% and 12.2%) and time (20.2% and 15.0%) in Region-1 and Region-2, respectively. Conclusions: A smartphone-based application is developed to improve the distribution plan. It can be utilized for an intelligent vehicle routing system to respond to real-time traffic; hence, the overall replenishment process will be improved.},

ABSTRACT = {By using text mining techniques, this study identifies the topics of sustainable consumption that are important during the COVID-19 pandemic. An Application Programming Interface (API) streaming method was used to extract the data from Twitter. A total of 14,591 tweets were collected using Twitter streaming API. However, after data cleaning, 13,635 tweets were considered for analysis. The objectives of the study are to identify (1) the topics users tweet about sustainable consumption and (2) to detect the emotion-based sentiments in the tweets. The study used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling and the Louvain algorithm for semantic network clustering. NRC emotion lexicon was used for sentiment analysis. The LDA model discovers six topics: organic food consumption, food waste, vegan food, sustainable tourism, sustainable transport, and sustainable energy consumption. While the Louvain algorithm detects four clusters—lifestyle and climate change, responsible consumption, energy consumption, and renewable energy, sentiment analysis results show more positive emotions among the users than the negative ones. The study contributes to existing literature by providing a fresh perspective on various interconnected topics of sustainable consumption that bring global consumption to a sustainable level.},

ABSTRACT = {The technologies of the fourth industrial revolution have the potential to make zero harm possible for the first time in the history of mining. In the journey toward zero harm, rock stress monitoring systems are important for the risk management process. Although communication systems for underground mining have improved significantly over the past two decades, it remains difficult to achieve reliable-all-the-time wireless communication in ultra-deep level underground mines. The aim of this study is to explore and test a smart phone network for communicating sensor data from the underground production environment to the surface. In this paper, the evaluation and performance over distance of a wireless communication system is performed in underground mining environments. The wireless system transmits the data collected from a sensor installed in a narrow reef stope, horizontal tunnel, and vertical shaft area of a mock underground mine. The evaluation was performed using the received signal strength of a mobile receiver over distance. The path loss coefficients of the underground mining environment were then derived for the measurement areas. The results show that a communication speed of 80 Mbps was achieved in a 60 m range, thus, indicating the potential for the support of applications requiring higher data rates.},

ABSTRACT = {The large number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that need interaction between smart devices and consumers makes security critical to an IoT environment. Biometrics offers an interesting window of opportunity to improve the usability and security of IoT and can play a significant role in securing a wide range of emerging IoT devices to address security challenges. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive survey on the current biometrics research in IoT security, especially focusing on two important aspects, authentication and encryption. Regarding authentication, contemporary biometric-based authentication systems for IoT are discussed and classified based on different biometric traits and the number of biometric traits employed in the system. As for encryption, biometric-cryptographic systems, which integrate biometrics with cryptography and take advantage of both to provide enhanced security for IoT, are thoroughly reviewed and discussed. Moreover, challenges arising from applying biometrics to IoT and potential solutions are identified and analyzed. With an insight into the state-of-the-art research in biometrics for IoT security, this review paper helps advance the study in the field and assists researchers in gaining a good understanding of forward-looking issues and future research directions.},

ABSTRACT = {The close development of the economic relations between China and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) since 2012 has triggered the European Union’s criticism of China’s foreign policy towards Eastern European countries. The European Union believes that China’s investment growth has led to a governance crisis in CEE countries. Based on the global governance indicators of the World Bank and the outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) data of the Ministry of Commerce of China, this paper conducts a test using the panel data model and the regression discontinuity method. An imbalanced panel dataset is adopted, covering 16 CEE countries from 2000 to 2018. The empirical research results indicate that, representing a small proportion of the investment inflows to CEE countries, China is not yet able to exert a domination effect on the region, and China’s economic power is far less than the European Union’s regulatory influence. Furthermore, China’s share of the OFDI in CEE has a U-shaped effect on the regulatory quality of host countries, and the two have a mutually causal relationship. Specifically, the impact on the host country’s regulatory quality is first manifested in the Shanghai effect, and when China’s share reaches a certain level, it is manifested in the California effect. The U-shaped effect is associated with the strategic factors of CEE countries and China’s positive contribution to good global governance.},

ABSTRACT = {The collapse of overhead power line guyed towers is one of the leading causes of power grid failures, subjecting electricity companies to pay considerable, high-value fines. In this way, the current work proposes a novel and complete framework for the remote monitoring of mechanical stresses in guyed towers. The framework method comprises a mesh network for data forwarding and neural networks to improve the performance of Low-Power and Lossy Networks. The method also considers the use of multiple sensors in the sensor fusion technique. As a result, the risk of collapse of guyed cable towers reduces, due to the remote monitoring and preventive actions promoted by the framework. Furthermore, the proposed method uses multiple input variable fusions, such as accelerometers and tension sensors, to estimate the tower’s displacement. These estimations help address the structural health of the tower against failures (i.e., loosening of the stay cables, displacement, and vibrations) that can cause catastrophic events, such as tower collapse or even cable rupture.},

ABSTRACT = {The autonomous vehicle (AVs) market is expanding at a rapid pace due to the advancement of information, communication, and sensor technology applications, offering a broad range of opportunities in terms of energy efficiency and addressing climate change concerns and safety. With regard to this last point, the rate of reduction in accidents is considerable when switching safety control tasks to machines from humans, which can be noted as having significantly slower response rates. This paper explores this thematic by focusing on the safety of AVs by thorough analysis of previously collected AV crash statistics and further discusses possible solutions for achieving increased autonomous vehicle safety. To achieve this, this technical paper develops a dynamic run-time safe assessment system, using the standard autonomous drive system (ADS), which is developed and simulated in case studies further in the paper. OpenCV methods for lane detection are developed and applied as robust control frameworks, which introduces the factor of vehicle crash predictability for the ego vehicle. The developed system is made to predict possible crashes by using a combination of machine learning and neural network methods, providing useful information for response mechanisms in risk scenarios. In addition, this paper explores the operational design domain (ODD) of the AV’s system and provides possible solutions to extend the domain in order to render vehicle operationality, even in safe mode. Additionally, three case studies are explored to supplement a discussion on the implementation of algorithms aimed at increasing curved lane detection ability and introducing trajectory predictability of neighbouring vehicles for an ego vehicle, resulting in lower collisions and increasing the safety of the AV overall. This paper thus explores the technical development of autonomous vehicles and is aimed at researchers and practitioners engaging in the conceptualisation, design, and implementation of safer AV systems focusing on lane detection and expanding AV safe state domains and vehicle trajectory predictability.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring driving behaviour is important in controlling driving risk, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. Recent advances in machine learning, which include several variants of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks, could be valuable for the development of objective and efficient computational tools in this direction. The main idea in this work is to complement data-driven classification of driving behaviour with rules derived from domain knowledge. In this light, we present a hybrid representation approach, which employs NN-based time-series encoding and rule-guided event detection. Histograms derived from the output of these two components are concatenated, normalized, and used to train a standard support vector machine (SVM). For the NN-based component, CNN-based, LSTM-based, and GRU-based variants are investigated. The CNN-based variant uses image-like representations of sensor measurements, whereas the RNN-based variants (LSTM and GRU) directly process sensor measurements in the form of time-series. Experimental evaluation on three datasets leads to the conclusion that the proposed approach outperforms a state-of-the-art camera-based approaches in distinguishing between normal and aggressive driving behaviour without using data derived from a camera. Moreover, it is demonstrated that both NN-guided time-series encoding and rule-guided event detection contribute to overall classification accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {The fourth industrial era, known as ‘Industry 4.0’ (I4.0), aided and abetted by the digital revolution, has attracted increasing attention among scholars and practitioners in the last decade. The adoption of I4.0 principles in Disaster Risk Management (DRM) research and associated industry practices is particularly notable, although its origins, impacts and potential are not well understood. In response to this knowledge gap, this paper conducts a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis of the application and contribution of I4.0 in DRM. The systematic literature review identified 144 relevant articles and then employed descriptive and content analysis of a focused set of 70 articles published between 2011 and 2021. The results of this review trace the growing trend for adoption of I4.0 tools and techniques in disaster management, and in parallel their influence in resilient infrastructure and digital construction fields. The results are used to identify six dominant clusters of research activity: big data analytics, Internet of Things, prefabrication and modularization, robotics and cyber-physical systems. The research in each cluster is then mapped to the priorities of the Sendai framework for DRR, highlighting the ways it can support this international agenda. Finally, this paper identifies gaps within the literature and discusses possible future research directions for the combination of I4.0 and DRM.},

ABSTRACT = {The expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) in public administration is generating numerous opportunities for governments. Current Spanish regulations have established electronic administration and support the expansion and implementation of this new technology, but they may not be adapted to the legal needs caused by AI. Consequently, this research aims to identify the risks associated with AI uses in Spanish public administration and if the legal mechanisms can solve them. We answer these questions by employing a qualitative research approach, conducting semi-structured interviews with several experts in the matter. Despite the benefits that this technology may involve, throughout this research we can confirm that the use of artificial intelligence can generate several problems such as opacity, legal uncertainty, biases, or breaches of personal data protection. The mechanisms already provided by Spanish law are not enough to avoid these risks as they have not been designed to face the use of artificial intelligence in public administration. In addition, a homogeneous legal definition of AI needs to be established.},

ABSTRACT = {A Digital Twin is the concept of creating a digital replica of physical models (such as a robot). This is similar to establishing a simulation using a robot operating system (ROS) or other industrial-owned platforms to simulate robot operations and sending the details to the robot controller. In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin model that assists in the online/remote programming of a robotic cell by creating a 3D digital environment of a real-world configuration. Our Digital Twin model consists of two components, (1) a physical model: FANUC robot (M-10iA/12), and (2) a digital model: Unity (a gaming platform) that comes with specialized plugins for virtual and augmented reality devices. One of the main challenges in the existing approach of robot programming is writing and modifying code for a robot trajectory that is eased in our framework using a Digital Twin. Using a Digital Twin setup along with Virtual Reality, we observe the trajectory replication between digital and physical robots. The simulation analysis provided a latency of approximately 40 ms with an error range of −0.28 to 0.28∘ across the robot joint movements in a simulation environment and −0.3 to 0.3∘ across the actual robot joint movements. Therefore, we can conclude that our developed model is suitable for industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents “DESMOS”, a novel ecosystem for the interconnection of smart infrastructures, mobile and wearable devices, and applications, to provide a secure environment for visitors and tourists. The presented solution brings together state-of-the-art IoT technologies, crowdsourcing, localization through BLE, and semantic reasoning, following a privacy and security-by-design approach to ensure data anonymization and protection. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the solution was tested, validated, and evaluated via two pilots in almost real settings—involving a fewer density of people than planned—in Trikala, Thessaly, Greece. The results and findings support that the presented solutions can provide successful emergency reporting, crowdsourcing, and localization via BLE. However, these results also prompt for improvements in the user interface expressiveness, the application’s effectiveness and accuracy, as well as evaluation in real, overcrowded conditions. The main contribution of this paper is to report on the progress made and to showcase how all these technological solutions can be integrated and applied in realistic and practical scenarios, for the safety and privacy of visitors and tourists.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the important aspects of realizing smart cities is developing smart homes/buildings and, from the energy perspective, designing and implementing an efficient smart home area energy management system (HAEMS) is vital. To be effective, the HAEMS should include various electrical appliances as well as local distributed/renewable energy resources and energy storage systems, with the whole system as a microgrid. However, the collecting and processing of the data associated with these appliances/resources are challenging in terms of the required sensors/communication infrastructure and computational burden. Thanks to the internet-of-things and cloud computing technologies, the physical requirements for handling the data have been provided; however, they demand suitable optimization/management schemes. In this article, a HAEMS is developed using cloud services to increase the accuracy and speed of the data processing. A management protocol is proposed that provides an optimal schedule for a day-ahead operation of the electrical equipment of smart residential homes under welfare indicators. The proposed system comprises three layers: (1) sensors associated with the home appliances and generation/storage units, (2) local fog nodes, and (3) a cloud where the information is processed bilaterally with HAEMS and the hourly optimal operation of appliances/generation/storage units is planned. The neural network and genetic algorithm (GA) are used as part of the HAEMS program. The neural network is used to predict the amount of workload corresponding to users’ requests. Improving the load factor and the economic efficiency are considered as the objective function that is optimized using GA. Numerical studies are performed in the MATLAB platform and the results are compared with a conventional method.},

ABSTRACT = {The long-term electricity demand forecast of the consumer utilization is essential for the energy provider to analyze the future demand and for the accurate management of demand response. Forecasting the consumer electricity demand with efficient and accurate strategies will help the energy provider to optimally plan generation points, such as solar and wind, and produce energy accordingly to reduce the rate of depletion. Various demand forecasting models have been developed and implemented in the literature. However, an efficient and accurate forecasting model is required to study the daily consumption of the consumers from their historical data and forecast the necessary energy demand from the consumer’s side. The proposed recurrent neural network gradient boosting regression tree (RNN-GBRT) forecasting technique allows one to reduce the demand for electricity by studying the daily usage pattern of consumers, which would significantly help to cope with the accurate evaluation. The efficiency of the proposed forecasting model is compared with various conventional models. In addition, by the utilization of power consumption data, power theft detection in the distribution line is monitored to avoid financial losses by the utility provider. This paper also deals with the consumer’s energy analysis, useful in tracking the data consistency to detect any kind of abnormal and sudden change in the meter reading, thereby distinguishing the tampering of meters and power theft. Indeed, power theft is an important issue to be addressed particularly in developing and economically lagging countries, such as India. The results obtained by the proposed methodology have been analyzed and discussed to validate their efficacy.},

ABSTRACT = {Regular inspection of railway track health is crucial for maintaining safe and reliable train operations. Factors, such as cracks, ballast issues, rail discontinuity, loose nuts and bolts, burnt wheels, superelevation, and misalignment developed on the rails due to non-maintenance, pre-emptive investigations and delayed detection, pose a grave danger and threats to the safe operation of rail transport. The traditional procedure of manually inspecting the rail track using a railway cart is both inefficient and prone to human error and biases. In a country like Pakistan where train accidents have taken many lives, it is not unusual to automate such approaches to avoid such accidents and save countless lives. This study aims at enhancing the traditional railway cart system to address these issues by introducing an automatic railway track fault detection system using acoustic analysis. In this regard, this study makes two important contributions: data collection on Pakistan railway tracks using acoustic signals and the application of various classification techniques to the collected data. Initially, three types of tracks are considered, including normal track, wheel burnt and superelevation, due to their common occurrence. Several well-known machine learning algorithms are applied such as support vector machines, logistic regression, random forest and decision tree classifier, in addition to deep learning models like multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural networks. Results suggest that acoustic data can help determine the track faults successfully. Results indicate that the best results are obtained by RF and DT with an accuracy of 97%.},

ABSTRACT = {With the fast development of infrastructure and communication technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a promising field. Ongoing research is looking at the smart home environment as the most promising sector that adopts IoT and cloud computing to improve resident live experiences. The IoT and cloud-dependent smart home services related to recent researches have security, bandwidth issues, and a lack of concerning thermal comfort of residents. In this paper, we propose an environment optimization scheme based on edge computing using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for efficient thermal comfort control in resident space to overcome the aforementioned limitations of researches on smart homes. The comfort level of a resident in a smart home is evaluated by Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) that represents the thermal response of occupants. The PSO algorithm combined with PMV to improve the accuracy of the optimization results for efficient thermal comfort control in a smart home environment. We integrate IoT with edge computing to upgrade the capabilities of IoT nodes in computing power, storage space, and reliable connectivity. We use EdgeX as an edge computing platform to develop a thermal comfort considering PMV-based optimization engine with a PSO algorithm to generate the resident’s friendly environment parameters and rules engine to detects the environmental change of the smart home in real-time to maintain the indoor environment thermal comfortable. For evaluating our proposed system that maintenance resident environment with thermal comfort index based on PSO optimization scheme in smart homes, we conduct the comparison between the real data with optimized data, and measure the execution times of optimization function. From the experimental results, when our proposed system is applied, it satisfies thermal comfort and consumes energy more stably.},

ABSTRACT = {A smart city is an urbanization region that collects data using several digital and physical devices. The information collected from such devices is used efficiently to manage revenues, resources, and assets, etc., while the information obtained from such devices is utilized to boost performance throughout the city. Cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications could help smart cities that contain information gathered from citizens, devices, homes, and other things. This information is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage transportation networks, electric utilities, resources management, water supply systems, waste management, crime detection, security mechanisms, proficiency, digital library, healthcare facilities, and other opportunities. A cloud service provider offers public cloud services that can update the IoT environment, enabling third-party activities to embed IoT data within electronic devices executing on the IoT.

ABSTRACT = {The role of forests is increasing because of rapid land use changes worldwide that have implications on ecosystems and the carbon cycle. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain accurate information about forests and build forest inventories. However, it is difficult to assess the internal structure of the forest through 2D remote sensing techniques and fieldwork. In this aspect, we proposed a method for estimating the vertical structure of forests based on full-waveform light detection and ranging (FW LiDAR) data in this study. Voxel-based tree point density maps were generated by estimating the number of canopy height points in each voxel grid from the raster digital terrain model (DTM) and canopy height points after pre-processing the LiDAR point clouds. We applied an unsupervised classification algorithm to the voxel-based tree point density maps and identified seven classes by profile pattern analysis for the forest vertical types. The classification accuracy was found to be 72.73% from the validation from 11 field investigation sites, which was additionally confirmed through comparative analysis with aerial images. Based on this pre-classification reference map, which is assumed to be ground truths, the deep neural network (DNN) model was finally applied to perform the final classification. As a result of accuracy assessment, it showed accuracy of 92.72% with a good performance. These results demonstrate the potential of vertical structure estimation for extensive forests using FW LiDAR data and that the distinction between one-storied and two-storied forests can be clearly represented. This technique is expected to contribute to efficient and effective management of forests based on accurate information derived from the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {The negative climate change induced by rapid urbanization has become a global environmental issue. Numerous studies have been devoted to microclimate regulation functions performed by urban vegetation. Digital city information modeling provides a powerful tool for various simulations and data analytics for the sustainable development of urban areas. However, the method reconstructing urban trees is still in its early stage compared to the relatively mature building modeling. Most prior studies on tree reconstruction focused on retrieving geometric features, while other factors related to urban microclimate simulation were rarely addressed. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review and in-depth analysis covering two distinct research directions in relation to urban microclimate simulation. The first one is set on the identification of key factors related to trees’ impact on urban microclimate. The second one is dedicated to approaches for three-dimensional (3D) tree reconstruction. Based on the findings, the paper identifies information including trees’ geometric, physiological characteristics and relation to the surroundings required for 3D tree reconstruction in the context of urban microclimate simulation, and further assesses the potential of the 3D tree reconstruction approaches to accommodate these pieces of information. An appropriate 3D tree reconstruction approach, which allows for the supply of the required information for urban microclimate simulation, is recommended.},

ABSTRACT = {In the era of public participation in government, public emotions and expectations are important considerations influencing urban construction, planning, and management. A desirable urban environment can make people feel at ease and comfortable and contribute to promoting positive public emotions. However, in the process of rapid urban development, the high-density and overloaded urban built environment has triggered people’s mental tension and anxiety and has contributed to negative emotions. Thus, this study aimed to explore the spatial distribution of public emotions and urban built environments in cities and to thoroughly investigate the correlation between urban built environments and public emotions. Considering the lack of dynamic elements analysis and emotions spatial analysis in previous studies, this study takes Wuhan City as an example, uses social media big data as the basis for text emotion analysis, introduces dynamic traffic elements, and establishes a multidimensional urban built environment measurement index system from five aspects: land use, spatial form, road and traffic, green space and open space, and daily life service facilities. Subsequently, the spatial distribution characteristics of public sentiment and urban built environment elements in Wuhan were analyzed. Finally, a geographically weighted regression method was used to analyze the degree of influence of different urban built environment elements on public emotions. The results showed that public emotions in Wuhan are not homogeneously distributed in terms of score and space and that there are significant differences. The urban built environment has a significant influence on public emotions. Higher land use mix, higher road network density, higher number of public transportation facilities, higher number of public open spaces, lower traffic congestion, and impact of freight transportation play important roles in promoting positive emotions. Therefore, in the process of urban construction, planners and decision makers should purposefully improve the quality of the built environment. Measures can include improving the mix of land functions, alleviating traffic congestion, avoiding the negative effects of freight traffic, rationally constructing green and open spaces, and improving various living facilities. This can help contribute toward improving urban functions and urban environments, and promote the construction of a people-oriented healthy city.},

ABSTRACT = {Entering the 5G and internet of things (IoT) era, human–machine interfaces (HMIs) capable of providing humans with more intuitive interaction with the digitalized world have experienced a flourishing development in the past few years. Although the advanced sensing techniques based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) or microelectromechanical system (MEMS) solutions, e.g., camera, microphone, inertial measurement unit (IMU), etc., and flexible solutions, e.g., stretchable conductor, optical fiber, etc., have been widely utilized as sensing components for wearable/non-wearable HMIs development, the relatively high-power consumption of these sensors remains a concern, especially for wearable/portable scenarios. Recent progress on triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) self-powered sensors provides a new possibility for realizing low-power/self-sustainable HMIs by directly converting biomechanical energies into valuable sensory information. Leveraging the advantages of wide material choices and diversified structural design, TENGs have been successfully developed into various forms of HMIs, including glove, glasses, touchpad, exoskeleton, electronic skin, etc., for sundry applications, e.g., collaborative operation, personal healthcare, robot perception, smart home, etc. With the evolving artificial intelligence (AI) and haptic feedback technologies, more advanced HMIs could be realized towards intelligent and immersive human–machine interactions. Hence, in this review, we systematically introduce the current TENG HMIs in the aspects of different application scenarios, i.e., wearable, robot-related and smart home, and prospective future development enabled by the AI/haptic-feedback technology. Discussion on implementing self-sustainable/zero-power/passive HMIs in this 5G/IoT era and our perspectives are also provided.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is aimed to provide efficient and seamless connectivity to a large number of low-power and low-cost embedded devices, consequently, the routing protocols play a fundamental role in achieving these goals. The IETF has recently standardized the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) for LLNs (i.e., Low-power and Lossy Networks) and is well-accepted among the Internet community. However, RPL was proposed for static IoT devices and suffers from many issues when IoT devices are mobile. In this paper, we first present various issues that are faced by the RPL when IoT devices are mobile. We then carry out a detailed survey of various solutions that are proposed in the current literature to mitigate the issues faced by RPL. We classify various solutions into five categories i.e., ‘Trickle-timer based solutions’, ‘ETX based solutions’, ‘RSSI based solutions’, ‘Position-based solutions’, and ‘Miscellaneous solutions’. For each category of these solutions, we illustrate their working principles, issues addressed and make a thorough assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, we found several flaws in the performance analysis done by the authors of each of the solutions, e.g., nodes mobility, time intervals, etc., and suggest further investigations for the performance evaluations of these solutions in order to assess their applicability in real-world environments. Moreover, we provide future research directions for RPL supporting various real-time applications, mobility support, energy-aware, and privacy-aware routing.},

ABSTRACT = {Emerging Industry 4.0 applications require ever-increasing amounts of data and new sources of information to more accurately characterize the different processes of a production line. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies, and in particular Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), allow a large amount of data to be digitized at a low energy cost, thanks to their easy scalability and the creation of meshed networks to cover larger areas. In industry, data acquisition systems must meet certain reliability and robustness requirements, since other systems such as predictive maintenance or the digital twin, which represents a virtual mapping of the system with which to interact without the need to alter the actual installation, may depend on it. Thanks to the IEEE 802.15.4e standard and the use of Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) as the medium access mechanism and IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) as the routing protocol, it is possible to deploy WSNs with high reliability, autonomy, and minimal need for re-configuration. One of the drawbacks of this communication architecture is the low efficiency of its deployment process, during which it may take a long time to synchronize and connect all the devices in a network. This paper proposes an analytical model to characterize the process for the creation of downstream routes in RPL, whose transmission of multi-hop messages can present complications in scenarios with a multitude of interfering nodes and resource allocation based on minimal IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH). This type of multi-hop message exchange has a different behaviour than the multicast control messages exchanged during the synchronization phase and the formation of upstream routes, since the number of interfering nodes changes in each retransmission.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital twin (DT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have grown rapidly in recent years and are considered by both academia and industry to be key enablers for Industry 4.0. As a digital replica of a physical entity, the basis of DT is the infrastructure and data, the core is the algorithm and model, and the application is the software and service. The grounding of DT and AI in industrial sectors is even more dependent on the systematic and in-depth integration of domain-specific expertise. This survey comprehensively reviews over 300 manuscripts on AI-driven DT technologies of Industry 4.0 used over the past five years and summarizes their general developments and the current state of AI-integration in the fields of smart manufacturing and advanced robotics. These cover conventional sophisticated metal machining and industrial automation as well as emerging techniques, such as 3D printing and human–robot interaction/cooperation. Furthermore, advantages of AI-driven DTs in the context of sustainable development are elaborated. Practical challenges and development prospects of AI-driven DTs are discussed with a respective focus on different levels. A route for AI-integration in multiscale/fidelity DTs with multiscale/fidelity data sources in Industry 4.0 is outlined.},

ABSTRACT = {The role of 5G-IoT has become indispensable in smart applications and it plays a crucial part in e-health applications. E-health applications require intelligent schemes and architectures to overcome the security threats against the sensitive data of patients. The information in e-healthcare applications is stored in the cloud which is vulnerable to security attacks. However, with deep learning techniques, these attacks can be detected, which needs hybrid models. In this article, a new deep learning model (CNN-DMA) is proposed to detect malware attacks based on a classifier—Convolution Neural Network (CNN). The model uses three layers, i.e., Dense, Dropout, and Flatten. Batch sizes of 64, 20 epoch, and 25 classes are used to train the network. An input image of 32 × 32 × 1 is used for the initial convolutional layer. Results are retrieved on the Malimg dataset where 25 families of malware are fed as input and our model has detected is Alueron.gen!J malware. The proposed model CNN-DMA is 99% accurate and it is validated with state-of-the-art techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {With opportunities brought by the Internet of Things (IoT), it is quite a challenge to maintain concurrency and privacy when a huge number of resource-constrained distributed devices are involved. Blockchain have become popular for its benefits, including decentralization, persistence, immutability, auditability, and consensus. Great attention has been received by the IoT based on the construction of distributed file systems worldwide. A new generation of IoT-based distributed file systems has been proposed with the integration of Blockchain technology, such as the Swarm and Interplanetary File System. By using IoT, new technical challenges, such as Credibility, Harmonization, large-volume data, heterogeneity, and constrained resources are arising. To ensure data security in IoT, centralized access control technologies do not provide credibility. In this work, we propose an attribute-based access control model for the IoT. The access control lists are not required for each device by the system. It enhances access management in terms of effectiveness. Moreover, we use blockchain technology for recording the attribute, avoiding data tempering, and eliminating a single point of failure at edge computing devices. IoT devices control the user’s environment as well as his or her private data collection; therefore, the exposure of the user’s personal data to non-trusted private and public servers may result in privacy leakage. To automate the system, smart contracts are used for data accessing, whereas Proof of Authority is used for enhancing the system’s performance and optimizing gas consumption. Through smart contracts, ciphertext can be stored on a blockchain by the data owner. Data can only be decrypted in a valid access period, whereas in blockchains, the trace function is achieved by the storage of invocation and the creation of smart contracts. Scalability issues can also be resolved by using the multichain blockchain. Eventually, it is concluded from the simulation results that the proposed system is efficient for IoT.},

This study explores the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) knowledge practices in the EEs of Berlin and Sydney by using knowledge-spillover theory of entrepreneurship. The study utilizes a bibliometric analysis of secondary data in combination with exploratory stakeholder interviews conducted for both cities. Findings underline the critical role of experimental knowledge in driving the momentum of the EEs and the supporting role of policies imprinting knowledge practices. The paper shows how the dynamics of EEs can be explored empirically and raises awareness of the role of specialised and integrated policies in determining a city’s overall success in building EEs.},

ABSTRACT = {Significant portions of European cities’ population are still exposed to levels of air pollution deemed harmful by the World Health Organization. Given the high impact of air pollution both on human health and the economy, numerous low-cost electrochemical sensor monitoring systems are being installed. The market is forced to develop new air quality monitoring systems to meet the needs of providing forecasting services based on advanced technologies and protocols that utilize certain characteristics such as high accuracy, real-time monitoring, daily and yearly statistics, data access from both experts and simple users with the use of low-cost equipment. In this study, conducted in Athens, Greece, a comparison is attempted between the findings from a low-cost electrochemical sensor device and those of a static, fixed site measurement monitoring station; this comparison is based on the data quality and Air Quality Index (AQI) concerning data accuracy and quality on adverse health effects due to air pollution. With regard to the prediction of different AQI intervals, TPR ranges from 35.2% up to 100.0%, FPR from 0.0% up to 36.1% and FNR from 0.0% up to 38.1%. The outcome of this study reveals flexible and affordable alternatives adopted during the evaluation and calibration of low-cost gas sensors for monitoring.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a mobile air pollution sensing unit based on the Internet of Things framework was designed for monitoring the concentration of fine particulate matter in three urban areas. This unit was developed using the NodeMCU-32S microcontroller, PMS5003-G5 (particulate matter sensing module), and Ublox NEO-6M V2 (GPS positioning module). The sensing unit transmits data of the particulate matter concentration and coordinates of a polluted location to the backend server through 3G and 4G telecommunication networks for data collection. This system will complement the government’s PM2.5 data acquisition system. Mobile monitoring stations meet the air pollution monitoring needs of some areas that require special observation. For example, an AIoT development system will be installed. At intersections with intensive traffic, it can be used as a reference for government transportation departments or environmental inspection departments for environmental quality monitoring or evacuation of traffic flow. Furthermore, the particulate matter distributions in three areas, namely Xinzhuang, Sanchong, and Luzhou Districts, which are all in New Taipei City of Taiwan, were estimated using machine learning models, the data of stationary monitoring stations, and the measurements of the mobile sensing system proposed in this study. Four types of learning models were trained, namely the decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and radial basis function neural network, and their prediction results were evaluated. The root mean square error was used as the performance indicator, and the learning results indicate that the random forest model outperforms the other models for both the training and testing sets. To examine the generalizability of the learning models, the models were verified in relation to data measured on three days: 15 February, 28 February, and 1 March 2019. A comparison between the model predicted and the measured data indicates that the random forest model provides the most stable and accurate prediction values and could clearly present the distribution of highly polluted areas. The results of these models are visualized in the form of maps by using a web application. The maps allow users to understand the distribution of polluted areas intuitively.},

ABSTRACT = {Power forecasting models offer valuable insights on the electricity consumption patterns of clients, enabling the development of advanced strategies and applications aimed at energy saving, increased energy efficiency, and smart energy pricing. The data collection process for client consumption models is not always ideal and the resulting datasets often lead to compromises in the implementation of forecasting models, as well as suboptimal performance, due to several challenges. Therefore, combinations of elements that highlight relationships between clients need to be investigated in order to achieve more accurate consumption predictions. In this study, we exploited the combined effects of client similarity and causality, and developed a power consumption forecasting model that utilizes ensembles of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Our novel approach enables the derivation of different representations of the predicted consumption based on feature sets influenced by similarity and causality metrics. The resulting representations were used to train a meta-model, based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), in order to combine the results of the LSTM ensembles optimally. This combinatorial approach achieved better overall performance and yielded lower mean absolute percentage error when compared to the standalone LSTM ensembles that do not include similarity and causality. Additional experiments indicated that the combination of similarity and causality resulted in more performant models when compared to implementations utilizing only one element on the same model structure.},

ABSTRACT = {The transportation sector has traditionally been considered essential for commercial activities, although nowadays, it presents clear negative impacts on the environment and can reduce social welfare. Thus, advanced optimization techniques are required to design sustainable routes with low logistic costs. Moreover, these negative impacts may be significantly increased as a consequence of the lack of synergy between the sustainability objectives. Correspondingly, the concept of transport optimization in smart cities is becoming popular in both the real world and academia when public decision making is lit by operations research models. In this paper, however, we argue that the level of urban smartness depends on its sustainability and on the level of information and communication technologies developed in the city. Therefore, the operations research models seek to achieve a higher threshold in the sustainable transport standards in smart cities. Thus, we present a generic definition of smart city, which includes the triple bottom line of sustainability, with the purpose of analyzing its effects on city performance. Finally, this work provides a consolidate study about urban freight transport problems, which show that sustainability is only one facet of the diamond of characteristics that depict a real smart city.},

ABSTRACT = {Carpooling schemes for mutual cost benefits between the driver and the passengers has a long history. However, the convenience of driving alone, the increasing level of car ownership, and the difficulties in finding travelers with matching timing and routes keep car occupancy low. Technology is a key enabler of online platforms which facilitate the ride matching process and lead to an increase in carpooling services. Smart carpooling services may be an alternative and enrichment for mobility, which can help smart cities (SCs) reduce traffic congestion and gas emissions but require the appropriate architecture to support connection with the city infrastructure such as high-occupancy vehicle lanes, parking space, tolls, and the public transportation services. To better understand the evolution of carpooling platforms in SCs, bibliometric analysis of three separate specialized literature collections, combined with a systematic literature review, is performed. It is identified that smart carpooling platforms could generate additional value for participants and SCs. To deliver this value to an SC, a multi-sided platform business model is proposed, suitable for a carpooling service provider with multiple customer segments and partners. Finally, after examining the SC structure, a carpooling platform architecture is presented, which interconnects with the applicable smart city layers.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper surveys the deep learning (DL) approaches for intrusion-detection systems (IDSs) in Internet of Things (IoT) and the associated datasets toward identifying gaps, weaknesses, and a neutral reference architecture. A comparative study of IDSs is provided, with a review of anomaly-based IDSs on DL approaches, which include supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid methods. All techniques in these three categories have essentially been used in IoT environments. To date, only a few have been used in the anomaly-based IDS for IoT. For each of these anomaly-based IDSs, the implementation of the four categories of feature(s) extraction, classification, prediction, and regression were evaluated. We studied important performance metrics and benchmark detection rates, including the requisite efficiency of the various methods. Four machine learning algorithms were evaluated for classification purposes: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Therefore, we compared each via the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The study model exhibits promising outcomes for all classes of attacks. The scope of our analysis examines attacks targeting the IoT ecosystem using empirically based, simulation-generated datasets (namely the Bot-IoT and the IoTID20 datasets).},

ABSTRACT = {The accurate and effective prediction of the traffic flow of vehicles plays a significant role in the construction and planning of signalized road intersections. The application of artificially intelligent predictive models in the prediction of the performance of traffic flow has yielded positive results. However, much uncertainty still exists in the determination of which artificial intelligence methods effectively resolve traffic congestion issues, especially from the perspective of the traffic flow of vehicles at a four-way signalized road intersection. A hybrid algorithm, an artificial neural network trained by a particle swarm optimization model (ANN-PSO), and a heuristic Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) were compared in the prediction of the flow of traffic of vehicles using the South Africa transportation system as a case study. Two hundred and fifty-nine (259) traffic datasets were obtained from the South African road network using inductive loop detectors, video cameras, and GPS-controlled equipment. For the ANN and ANN-PSO training and testing, 219 traffic data were used for the training, and 40 were used for the testing of the ANN-PSO model, while training (160), testing (40), and validation (59) was used for the ANN. The ANN result presented a logistic sigmoid transfer function with a 13–6–1 model and a testing R2 of 0.99169 compared to the ANN-PSO result, which showed a testing performance of R2 0.99710. This result shows that the ANN-PSO model is more efficient and effective than the ANN model in the prediction of the traffic flow of vehicles at a four-way signalized road intersection. Furthermore, the ANN and ANN-PSO models are robust enough to predict traffic flow due to their better testing performance. The modelling approaches proposed in this study will assist transportation engineers and urban planners in designing a traffic control system for traffic lights at four-way signalized road intersections. Finally, the results of this research will assist transportation engineers and traffic controllers in providing traffic flow information and travel guidance for motorists and pedestrians in the optimization of their travel time decision-making.},

ABSTRACT = {In current research, fully supervised Deep Learning (DL) techniques are employed to train a segmentation network to be applied to point clouds of buildings. However, training such networks requires large amounts of fine-labeled buildings’ point-cloud data, presenting a major challenge in practice because they are difficult to obtain. Consequently, the application of fully supervised DL for semantic segmentation of buildings’ point clouds at LoD3 level is severely limited. In order to reduce the number of required annotated labels, we proposed a novel label-efficient DL network that obtains per-point semantic labels of LoD3 buildings’ point clouds with limited supervision, named 3DLEB-Net. In general, it consists of two steps. The first step (Autoencoder, AE) is composed of a Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) encoder and a folding-based decoder. It is designed to extract discriminative global and local features from input point clouds by faithfully reconstructing them without any label. The second step is the semantic segmentation network. By supplying a small amount of task-specific supervision, a segmentation network is proposed for semantically segmenting the encoded features acquired from the pre-trained AE. Experimentally, we evaluated our approach based on the Architectural Cultural Heritage (ArCH) dataset. Compared to the fully supervised DL methods, we found that our model achieved state-of-the-art results on the unseen scenes, with only 10% of labeled training data from fully supervised methods as input. Moreover, we conducted a series of ablation studies to show the effectiveness of the design choices of our model.},

ABSTRACT = {Real-time health monitoring of civil infrastructures is performed to maintain their structural integrity, sustainability, and serviceability for a longer time. With smart electronics and packaging technology, large amounts of complex monitoring data are generated, requiring sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for their processing. With the advancement of technology, more complex AI models have been applied, from simple models to sophisticated deep learning (DL) models, for structural health monitoring (SHM). In this article, a comprehensive review is performed, primarily on the applications of AI models for SHM to maintain the sustainability of diverse civil infrastructures. Three smart data capturing methods of SHM, namely, camera-based, smartphone-based, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based methods, are also discussed, having made the utilization of intelligent paradigms easier. UAV is found to be the most promising smart data acquisition technology, whereas convolution neural networks are the most impressive DL model reported for SHM. Furthermore, current challenges and future perspectives of AI-based SHM systems are also described separately. Moreover, the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city concepts are explained to elaborate on the contributions of intelligent SHM systems. The integration of SHM with IoT and cloud-based computing is leading us towards the evolution of future smart cities.},

ABSTRACT = {In the era of big data, mass customization (MC) systems are faced with the complexities associated with information explosion and management control. Thus, it has become necessary to integrate the mass customization system and Social Internet of Things, in order to effectively connecting customers with enterprises. We should not only allow customers to participate in MC production throughout the whole process, but also allow enterprises to control all links throughout the whole information system. To gain a better understanding, this paper first describes the architecture of the proposed system from organizational and technological perspectives. Then, based on the nature of the Social Internet of Things, the main technological application of the mass customization–Social Internet of Things (MC–SIOT) system is introduced in detail. On this basis, the key problems faced by the mass customization–Social Internet of Things system are listed. Our findings are as follows: (1) MC–SIOT can realize convenient information queries and clearly understand the user’s intentions; (2) the system can predict the changing relationships among different technical fields and help enterprise R&amp;D personnel to find technical knowledge; and (3) it can interconnect deep learning technology and digital twin technology to better maintain the operational state of the system. However, there exist some challenges relating to data management, knowledge discovery, and human–computer interaction, such as data quality management, few data samples, a lack of dynamic learning, labor consumption, and task scheduling. Therefore, we put forward possible improvements to be assessed, as well as privacy issues and emotional interactions to be further discussed, in future research. Finally, we illustrate the behavior and evolutionary mechanism of this system, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This provides some idea of how to address the current issues pertaining to mass customization systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In modern times, ensuring social security has become the prime concern for security administrators. The widespread and recurrent use of social media sites is creating a huge risk for the lives of the general people, as these sites are frequently becoming potential sources of the organization of various types of immoral events. For protecting society from these dangers, a prior detection system which can effectively detect events by analyzing these social media data is essential. However, automating the process of event detection has been difficult, as existing processes must account for diverse writing styles, languages, dialects, post lengths, and et cetera. To overcome these difficulties, we developed an effective model for detecting events, which, for our purposes, were classified as either protesting, celebrating, religious, or neutral, using Bengali and Banglish Facebook posts. At first, the collected posts’ text were processed for language detection, and then, detected posts were pre-processed using stopwords removal and tokenization. Features were then extracted from these pre-processed texts using three sub-processes: filtering, phrase matching of specific events, and sentiment analysis. The collected features were ultimately used to train our Bernoulli Naive Bayes classification model, which was capable of detecting events with 90.41% accuracy (for Bengali-language posts) and 70% (for the Banglish-form posts). For evaluating the effectiveness of our proposed model more precisely, we compared it with two other classifiers: Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree.},

ABSTRACT = {Computation offloading technology extends cloud computing to the edge of the access network close to users, bringing many benefits to terminal devices with limited battery and computational resources. Nevertheless, the existing computation offloading approaches are challenging to apply to specific scenarios, such as the dense distribution of end-users and the sparse distribution of network infrastructure. The technological revolution in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and chip industry has granted UAVs more computing resources and promoted the emergence of UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) technology, which could be applied to those scenarios. However, in the MEC system with multiple users and multiple servers, making reasonable offloading decisions and allocating system resources is still a severe challenge. This paper studies the offloading decision and resource allocation problem in the UAV-assisted MEC environment with multiple users and servers. To ensure the quality of service for end-users, we set the weighted total cost of delay, energy consumption, and the size of discarded tasks as our optimization objective. We further formulate the joint optimization problem as a Markov decision process and apply the soft actor–critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the offloading policy. Numerical simulation results show that the offloading policy optimized by our proposed SAC-based dynamic computing offloading (SACDCO) algorithm effectively reduces the delay, energy consumption, and size of discarded tasks for the UAV-assisted MEC system. Compared with the fixed local-UAV scheme in the specific simulation setting, our proposed approach reduces system delay and energy consumption by approximately 50% and 200%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Most cities have adopted smart city services to solve urban problems. However, an examination of their operations reveals that many of these services have either been discontinued or have failed to advance further since they were not profitable. Therefore, this study reviews and proposes the business models of smart city services at a fundamental level. It defines and classifies the smart city service focusing on transportation and the components. The business model has been constructed for electric vehicles and autonomous shuttle businesses in terms of transportation services. It found that the model was profitable in each business only when various stakeholders were linked for mutual interests. Since various service stakeholders cooperate in smart city service, if one of them is unable to secure profitability, it is difficult to operate the smart city service fully. Therefore, a detailed review of the business model is required before providing a smart city service.},

ABSTRACT = {Water wave monitoring is a vital issue for coastal research and plays a key role in geomorphological changes, erosion and sediment transportation, coastal hazards, risk assessment, and decision making. However, despite missing data and the difficulty of capturing the data of nearshore fieldwork, the analysis of water wave surface parameters is still able to be discussed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for accurate detection and analysis of water wave surface from Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB) large-scale point clouds data. In our proposed method we combined the modified Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method with a connectivity constraint and a multi-level analysis of ocean water surface. We adapted for most types of wave shape anatomies in shallow waters, nearshore, and onshore of the coastal zone. We used a wavelet analysis filter to detect the water wave surface. Then, through the Fourier Transformation Approach, we estimated the parameters of wave height, wavelength, and wave orientation. The comparison between the LiDAR measure estimation technique and available buoy data was then presented. We quantified the performance of the algorithm by measuring the precision and recall for the waves identification without evaluating the degree of over-segmentation. The proposed method achieves 87% accuracy of wave identification in the shallow water of coastal zones.},

ABSTRACT = {In the context of climate change and rapid urbanization, flood disaster loss caused by extreme rainstorm events is becoming more and more serious. An accurate assessment of flood disaster loss has become a key issue. In this study, extreme rainstorm scenarios with 50- and 100-year return periods based on the Chicago rain pattern were designed. The dynamic change process of flood disaster loss was obtained by using a 1D–2D coupled model, Hazard Rating (HR) method, machine learning, and ArcPy script. The results show that under extreme rainstorm events, the direct economic loss and affected population account for about 3% of the total GDP and 16% of the total population, respectively, and built-up land is the main disaster area. In addition, the initial time and the peak time of flood disaster loss increases with an increasing flood hazard degree and decreases with the increase in the return period. The total loss increases with the increase in the return period, and the unit loss decreases with the increase in the return period. Compared with a static assessment, a dynamic assessment can better reveal the development law of flood disaster loss, which has great significance for flood risk management and the mitigation of flood disaster loss.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents and discusses the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) and crowdsourcing in constructing smart cities. The literature review shows an important and increasing concern of the scientific community for these three issues and their association as support for urban development. Based on an extensive literature review, the paper first presents the smart city concept, emphasizing smart city architecture and the role of data in smart city solutions. The second part presents the Internet of Things, focusing on IoT technology, the use of IoT in smart city applications, and security. Finally, the paper presents crowdsourcing with particular attention to mobile crowdsourcing and its role in smart cities. The paper shows that IoT and crowdsourcing have a crucial role in two fundamental layers of smart city applications, namely, the data collection and services layers. Since these two layers ensure the connection between the physical and digital worlds, they constitute the central pillars of smart city projects. The literature review also shows that the smart city development still requires stronger cooperation between the smart city technology-centered research, mainly based on the IoT, and the smart city citizens-centered research, mainly based on crowdsourcing. This cooperation could beneficiate in recent developments in the field of crowdsensing that combines IoT and crowdsourcing.},

ABSTRACT = {Buildings account for 36% of the final energy demand and 39% of CO2 emissions worldwide. Targets for increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing building related emissions is an important part of the energy policy to reach the Paris agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. While nearly zero energy buildings are the new norm in the EU, the research is advancing towards positive energy buildings, which contribute to the surrounding community by providing emission-free energy. This paper suggests a definition for positive energy building and presents the framework, elements, and challenges of the concept. In a positive energy building, the annual renewable energy production in the building site exceeds the energy demand of the building. This increases two-way interactions with energy grids, requiring a broader approach compared to zero energy buildings. The role of energy flexibility grows when the share of fluctuating renewable energy increases. The presented framework is designed with balancing two important perspectives: technical and user-centric approaches. It can be accommodated to different operational conditions, regulations, and climates. Potential challenges and opportunities are also discussed, such as the present issues in the building’s balancing boundary, electric vehicle integration, and smart readiness indicators.},

ABSTRACT = {To assess critically the scientific literature is a very challenging task; in general it requires analysing a lot of documents to define the state-of-the-art of a research field and classifying them. The documents classifier systems have tried to address this problem by different techniques such as probabilistic, machine learning and neural networks models. One of the most popular document classification approaches is the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), a probabilistic topic model. One of the main issues of the LDA approach is that the retrieved topics are a collection of terms with their probabilities and it does not have a human-readable form. This paper defines an approach to make LDA topics comprehensible for humans by the exploitation of the Word2Vec approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Fifth-generation (5G) communication technology is intended to offer higher data rates, outstanding user exposure, lower power consumption, and extremely short latency. Such cellular networks will implement a diverse multi-layer model comprising device-to-device networks, macro-cells, and different categories of small cells to assist customers with desired quality-of-service (QoS). This multi-layer model affects several studies that confront utilizing interference management and resource allocation in 5G networks. With the growing need for cellular service and the limited resources to provide it, capably handling network traffic and operation has become a problem of resource distribution. One of the utmost serious problems is to alleviate the jamming in the network in support of having a better QoS. However, although a limited number of review papers have been written on resource distribution, no review papers have been written specifically on 5G resource allocation. Hence, this article analyzes the issue of resource allocation by classifying the various resource allocation schemes in 5G that have been reported in the literature and assessing their ability to enhance service quality. This survey bases its discussion on the metrics that are used to evaluate network performance. After consideration of the current evidence on resource allocation methods in 5G, the review hopes to empower scholars by suggesting future research areas on which to focus.},

ABSTRACT = {Water is a critically important element of human life. The best practice of effective water management comes from ancient civilizations that, despite their technologies and practices, were unable to prevent collapse from water scarcity. In the 21st century, in an era of climate change, pollution or population explosion, cities are looking for innovative ways to effectively manage scarce resources for future generations. Which elements should cities of the future follow to avoid water collapse? The following article aims to identify the key elements of effective management and to represent them graphically in the form of a recommended model, which will be verified in the future in Slovakia. The article uses case analysis of best past and current practices, comparison and summarization to identify the elements, creativity, and logic in the development of the model, including induction and deduction. The article serves as a basis for fellow researchers (analyses carried out) and strategic urban management (effective urban water management). The main finding of the article is that ecological change puts pressure on social elements and therefore it is necessary to focus on the area of strategic management. Cities should not only know how to manage resource abundance or short-term scarcity, but also long-term scarcity. They should use elements of trust, awareness and continuous improvement through modern monitoring technologies (UAVs, sensors) and prediction (machine learning). This is the only way to generate water sustainability in the urban concept of the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Ambient Intelligence (AmI) encompasses technological infrastructures capable of sensing data from environments and extracting high-level knowledge to detect or recognize users’ features and actions, as well as entities or events in their surroundings. Visual perception, particularly object detection, has become one of the most relevant enabling factors for this context-aware user-centered intelligence, being the cornerstone of relevant but complex tasks, such as object tracking or human action recognition. In this context, convolutional neural networks have proven to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy levels. However, they typically result in large and highly complex models that typically demand computation offloading onto remote cloud platforms. Such an approach has security- and latency-related limitations and may not be appropriate for some AmI use cases where the system response time must be as short as possible, and data privacy must be guaranteed. In the last few years, the on-device paradigm has emerged in response to those limitations, yielding more compact and efficient neural networks able to address inference directly on client machines, thus providing users with a smoother and better-tailored experience, with no need of sharing their data with an outsourced service. Framed in that novel paradigm, this work presents a review of the recent advances made along those lines in object detection, providing a comprehensive study of the most relevant lightweight CNN-based detection frameworks, discussing the most paradigmatic AmI domains where such an approach has been successfully applied, the different challenges arisen, the key strategies and techniques adopted to create visual solutions for image-based object classification and localization, as well as the most relevant factors to bear in mind when assessing or comparing those techniques, such as the evaluation metrics or the hardware setups used.},

ABSTRACT = {With the emergence of fog and edge computing, new possibilities arise regarding the data-driven management of citizens’ mobility in smart cities. Internet of Things (IoT) analytics refers to the use of these technologies, data, and analytical models to describe the current status of the city traffic, to predict its evolution over the coming hours, and to make decisions that increase the efficiency of the transportation system. It involves many challenges such as how to deal and manage real and huge amounts of data, and improving security, privacy, scalability, reliability, and quality of services in the cloud and vehicular network. In this paper, we review the state of the art of IoT in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), identify challenges posed by cloud, fog, and edge computing in ITS, and develop a methodology based on agile optimization algorithms for solving a dynamic ride-sharing problem (DRSP) in the context of edge/fog computing. These algorithms allow us to process, in real time, the data gathered from IoT systems in order to optimize automatic decisions in the city transportation system, including: optimizing the vehicle routing, recommending customized transportation modes to the citizens, generating efficient ride-sharing and car-sharing strategies, create optimal charging station for electric vehicles and different services within urban and interurban areas. A numerical example considering a DRSP is provided, in which the potential of employing edge/fog computing, open data, and agile algorithms is illustrated.},

ABSTRACT = {Phishing detection with high-performance accuracy and low computational complexity has always been a topic of great interest. New technologies have been developed to improve the phishing detection rate and reduce computational constraints in recent years. However, one solution is insufficient to address all problems caused by attackers in cyberspace. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of various deep learning algorithms in detecting phishing activities. This analysis will help organizations or individuals select and adopt the proper solution according to their technological needs and specific applications’ requirements to fight against phishing attacks. In this regard, an empirical study was conducted using four different deep learning algorithms, including deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). To analyze the behaviors of these deep learning architectures, extensive experiments were carried out to examine the impact of parameter tuning on the performance accuracy of the deep learning models. In addition, various performance metrics were measured to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of DL models in detecting phishing activities. The results obtained from the experiments showed that no single DL algorithm achieved the best measures across all performance metrics. The empirical findings from this paper also manifest several issues and suggest future research directions related to deep learning in the phishing detection domain.},

ABSTRACT = {The inherent complexities of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) architecture make its security and privacy issues becoming critically challenging. Numerous surveys have been published to review IoT security issues and challenges. The studies gave a general overview of IIoT security threats or a detailed analysis that explicitly focuses on specific technologies. However, recent studies fail to analyze the gap between security requirements of these technologies and their deployed countermeasure in the industry recently. Whether recent industry countermeasure is still adequate to address the security challenges of IIoT environment are questionable. This article presents a comprehensive survey of IIoT security and provides insight into today’s industry countermeasure, current research proposals and ongoing challenges. We classify IIoT technologies into the four-layer security architecture, examine the deployed countermeasure based on CIA+ security requirements, report the deficiencies of today’s countermeasure, and highlight the remaining open issues and challenges. As no single solution can fix the entire IIoT ecosystem, IIoT security architecture with a higher abstraction level using the bottom-up approach is needed. Moving towards a data-centric approach that assures data protection whenever and wherever it goes could potentially solve the challenges of industry deployment.},

ABSTRACT = {Today, the issue of economic circularity is certainly not a new concept. It represents an essential issue in any production system since it is an alternative to the current production and consumption model. The importance of the topic is confirmed worldwide. However, there is still a “circularity gap” that can be bridged in the short and medium term, probably with the use of innovative and digital technologies. In fact, many researchers agree that the sustainable future can be achieved in the long term thanks to digital technologies (i.e., IoT, artificial intelligence, quantum computing etc.) which, thanks to their speed of calculation, are able to identify the right solutions at the right time. The challenge, therefore, will be to develop innovative technologies and tools for the efficient use of resources in industries for sustainable production. Thus, the aim of this study is to define the current state of the art and future research developments in this very promising field. To achieve this goal, the integration of a “set” of tools, based on the AHP method and the PRISMA protocol, is proposed. The results aim to be a guideline for decision makers and researchers interested in this topic.},

ABSTRACT = {In the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) realm, queue length estimation is one of an essential yet a challenging task. Queue lengths are important for determining traffic density in traffic lanes so that possible congestion in any lane can be minimized. Smart roadside sensors such as loop detectors, radars and pneumatic road tubes etc. are promising for such tasks though they have a very high installation and maintenance cost. Large scale deployment of surveillance cameras have shown a great potential in the collection of vehicular data in a flexible way and are also cost effective. Similarly, vision-based sensors can be used independently or if required can also augment the functionality of other roadside sensors to effectively process queue length at prescribed traffic lanes. In this research, a CNN-based approach for estimation of vehicle queue length in an urban traffic scenario using low-resolution traffic videos is proposed. The queue length is estimated based on count of total vehicles waiting on a signal. The proposed approach calculates queue length without the knowledge of any onsite camera calibration information. Average vehicle length is approximated to be 5 m. This caters for the vehicles at the far end of the traffic lane that appear smaller in the camera view. Identification of stopped vehicles is done using Deep SORT based object tracking. Due to robust and accurate CNN-based detection and tracking, the queue length estimated by using only the cameras has been very effective. This mostly eliminates the need for fusion with any roadside or in-vehicle sensors. A detailed comparative analysis of vehicle detection models including YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, SSD, ResNet101, and InceptionV3 was performed. Based on this analysis, YOLOv4 was selected as a baseline model for queue length estimation. Using the pre-trained 80-classes YOLOv4 model, an overall accuracy of 73% and 88% was achieved for vehicle count and vehicle count-based queue length estimation, respectively. After fine-tuning of model and narrowing the output classes to vehicle class only, an average accuracy of 83% and 93% was achieved, respectively. This shows the efficiency and robustness of the proposed approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, researchers have realized a number of achievements involving deep-learning-based neural networks for the tasks of segmentation and detection based on 2D images, 3D point clouds, etc. Using 2D and 3D information fusion for the advantages of compensation and accuracy improvement has become a hot research topic. However, there are no critical reviews focusing on the fusion strategies of 2D and 3D information integration based on various data for segmentation and detection, which are the basic tasks of computer vision. To boost the development of this research domain, the existing representative fusion strategies are collected, introduced, categorized, and summarized in this paper. In addition, the general structures of different kinds of fusion strategies were firstly abstracted and categorized, which may inspire researchers. Moreover, according to the methods included in this paper, the 2D information and 3D information of different methods come from various kinds of data. Furthermore, suitable datasets are introduced and comparatively summarized to support the relative research. Last but not least, we put forward some open challenges and promising directions for future research.},

ABSTRACT = {Satellite–terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) are regarded as a promising solution to meeting the demands of global high-speed seamless network access in the future. Software-defined networking and network function virtualization (SDN/NFV) are two complementary technologies that can be used to ensure that the heterogeneous resources in STINs can be easily managed and deployed. Considering the dual mobility of satellites and ubiquitous users, along with the dynamic requirements of user requests and network resource states, it is challenging to maintain service continuity and high QoE performance in STINs. Thus, we investigate the service migration and reconfiguration scheme, which are of great significance to the guarantee of continuous service provisioning. Specifically, this paper proposes a dynamic service reconfiguration method that can support flexible service configurations on integrated networks, including LEO satellites and ground nodes. We first model the migration cost as an extra delay incurred by service migration and reconfiguration and then formulate the selection processes of the location and migration paths of virtual network functions (VNFs) as an integer linear programming (ILP) optimization problem. Then, we propose a fuzzy logic and quantum genetic algorithm (FQGA) to obtain an approximate optimal solution that can accelerate the solving process efficiently with the benefits of the high-performance computing capacity of QGA. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and improved performance of the scheme proposed in this paper.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate and timely wind power forecasting is essential for achieving large-scale wind power grid integration and ensuring the safe and stable operation of the power system. For overcoming the inaccuracy of wind power forecasting caused by randomness and volatility, this study proposes a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) model (GA–PSO–CNN) integrating genetic algorithm (GA) and a particle swarm optimization (PSO). The model can establish feature maps between factors affecting wind power such as wind speed, wind direction, and temperature. Moreover, a mix-encoding GA–PSO algorithm is introduced to optimize the network hyperparameters and weights collaboratively, which solves the problem of subjective determination of the optimal network in the CNN and effectively prevents local optimization in the training process. The prediction effectiveness of the proposed model is verified using data from a wind farm in Ningxia, China. The results show that the MAE, MSE, and MAPE of the proposed GA–PSO–CNN model decreased by 1.13–9.55%, 0.46–7.98%, and 3.28–19.29%, respectively, in different seasons, compared with Single–CNN, PSO–CNN, ISSO–CNN, and CHACNN models. The convolution kernel size and number in each convolution layer were reduced by 5–18.4% in the GA–PSO–CNN model.},

ABSTRACT = {In the search for increased productivity and efficiency in the industrial sector, a new industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0, was promoted. In the electric sector, power plants seek to adapt these new concepts to optimize electric power generation processes, as well as to reduce operating costs and unscheduled downtime intervals. In these plants, PID control strategies are commonly used in water cooling systems, which use fans to perform the thermal exchange between water and the ambient air. However, as the nonlinearities of these systems affect the performance of the drivers, sometimes a greater number of fans than necessary are activated to ensure water temperature control which, consequently, increases energy expenditure. In this work, our objective is to develop digital twins for a water cooling system with auxiliary equipment, in terms of the decision making of the operator, to determine the correct number of fans. This model was developed based on the algorithm of automatic extraction of fuzzy rules, derived from the SCADA of a power plant located in the capital of Paraíba, Brazil. The digital twins can update the fuzzy rules in the case of new events, such as steady-state operation, starting and stopping ramps, and instability. The results from experimental tests using data from 11 h of plant operations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed digital twin model. Furthermore, in all scenarios, the average percentage error was less than 5% and the average absolute temperature error was below 3 °C.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last few years, jargon, such as machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), have been ubiquitous in both popular science media as well as the academic literature. Many industries have tried the current suite of ML and AI algorithms with various degrees of success. Mineral processing, as an industry, is looking at AI for two reasons. First of all, as with other industries, it is pertinent to know if AI algorithms can be used to enhance productivity. The second reason is specific to the mining industry. Of late, the grade of ores is reducing, and the demand for ethical mining (with as little effect on ecology as possible) is increasing. Thus, mineral processing industries also want to explore the possible use of AI in solving these challenges. In this review paper, first, the challenges in mineral processing that can potentially be solved by AI are presented. Then, some of the most pertinent developments in the domain of ML and AI (applied in the domain of mineral processing) are discussed. Lastly, a top-level modus operandi is presented for a mineral processing industry that might want to explore the possibilities of using AI in its processes. Following are some of the new paradigms added by this review. This review presents a holistic view of the domain of mineral processing with an AI lens. It is also one of the first reviews in this domain to thoroughly discuss the use of AI in ethical, green, and sustainable mineral processing. The AI process proposed in this paper is a comprehensive one. To ensure the relevance to industry, the flow was made agile with the spiral system engineering flow. This is expected to drive rapid and agile investigation of the potential of applying ML and AI in different mineral processing industries.},

ABSTRACT = {This article has reviewed international research, up to the first half of 2021, focused on sustainability, big data and the mathematical techniques used for its analysis. In addition, a study of the spatial component (city, region, nation and beyond) of the works has been carried out and an analysis has been made of which Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have received the most attention. A bibliometric analysis and a fractal cluster analysis were performed on the papers published in the Web of Science. The results show a continuous increase in the number of published articles and citations over the whole period, demonstrating a growing interest in this topic. China, the United States and India are the most productive countries and there are more papers at the regional level. It has been found that the environmental dimension is the most studied and the least studied is the social dimension. The mathematical techniques used in the empirical work are mainly regression analysis, neural networks and multi-criteria decision methods. SDG9 and SDG11 are the most worked on. The trend shows a convergence in recent years towards big data applied to supply chains, Industry 4.0 and the achievement of sustainable cities.},

ABSTRACT = {Cloud computing is a well-known technology that provides flexible, efficient, and cost-effective IT solutions for multinationals to offer improved and enhanced quality of business services to end-users. The cloud computing paradigm is instigated from the grid and parallel computing models. It uses virtualization, server consolidation, utility computing, and other computing technologies and models for providing better IT solutions for large-scale computational data centres. It encompasses different services for supporting data storage, networking, and computing for facilities and amenities for businesses and multinational corporations. The enormous elastic on-demand cloud provisioning resources and services and datasets are processed and stored in tier-level virtualized cloud data centres operated by third-party service providers called cloud owners. The primary issue with these cloud service providers is to provide and maintain data security, privacy, and confidentiality and service availability and data support for end-users. This paper reviews, highlights, and discusses some of the common cloud computing vulnerabilities primarily related to virtualization platforms and their implementations while outsourcing services and resources to different end-users and business enterprises. We then provided blockchain-enabled solutions for virtualized cloud platforms involving both the end-users and cloud service providers (CSP) to address and solve various security and privacy-related vulnerabilities. These solutions will help the data centre industry to improve its virtualized cloud services and resource provisioning facilities. Finally, we discussed different blockchain-related implementation challenges in cloud infrastructures.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent decades, modern societies are experiencing an increasing adoption of interconnected smart devices. This revolution involves not only canonical devices such as smartphones and tablets, but also simple objects like light bulbs. Named the Internet of Things (IoT), this ever-growing scenario offers enormous opportunities in many areas of modern society, especially if joined by other emerging technologies such as, for example, the blockchain. Indeed, the latter allows users to certify transactions publicly, without relying on central authorities or intermediaries. This work aims to exploit the scenario above by proposing a novel blockchain-based distributed paradigm to secure localization services, here named the Internet of Entities (IoE). It represents a mechanism for the reliable localization of people and things, and it exploits the increasing number of existing wireless devices and blockchain-based distributed ledger technologies. Moreover, unlike most of the canonical localization approaches, it is strongly oriented towards the protection of the users’ privacy. Finally, its implementation requires minimal efforts since it employs the existing infrastructures and devices, thus giving life to a new and wide data environment, exploitable in many domains, such as e-health, smart cities, and smart mobility.},

ABSTRACT = {As a typical application of sensor networks, there exist many information security problems in smart parks, such as confusion of personnel access, lack of security management, disorderly data flow, insufficient collection of audit evidence, and so on. Aiming at the scenario of personnel and equipment moving in different areas of smart parks, the paper proposes a joint authorization and dynamic access control mechanism, which can provide unified identity management services, access control services, and policy management services, and effectively solve the problem of multi-authorization in user identity and authority management. The license negotiation interaction protocol is designed to prevent common network attack threats in the process of identity authentication and authority management. In order to realize the tamper-proof storage of personnel and equipment movement trajectory, the paper also designs a movement trajectory traceability protocol based on a Merkle tree, which solves the problems of internal personnel malicious attack, trusted third-party dependency bottleneck, high overheads of tracking algorithms, and so on. The experimental results show that compared with the current security control mechanisms for sensor networks, the joint authorization, and dynamic access control mechanism can support multi-party authorization and traceability, while the overhead it generates in initialization, encryption, decryption, and key generation steps are basically the same as other mechanisms do.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of advanced sensing devices for concrete and reinforced concrete structures (RCS) is considered a rational approach for the assessment of repair options and scheduling of inspection and maintenance strategies. The immediate benefits are cost reduction and a reliable prevention of unpredictable events. The use of optical fiber sensors (OFS) for such purposes has increased considerably in the last few years due to their intrinsic advantages. In most of the OFS, the chemical transducer consists of immobilized chemical reagents placed in the sensing region of the optical sensor by direct deposition or by encapsulation in a polymeric matrix. The choice of the support matrix impacts directly on the performance of the OFS. In the last two decades, the development of OFS functionalized with organic–inorganic hybrid (OIH) sol–gel membranes have been reported. Sol–gel route is considered a simple method that offers several advantages when compared to traditional synthesis processes, allowing to obtain versatile materials with unique chemical and physical properties, and is particularly valuable in the design of OIH materials. This review will provide an update of the current state-of-the-art of the OFS based on OIH sol-gel materials for concrete and RCS since 2016 until mid-2021. The main achievements in the synthesis of OIH membranes for deposition on OFS will be discussed. The challenges and future directions in this field will also be considered, as well as the main limitations of OFS for RCS monitoring.},

ABSTRACT = {With growing evidence of deep learning-assisted smart process planning, there is an essential demand for comprehending whether cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) are adequate in managing complexity and flexibility, configuring the smart factory. In this research, prior findings were cumulated indicating that the interoperability between Internet of Things-based real-time production logistics and cyber-physical process monitoring systems can decide upon the progression of operations advancing a system to the intended state in CPPSs. We carried out a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science throughout March and August 2021, with search terms including “cyber-physical production systems”, “cyber-physical manufacturing systems”, “smart process manufacturing”, “smart industrial manufacturing processes”, “networked manufacturing systems”, “industrial cyber-physical systems,” “smart industrial production processes”, and “sustainable Internet of Things-based manufacturing systems”. As we analyzed research published between 2017 and 2021, only 489 papers met the eligibility criteria. By removing controversial or unclear findings (scanty/unimportant data), results unsupported by replication, undetailed content, or papers having quite similar titles, we decided on 164, chiefly empirical, sources. Subsequent analyses should develop on real-time sensor networks, so as to configure the importance of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics by use of cyber-physical production networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Logic-in-memory (LIM) circuits based on the material implication logic (IMPLY) and resistive random access memory (RRAM) technologies are a candidate solution for the development of ultra-low power non-von Neumann computing architectures. Such architectures could enable the energy-efficient implementation of hardware accelerators for novel edge computing paradigms such as binarized neural networks (BNNs) which rely on the execution of logic operations. In this work, we present the multi-input IMPLY operation implemented on a recently developed smart IMPLY architecture, SIMPLY, which improves the circuit reliability, reduces energy consumption, and breaks the strict design trade-offs of conventional architectures. We show that the generalization of the typical logic schemes used in LIM circuits to multi-input operations strongly reduces the execution time of complex functions needed for BNNs inference tasks (e.g., the 1-bit Full Addition, XNOR, Popcount). The performance of four different RRAM technologies is compared using circuit simulations leveraging a physics-based RRAM compact model. The proposed solution approaches the performance of its CMOS equivalent while bypassing the von Neumann bottleneck, which gives a huge improvement in bit error rate (by a factor of at least 108) and energy-delay product (projected up to a factor of 1010).},

ABSTRACT = {Weeds are among the most harmful abiotic factors in agriculture, triggering significant yield loss worldwide. Remote sensing can detect and map the presence of weeds in various spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. This review aims to show the current and future trends of UAV applications in weed detection in the crop field. This study systematically searched the original articles published from 1 January 2016 to 18 June 2021 in the databases of Scopus, ScienceDirect, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux (CAB) Direct, and Web of Science (WoS) using Boolean string: “weed” AND “Unmanned Aerial Vehicle” OR “UAV” OR “drone”. Out of the papers identified, 144 eligible studies did meet our inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Most of the studies (i.e., 27.42%) on weed detection were carried out during the seedling stage of the growing cycle for the crop. Most of the weed images were captured using red, green, and blue (RGB) camera, i.e., 48.28% and main classification algorithm was machine learning techniques, i.e., 47.90%. This review initially highlighted articles from the literature that includes the crops’ typical phenology stage, reference data, type of sensor/camera, classification methods, and current UAV applications in detecting and mapping weed for different types of crop. This study then provides an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of each sensor and algorithm and tries to identify research gaps by providing a brief outlook at the potential areas of research concerning the benefit of this technology in agricultural industries. Integrated weed management, coupled with UAV application improves weed monitoring in a more efficient and environmentally-friendly way. Overall, this review demonstrates the scientific information required to achieve sustainable weed management, so as to implement UAV platform in the real agricultural contexts.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite the trending studies on smart city development, how to evaluate the smartness of a city remains unclear. This research aimed to design a smart city evaluation system, named the City Intelligence Quotient (CityIQ) evaluation system, which considers both the hard (e.g., physical infrastructure) and soft sides (e.g., citizens’ perspectives) of smart city development. Based on the two-level structure of the CityIQ evaluation system (i.e., five dimensions and twenty indicators), a list of keywords was defined for automated information scraping in leading social media platforms to obtain volunteered geographic information. Semantic analysis was then used to update the CityIQ evaluations in a timely manner. Fifteen major cities in the Yangtze River Delta region, China, were selected for the empirical study, in which their smartness indices were calculated, traced and compared. Finally, suggestions for collaborative smart agglomerations were put forward. With the CityIQ evaluation system, policy makers can be informed of up-to-date changes in urban smartness levels and, thus, design context-specific collaborative policies to promote smart agglomerations.},

ABSTRACT = {Taxi waiting times is an important criterion for taxi passengers to choose appropriate pick-up locations in urban environments. How to predict the taxi waiting time accurately at a certain time and location is the key solution for the imbalance between the taxis’ supplies and demands. Considering the life schedule of urban residents and the different functions of geogrid regions, the research developed in this paper introduces a spatio-temporal schedule-based neural network for urban taxi waiting time prediction. The approach integrates a series of multi-source data from taxi trajectories to city points of interest, different time frames and human behaviors in the city. We apply a grid-based and functional structuration of an urban space that provides a lower-level data representation. Overall, the neural network model can dynamically predict the waiting time of taxi passengers in real time under some given spatio-temporal constraints. The experimental results show that the granular-based grids and spatio-temporal neural network can effectively predict and optimize the accuracy of taxi waiting times. This work provides a decision support for intelligent travel predictions of taxi waiting time in a smart city.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial neural networks (ANN) exhibit excellent performance in complex problems and have been increasingly applied in the research field of construction management (CM) over the last few decades. However, few papers draw up a systematic review to evaluate the state-of-the-art research on ANN in CM. In this paper, content analysis is performed to comprehensively analyze 112 related bibliographic records retrieved from seven selected top journals published between 2000 and 2020. The results indicate that the applications of ANN of interest in CM research have been significantly increasing since 2015. Back-propagation was the most widely used algorithm in training ANN. Integrated ANN with fuzzy logic/genetic algorithm was the most commonly employed way of addressing the CM problem. In addition, 11 application fields and 31 research topics were identified, with the primary research interests focusing on cost, performance, and safety. Lastly, challenges and future directions for ANN in CM were put forward from four main areas of input data, modeling, application fields, and emerging technologies. This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the application of ANN in CM research and useful reference for the future.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of 5G communications, enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine type communications and ultra-reliable low latency communications are widely supported. However, a 5G communication system is still based on Shannon’s information theory, while the meaning and value of information itself are not taken into account in the process of transmission. Therefore, it is difficult to meet the requirements of intelligence, customization, and value transmission of 6G networks. In order to solve the above challenges, we propose a 6G mailbox theory, namely a cognitive information carrier to enable distributed algorithm embedding for intelligence networking. Based on Mailbox, a 6G network will form an intelligent agent with self-organization, self-learning, self-adaptation, and continuous evolution capabilities. With the intelligent agent, redundant transmission of data can be reduced while the value transmission of information can be improved. Then, the features of mailbox principle are introduced, including polarity, traceability, dynamics, convergence, figurability, and dependence. Furthermore, key technologies with which value transmission of information can be realized are introduced, including knowledge graph, distributed learning, and blockchain. Finally, we establish a cognitive communication system assisted by deep learning. The experimental results show that, compared with a traditional communication system, our communication system performs less data transmission quantity and error.},

ABSTRACT = {Public transport has become one of the major transport options, especially when it comes to reducing motorized individual transport and achieving sustainability while reducing emissions, noise and so on. The use of public transport data has evolved and rapidly improved over the past decades. Indeed, the availability of data from different sources, coupled with advances in analytical and predictive approaches, has contributed to increased attention being paid to the exploitation of available data to improve public transport service. In this paper, we review the current state of the art of public transport data sources. More precisely, we summarize and analyze the potential and challenges of the main data sources. In addition, we show the complementary aspects of these data sources and how to merge them to broaden their contributions and face their challenges. This is complemented by an information management framework to enhance the use of data sources. Specifically, we seek to bridge the gap between traditional data sources and recent ones, present a unified overview of them and show how they can all leverage recent advances in data-driven methods and how they can help achieve a balance between transit service and passenger behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {The widespread use of mobile devices and sensors has motivated data-driven applications that can leverage the power of big data to benefit many aspects of our daily life, such as health, transportation, economy, and environment. Under the context of smart city, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), as a main building block of modern cities, and edge computing (EC), as an emerging computing service that targets addressing the limitations of cloud computing, have attracted increasing attention in the research community in recent years. It is well believed that the application of EC in ITS will have considerable benefits to transportation systems regarding efficiency, safety, and sustainability. Despite the growing trend in ITS and EC research, a big gap in the existing literature is identified: the intersection between these two promising directions has been far from well explored. In this paper, we focus on a critical part of ITS, i.e., sensing, and conducting a review on the recent advances in ITS sensing and EC applications in this field. The key challenges in ITS sensing and future directions with the integration of edge computing are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the accident rate of urban rail transit PPP (public–private partnerships) project under construction has been relatively high, and the issue of security risks has attracted great attention from all walks of life. Therefore, it is necessary to identify, analyze, and evaluate the issue of security risks of the urban rail transit PPP project. This paper takes the PPP project of urban rail transit as the object. Through offline interviews and surveys and online questionnaires, this paper focuses on identifying and analyzing the risks brought by the introduction of PPP mode to the urban rail transit project and its action mechanism. The risk evaluation method based on Bayesian network model is studied, which is described from three dimensions: risk occurrence probability, risk reasoning, and risk sensitivity. Finally, an example of Xuzhou Metro Line 3 is given to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. This study provides a reference basis for relevant practitioners and promotes the healthy development of the industry.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the application of simulation to assess and predict the influence of random factors of pedestrian flow and its continuity on the traffic capacity of a signal-controlled intersection during a right turn. The data were collected from the surveillance cameras of 25 signal-controlled intersections in the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia, and interpreted by a neural network. We considered the influence of both the intensity of the pedestrian flow and its continuity on the traffic capacity of a signal-controlled intersection in the stochastic approach, provided that the flow of vehicles is redundant. We used a reasonably minimized regression model as the basis for our intersection models. At the first stage, we obtained and tested a simulated continuous-stochastic intersection model that accounts for the dynamics of traffic flow. The second approach, due to the unpredictability of pedestrian flow, used a relevant method for analysing traffic flows based on the fuzzy logic theory. The second was also used as the foundation to build and graphically demonstrate a computer model in the fuzzy TECH suite for predictive visualization of the values of a traffic flow crossing a signal-controlled intersection. The results of this study can contribute to understanding the real conditions at a signal-controlled intersection and making grounded decisions on its focused control.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent Society 5.0 efforts by the Government of Japan are aimed at establishing a sustainable human-centered society by combining new technologies such as sensor networks, edge computing, Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and robotics. Many research works have been carried out with an increasing emphasis on the fundamentals of wireless sensor networks (WSN) for different applications; namely precision agriculture, environment, medical care, security, and surveillance. In the same vein, almost all of the known authentication techniques rely on the single gateway node, which is unsuitable for the current sensor nodes that are broadly distributed in the real world. Despite technological advances, resource constraints and vulnerability to an attacker physically capturing some sensor nodes have remained an important and challenging research field for developing wireless sensor network user authentication. This work proposes a new authentication scheme for agriculture professionals based on a multi-gateway communication model using a fuzzy extractor algorithm to support the Society 5.0 environment. The scheme provides a secure mutual authentication using the well-established formal method called BAN logic. The formal security verification of the proposed scheme is validated with the AVISPA tool, a powerful validation method for network security applications. In addition, the security of the scheme was informally analyzed to demonstrate that the scheme is secure from different attacks, e.g., sensor capture, replay, and other network and physical attacks. Furthermore, the communication and computation costs of the proposed scheme are evaluated and show better performance than the existing authentication schemes.},

ABSTRACT = {In the context of hyper-connected cars and a growing heterogeneous digital ecosystem, we wish to make the most of the data available from the various sensors, devices and services that compose the ecosystem, in order to propose a proof of concept in-vehicle system that enhances the driving experience. We focus on improving the driving experience along three main directions, namely: (1) driving and trip planning, (2) health and well-being and (3) social and online activities. We approached the in-vehicle space as a smart interface to the intelligent driving environment. The digital data-producers in the ecosystem of the connected car are sources of raw data of various categories, such as data from the outside world, gathered from sensors or online services, data from the car itself and data from the driver gathered with various mobile and wearable devices, by means of observing his state and by means of his social media and online activity. Data is later processed into three information categories—driving, wellness, and social—and used to provide multi-modal interaction, namely visual, audio and gesture. The system is implemented to act in response to the trafficked information on different levels of autonomy, either in a reactive manner, by simple monitoring, or in a proactive manner. The system is designed to provide an in-vehicle system that assists the driver with planning the travel (Drive panel), by providing a comfortable environment for the driver while monitoring him (Wellness panel), and by adaptively managing interactions with their phone and the digital environment (Social panel). Heuristic evaluation of the system is performed, with respect to guidelines formulated for automated vehicles, and a SWOT analysis of the system is also presented in the paper.},

ABSTRACT = {This review describes a cloud-based intelligent power management system that uses analytics as a control signal and processes balance achievement pointer, and describes operator acknowledgments that must be shared quickly, accurately, and safely. The current study aims to introduce a conceptual and systematic structure with three main components: demand power (direct current (DC)-device), power mix between renewable energy (RE) and other power sources, and a cloud-based power optimization intelligent system. These methods and techniques monitor demand power (DC-device), load, and power mix between RE and other power sources. Cloud-based power optimization intelligent systems lead to an optimal power distribution solution that reduces power consumption or costs. Data has been collected from reliable sources such as Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed. The overall findings of these studies are visually explained in the proposed conceptual framework through the literature that are considered to be cloud computing based on storing and running the intelligent systems of power management and mixing.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an enhanced PDR-BLE compensation mechanism for improving indoor localization, which is considerably resilient against variant uncertainties. The proposed method of ePDR-BLE compensation mechanism (EPBCM) takes advantage of the non-requirement of linearization of the system around its current state in an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and Kalman filter (KF) in smoothing of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values. In this paper, a fusion of conflicting information and the activity detection approach of an object in an indoor environment contemplates varying magnitude of accelerometer values based on the hidden Markov model (HMM). On the estimated orientation, the proposed approach remunerates the inadvertent body acceleration and magnetic distortion sensor data. Moreover, EPBCM can precisely calculate the velocity and position by reducing the position drift, which gives rise to a fault in zero-velocity and heading error. The developed EPBCM localization algorithm using Bluetooth low energy beacons (BLE) was applied and analyzed in an indoor environment. The experiments conducted in an indoor scenario shows the results of various activities performed by the object and achieves better orientation estimation, zero velocity measurements, and high position accuracy than other methods in the literature.},

ABSTRACT = {Trackers installed in vehicles gives insights into many useful information and predict future mobility patterns and other aspects related to vehicles movement which can be used for smart and sustainable cities planning. A novel approach is used with the COPERT model to estimate fuel consumption on a huge dataset collected over a period of one year. Since the data size is enormous, Apache Spark, a big data analytical framework is used for performance gains while estimating vehicle fuel consumption with the lowest latency possible. The research presents peak and off-peak hours fuel consumption’s in three major cities, i.e., Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. The results can assist smart city professionals to plan alternative trip routes, avoid traffic congestion in order to save fuel and time, and protect against urban pollution for effective smart city planning. The research will be a step towards Industry 5.0 by combining sustainable disruptive technologies.},

ABSTRACT = {While extensive research has gone into demand response techniques in data centers, the energy consumed in edge computing systems and in network data transmission remains a significant part of the computing industry’s carbon footprint. The industry also has not fully leveraged the parallel trend of decentralized renewable energy generation, which creates new areas of opportunity for innovation in combined energy and computing systems. Through an interdisciplinary sociotechnical discussion of current energy, computer science and social studies of science and technology (STS) literature, we argue that a more comprehensive set of carbon response techniques needs to be developed that span the continuum of data centers, from the back-end cloud to the network edge. Such techniques need to address the combined needs of decentralized energy and computing systems, alongside the social power dynamics those combinations entail. We call this more comprehensive range “carbon-responsive computing,” and underscore that this continuum constitutes the beginnings of an interconnected infrastructure, elements of which are data-intensive and require the integration of social science disciplines to adequately address problems of inequality, governance, transparency, and definitions of “necessary” tasks in a climate crisis.},

ABSTRACT = {Cities are becoming increasingly complex to manage, as they increase in size and must provide higher living standards for their populations. New technology-based solutions must be developed towards attending this growth and ensuring that it is socially sustainable. This paper puts forward the notion that these solutions must share some properties: they should be anthropocentric, holistic, horizontal, multi-dimensional, multi-modal, and predictive. We propose an architecture in which streaming data sources that characterize the city context are used to feed a real-time graph of the city’s assets and states, as well as to train predictive models that hint into near future states of the city. This allows human decision-makers and automated services to take decisions, both for the present and for the future. To achieve this, multiple data sources about a city were gradually connected to a message broker, that enables increasingly rich decision-support. Results show that it is possible to predict future states of a city, in aspects such as traffic, air pollution, and other ambient variables. The key innovative aspect of this work is that, as opposed to the majority of existing approaches which focus on a real-time view of the city, we also provide insights into the near-future state of the city, thus allowing city services to plan ahead and adapt accordingly. The main goal is to optimize decision-making by anticipating future states of the city and make decisions accordingly.},

ABSTRACT = {Because cities worldwide have high population concentration, traffic congestion is a key problem that needs to be addressed. As modern technology advances, smart traffic management is able to collect data from the environment and uses a contextual signal assignment to determine the traffic flow at intersections and improve the traffic conditions. In this paper, we propose a green signal time allocation system based on a deep Q-network (DQN) that can maximize the capacity at intersections and assign the green light time according to the traffic conditions. The proposed system also aims to reduce the standard deviation of each lane at an intersection by considering the standard deviation of the waiting time. As a result, selfish green signal allocations can be reduced. Thus, the proposed system can achieve better experimental results in a dynamic environment than those of the green signal phase sequence allocation system.},

ABSTRACT = {A communication system based on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a viable alternative for meeting the coverage and capacity needs of future wireless networks. However, because of the limitations of UAV-enabled communications in terms of coverage, energy consumption, and flying laws, the number of studies focused on the sustainability element of UAV-assisted networking in the literature was limited thus far. We present a solution to this problem in this study; specifically, we design a Q-learning-based UAV placement strategy for long-term wireless connectivity while taking into account major constraints such as altitude regulations, nonflight zones, and transmit power. The goal is to determine the best location for the UAV base station (BS) while reducing energy consumption and increasing the number of users covered. Furthermore, a weighting method is devised, allowing energy usage and the number of users served to be prioritized based on network/battery circumstances. The suggested Q-learning-based solution is contrasted to the standard k-means clustering method, in which the UAV BS is positioned at the centroid location with the shortest cumulative distance between it and the users. The results demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms the baseline k-means clustering-based method in terms of the number of users covered while achieving the desired minimization of the energy consumption.},

ABSTRACT = {Diverse forms of artificial intelligence (AI) are at the forefront of triggering digital security innovations based on the threats that are arising in this post-COVID world. On the one hand, companies are experiencing difficulty in dealing with security challenges with regard to a variety of issues ranging from system openness, decision making, quality control, and web domain, to mention a few. On the other hand, in the last decade, research has focused on security capabilities based on tools such as platform complacency, intelligent trees, modeling methods, and outage management systems in an effort to understand the interplay between AI and those issues. the dependence on the emergence of AI in running industries and shaping the education, transports, and health sectors is now well known in the literature. AI is increasingly employed in managing data security across economic sectors. Thus, a literature review of AI and system security within the current digital society is opportune. This paper aims at identifying research trends in the field through a systematic bibliometric literature review (LRSB) of research on AI and system security. the review entails 77 articles published in the Scopus® database, presenting up-to-date knowledge on the topic. the LRSB results were synthesized across current research subthemes. Findings are presented. the originality of the paper relies on its LRSB method, together with an extant review of articles that have not been categorized so far.

ABSTRACT = {Currently, two-wheelers are the most popular mode of transportation, driven by the majority the people. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) identifies that most two-wheeler deaths are caused due to not wearing a helmet. However, the advancement in sensors and wireless communication technology empowers one to monitor physical things such as helmets through wireless technology. Motivated by these aspects, this article proposes a wireless personal network and an Internet of Things assisted system for automating the ignition of two-wheelers with authorization and authentication through the helmet. The authentication and authorization are realized with the assistance of a helmet node and a two-wheeler node based on 2.4 GHz RF communication. The helmet node is embedded with three flex sensors utilized to experiment with different age groups and under different temperature conditions. The statistical data collected during the experiment are utilized to identify the appropriate threshold value through a t-test hypothesis for igniting the two-wheelers. The threshold value obtained after the t-test is logged in the helmet node for initiating the communication with the two-wheeler node. The pairing of the helmet node along with the RFID key is achieved through 2.4 GHZ RF communication. During real-time implementation, the helmet node updates the status to the server and LABVIEW data logger, after wearing the helmet. Along with the customization of hardware, a LABVIEW data logger is designed to visualize the data on the server side.},

ABSTRACT = {Irrigation installations in cities or agricultural operations use large amounts of water and electrical energy in their activity. Therefore, optimising these resources is essential nowadays. Wireless networks offer ideal support for such applications. The long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) used in this research offers a large coverage of up to 5 km, has low power consumption and does not need additional hardware such as repeaters or signal amplifiers. This research develops a control and monitoring system for irrigation systems. For this purpose, an irrigation algorithm is designed that uses rainfall probability data to regulate the irrigation of the installation. The algorithm is complemented by checking the sending and receiving of information in the LoRa network to reduce the loss of information packets. In addition, two temperature and humidity measurement devices for LoRaWAN (THMDLs) and an electrovalve control device for LoRaWAN (ECDLs) were developed. The hardware and software were also designed, and prototypes were built with the development of the electronic board. The wide coverage of the LoRaWAN allows the covering of small to large irrigation areas.},

ABSTRACT = {With the increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and network communications, but with less bandwidth growth, the resulting constraints must be overcome. Due to the network complexity and uncertainty of emergency distribution parameters in smart environments, using predetermined rules seems illogical. Reinforcement learning (RL), as a powerful machine learning approach, can handle such smart environments without a trainer or supervisor. Recently, we worked on bandwidth management in a smart environment with several fog fragments using limited shared bandwidth, where IoT devices may experience uncertain emergencies in terms of the time and sequence needed for more bandwidth for further higher-level communication. We introduced fog fragment cooperation using an RL approach under a predefined fixed threshold constraint. In this study, we promote this approach by removing the fixed level of restriction of the threshold through hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and completing the cooperation qualification. At the first learning hierarchy level of the proposed approach, the best threshold level is learned over time, and the final results are used by the second learning hierarchy level, where the fog node learns the best device for helping an emergency device by temporarily lending the bandwidth. Although equipping the method to the adaptive threshold and restricting fog fragment cooperation make the learning procedure more difficult, the HRL approach increases the method’s efficiency in terms of time and performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Research on the forest structure classification is essential, as it plays an important role in assessing the vitality and diversity of vegetation. However, classifying forest structure involves in situ surveying, which requires considerable time and money, and cannot be conducted directly in some instances; also, the update cycle of the classification data is very late. To overcome these drawbacks, feasibility studies on mapping the forest vertical structure from aerial images using machine learning techniques were conducted. In this study, we investigated (1) the performance improvement of the forest structure classification, using a high-resolution LiDAR-derived digital surface model (DSM) acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform and (2) the performance comparison of results obtained from the single-seasonal and two-seasonal data, using random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM). For the performance comparison, the UAV optic and LiDAR data were divided into three cases: (1) only used autumn data, (2) only used winter data, and (3) used both autumn and winter data. From the results, the best model was XGBoost, and the F1 scores achieved using this method were approximately 0.92 in the autumn and winter cases. A remarkable improvement was achieved when both two-seasonal images were used. The F1 score improved by 35.3% from 0.68 to 0.92. This implies that (1) the seasonal variation in the forest vertical structure can be more important than the spatial resolution, and (2) the classification performance achieved from the two-seasonal UAV optic images and LiDAR-derived DSMs can reach 0.9 with the application of an optimal machine learning approach.},

ABSTRACT = {COVID-19 disease shocked global economic activity and affected the electricity markets due to lockdown and work-from-home policies. Therefore, this study proposes an empirical analysis to identify the electricity spot price response during the preventive and mandatory insulation in Colombia, where the economic contraction caused the largest decrease in the electricity demand, especially in the industrial sector. The methodology applied was quantile regression to quantify the non-linear effect on the spot price returns, and two sample periods were selected to contrast the results: 2018 and 2019. The main findings showed that regulated demand variation caused the highest variability on the spot price dynamic during the strict quarantine. However, the price could not fully capture the effects of the demand change due to the short duration of the shock and, also, the price variability in 2019 was higher than 2020 by an El Niño shock.},

ABSTRACT = {Internet of things (IoT) is playing a major role in smart cities to make a digital environment. Traffic congestion is a serious road issue because of an increasing number of vehicles in urban areas. Some crucial traffic problems include accidents and traffic jams that cause waste of fuel, health diseases, and a waste of time. Present traffic signaling systems are not efficient in resolving congestion problems because of the lack of traffic signals. Nowadays, traffic signaling systems are modeled with fixed time intervals in which no proper mechanism for emergency vehicles is available. Such traffic mechanisms failed to deal with traffic problems effectively. The major objective is to establish a robust traffic monitoring and signaling system that improves signal efficiency by providing a responsive scheme; appropriate routes; a mechanism for emergency vehicles and pedestrians in real-time using Vienna Development Method Specification Language (VDM-SL) formal method and graph theory. A formal model is constructed by considering objects, such as wireless sensors and cameras that are used for collecting information. Graph theory is used to represent the network and find appropriate routes. Unified Modeling Language is used to design the system requirements. The graph-based framework is converted into a formal model by using VDM-SL. The model has been validated and analyzed using many facilities available in the VDM-SL toolbox.},

ABSTRACT = {Sleep deficiency impacts the quality of life and may have serious health consequences in the long run. Questionnaire-based subjective assessment of sleep deficiency has many limitations. On the other hand, objective assessment of sleep deficiency is challenging. In this study, we propose a polysomnography-based mathematical model for computing baseline sleep deficiency severity score and then investigated the estimation of sleep deficiency severity using features available only from wearable sensor data including heart rate variability and single-channel electroencephalography for a dataset of 500 subjects. We used Monte-Carlo feature selection (MCFS) and inter-dependency discovery for selecting the best features and removing multi-collinearity. For developing the Regression model we investigated both the frequentist and the Bayesian approaches. An artificial neural network achieved the best performance of RMSE = 5.47 and an R-squared value of 0.67 for sleep deficiency severity estimation. The developed method is comparable to conventional methods of Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire and Epworth Sleepiness Scale for assessing the impact of sleep apnea on sleep deficiency. Moreover, the results pave the way for reliable and interpretable sleep deficiency severity estimation using single-channel EEG.},

ABSTRACT = {With advantages such as short and long transmission ranges, D2D communication, low latency, and high node density, the 5G communication standard is a strong contender for smart healthcare. Smart healthcare networks based on 5G are expected to have heterogeneous energy and mobility, requiring them to adapt to the connected environment. As a result, in 5G-based smart healthcare, building a routing protocol that optimizes energy consumption, reduces transmission delay, and extends network lifetime remains a challenge. This paper presents a clustering-based routing protocol to improve the Quality of services (QoS) and energy optimization in 5G-based smart healthcare. QoS and energy optimization are achieved by selecting an energy-efficient clustering head (CH) with the help of game theory (GT) and best multipath route selection with reinforcement learning (RL). The cluster head selection is modeled as a clustering game with a mixed strategy considering various attributes to find equilibrium conditions. The parameters such as distance between nodes, the distance between nodes and base station, the remaining energy and speed of mobility of the nodes were used for cluster head (CH) selection probability. An energy-efficient multipath routing based on reinforcement learning (RL) having (Q-learning) is proposed. The simulation result shows that our proposed clustering-based routing approach improves the QoS and energy optimization compared to existing approaches. The average performances of the proposed schemes CRP-GR and CRP-G are 78% and 71%, respectively, while the existing schemes, such as FBCFP, TEEN and LEACH have average performances of 63%, 48% and 35% accordingly.},

ABSTRACT = {Predicting the travel demand plays an indispensable role in urban transportation planning. Data collection methods for estimating the origin–destination (OD) demand matrix are being extensively shifted from traditional survey techniques to the pre-collected data from intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). This shift is partly due to the high cost of conducting traditional surveys and partly due to the diversity of scattered data produced by ITSs and the opportunity to derive extra benefits out of this big data. This study attempts to predict the OD matrix of Tehran metropolis using a set of ITS data, including the data extracted from automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, smart fare cards, loop detectors at intersections, global positioning systems (GPS) of navigation software, socio-economic and demographic characteristics as well as land-use features of zones. For this purpose, five models based on machine learning (ML) techniques are developed for training and test. In evaluating the performance of the models, the statistical methods show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to the best performance in terms of accuracy in predicting the OD matrix and has the lowest error in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Moreover, the predicted OD matrix was structurally compared with the ground truth matrix, and the CNN model also shows the highest structural similarity with the ground truth OD matrix in the presented case.},

ABSTRACT = {The fast growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its diverse applications increase the risk of cyberattacks, one type of which is malware attacks. Due to the IoT devices’ different capabilities and the dynamic and ever-evolving environment, applying complex security measures is challenging, and applying only basic security standards is risky. Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are intrusion-detecting algorithms inspired by the human body’s adaptive immune system techniques. Most of these algorithms imitate the human’s body B-cell and T-cell defensive mechanisms. They are lightweight, adaptive, and able to detect malware attacks without prior knowledge. In this work, we review the recent advances in employing AIS for the improved detection of malware in IoT networks. We present a critical analysis that highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art in AIS research and offer insights into promising new research directions.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent times, Blockchain has emerged as a transformational technology with the ability to disrupt and evolve multiple domains. As a decentralized, immutable distributed ledger, Blockchain technology is one of the most recent entrants to the comprehensive ideology of Smart Cities. The rise of urbanization and increased citizen participation have led to various technology integrations in our present-day cities. For cities to become smart, we need standard frameworks and procedures for integrating technology, citizens and governments. In this paper, we explore the potential of Blockchain technology as an enabler for e-governance in smart cities. We examine the daily challenges of citizens and compare them with the benefits being offered by Blockchain integration. On the basis of a comprehensive literature review, we identified four key areas of e-governance wherein Blockchain can provide monumental advantages.

ABSTRACT = {In modern years, network edges have been explored by many applications to lower communication and management costs. They are also integrated with the internet of things (IoT) to achieve network design, in terms of scalability and heterogeneous services for multimedia applications. Many proposed solutions are performing a vital role in the development of robust protocols and reducing the response time for critical networks. However, most of them are not able to support the forwarding processes of high multimedia traffic under dynamic characteristics with constraint bandwidth. Moreover, they increase the rate of data loss in an uncertain environment and compromise network performance by increasing delivery delay. Therefore, this paper presents an optimization model with mobile edges for multimedia sensors using artificial intelligence of things, which aims to maintain the process of real-time data collection with low consumption of resources. Moreover, it improves the unpredictability of network communication with the integration of software-defined networks (SDN) and mobile edges. Firstly, it utilizes the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), forming the multi-hop network and guaranteed the primary services for constraints network with stable resources management. Secondly, the SDN performs direct association with mobile edges to support the load balancing for multimedia sensors and centralized the management. Finally, multimedia traffic is heading towards applications in an unchanged form and without negotiating using the sharing of subkeys. The experimental results demonstrated its effectiveness for delivery rate by an average of 35%, processing delay by an average of 29%, network overheads by an average of 41%, packet drop ratio by an average of 39%, and packet retransmission by an average of 34% against existing solutions.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become an inseparable part of our lives. With the growing demand for Smart Applications, it becomes clear that IoT will bring regular automation and intelligent sensing to a new level thus improving quality of life. The core component of the IoT ecosystem is data which exists in various forms and formats. The collected data is then later used to create context awareness and make meaningful decisions. Besides an undoubtedly large number of advantages from the usage of IoT, there exist numerous challenges attributed to the security of objects that cannot be neglected for uninterrupted services. The Mirai botnet attack demonstrated that the IoT system is susceptible to different forms of cyberattacks. While advanced data analytics and Machine Learning have proved efficiency in various applications of cybersecurity, those still have not been explored enough in the literature from the applicability perspective in the domain of resource-constrained IoT. Several architectures and frameworks have been proposed for defining the ways for analyzing the data, yet mostly investigating off-chip analysis. In this contribution, we show how an Artificial Neural Network model can be trained and deployed on trivial IoT nodes for detecting intelligent similarity-based network attacks. This article proposes a concept of the resource-constrained intelligent system as a part of the IoT infrastructure to be able to harden the cybersecurity on microcontrollers. This work will serve as a stepping stone for the application of Artificial Intelligence on devices with limited computing capabilities such as end-point IoT nodes.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, Environmental Sound Recognition (ESR) has become a relevant capability for urban monitoring applications. The techniques for automated sound recognition often rely on machine learning approaches, which have increased in complexity in order to achieve higher accuracy. Nonetheless, such machine learning techniques often have to be deployed on resource and power-constrained embedded devices, which has become a challenge with the adoption of deep learning approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are power efficient and highly suitable for computationally intensive algorithms like CNNs. By fully exploiting their parallel nature, they have the potential to accelerate the inference time as compared to other embedded devices. Similarly, dedicated architectures to accelerate Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) promise to deliver high accuracy while achieving high performance. In this work, we evaluate existing tool flows to deploy CNN models on FPGAs as well as on TPU platforms. We propose and adjust several CNN-based sound classifiers to be embedded on such hardware accelerators. The results demonstrate the maturity of the existing tools and how FPGAs can be exploited to outperform TPUs.},

ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are spatially scattered networks equipped with an extensive number of nodes to check and record different ecological states such as humidity, temperature, pressure, and lightning states. WSN network provides different services to a client such as monitoring, detection, and runtime decision-making against events occurrence. However, the WSN network still has some limitations in computing power, storage resources, and battery life, which make the network is restricted for data transformation. It is due to less supportive battery power, and limited memory of nodes. The integration of WSN and cloud offers an open, adaptable, and more reconfigurable stage for different security checks and regulating requirements. In this paper, we discovered how WSN and cloud computing (CC) are integrated and help to accomplish different goals. Additionally, a comprehensive study about procedures and issues for an effective combination of WSN-CC is presented. This work also presents the work proposed by the research community for WSN-CC. Besides, we explored the integration of WSN/IoT with Fog computing (FC). Based on investigations, WSN integration with Fog computing (FC) has many benefits with respect to latency, energy consumption, data processing, and real-time data streaming. FC is not a substitute for distributed computing, so far it is utilized to improve the productivity of the sensor.},

ABSTRACT = {Given recent scientific advances, coastal flooding events can be properly modelled. Nevertheless, such models are computationally expensive (requiring many hours), which prevents their use for forecasting and warning. In addition, there is a gap between the model outputs and information actually needed by decision makers. The present work aims to develop and test a method capable of forecasting coastal flood information adapted to users’ needs. The method must be robust and fast and must integrate the complexity of coastal flood processes. The explored solution relies on metamodels, i.e., mathematical functions that precisely and efficiently (within minutes) estimate the results that would provide the numerical model. While the principle of relying on metamodel solutions is not new, the originality of the present work is to tackle and validate the entire process from the identification of user needs to the establishment and validation of the rapid forecast and early warning system (FEWS) while relying on numerical modelling, metamodelling, the development of indicators, and information technologies. The development and validation are performed at the study site of Gâvres (France). This site is subject to wave overtopping, so the numerical phase-resolving SWASH model is used to build the learning dataset required for the metamodel setup. Gaussian process- and random forest classifier-based metamodels are used and post-processed to estimate 14 indicators of interest for FEWS users. These metamodelling and post-processing schemes are implemented in an FEWS prototype, which is employed by local users and exhibits good warning skills during the validation period. Based on this experience, we provide recommendations for the improvement and/or application of this methodology and individual steps to other sites.},

ABSTRACT = {The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic still involves many struggles and challenges. The greatest challenge that most governments are currently facing is the lack of a precise, accurate, and automated mechanism for detecting and tracking new COVID-19 cases. In response to this challenge, this study proposes the first blockchain-based system, called the COVID-19 contact tracing system (CCTS), to verify, track, and detect new cases of COVID-19. The proposed system consists of four integrated components: an infection verifier subsystem, a mass surveillance subsystem, a P2P mobile application, and a blockchain platform for managing all transactions between the three subsystem models. To investigate the performance of the proposed system, CCTS has been simulated and tested against a created dataset consisting of 300 confirmed cases and 2539 contacts. Based on the metrics of the confusion matrix (i.e., recall, precision, accuracy, and F1 Score), the detection evaluation results proved that the proposed blockchain-based system achieved an average of accuracy of 75.79% and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.004 in recognizing persons in contact with COVID-19 patients within two different areas of infection covered by GPS. Moreover, the simulation results also demonstrated the success of the proposed system in performing self-estimation of infection probabilities and sending and receiving infection alerts in P2P communications in crowds of people by users. The infection probability results have been calculated using the binomial distribution function technique. This result can be considered unique compared with other similar systems in the literature. The new system could support governments, health authorities, and citizens in making critical decisions regarding infection detection, prediction, tracking, and avoiding the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, the functionality of the proposed CCTS can be adapted to work against any other similar pandemics in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {The two-part series of papers provides a survey on recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach to simulate the human’s natural learning process, whose key is to let the agent learn by interacting with the stochastic environment. The fact that the agent has limited access to the information of the environment enables AI to be applied efficiently in most fields that require self-learning. It’s essential to have an organized investigation—we can make good comparisons and choose the best structures or algorithms when applying DRL in various applications. The first part of the overview introduces Markov Decision Processes (MDP) problems and Reinforcement Learning and applications of DRL for solving POMDP problems in games, robotics, and natural language processing. In part two, we continue to introduce applications in transportation, industries, communications and networking, etc. and discuss the limitations of DRL.},

ABSTRACT = {Automakers manage vast fleets of connected vehicles and face an ever-increasing demand for their sensor readings. This demand originates from many stakeholders, each potentially requiring different sensors from different vehicles. Currently, this demand remains largely unfulfilled due to a lack of systems that can handle such diverse demands efficiently. Vehicles are usually passive participants in data acquisition, each continuously reading and transmitting the same static set of sensors. However, in a multi-tenant setup with diverse data demands, each vehicle potentially needs to provide different data instead. We present a system that performs such vehicle-specific minimization of data acquisition by mapping individual data demands to individual vehicles. We collect personal data only after prior consent and fulfill the requirements of the GDPR. Non-personal data can be collected by directly addressing individual vehicles. The system consists of a software component natively integrated with a major automaker’s vehicle platform and a cloud platform brokering access to acquired data. Sensor readings are either provided via near real-time streaming or as recorded trip files that provide specific consistency guarantees. A performance evaluation with over 200,000 simulated vehicles has shown that our system can increase server capacity on-demand and process streaming data within 269 ms on average during peak load. The resulting architecture can be used by other automakers or operators of large sensor networks. Native vehicle integration is not mandatory; the architecture can also be used with retrofitted hardware such as OBD readers.},

ABSTRACT = {The fundamental issue for Beyond fifth Generation (B5G) is providing a pervasive connection to heterogeneous and various devices in smart environments. Therefore, Drones play a vital role in the B5G, allowing for wireless broadcast and high-speed communications. In addition, the drone offers several advantages compared to fixed terrestrial communications, including flexible deployment, robust Line of Sight (LoS) connections, and more design degrees of freedom due to controlled mobility. Drones can provide reliable and high data rate connectivity to users irrespective of their location. However, atmospheric disturbances impact the signal quality between drones and users and degrade the system performance. Considering practical implementation, the location of drones makes the drone–user communication susceptible to several environmental disturbances. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of drone-user connectivity during atmospheric disturbances. Further, a Machine Learning (ML)-assisted algorithm is proposed to adapt to a modulation technique that offers optimal performance during atmospheric disturbances. The results show that, with the algorithm, the system switches to a lower order modulation scheme during higher rain rate and provides reliable communication with optimized data rate and error performance.},

ABSTRACT = {At present, climate change, pollution, and uncontrolled urbanism threaten not only natural ecosystems, but also the urban environment. Approaches to mitigate these challenges and able to provide an alternative for the use of the space are deemed to be multidisciplinary, combining architecture, vegetation integration, circular economy and information and communications technologies (ICT). University campuses are a key scenario to evaluate such solutions as their student and research community is intrinsically willing to support these experiences and provide a wide knowledge on the fields necessary for their design and implementation. However, the creation of areas combining usability and sustainability is commonly lacking a multidisciplinary approach combining all these different perspectives. Hence, the present work aims to overcome this limitation by the development of a novel integrated approach for campus spaces for co-working and leisure, namely a “Smart Tree”, where novel architecture, furniture design, flora integration, environmental sensoring and communications join together. To this end, a survey of the literature is provided, covering related approaches as well as general principles behind them. From this, the general requirements and constraints for the development of the Smart Tree area are identified, establishing the main interactions between the architecture, greening and ICT perspectives. Such requirements guide the proposed system design and implementation, whose impact on the environment is analyzed. Finally, the research challenges and lessons learned for their development are identified in order to support future works.},

ABSTRACT = {Real-time acquisition and intelligent classification of pole-like street-object point clouds are of great significance in the construction of smart cities. Efficient point cloud processing technology in road scenes can accelerate the development of intelligent transportation and promote the development of high-precision maps. However, available algorithms have the problems of incomplete extraction and the low recognition accuracy of pole-like objects. In this paper, we propose a segmentation method of pole-like objects under geometric structural constraints. As for classification, we fused the classification results at different scales with each other. First, the point cloud data excluding ground point clouds were divided into voxels, and the rod-shaped parts of the pole-like objects were extracted according to the vertical continuity. Second, the regional growth based on the voxel was carried out based on the rod part to retain the non-rod part of the pole-like objects. A one-way double coding strategy was adopted to preserve the details. For spatial overlapping entities, we used multi-rule supervoxels to divide them. Finally, the random forest model was used to classify the pole-like objects based on local- and global-scale features and to fuse the double classification results under the different scales in order to obtain the final result. Experiments showed that the proposed method can effectively extract the pole-like objects of the point clouds in the road scenes, indicating that the method can achieve high-precision classification and identification in the lightweight data. Our method can also bring processing inspiration for large data.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of sensor applications has been steadily increasing, leading to an urgent need for efficient data compression techniques to facilitate the storage, transmission, and processing of digital signals generated by sensors. Unlike other sequential data such as text sequences, sensor signals have more complex statistical characteristics. Specifically, in every signal point, each bit, which corresponds to a specific precision scale, follows its own conditional distribution depending on its history and even other bits. Therefore, applying existing general-purpose data compressors usually leads to a relatively low compression ratio, since these compressors do not fully exploit such internal features. What is worse, partitioning a bit stream into groups with a preset size will sometimes break the integrity of each signal point. In this paper, we present a lossless data compressor dedicated to compressing sensor signals which is built upon a novel recurrent neural architecture named multi-channel recurrent unit (MCRU). Each channel in the proposed MCRU models a specific precision range of each signal point without breaking data integrity. During compressing and decompressing, the mirrored network will be trained on observed data; thus, no pre-training is needed. The superiority of our approach over other compressors is demonstrated experimentally on various types of sensor signals.},

ABSTRACT = {As part of the recent electrification of the transportation industry, internal combustion engines are being coupled with or replaced by electric motors. This movement towards an electrified drivetrain poses new noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) challenges related to electric motors. In this paper, the acoustic signature of an electric motor was analyzed to obtain a better understanding of the sound generated by these motors. This work provides an insight into an acoustic measurement technique that can be used to identify certain frequency bands that significantly contribute to the perceived sound. In the first part, the structural response of the motor was correlated with its acoustic spectra. Furthermore, data from acoustic and structural measurements were used to analyze the order content of the signal and identify critical contributors to the overall perceived sound. The differences between data captured by microphones in different positions around the motor helped to localize components of the overall sound. The results provide some discussion about techniques to decrease the overall sound. The technique described in this paper can be extended to fan-cooled motors that are used in vehicles such as golf carts or as auxiliary motors in electric/hybrid vehicles, as well as across a wide range of industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {New advances in small-scale generation and consumption technologies have shifted conventional buildings’ functionality towards energy-efficient active buildings (ABs). Such developments drew the attention of researchers all around the world, resulting in a variety of publications, including several review papers. This study conducts a systematic literature review so as to analyse the concepts/factors enabling active participation of buildings in the energy networks. To do so, a relatively large number of publications devoted to the subject are identified, introducing the taxonomy of control and optimisation methods for the ABs. Then, a study selection methodology is proposed to nominate potential literature that has investigated the role of ABs in the energy networks. The modelling approaches in enabling flexible ABs are identified, while the potential challenges have been highlighted. Furthermore, the citation network of included papers is illustrated by Gephi software and analysed using “ForceAtlas2” and “Yifan Hu Proportional” algorithms so as to analyse the insights and possibilities for future developments. The survey results provide a clear answer to the research question around the potential flexibility that can be offered by ABs to the energy grids, and highlights possible prospective research plans, serving as a guide to research and industry.},

ABSTRACT = {Food access is a major key component in food security, as it is every individual’s right to proper access to a nutritious and affordable food supply. Low access to healthy food sources influences people’s diet and activity habits. Guilford County in North Carolina has a high ranking in low food security and a high rate of health issues such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to investigate the geospatial correlation between health issues and food access areas. The secondary objective was to quantitatively compare food access areas and heath issues’ descriptive statistics. The tertiary objective was to compare several machine learning techniques and find the best model that fit health issues against various food access variables with the highest performance accuracy. In this study, we adopted a food-access perspective to show that communities that have residents who have equitable access to healthy food options are typically less vulnerable to health-related disasters. We propose a methodology to help policymakers lower the number of health issues in Guilford County by analyzing such issues via correlation with respect to food access. Specifically, we conducted a geographic information system mapping methodology to examine how access to healthy food options influenced health and mortality outcomes in one of the largest counties in the state of North Carolina. We created geospatial maps representing food deserts—areas with scarce access to nutritious food; food swamps—areas with more availability of unhealthy food options compared to healthy food options; and food oases—areas with a relatively higher availability of healthy food options than unhealthy options. Our results presented a positive correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.819 among obesity and the independent variables of transportation access, and population. The correlation coefficient matrix analysis helped to identify a strong negative correlation between obesity and median income. Overall, this study offers valuable insights that can help health authorities develop preemptive preparedness for healthcare disasters.},

ABSTRACT = {This research sheds light on the relationship between the presence of location-based social network (LBSN) data and other economic and demographic variables in the city of Valencia (Spain). For that purpose, a comparison is made between location patterns of geolocated data from various social networks (i.e., Google Places, Foursquare, Twitter, Airbnb and Idealista) and statistical information such as land value, average gross income, and population distribution by age range. The main findings show that there is no direct relationship between land value or age of registered population and the amount of social network data generated in a given area. However, a noteworthy coincidence was observed between Google Places data-clustering patterns, which represent the offer of economic activities, and the spatial concentration of the other LBSNs analyzed, suggesting that data from these sources are mostly generated in areas with a high density of economic activities.},

ABSTRACT = {The deteriorating housing situation of young adults in many countries has become a subject of global interest. Researchers point to a number of factors that influence young adults’ decisions to own or rent a home. This paper examines the relationship between young adults’ inclination to own their own home and a range of different socio-economic factors. The study is of a quantitative-qualitative nature and was based on the results of a computer-assisted web interview (CAWI) questionnaire. The survey was conducted among young Poles aged 18–45 (n = 983). To analyse the results of the questionnaires, a logistic regression was used in which 24 different dichotomous and categorical variables were considered. Taking into account a number of individual characteristics (e.g., gender, education, hometown population size, etc.), the results show, for example, that single individuals and those with a higher level of tolerance for mortgage interest rates are more likely to own a home than to rent. This result highlights the desirability of easier access to mortgage credit. At the other end of the spectrum are those living with parents and those with dependents. The results imply that they are less interested in buying a home. Interestingly, declarations of a lack of funds for an own contribution when buying a new house/dwelling, or reluctance to expose oneself to financial difficulties throughout one’s life, do not discourage young adults from striving for their own dwelling, which further demonstrates the need to create appropriate mechanisms/instruments to facilitate the purchase of a dwelling for young adults.},

ABSTRACT = {Empowered by the emergence of novel information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as sensors and high-performance digital communication systems, Europe has adapted its electricity distribution network into a modern infrastructure known as a smart grid (SG). The benefits of this new infrastructure include precise and real-time capacity for measuring and monitoring the different energy-relevant parameters on the various points of the grid and for the remote operation and optimization of distribution. Furthermore, a new user profile is derived from this novel infrastructure, known as a prosumer (a user that can produce and consume energy to/from the grid), who can benefit from the features derived from applying advanced analytics and semantic technologies in the rich amount of big data generated by the different subsystems. However, this novel, highly interconnected infrastructure also presents some significant drawbacks, like those related to information security (IS). We provide a systematic literature survey of the ICT-empowered environments that comprise SGs and homes, and the application of modern artificial intelligence (AI) related technologies with sensor fusion systems and actuators, ensuring energy efficiency in such systems. Furthermore, we outline the current challenges and outlook for this field. These address new developments on microgrids, and data-driven energy efficiency that leads to better knowledge representation and decision-making for smart homes and SGs.},

ABSTRACT = {Air pollution has become the most important issue concerning human evolution in the last century, as the levels of toxic gases and particles present in the air create health problems and affect the ecosystems of the planet. Scientists and environmental organizations have been looking for new ways to combat and control the air pollution, developing new solutions as technologies evolves. In the last decade, devices able to observe and maintain pollution levels have become more accessible and less expensive, and with the appearance of the Internet of Things (IoT), new approaches for combating pollution were born. The focus of the research presented in this paper was predicting behaviours regarding the air quality index using machine learning. Data were collected from one of the six atmospheric stations set in relevant areas of Bucharest, Romania, to validate our model. Several algorithms were proposed to study the evolution of temperature depending on the level of pollution and on several pollution factors. In the end, the results generated by the algorithms are presented considering the types of pollutants for two distinct periods. Prediction errors were highlighted by the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for each of the three machine learning algorithms used.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the limitations of data transfer technologies, existing studies on urban traffic control mainly focused on isolated dimension control such as traffic signal control or vehicle route guidance to alleviate traffic congestion. However, in real traffic, the distribution of traffic flow is the result of multiple dimensions whose future state is influenced by each dimension’s decisions. Presently, the development of the Internet of Vehicles enables an integrated intelligent transportation system. This paper proposes an integrated intelligent transportation model that can optimize predictive traffic signal control and predictive vehicle route guidance simultaneously to alleviate traffic congestion based on their feedback regulation relationship. The challenges of this model lie in that the formulation of the nonlinear feedback relationship between various dimensions is hard to describe and the design of a corresponding solving algorithm that can obtain Pareto optimality for multi-dimension control is complex. In the integrated model, we introduce two medium variables—predictive traffic flow and the predictive waiting time—to two-way link the traffic signal control and vehicle route guidance. Inspired by game theory, an asymmetric information exchange framework-based updating distributed algorithm is designed to solve the integrated model. Finally, an experimental study in two typical traffic scenarios shows that more than 73.33% of the considered cases adopting the integrated model achieve Pareto optimality.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring the progress on a construction site during the construction phase is crucial. An inadequate understanding of the project status can lead to mistakes and inappropriate actions, causing delays and increased costs. Monitoring and controlling projects via digital tools would reduce the risk of error and enable timely corrective actions. Although there is currently a wide range of technologies for these purposes, these technologies and interoperability between them are still limited. Because of this, it is important to know the possibilities of integration and interoperability regarding their implementation. This article presents a bibliographic synthesis and interpretation of 30 nonconventional digital tools for monitoring progress in terms of field data capture technologies (FDCT) and communication and collaborative technologies (CT) that are responsible for information processing and management. This research aims to perform an integration and interoperability analysis of technologies to demonstrate their potential for monitoring and controlling construction projects during the execution phase. A network analysis was conducted, and the results suggest that the triad formed by building information modeling (BIM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and photogrammetry is an effective tool; the use of this set extends not only to monitoring and control, but also to all phases of a project.},

ABSTRACT = {The elderly are the most predicted users for smart home technology in the United Arab Emirates and the population over 65 is expected to increase to 24.3% by 2030. Despite the rapid development of smart home technology, research has been mainly focused on technology development. To encourage conservative elderly users, however, smart home technology should be implemented for UAE elderly users to accept and integrate it into their daily lives. The objective of this paper is to analyze the preferences and needs of smart home technologies to understand the behaviors of UAE elderly users, and the factors affecting the acceptance of technology. As a methodology, a survey and interview were conducted for 110 people in their 40s and 60s and a total of 105 valid survey responses were collected and used as data for frequency, mean, cross-analysis, independent sample t-test, one-way variance analysis, and multiple regression analysis with IBM SPSS statistics 27. The results showed that 67.0% of UAE elderly users have chronic diseases such as high blood pressure (16.2%), heart disease (3.8%), diabetes (32.4%), or arthritis (10.5%). Therefore, smart home technology for health management is inevitable to improve overall lifestyles. It was statistically proven that UAE elderly users want automatic fall detection in the living room (39.0%) and bedroom (25.7%). Lifestyle monitoring in living room (44.7%) and bedroom (18.1%); the elderly preferred living room most for daily life assistance (36.2%), environmental control (50.5%), health and biometric monitoring (49.5%), and video conferencing (82.9%). In the case of sensors, elderly preferred the switch at the entrance (36.2%), and motion detecting sensors (42.9%), video cameras (56.2%), and voice recognition (50.5%) sensors in the living room. However, UAE elderly users do not think smart home technology can protect their privacy. It is found that age group and computer technology affinity are the most influential variables and UAE elderly users have an anxiety about technology, which influenced the acceptance of smart home technology.},

ABSTRACT = {For public safety and physical security, currently more than a billion closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are in use around the world. Proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine/deep learning (M/DL) technologies have gained significant applications including crowd surveillance. The state-of-the-art distance and area estimation algorithms either need multiple cameras or a reference object as a ground truth. It is an open question to obtain an estimation using a single camera without a scale reference. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called E-SEC, which estimates interpersonal distance between a pair of dynamic human objects, area occupied by a dynamic crowd, and density using a single edge camera. The E-SEC framework comprises edge CCTV cameras responsible for capturing a crowd on video frames leveraging a customized YOLOv3 model for human detection. E-SEC contributes an interpersonal distance estimation algorithm vital for monitoring the social distancing of a crowd, and an area estimation algorithm for dynamically determining an area occupied by a crowd with changing size and position. A unified output module generates the crowd size, interpersonal distances, social distancing violations, area, and density per every frame. Experimental results validate the accuracy and efficiency of E-SEC with a range of different video datasets.},

ABSTRACT = {The European building industry is facing a strong increase in renovation processes, which are still non-cost-effective, involve unproperly coordinated stakeholders, are disturbing for the occupants, and cause important inefficiencies in the overall renovation process. In this context, digitalization and Building Information Modelling (BIM), as an enabler, is the key solution that may drive renovation interventions to ensure a more successful and leaner process, aiding the whole value chain of actors to achieve its full potential. This research describes the OpenBIM methodology applied in order to transform the implicit knowledge from the stakeholders involved in the building renovation process, not structured enough for automation, into an OpenBIM digital process based on the BIM standards. The outcomes of this research are the OpenBIM ready workflows that represent the renovation process and information requirements according to the involvement of different stakeholders rooted in the analysis of barriers, requirements, and needs. Those workflows are the basis for the future development of specific products and tools for boosting digitalization and interoperability in the renovation process.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite the promise of AI and IoT, the efforts of many organizations at scaling smart city initiatives fall short. Organizations often start by exploring the potential with a proof-of-concept and a pilot project, with the process later grinding to a halt for various reasons. Pilot purgatory, in which organizations invest in small-scale implementations without them realizing substantial benefits, is given very little attention in the scientific literature relating to the question of why AI and IoT initiatives fail to scale up for smart cities. By combining extensive study of the literature and expert interviews, this research explores the underlying reasons why many smart city initiatives relying on Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) fail to scale up. The findings suggest that a multitude of factors may leave organizations ill prepared for smart city AIoT solutions, and that these tend to multiply when cities lack much-needed resources and capabilities. Yet many organizations tend to overlook the fact that such initiatives require them to pay attention to all aspects of change: strategy, data, people and organization, process, and technology. Furthermore, the research reveals that some factors tend to be more influential in certain stages. Strategic factors tend to be more prominent in the earlier stages, whereas factors relating to people and the organization tend to feature later when organizations roll out solutions. The study also puts forward potential strategies that companies can employ to scale up successfully. Three main strategic themes emerge from the study: proof-of-value, rather than proof-of-concept; treating and managing data as a key asset; and commitment at all levels.},

ABSTRACT = {There is a tendency, during the last years, to migrate from the traditional homogeneous clouds and centralized provisioning of resources to heterogeneous clouds with specialized hardware governed in a distributed and autonomous manner. The CloudLightning architecture proposed recently introduced a dynamic way to provision heterogeneous cloud resources, by shifting the selection of underlying resources from the end-user to the system in an efficient way. In this work, an optimized Suitability Index and assessment function are proposed, along with their theoretical analysis, for improving the computational efficiency, energy consumption, service delivery and scalability of the distributed orchestration. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is being evaluated with the use of simulation, by comparing the optimized methods with the original approach and the traditional centralized resource management, on real and synthetic High Performance Computing applications. Finally, numerical results are presented and discussed regarding the improvements over the defined evaluation criteria.},

ABSTRACT = {Mechanical damages of sugar beet during harvesting affects the quality of the final products and sugar yield. The mechanical damage of sugar beet is assessed randomly by operators of harvesters and can depend on the subjective opinion and experience of the operator due to the complexity of the harvester machines. Thus, the main aim of this study was to determine whether a digital two-dimensional imaging system coupled with convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques could be utilized to detect visible mechanical damage in sugar beet during harvesting in a harvester machine. In this research, various detector models based on the CNN, including You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4, region-based fully convolutional network (R-FCN) and faster regions with convolutional neural network features (Faster R-CNN) were developed. Sugar beet image data during harvesting from a harvester in different farming conditions were used for training and validation of the proposed models. The experimental results showed that the YOLO v4 CSPDarknet53 method was able to detect damage in sugar beet with better performance (recall, precision and F1-score of about 92, 94 and 93%, respectively) and higher speed (around 29 frames per second) compared to the other developed CNNs. By means of a CNN-based vision system, it was possible to automatically detect sugar beet damage within the sugar beet harvester machine.},

ABSTRACT = {There is a significant interest in facial emotion recognition in the fields of human–computer interaction and social sciences. With the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the field of human behavioral prediction and analysis, especially human emotion, has evolved significantly. The most standard methods of emotion recognition are currently being used in models deployed in remote servers. We believe the reduction in the distance between the input device and the server model can lead us to better efficiency and effectiveness in real life applications. For the same purpose, computational methodologies such as edge computing can be beneficial. It can also encourage time-critical applications that can be implemented in sensitive fields. In this study, we propose a Raspberry-Pi based standalone edge device that can detect real-time facial emotions. Although this edge device can be used in variety of applications where human facial emotions play an important role, this article is mainly crafted using a dataset of employees working in organizations. A Raspberry-Pi-based standalone edge device has been implemented using the Mini-Xception Deep Network because of its computational efficiency in a shorter time compared to other networks. This device has achieved 100% accuracy for detecting faces in real time with 68% accuracy, i.e., higher than the accuracy mentioned in the state-of-the-art with the FER 2013 dataset. Future work will implement a deep network on Raspberry-Pi with an Intel Movidious neural compute stick to reduce the processing time and achieve quick real time implementation of the facial emotion recognition system.},

ABSTRACT = {The Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is the main driving force behind smart manufacturing, industrial automation, and industry 4.0. Conversely, industrial IoT as the evolving technological paradigm is also becoming a compelling target for cyber adversaries. Particularly, advanced persistent threats (APT) and especially botnets are the foremost promising and potential attacks that may throw the complete industrial IoT network into chaos. IIoT-enabled botnets are highly scalable, technologically diverse, and highly resilient to classical and conventional detection mechanisms. Subsequently, we propose a deep learning (DL)-enabled novel hybrid architecture that can efficiently and timely tackle distributed, multivariant, lethal botnet attacks in industrial IoT. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated on a current state-of-the-art, publicly available dataset using standard performance evaluation metrics. Moreover, our proposed technique has been precisely verified with our constructed hybrid DL-enabled architectures and current benchmark DL algorithms. Our devised mechanism shows promising results in terms of high detection accuracy with a trivial trade-off in speed efficiency, assuring the proposed scheme as an optimal and legitimate cyber defense in prevalent IIoTs. Besides, we have cross-validated our results to show utterly unbiased performance.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents a study of the attitude of metropolis residents to the environmental development of the urban public transport system. The authors set a goal to assess the influence of values on the assessment of environmental initiatives of city authorities in the field of public transport and their attitude to innovations in this sphere. In the course of the study, four clusters reflecting the values of the respondents were identified. The results showed support for innovations that do not require changes in the transport behavior of the individual. At the same time, we observe differences in the perception of initiatives by representatives of different clusters when the innovation affects their transportation behavior. Hypotheses were tested as an analysis result of empirical data by determining the synthetic indices of values using factor analysis, the classification of respondents based on the obtained indices to identify groups with similar values using cluster analysis, and an analysis of the relationship of the classification results by values using contingency tables and chi-square criterion. The scientific novelty of the study is to assess the impact of values of metropolis residents on the perception of environmental conditions and their change in the city.},

ABSTRACT = {Big Data, the Internet of Things, and robotic and augmented realities are just some of the technologies that belong to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions and increase productivity and the quality of industry production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. A new perspective is oriented towards social well-being and it is called Society 5.0. Industry 4.0 supports the transition to the new society, but other drivers are also needed. To guide the transition, it is necessary to identify the enabling factors that integrate Industry 4.0. A conceptual framework was developed in which these factors were identified through a literature review and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. Furthermore, the way in which they relate was evaluated with the help of the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The proposed framework fills a research gap, which has not yet consolidated a strategy that includes all aspects of Society 5.0. As a result, the main driver, in addition to technology, is international politics.},

ABSTRACT = {The public sector is facing significant challenges regarding public services provision, including declination of users&rsquo; trust and limited resources. An alternative approach to traditional public service provision with the potential to address these challenges is the co-creation of public services. Co-creation promises to foster innovative solutions to provide high-quality services that respond to users&rsquo; needs. Considering this background, we aim at critically exploring public service co-creation via a scoping review, employing the PRISMA-ScR method. Our review focuses on 25 empirical studies out of 75 analyzed articles that examine the implementation of co-creation of (digital) public services and investigates how the empirical literature portrays the concept of public service co-creation. Our findings primarily suggest that co-creation can be implemented in a wide range of sectors and settings, to improve public services and to foster innovation, throughout the whole public service cycle, using a variety of digital, analog and hybrid co-creation tools and strategies. Yet, our review has also shown that there is still an implementation gap that needs to be bridged between knowing and doing in the context of public services co-creation in a digital setting.},

ABSTRACT = {The urban functional area is critical to an understanding of the complex urban system, resource allocation, and management. However, due to urban surveys’ focus on geographic objects and the mixture of urban space, it is difficult to obtain such information. The function of a place is determined by the activities that take place there. This study employed mobile phone signaling data to extract temporal features of human activities through discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Combined with the features extracted from the point of interest (POI) data and Sentinel images, the urban functional areas of Changchun City were identified using a random forest (RF) model. The results indicate that integrating features derived from remote sensing and social sensing data can effectively improve the identification accuracy and that features derived from dynamic mobile phone signaling have a higher identification accuracy than those derived from POI data. The human activity characteristics on weekends are more distinguishable for different functional areas than those on weekdays. The identified urban functional layout of Changchun is consistent with the actual situation. The residential functional area has the highest proportion, accounting for 33.51%, and is mainly distributed in the central area, while the industrial functional area and green-space are distributed around.},

ABSTRACT = {Blockchain technology is emerging as a plausible disruptor of waste management practices that influence the governance of plastics. The interest among the waste management community in the potential and fundamental changes to complex resource management associated with blockchain adoption parallels recent research in other sectors, such as finance, health, public administration, etc. During any comparable period characterized by a step-change in positive coverage of an early-stage technology, it can be challenging for actors to access a grounded, evidence-based oversight of the current state of practice and make informed decisions about whether or how to adopt blockchain technology. The current absence of such a systematic overview of recent experiences with blockchain initiatives disrupting waste practices not only limits the visibility of these experimental efforts, but also limits the learning that can be shared across waste plastics researcher and practitioner communities. This paper contributes with a current overview of blockchain technology adoption in the waste management sector, giving particular attention to implications for the governance of plastics. Our study draws on both primary interview data and secondary documentation data to map the landscape of current blockchain initiatives in the global waste sector. We identify four areas of blockchain use that are beginning to change waste management practices (payment, recycling and reuse rewards, monitoring and tracking of waste, and smart contracts). We conclude by outlining five areas of significant blockchain uses, implications, and influences of relevance to the development of circular plastic waste governance in both research and practice.},

ABSTRACT = {The expansion of electric vehicles made the expansion of charging infrastructure rudimentary to keep up with this developing technology that helps people in a myriad of ways. The main drawback in electric vehicle charging, however, is the time consumed to charge a vehicle. The fast charging of electric vehicles solves this problem thus making it a lucrative technology for consumers. However, the fast charging technology is not without its limitations. In this paper we have identified the technology gaps in EV fast charging stations mostly focused on the extremely fast charging topology. It will help pave a path for researchers to direct their effort in a consolidated manner to contribute to the fast charging infrastructure. A thorough review of all aspects and limitations of existing extremely fast charging (XFC) stations have been identified and supporting data are provided. The importance of DC power network based on free fuel energy sources and silicon carbide-based power electronics are proposed to provide ultra-low cost and ultra-high speed XFC stations.},

ABSTRACT = {In the transportation sector, electric battery bus (EBB) deployment is considered to be a potential solution to reduce global warming because no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are directly produced by EBBs. In addition to the required charging infrastructure, estimating the energy consumption of buses has become a crucial precondition for the deployment and planning of electric bus fleets. Policy and decision-makers may not have the specific tools needed to estimate the energy consumption of a particular bus network. Therefore, many state-of-the-art studies have proposed models to determine the energy demand of electric buses. However, these studies have not critically reviewed, classified and discussed the challenges of the approaches that are applied to estimate EBBs’ energy demands. Thus, this manuscript provides a detailed review of the forecasting models used to estimate the energy consumption of EBBs. Furthermore, this work fills the gap by classifying the models for estimating EBBs’ energy consumption into small-town depot and big-city depot networks. In brief, this review explains and discusses the models and formulations of networks associated with well-to-wheel (WTW) assessment, which can determine the total energy demand of a bus network. This work also reviews a survey of the most recent optimization methods that could be applied to achieve the optimal pattern parameters of EBB fleet systems, such as the bus battery capacity, charger rated power and the total number of installed chargers in the charging station. This paper highlights the issues and challenges, such as the impact of external factors, replicating real-world data, big data analytics, validity index, and bus routes’ topography, with recommendations on each issue. Also, the paper proposes a generic framework based on optimization algorithms, namely, artificial neural network (ANN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), which will be significant for future development in implementing new energy consumption estimation approaches. Finally, the main findings of this manuscript further our understanding of the determinants that contribute to managing the energy demand of EBBs networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart seaside cities can fully exploit the capabilities brought by Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of city services in traditional smart city applications: smart home, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart surveillance, smart environment, cyber security, etc. However, smart coastal cities are characterized by their specific application domain, namely, beach monitoring. Beach attendance prediction is a beach monitoring application of particular importance for coastal managers to successfully plan beach services in terms of security, rescue, health and environmental assistance. In this paper, an experimental study that uses IoT data and deep learning to predict the number of beach visitors at Castelldefels beach (Barcelona, Spain) was developed. Images of Castelldefels beach were captured by a video monitoring system. An image recognition software was used to estimate beach attendance. A deep learning algorithm (deep neural network) to predict beach attendance was developed. The experimental results prove the feasibility of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for beach attendance prediction. For each beach, a classification of occupancy was estimated, depending on the number of beach visitors. The proposed model outperforms other machine learning models (decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest) and can successfully classify seven beach occupancy levels with the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of 0.03, 92.7%, 92.9%, 92.7%, and 92.7%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Forests play a fundamental role in preserving the environment and fighting global warming. Unfortunately, they are continuously reduced by human interventions such as deforestation, fires, etc. This paper proposes and evaluates a framework for automatically detecting illegal tree-cutting activity in forests through audio event classification. We envisage ultra-low-power tiny devices, embedding edge-computing microcontrollers and long-range wireless communication to cover vast areas in the forest. To reduce the energy footprint and resource consumption for effective and pervasive detection of illegal tree cutting, an efficient and accurate audio classification solution based on convolutional neural networks is proposed, designed specifically for resource-constrained wireless edge devices. With respect to previous works, the proposed system allows for recognizing a wider range of threats related to deforestation through a distributed and pervasive edge-computing technique. Different pre-processing techniques have been evaluated, focusing on a trade-off between classification accuracy with respect to computational resources, memory, and energy footprint. Furthermore, experimental long-range communication tests have been conducted in real environments. Data obtained from the experimental results show that the proposed solution can detect and notify tree-cutting events for efficient and cost-effective forest monitoring through smart IoT, with an accuracy of 85%.},

ABSTRACT = {Medium-term electricity consumption and load forecasting in smart grids is an attractive topic of study, especially using innovative data analysis approaches for future energy consumption trends. Loss of electricity during generation and use is also a problem to be addressed. Both consumers and utilities can benefit from a predictive study of electricity demand and pricing. In this study, we used a new machine learning approach called AdaBoost to identify key features from an ISO-NE dataset that includes daily consumption data over eight years. Moreover, the DT classifier and RF are widely used to extract the best features from the dataset. Moreover, we predicted the electricity load and price using machine learning techniques including support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning techniques such as a convolutional neural network (CNN). Coronavirus herd immunity optimization (CHIO), a novel optimization approach, was used to modify the hyperparameters to increase efficiency, and it used classifiers to improve the performance of our classifier. By adding additional layers to the CNN and fine-tuning its parameters, the probability of overfitting the classifier was reduced. For method validation, we compared our proposed models with several benchmarks. MAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE, the f1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy were the measures used for performance evaluation. Moreover, seven different forms of statistical analysis were given to show why our proposed approaches are preferable. The proposed CNN-CHIO and SVM techniques had the lowest MAPE error rates of 6% and 8%, respectively, and the highest accuracy rates of 95% and 92%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Price forecasting (PF) is the primary concern in distributed power generation. This paper presents a novel and improved technique to forecast electricity prices. The data of various power producers, Capacity Purchase Price (CPP), Power Purchase Price (PPP), Tariff rates, and load demand from National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) are considered for MAPE reduction in PF. Eight time-series and auto-regression algorithms are developed for data fetching and setting the objective function. The feed-forward ANFIS based on the ML approach and space vector regression (SVR) is introduced to PF by taking the input from time series and auto-regression (AR) algorithms. Best-feature selection is conducted by adopting the Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA)-Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach that ultimately minimizes the complexity and computational time of the model. The proposed integration strategy computes the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the overall improvement percentage is 9.24%, which is valuable in price forecasting of the energy management system (EMS). In the end, EMS based on the Firefly algorithm (FA) has been presented, and by implementing FA, the cost of electricity has been reduced by 21%, 19%, and 20% for building 1, 2, and 3, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Traffic density around the globe is increasing on a day-to-day basis, resulting in more accidents, congestion, and pollution. The dynamic vehicular environment induces challenges in designing an efficient and reliable protocol for communication. Timely delivery of safety and non-safety messages is necessary for traffic congestion control and for avoiding road mishaps. For efficient resource sharing and optimized channel utilization, the media access control (MAC) protocol plays a vital role. An efficient MAC protocol design can provide fair channel access and can delay constraint safety message dissemination, improving road safety. This paper reviews the applications, characteristics, and challenges faced in the design of MAC protocols. A classification of the MAC protocol is presented based on contention mechanisms and channel access. The classification based on contention is oriented as contention-based, contention-free, and hybrid, whereas the classification based on channel access is categorized as distributed, centralized, cluster-based, cooperative, token-based, and random access. These are further sub-classified as single-channel and multi-channel, based on the type of channel resources they utilize. This paper gives an analysis of the objectives, mechanisms, advantages/disadvantages, and simulators used in specified protocols. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on the future scope and open challenges for improving the MAC protocol design.},

Therefore, there was a need for their development or even redesign and redefinition. One of the issues that undoubtedly has a huge impact on the current shape of the global network and the way information is processed in it is the issue of traffic balancing, especially the one in the server infrastructure related to the WWW service, providing users with the possibility of efficient and reliable web browsing. The paper presents a comparative analysis of selected open-source solutions used for traffic balancing in server infrastructures providing WWW service based on selected criteria. The designed architecture of the test environment and the test results of selected tools implementing the traffic-balancing functionality are presented. Methodologies, test plans, and comparison criteria are proposed. A comparative analysis of results based on specific criteria was performed. The balance between network traffic optimization and load balancing distribution among servers is crucial for the development of energy-efficient data processing centers.},

ABSTRACT = {The cross-border movement of capital has suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic since December 2019. Nevertheless, it is unrealistic for multinational companies to withdraw giant global value chains (GVCs) overnight because of the pandemic. Instead, active discussions and achievements of deals in cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) are expected in the post-COVID-19 era among various other market entry modes, considering the growing demand in high technologies in societies. This paper analyzes particular determinants of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) during the pandemic year (2020) based on cross-sectional datasets by employing quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models. According to the empirical evidence, COVID-19 indices do not hamper M&amp;A deals in general. This indicates that managerial capabilities of the coronavirus, not the outbreak itself, determined locational decisions of M&amp;A deals during the pandemic. In this vein, it is expected that the vaccination rate will become a key factor of locational decision for M&amp;A deals in the near future. Furthermore, countries that have been outstanding in coping with COVID-19 and thus serve as a good example for other nations may seize more opportunities to take a leap forward. In addition, as hypothesized, the results present positive and significant associations with M&amp;A deals and the SDG index, confirming the resource-based theory of internationalization. In particular, the achievement of SDGs seems to exercise much influence in developing countries for M&amp;A bidders during the pandemic year. This indicates that the pandemic demands a new zeitgeist that pursues growth while resolving existing but disregarded environmental issues and cherishes humanitarian values, for all countries, non-exceptionally, standing at the start line of the post-COVID-19 era.},

ABSTRACT = {Despite the significance and growth of wind energy as a major source of renewable energy, research on the risks of wind turbines in the form of accidents and failures has attracted limited attention. Research that applies data analytics methodologically in this context is scarce. The research presented here, upon construction of a text corpus of 721 selected wind turbine accident and failure news reports, develops and applies a custom-developed data analytics framework that integrates tabular analysis, visualization, text mining, and machine learning. Topic modeling was applied for the first time to identify and classify recurring themes in wind turbine accident news, and association mining was applied to identify contextual terms associated with death and injury. The tabular and visual analyses relate accidents to location (offshore vs. onshore), wind turbine life cycle phases (transportation, construction, operation, and maintenance), and the incidence of death and injury. As one of the insights, more incidents were found to occur during operation and transportation. Through topic modeling, topics associated most with deaths and injuries were revealed. The results could benefit wind turbine manufacturers, service providers, energy companies, insurance companies, government bodies, non-profit organizations, researchers, and other stakeholders in the wind energy sector.},

ABSTRACT = {The fundamental notion of ‘smart’ in building materials discourse is responsiveness—the ability of materials to react to environmental stimuli by manifesting a noticeable physical change when there is a difference in the conditions of their immediate surroundings. This notion, however, is also interchanged with ‘intelligence’, which involves an array of control protocols. Notwithstanding, both notions are used synonymously and as occupant comfort and energy efficiency strategies in buildings. The current study aimed to underscore the fundamental issues in the conceptualization of both notions in building materials colloquy by systematic review of published literature following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist. The review revealed that while smart responses are direct, predictable and reversible, requiring no external control system, computer systems and networks which require a constant supply of energy are essential for intelligence. In fact, the relationship between intelligent systems, energy efficiency and occupant comfort depends on external computer control and machine components of learning, resulting in complex systems with longer payback times, whereas smart materials and systems respond directly and immediately without additional energy or occupant control. The discussions present an attempt towards promoting zero additional energy demand for buildings using smart materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks are used to monitor the operating status of the microgrids, which can effectively improve the stability of power supplies. The topology control is a critical issue of wireless sensor networks, which affects monitoring data transmission reliability and lifetime of wireless sensor networks. Meanwhile, the data acquisition accuracy of wireless sensor networks has a great impact on the quality of monitoring. Therefore, this paper focuses on improving wireless sensor networks data acquisition satisfaction and energy efficiency. A joint acquisition time design and sensor association optimization algorithm is proposed to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks and enhance the stability of monitoring, which considers the cluster heads selection, data collection satisfaction and sensor association. First, a multi-constrained mixed-integer programming problem, which combines acquisition time design and sensor association, is formulated to maximize data acquisition satisfaction and minimize energy consumption. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent technology. In each iteration, the acquisition time is obtained by Lagrangian duality. After that, the sensor association is modeled as a 0–1 knapsack problem, and the three different methods are proposed to solve it. Finally, the simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm proposed in this paper.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a secure blockchain-aware framework for distributed data management and monitoring. Indeed, images-based data are captured through drones and transmitted to the fog nodes. The main objective here is to enable process and schedule, to investigate individual captured entity (records) and to analyze changes in the blockchain storage with a secure hash-encrypted (SH-256) consortium peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The proposed blockchain mechanism is also investigated for analyzing the fog-cloud-based stored information, which is referred to as smart contracts. These contracts are designed and deployed to automate the overall distributed monitoring system. They include the registration of UAVs (drones), the day-to-day dynamic captured drone-based images, and the update transactions in the immutable storage for future investigations. The simulation results show the merit of our framework. Indeed, through extensive experiments, the developed system provides good performances regarding monitoring and management tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {To accurately predict the economic development of each industry in different types of regions, a deep convolutional neural network model was designed for predicting the annual GDP; GDP growth index; and primary, secondary and tertiary industry growth values of each. In the model, raw industrial data are preprocessed by a normalization operation and subsequently transformed by the BoxCox method to approach the normal distribution. Panel data of consecutive years are constructed and used as input to the deep convolutional neural network, and industrial data of year t + 1 are used as the output of the network. Simulation experiments were conducted to analyze 23 years of industrial economic data from 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China. The experimental results show that R-squared value is larger than 0.91 for all 31 provinces and root mean squared log errors (RMSLE) of all regions are less than 0.1, which demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high prediction accuracy with generalization capability and can accurately predict the economic growth trends of different types of regions.},

ABSTRACT = {Blockchain technology has been recognized as a promising solution to enhance the security and privacy of Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing scenarios. Taking advantage of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol, which solves a computation intensive hashing puzzle, Blockchain ensures the security of the system by establishing a digital ledger. However, the computation intensive PoW favors members possessing more computing power. In the IoT paradigm, fairness in the highly heterogeneous network edge environments must consider devices with various constraints on computation power. Inspired by the advanced features of Digital Twins (DT), an emerging concept that mirrors the lifespan and operational characteristics of physical objects, we propose a novel Miner Twins (MinT) architecture to enable a fair PoW consensus mechanism for blockchains in IoT environments. MinT adopts an edge-fog-cloud hierarchy. All physical miners of the blockchain are deployed as microservices on distributed edge devices, while fog/cloud servers maintain digital twins that periodically update miners’ running status. By timely monitoring of a miner’s footprint that is mirrored by twins, a lightweight Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)-based detection achieves the identification of individual misbehaved miners that violate fair mining. Moreover, we also design a novel Proof-of-Behavior (PoB) consensus algorithm to detect dishonest miners that collude to control a fair mining network. A preliminary study is conducted on a proof-of-concept prototype implementation, and experimental evaluation shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed MinT scheme under a distributed byzantine network environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Available digital maps of indoor environments are limited to a description of the geometrical environment, despite there being an urgent need for more accurate information, particularly data about the electromagnetic (EM) properties of the materials used for walls. Such data would enable new possibilities in the design and optimization of wireless networks and the development of new radio services. In this paper, we introduce, formalize, and evaluate a framework for machine learning (ML) based wireless sensing of indoor surface materials in the form of EM properties. We apply the radio-environment (RE) signatures of the wireless link, which inherently contains environmental information due to the interaction of the radio waves with the environment. We specify the content of the RE signature suitable for surface-material classification as a set of multipath components given by the received power, delay, phase shift, and angle of arrival. The proposed framework applies an ML approach to construct a classification model using RE signatures labeled with the environmental information. The ML method exploits the data obtained from measurements or simulations. The performance of the framework in different scenarios is evaluated based on standard ML performance metrics, such as classification accuracy and F-score. The results of the elementary case prove that the proposed approach can be applied for the classification of the surface material for a plain environment, and can be further extended for the classification of wall materials in more complex indoor environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, 5G networks have emerged as a new technology that can control the advancement of telecommunication networks and transportation systems. Furthermore, 5G networks provide better network performance while reducing network traffic and complexity compared to current networks. Machine-learning techniques (ML) will help symmetric IoT applications become a significant new data source in the future. Symmetry is a widely studied pattern in various research areas, especially in wireless network traffic. The study of symmetric and asymmetric faults and outliers (anomalies) in network traffic is an important topic. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) is an advanced approach in challenging wireless networks such as network management and optimization, anomaly detection, predictive analysis, lifetime value prediction, etc. However, its performance depends on the efficiency of training samples. DL is designed to work with large datasets and uses complex algorithms to train the model. The occurrence of outliers in the raw data reduces the reliability of the training models. In this paper, the performance of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) traffic was estimated using the DL algorithm. A set of robust statistical estimators, called M-estimators, have been proposed as robust loss functions as an alternative to the traditional MSE loss function, to improve the training process and robustize DL in the presence of outliers. We demonstrate their robustness in the presence of outliers on V2X traffic datasets.},

ABSTRACT = {In an effort to reach accident-free milestones or drastically reduce/eliminate road fatalities rates and traffic congestion and to create disruptive, transformational mobility systems and services, different parties (e.g., automakers, universities, governments, and road traffic regulators) have collaborated to research, develop, and test connected vehicle (CV) technologies. CVs create new data-rich environments and are considered key enablers for many applications and services that will make our roads safer, less congested, and more eco-friendly. A deeper understanding of the CV technologies will pave the way to avoid setbacks and will help in developing more innovative applications and breakthroughs. In the CV paradigm, vehicles become smarter by communicating with nearby vehicles, connected infrastructure, and the surroundings. This connectivity will be substantial to support different features and systems, such as adaptive routing, real-time navigation, and slow and near real-time infrastructure. Further examples include environmental sensing, advanced driver-assistance systems, automated driving systems, mobility on demand, and mobility as a service. This article provides a comprehensive review on CV technologies including fundamental challenges, state-of-the-art enabling technologies, innovative applications, and potential opportunities that can benefit automakers, customers, and businesses. The current standardization efforts of the forefront enabling technologies, such as Wi-Fi 6 and 5G-cellular technologies are also reviewed. Different challenges in terms of cooperative computation, privacy/security, and over-the-air updates are discussed. Safety and non-safety applications are described and possible future opportunities that CV technology brings to our life are also highlighted.},
