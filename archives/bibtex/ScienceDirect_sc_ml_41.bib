abstract = {In this paper, we present (to the best of our knowledge) the first outranking method to assign a score to each alternative. This method is part of the Electre family, and we will call it Electre-Score. In contrast to the Multi-Attribute Value Theory methods, Electre-Score does not construct a value function for each criterion to proceed then to the aggregation into a single value. Instead, Electre-Score makes use of the outranking relations to make a comparison with sets of reference actions (to which a score is assigned) and assigns a score range to each action and a representative score in the range to each action. This is a more robust way of proceeding given the fragility of a single score. The reference actions have similar nature and characteristics of limiting profiles in Electre Tri-nB and the reference scores are assigned to them through the application of the deck of cards technique. Because this method uses outranking relations, it makes also possible to take into account the imperfect knowledge of data and to avoid systematic compensatory effects. Some fundamental theoretical results guaranteeing the consistency of the method, an illustrative example and a case study in the domain of healthcare system evaluation are also provided in this paper.}

U–learning represents an emergent paradigm that spreads education in diverse settings, where users are situated in authentic learning contexts to face immersive experiences in order to accomplish meaningful learning. With the aim at disseminating such a revolutionary arena, this systematic review analyzes its nature, application, and evolution throughout a longitudinal study, where 176 approaches built since 2010 up to the third quarter of 2017 date are gathered, classified, and characterized to disclose labor traits, outcome patterns, and field tendencies. These five results are grounded respectively in a representative collection, a proposed taxonomy, a suggested pattern, statistical interpretations, mining findings, and critical analysis. The conclusions reveal: u–learning is able to transform traditional education provided at classroom level and by e–learning. Principally, this is because students, pertaining to diverse academic levels experience real and authentic settings, are immersed in dual reality sceneries, benefit from context–aware support, learn diverse educational domains, follow suitable learning paradigms, deal with diverse effects, and interact with different devices and technologies in a blended fashion. All of this with the purpose of enhancing users’ apprenticeship.}

Typically, CPSs have limited computation and storage capabilities due to their tiny size and being embedded into larger systems. With the emergence of cloud computing and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), there are several new opportunities for these CPSs to extend their capabilities by taking advantage of the cloud resources in different ways. In this survey paper, we present an overview of research efforts on the integration of cyber-physical systems with cloud computing and categorize them into three areas: (1) remote brain, (2) big data manipulation, (3) and virtualization. In particular, we focus on three major CPSs namely mobile robots, wireless sensor networks and vehicular networks.}

Optimal placement of the end devices to the most suitable access network is expected to provide the best Quality of Service (QoS) experience to the users but also the maximum utilization of the scarce wireless resources by the operators. Several on-going proposals attempt to overcome the existing barriers by enabling the use of Wi-Fis and femto-cells to cater for part of the load generated by the end devices. The evolution of the Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) for the core part of the cellular network, as well as the Hotspot 2.0 approach, are currently being subject to thorough discussions and studies and are expected to facilitate a seamless 3GPP-WiFi interworking. During the past years, several Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection schemes have been proposed. However, these schemes do not take into consideration the opportunities offered by these new standardized approaches. Our paper acts in a manifold way: Firstly, it proposes COmpAsS, a Context-Aware RAT Selection mechanism, the main part of which operates on the User Equipment (UE)-side, minimizing signaling overhead over the air interface and computation load on the base stations. Secondly, we discuss in detail the architectural perspective; i.e., the extensions needed in the network interfaces that enable the exchange of the required context information among the respective network entities and in accordance with the 3GPP trends in relation to the context-aggregating entities. Furthermore, we quantify the signaling overhead of the proposed mechanism by linking it to the current 3GPP specifications and performing a comprehensive per-parameter analysis. Finally, we evaluate the novel scheme via extensive simulations in a complex and realistic 5G use case, illustrating the clear advantages of our approach in terms of key QoS metrics, i.e. the user-experienced throughput and delay, both in the uplink and the downlink.}

In this paper, we have developed a similarity query system for road traffic big data, called SigTrac, that runs on top of an existing MongoDB document store. The SigTrac system represents road traffic sensor data having spatio-temporal characteristics into traffic matrices and stores them into a MongoDB NoSQL document store by exploiting map-reduce operations of MongoDB. In addition, SigTrac efficiently processes similarity queries for traffic data with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based and incremental SVD-based algorithms. Our experimental studies with real traffic data demonstrate the efficiency of SiqTrac for similarity query processing for road traffic big data.}

abstract = {Via the integration of renewable energy and storage technologies, buildings have started to change from passive (electricity) consumers to active prosumer microgrids. Along with this development come a shift from centralized to distributed production and consumption models as well as discussions about the introduction of variable demand–supply-driven grid electricity prices. Together with upcoming ICT and automation technologies, these developments open space to a wide range of novel energy management and energy trading possibilities to optimally use available energy resources. However, what is considered as an optimal energy management and trading strategy heavily depends on the individual objectives and needs of a microgrid operator. Accordingly, elaborating the most suitable strategy for each particular system configuration and operator need can become quite a complex and time-consuming task, which can massively benefit from computational support. In this article, we introduce a bio-inspired cognitive decision agent architecture for optimized, goal-specific energy management in (interconnected) microgrids, which are additionally connected to the main electricity grid. For evaluating the performance of the architecture, a number of test cases are specified targeting objectives like local photovoltaic energy consumption maximization and financial gain maximization. Obtained outcomes are compared against a modified simulating annealing optimization approach in terms of objective achievement and computational effort. Results demonstrate that the cognitive decision agent architecture yields improved optimization results in comparison to the state of the art reference method while at the same time requiring significantly less computation time.}

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth in exploiting Cloud environments to deliver various types of resources as services. To improve the efficiency of software development, service reuse and composition is viewed as a powerful means. However, effectively composing services from multiple clouds has not been solved yet. Indeed, existing solutions assume that the services participating to a composition come from a single cloud. This approach is unrealistic since the other existing clouds may host more suitable services. In order to deliver high quality service compositions, the user request must be checked against the services in the multi-cloud environment (MCE) or at least clouds in the availability zone of the user. In this paper, we propose a multi-cloud service composition (MCSC) approach based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). We use FCA to represent and combine information of multiple clouds. FCA is based on the concept lattice which is a powerful mean to classify clouds and services information. We first model the multi-cloud environment as a set of formal contexts. Then, we extract and combine candidate clouds from formal concepts. Finally, the optimal cloud combination is selected and the MCSC is transformed into a classical service composition problem. Conducted experiments proved the effectiveness and the ability of FCA based method to regroup and find cloud combinations with a minimal number of clouds and a low communication cost. Also, the comparison with two well-known combinatorial optimization approaches showed that the adopted top-down strategy allowed to rapidly select services hosted on the same and closest clouds, which directly reduced the inter-cloud communication cost, compared to existing approaches.}

However, the common practice of standard encryption hinders the effective keyword-based data subscription over outsourced data. Attribute-based keyword search (ABKS), which fulfills the functionality of attribute-based encryption and searchable encryption, is a promising cryptographic primitive to construct secure data publish-subscribe scheme. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a decentralized and expressive CP-ABKS scheme with computation outsourcing and collusion resistance. Then we construct a novel data publish-subscribe scheme based on the proposed CP-ABKS to realize secure and flexible data sharing among multiple users. Both the access and subscription policies are expressed with the Linear Secret Sharing Scheme structure that can be derived from any monotonic Boolean formula and any threshold gate. To protect the keyword privacy, the subscription policy is partially publicized, and a keyword localization method is designed to enable the server to reconstruct the subscription policy and execute the search protocol in linear time. Additionally, the proposed scheme adopts online/offline encryption and outsourced decryption in a fully decentralized setting. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that our scheme achieves a good balance between security goals and practical efficiency.}

The system was tailored for mobile use and although the pressing need for its deployment negated the time for thorough design, a rich set of lessons and findings emerge from its public use by 13,340 users, over a period of 2 months, reporting over 1,800 times on the condition of 189 local beaches, of which 157 were added to the system by the users themselves. This work touches on issues of usability, motivation, data reliability and public utility of mobile participatory systems and demonstrates that effective outcomes for public bodies may rise when systems are designed for the immediate benefit of citizens, by openly exposing the collected data. Most importantly, participation in mobile crowdsourced systems where the data is openly shared between participants is found to be strongly driven by altruistic motives and not by financial or ethical awards. Additionally, the altruistic motives behind participation overcome the added difficulty of participating from a purely mobile use context, and safeguard the quality of the contributed data, reducing the need for complex quality monitoring and safeguarding mechanisms. Finally, the paper identifies barriers and opportunities for the opportunistic participation in mobile crowdsourcing systems during leisure time.}

SpatialHadoop supports several spatial operations (e.g., K Nearest Neighbor search, range query, spatial intersection join, etc.) and seven spatial partitioning techniques (Grid, Quadtree, STR, STR+, k-d tree, Z-curve and Hilbert-curve). Distance-Join Queries (DJQs), like the K Nearest Neighbors Join Query (KNNJQ) and K Closest Pairs Query (KCPQ), are common operations used in numerous spatial applications. DJQs are costly operations, since they combine spatial joins with distance-based search. Data partitioning improves the management of large datasets and speeds up query performance. Therefore, performing DJQs efficiently with new partitioning methods in SpatialHadoop is a challenging task. In this paper, a new data partitioning technique based on Voronoi-Diagrams is designed and implemented in SpatialHadoop. Moreover, improved KNNJQ and KCPQ MapReduce algorithms, using the new partitioning mechanism, are also designed and developed for SpatialHadoop. Finally, the results of an extensive set of experiments with real-world datasets are presented, demonstrating that the new partitioning technique and the improved DJQ MapReduce algorithms are efficient, scalable and robust in SpatialHadoop.}

Compared to traditional networks it decouples the control logic from network layer devices and centralizes it for efficient traffic forwarding and flow management across the domain. This multi-layered architecture has data forwarding devices at the bottom in the data plane, which is programmed by controllers in the control plane. The high-level management plane interacts with the control plane to program the whole network and enforce different policies. The interaction among these planes is done through interfaces that work as communication/programming protocols. In this survey, we present a comprehensive study of these interface and programming protocols, which are primarily classified into southbound, northbound, and east/westbound interfaces. This work first classifies each of them into subcategories and then presents a comprehensive comparative analysis. As the different interfaces have different properties, hence, the sub-classification and their analysis are done using different properties. In addition, we also discuss the impact of different virtualization techniques, such as hypervisors, on interface protocols and inter-plane communication. More over specialized interfaces for emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things and wireless sensor networks are also presented.

Based on a new hybrid distance, novel Gaussian kernel Fuzzy Rough Sets (FRS) for HIS were constructed in our previous study. In real-world applications, with the deepening of cognition and improvements in technology, attribute values in an information system often evolve over time; in particular, there are three cases: when missing values are imputed, error values are corrected, and the values are coarsened or refined. This has posed challenges to developing efficient data analysis algorithms. In this paper, the changing mechanisms of the attribute values and fuzzy equivalence relations in FRS are analyzed. FRS approaches for incrementally updating approximations in HIS are presented. Moreover, two corresponding incremental algorithms are developed. Finally, extensive experiments on eight data sets from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and an artificial data set show that incremental approaches can effectively improve the performance of updating approximations and not only significantly shorten the computational time, but also increase approximation classification accuracies.}

To make things worse, they are poorly understood, while a deep understanding of them is essential for strengthening the role of the Internet as the world's communication substrate.

Unfortunately, we have found this literature rather scattered, since many different and equally important aspects can be investigated, and researchers typically focused only on a subset of them. And, to the best of out knowledge, no paper in literature provides an extensive view on this important research topic. To fill this gap, we analyze all the relevant facets of this important research topic, stepping from the critical review of the available literature. Our work sheds light on several obscure aspects such as, for example, the different challenges considered in the literature, the techniques, tools, and methodologies used, the contributions provided towards different goals (e.g., outage analysis and detection, impact evaluation, risk assessment, countermeasures, etc.), the issues that are still open, etc. Moreover, it provides several innovative contributions achieved analyzing the wide and scattered literature on Internet outages (e.g., characterization of the main causes of outages, general approach for implementing outages detection systems, systematic classification of definitions and metrics for network resilience, etc.).

abstract = {Bitcoin introduced delegation of control over a monetary system from a select few to all who participate in that system. This delegation is known as the decentralization of controlling power and is a powerful security mechanism for the ecosystem. After the introduction of Bitcoin, the field of cryptocurrency has seen widespread attention from industry and academia, so much so that the original novel contribution of Bitcoin, i.e., decentralization, may be overlooked, due to decentralizations’ assumed fundamental existence for the functioning of such crypto-assets. However, recent studies have observed a trend of increased centralization in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. As this increased centralization has an impact the security of the blockchain, it is crucial that it is measured, towards adequate control. This research derives an initial taxonomy of centralization present in decentralized blockchains through rigorous synthesis using a systematic literature review. This is followed by iterative refinement through expert interviews. We systematically analyzed 89 research papers published between 2009 and 2019. Our study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the multiple definitions and measurements of centralization in the literature. We identify different aspects of centralization and propose an encompassing taxonomy of centralization concerns. This taxonomy is based on empirically observable and measurable characteristics. It consists of 13 aspects of centralization, classified over six architectural layers: Governance, Network, Consensus, Incentive, Operational, and Application. We also discuss how the implications of centralization can vary depending on the aspects studied. We believe that this review and taxonomy provides a comprehensive overview of centralization in decentralized blockchains involving various conceptualizations and measures.}

abstract = {Context
One of the main targets of cyber-attacks is data exfiltration, which is the leakage of sensitive or private data to an unauthorized entity. Data exfiltration can be perpetrated by an outsider or an insider of an organization. Given the increasing number of data exfiltration incidents, a large number of data exfiltration countermeasures have been developed. These countermeasures aim to detect, prevent, or investigate exfiltration of sensitive or private data. With the growing interest in data exfiltration, it is important to review data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures to support future research in this field.
Objective
This paper is aimed at identifying and critically analysing data exfiltration attack vectors and countermeasures for reporting the status of the art and determining gaps for future research.
Method
We have followed a structured process for selecting 108 papers from seven publication databases. Thematic analysis method has been applied to analyse the extracted data from the reviewed papers.
Results
We have developed a classification of (1) data exfiltration attack vectors used by external attackers and (2) the countermeasures in the face of external attacks. We have mapped the countermeasures to attack vectors. Furthermore, we have explored the applicability of various countermeasures for different states of data (i.e., in use, in transit, or at rest).
Conclusion
This review has revealed that (a) most of the state of the art is focussed on preventive and detective countermeasures and significant research is required on developing investigative countermeasures that are equally important; (b) Several data exfiltration countermeasures are not able to respond in real-time, which specifies that research efforts need to be invested to enable them to respond in real-time (c) A number of data exfiltration countermeasures do not take privacy and ethical concerns into consideration, which may become an obstacle in their full adoption (d) Existing research is primarily focussed on protecting data in ‘in use’ state, therefore, future research needs to be directed towards securing data in ‘in rest’ and ‘in transit’ states (e) There is no standard or framework for evaluation of data exfiltration countermeasures. We assert the need for developing such an evaluation framework.}

A majorbreakthrough in bridging the gap between virtual and physical worlds came from the vision of the Web of Things (WoT), which employs open Web standards in achieving information sharing and objects interoperability. Social Web of Things (SWoT) further extends WoT to integrate smart objects with social networks and is observed to not only bridge between physical and virtual worlds but also facilitate continued interaction between physical devices and human. This makes SWoT the most promising approach and has now become an active research area. This survey introduces necessary background and fundamentals to understand current efforts in IoT, WoT and SWoT by reviewing key enabling technologies. These efforts are investigated in detail from several different perspectives such as architecture design, middleware, platform, systems implementation, and application in hand.

The proposed scheme consists of (i) a secure and efficient end-user authentication and authorization architecture based on the certificate based DTLS handshake, (ii) secure end-to-end communication based on session resumption, and (iii) robust mobility based on interconnected smart gateways. The smart gateways act as an intermediate processing layer (called fog layer) between IoT devices and sensors (device layer) and cloud services (cloud layer). In our scheme, the fog layer facilitates ubiquitous mobility without requiring any reconfiguration at the device layer. The scheme is demonstrated by simulation and a full hardware/software prototype. Based on our analysis, our scheme has the most extensive set of security features in comparison to related approaches found in literature. Energy-performance evaluation results show that compared to existing approaches, our scheme reduces the communication overhead by 26% and the communication latency between smart gateways and end users by 16%. In addition, our scheme is approximately 97% faster than certificate based and 10% faster than symmetric key based DTLS. Compared to our scheme, certificate based DTLS consumes about 2.2 times more RAM and 2.9 times more ROM resources. On the other hand, the RAM and ROM requirements of our scheme are almost as low as in symmetric key-based DTLS. Analysis of our implementation revealed that the handover latency caused by mobility is low and the handover process does not incur any processing or communication overhead on the sensors.}

Purposefully, new technologies and solutions have emerged such as renewable-energy systems, electric vehicles, and micro-grids. With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networking (WSN) technologies, Smart Grid (SG) concept is becoming more attractive, whereby it refers to upgrading conventional power-grid infrastructure in order to offer automated control over the resources and emerging technologies in smart and sustainable cities. The implementation of this automated control requires robust and secure bidirectional communication systems. However, legacy-networking paradigms failed to address flexibility in their design to meet SG-networking requirements. Alternatively, Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm provides two powerful networking solutions namely, decoupling control from the data layer and network programmability, which can enhance the robustness of communication networks in modern societies. Therefore, the main aim of this article is to present an overview of integrating Software-Defined WSN (SDWSN) concept in SGs in order to solve the aforementioned challenges and improve network robustness. We categorize literature attempts, describe enabling devices and communication technologies, and we suggest open research issues and opportunities associated with integrating SDWSN paradigm into SGs.}

We present a new Compact Trip Representation (CTR) that handles the spatio-temporal data associated with users’ trips over transportation networks. Depending on the network and types of queries, nodes in the network can represent intersections, stops, or even street segments. CTR represents separately sequences of nodes and the time instants when users traverse these nodes. The spatial component is handled with a data structure based on the well-known Compressed Suffix Array (CSA), which provides both a compact representation and interesting indexing capabilities. The temporal component is self-indexed with either a Hu–Tucker-shaped Wavelet-Tree or a Wavelet Matrix that solve range-interval queries efficiently. We show how CTR can solve relevant counting-based spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal queries over large sets of trips. Experimental results show the space requirements (around 50–70% of the space needed by a compact non-indexed baseline) and query efficiency (most queries are solved in the range of 1–1000 µs) of CTR.}

This model of client–server data communication has evolved into a peer-to-peer mode of data sharing in recent times.

So, the idea of using IP addresses to identify servers hosting a particular content is losing its importance. Moreover, want of IP addresses is a challenging issue haunting the Internet community since long. The need of the time is a content-centric networking platform where data hosts are of less importance, and Named Data Networking (NDN) has been proposed to that end. NDN allows users to float a data request without any knowledge about the hosting entity. NDN can handle user mobility, security issues more efficiently than the current Internet. Although NDN has been proposed in 2010, so far, there is no survey paper studying its architecture and various schemes proposed for its different characteristic features, like, naming, adaptive forwarding and routing, caching, security, mobility, etc. In this paper, we introduce a novel taxonomy to study NDN features in depth.

abstract = {Spatial crowdsourcing has emerged as a new paradigm for solving problems in the physical world with the help of human workers. A major challenge in spatial crowdsourcing is to assign reliable workers to nearby tasks. The goal of such task assignment process is to maximize the task completion in the face of uncertainty. This process is further complicated when tasks arrivals are dynamic and worker reliability is unknown. Recent research proposals have tried to address the challenge of dynamic task assignment. Yet the majority of the proposals do not consider the dynamism of tasks and workers. They also make the unrealistic assumptions of known deterministic or probabilistic workers’ reliabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for dynamic task assignment in spatial crowdsourcing. The proposed approach combines bi-objective optimization with combinatorial multi-armed bandits. We formulate an online optimization problem to maximize task reliability and minimize travel costs in spatial crowdsourcing. We propose the distance-reliability ratio (DRR) algorithm based on a combinatorial fractional programming approach. The DRR algorithm reduces travel costs by 80% while maximizing reliability when compared to existing algorithms. We extend the DRR algorithm for the scenario when worker reliabilities are unknown. We propose a novel algorithm (DRR-UCB) that uses an interval estimation heuristic to approximate worker reliabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that the DRR-UCB achieves high reliability in the face of uncertainty. The proposed approach is particularly suited for real-life dynamic spatial crowdsourcing scenarios. This approach is generalizable to the similar problems in other areas in expert systems. First, it encompasses online assignment problems when the objective function is a ratio of two linear functions. Second, it considers situations when intelligent and repeated assignment decisions are needed under uncertainty.}

Game theory, which can capture the interactions among players dexterously, has been widely used in solving various problems in HMN systems from the view of economics. In this paper, we extensively review the literature about game theoretical methods in HMNs, in particular focusing on its typical systems such as crowdsourcing, an elemental HMN and Internet of Things (IoT), a hybrid HMN, as well as Bitcoin. We propose a series of requirements to evaluate existing work.

abstract = {Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds offer services to automate the deployment and management of applications, relieving application owners of the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure resources. However, application owners have an increasingly larger diversity and volume of workloads, which they want to execute at minimum cost while maintaining desired performance guarantees. In this paper we investigate how existing PaaS systems cope with this challenge. In particular, we first present a taxonomy of commonly-encountered design decisions regarding how PaaS systems manage underlying resources. We then use this taxonomy to analyze an extensive set of PaaS systems targeting different application domains. Based on this analysis, we identify several future research opportunities in the PaaS design space, which will enable PaaS owners to reduce hosting costs while coping with the workload variety.}

Intermediaries are seen as crucial actors in a transition process, but so far the transition intermediary literature has had a positive bias towards their role. We mobilize strong structuration theory to develop an analytical perspective that captures how complexity, tensions, and ambiguity influence the transition intermediary’s role and activities. We apply the perspective to the case of Connecting Mobility, a transition intermediary in the Dutch smart mobility field. Results show that Connecting Mobility has fulfilled several transition intermediary roles to different degrees, both simultaneously and sequentially, but they also experienced difficulties in fulfilling these. We conclude that the roles and the engagement of transition intermediaries in meaningful activities are a response to their dynamic context and internal learning processes. As an additional consequence, a single transition intermediary’s direct impact on the overall transition process should not be overstated.}

IoE uses Internet to collect, organize, optimize and manage the networks energy information from different edge devices in order to develop a distributed smart energy infrastructure. Sensors and communication technologies are used to collect data and to predict demand and supply by consumers and suppliers respectively. However, with the development of renewable energy resources, Electric Vehicles (EVs), smart grid and Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, the existing energy sector started shifting towards distributed and decentralized solutions. Moreover, the security and privacy issues because of centralization is another major concern for IoE technology. In this context, Blockchain technology with the features of automation, immutability, public ledger facility, irreversibility, decentralization, consensus and security has been adopted in the literature for solving the prevailing problems of centralized IoE architecture. By leveraging smart contracts, blockchain technology enables automated data exchange, complex energy transactions, demand response management and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading etc. Blockchain will play vital role in the evolution of the IoE market as distributed renewable resources and smart grid network are being deployed and used. We discuss the potential and applications of blockchain in the IoE field. This article is build on the literature research and it provides insight to the end-user regarding the future IoE scenario in the context of blockchain technology. Lastly this article discusses the different consensus algorithm for IoE technology.}

Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used.11A summary of the research projects reviewed in this study can be found in the Appendix A. Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream.}

Proposed parking assistance solutions combine sensors, either as part of fixed infrastructure or onboard vehicles, wireless networking technologies and mobile social applications running on smartphones to collect, share and present to drivers real-time information about parking demand and availability. One question that arises is how does (and should) the driver actually use such information to take parking decisions, e.g., whether to search for on-street parking space or drive to a parking lot and, in the latter case, which one. The paper is, hence, a performance analysis study that seeks to capture the highly behavioral and heuristic dimension of drivers’ decisions and its impact on the efficiency of the parking search process. To this end, and in sharp contrast with the existing literature, we model drivers as agents of bounded rationality and assume that their choices are directed by lexicographic heuristics, an instance of the fast and frugal heuristics developed in behavioral sciences such as psychology and biology. We analyze the performance of the search process under these heuristics and compare it against the predictions of normative game-theoretic models that assume fully rational strategically acting agents. We derive conditions under which the game-theoretic norms turn out to be more pessimistic than the simpler heuristic choice rules and show that these are fulfilled for a broad range of scenarios concerning the fees charged for the parking resources and their distance from the destinations of the drivers’ trips. The practical implications of these results for parking assistance solutions are identified and thoroughly discussed.}

In this paper, we survey and compare existing routing protocols in wireless sensor networks. We start by introducing the different solutions that can be used to improve the network lifetime and focus on energy efficient routing protocols as the area of the survey, in addition to network topology modeling. We also model the network regarding energy consumption, sensing and event extraction analysis in the network. Categorization of the routing protocols into homogeneous and heterogeneous was performed, for which, sub-classification into static and mobile and other behavioral patterns of the routing protocols was done. The second phase of the paper presents models and simulations of selected routing protocols and comparisons of their performances.

After an analysis of the current and of the new territorial application rules under the data protection legislation, we investigate the consequences of these new rules for research and platforms in four particular situations. We warn and advise the regulator that research platforms and the use of other equipment for the collection and processing of personal data in the Union for research may escape from data protection legislation once the new data protection regulation applies. This is due to the revised territorial application rules in the new regulation. We therefore plead for more reflection and clear terminology and for keeping the criterion of the use of equipment for the territorial application of data protection legislation. Rejecting this criterion may result in considerable better (competitive) positions for non-Union companies and institutions collecting and using personal data collected in the Union for research as compared to Union research organisations.}

For accomplishing the robustness and to perceive the security demands of various M2M communication-based services, academicians have discussed group-based handover protocols in the literature. However, the group of medical M2M devices (MMD) suffer from numerous challenges such as privacy-preservation, high signaling congestion at the network, and inadequacy of forward/backward key secrecy at the time of handover authentication. Also, the existing handover schemes are susceptible to network attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM), etc., and stimulate high network utilization. To avoid the above concerns, we introduce the IoT-enabled and Secrecy Aware Group-based (ISAG) handover authentication and key agreement (AKA) scheme in the LTE-A network for M2M communication. The scheme realizes the mutual authentication between the target base-station and a group of MMDs with a secret session key. Based on message aggregation technology, the ISAG handover protocol averts the communication network congestion and minimizes the bandwidth overhead. The security analysis illustrates that the protocol obtains necessary security requirements such as confidentiality, data integrity, and private key protection. Through performance evaluations, the protocol shows significant improvement in the communication, computation, storage, and transmission overhead compared to the exiting group-based handover protocols. Finally, simulation output by the OpenSSL library of computing bandwidth consumption to network participants illustrates that ISAG handover protocol is appropriate for e-health services.}

In addition to this, the computing capabilities of such devices, often under-utilized by their owners, are in continuous improvement. Today, smart mobile devices have multi-core CPUs, several gigabytes of RAM, and the ability to communicate through several wireless networking technologies. These facts caught the attention of researchers who propose to leverage smart mobile devices aggregated computing capabilities for running resource intensive software at the edge of the network. Such idea is conditioned by key features, named singularities in the context of this work, that makes smart mobile devices resource exploitation a difficult problem. These are the ability of devices to change location (user mobility), the shared condition -i.e., non-dedicated nature- of resources provided (lack of ownership) and the limited operation time given by the finite energy source (exhaustible resources). In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of proposals materializing this idea. We show that (a) existing approaches differ in the singularities combinations they target and the way they address each singularity through novel taxonomies, and (b) this fact makes them suitable for distinct goals and resource exploitation opportunities also schematized in this paper. The latter are represented by real life situations where resources provided by groups of smart mobile devices can be exploited, which in turn, are characterized by a social context and a networking support used to link and coordinate devices. The behavior of people in a given social context configure a special availability level of resources, while the networking support imposes restrictions on how data/computational tasks are distributed and results are collected. We conclude our analysis by discussing strong/weak points of the approaches and by identifying prospective future lines in the area.}

These domains use physical networking objects connecting over the Internet to collect and exchange the data. Using the advancement of cloud computing technologies and aggravation of big-data growth caused by the incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT), secure user authentication for remote access is playing a crucial role. Since it has limited authorization and authentication privileges for mobility users, an approach of mobile-sink has been instigated for the improvisation of remote user authentication i.e. cloud-based IoT applications. As a result, this article proposes a lightweight smartcard based secure authentication (LS-BSA) approach using the mathematical assumption of bilinear-pairing/mapping, elliptic-curve cryptosystems, and fuzzy verifier. An extensive security investigation demonstrates that the proposed LS-BSA not only guarantees the AKA security properties but also prevents significant vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the proposed LS-BSA uses lightweight operations to establish a seamless data connectivity over a secure network. It maintains the compatibility standards including low-cost and low-power to mitigate the computation and communication cost of cloud-based intelligent data computing. Formal security verification of BAN-logic is introduced to show that LS-BSA offers proper mutual user authentication and secret secure-session key agreement between the real-time entities. In addition, a network scenario has been set up using the NS-3 simulator to prove that the proposed LS-BSA is more efficient than other existing schemes in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and throughput rate.}

The guifi.net community network is a successful example of a digital infrastructure, a computer network, managed as an open commons. Inspired by the guifi.net case and its commons governance model, we claim that a computing cloud, another digital infrastructure, can also be managed as an open commons if the appropriate tools are put in place. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and sustainability of community clouds as open commons: open user-driven clouds formed by community-managed computing resources. We propose organising the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) cloud service layers as common-pool resources (CPR) for enabling a sustainable cloud service provision. On this basis, we have outlined a governance framework for community clouds, and we have developed Cloudy, a cloud software stack that comprises a set of tools and components to build and operate community cloud services. Cloudy is tailored to the needs of the guifi.net community network, but it can be adopted by other communities. We have validated the feasibility of community clouds in a deployment in guifi.net of some 60 devices running Cloudy for over two years. To gain insight into the capacity of end-user services to generate enough value and utility to sustain the whole cloud ecosystem, we have developed a file storage application and tested it with a group of 10 guifi.net users. The experimental results and the experience from the action research confirm the feasibility and potential sustainability of the community cloud as an open commons.}

abstract = {The conceptual approach known as Fog/Edge Computing has recently emerged, aiming to move part of the computing and storage resources from the cloud to the edge of the network. The combination of IoT devices, edge nodes, and the Cloud gives rise to a three-tier Cloud of Things (CoT) architecture. In the complex and dynamic CoT ecosystems, a key issue is how to efficiently and effectively allocate resources to meet the demands of applications. Similar to traditional clouds, the goal of resource allocation in the CoT is to maximize the number of applications served by the infrastructure while ensuring a target operational cost. We propose a resource allocation algorithm for CoT systems that (i) supports heterogeneity of devices and applications, (ii) leverages the distributed nature of edge nodes to promote collaboration during the allocation process and (iii) provides an efficient usage of the system resources while meeting latency requirements and considering different priorities of IoT applications. Our algorithm follows a heuristic-based approach inspired on an economic model for solving the resource allocation problem in CoT. A set of simulations were performed, with promising results, showing that our collaborative resource allocation algorithm is more scalable, reduces the response time for applications and the energy consumption of end devices, in comparison to a two-tier, Cloud-based approach. Moreover, the network traffic between edge nodes, and between the Edge and Cloud tiers, is considerably smaller when using our collaborative solution, in comparison to other evaluated approaches.}

abstract = {The coverage problem, as a fundamental problem for almost all types of applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), has been studied for over a decade. Because of its simplicity and ease of analysis, full coverage is widely adopted in many theoretical studies. However, a full coverage requirement can be relaxed into a partial one to avoid the overuse of sensors. Moreover, sometimes full coverage is not the best way to represent some real-world applications because of its strong restrictions and its deterministic characteristics. From this view, a better way is to introduce uncertainty into coverage problems. By analyzing the characteristics of partial or probabilistic coverage problems, and comparing them with full coverage problems, this survey is helpful to establish an overview of non-deterministic coverage problems, denoted as coverage problems with uncertain properties. This survey then sketches a general research framework to solve such problems. According to the framework, we first introduce a series of basic concepts of coverage problems with uncertain properties and then summarize the relevant models, such as detection models, network models, and deployment models. Based on these models, we discuss three main objectives, namely, to maximize coverage quality, to maximize network lifetime, and to minimize the number of sensors. Next, we illustrate several solution strategies for these three objectives, such as deployment, scheduling or selection, and movement or adjustment. Then, we classify the solutions (algorithms) from different aspects, i.e., traditional and heuristic, approximation, distributed and centralized, and random algorithms. In addition, the theoretical analysis for algorithms and the platforms for simulating the numerical experiments are also summarized. Finally, we discuss future challenges and directions for research of coverage problems with uncertain properties.}

There are a variety of innovations in the flight mechanisms that UASs are applying for flight. There is also a significant interest in the development of new types of drones that can fly autonomously in different locations, such as cities, marine, and space environments and perform various missions. This paper reviews the different configurations, flight mechanisms, and applications of UASs. First of all, UASs are divided into four main categories, including Horizontal Takeoff and Landing (HTOL), Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL), Hybrid, and Bio-Based drones. Then each category is divided into some sub-categories in order to have a coherent review. The characteristics, advantages and drawbacks of each category are discussed elaborately. Moreover, a comprehensive study is carried out on the applications of UASs and their specifications.}

abstract = {Optimal scale selection and attribute reduction are two key issues related to knowledge discovery in multi-scale decision tables (MDTs). The former is mainly used to obtain optimal scale combinations by selecting a suitable scale for each attribute, while the latter attempts to obtain reducts of these optimal scale combinations (i.e., optimal scale reducts). However, a search for all optimal scale reducts of a given MDT may result in a combinatorial explosion and existing approaches typically incur excessive time consumption. In this paper, a novel scale combination is defined to perform optimal scale selection and attribute reduction synchronously. Accordingly, an effective approach integrating sequential three-way decision with simplified MDTs is proposed to search for all optimal scale reducts. The efficiency of searching can be significantly improved by reducing the number of consistency checks required for single-scale decision tables and accelerating each check. First, a sequential three-way decision model of the scale space is proposed to search for all optimal scale reducts. Based on the trisecting-and-acting concept and a multi-step strategy, a large number of non-optimal scale reducts can be progressively transferred from the boundary regions to the negative regions. Second, an extended stepwise optimal scale selection method is introduced to quickly search for a single optimal scale reduct in the boundary region. Finally, a simplified MDT is proposed to accelerate the consistency checks for single-scale decision tables. Accordingly, an optimal scale selection algorithm integrating sequential three-way decision with simplified MDTs is proposed to improve the efficiency of searching for all optimal scale reducts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce overall computational time.}

abstract = {The enhancement of energy performance of buildings has become a pillar of energy policies. The main target is the cut of energy consumption to reduce buildings footprint. This aim is pursued by introducing constrains on building requirements in terms of properties of basic materials and components and exploitation of renewable energy sources. That results in the definition of the zero-energy building (ZEB) concept. The new paradigm introduced new challenges and, at the same time, involved all the different stakeholders in facing the barriers to the diffusion of the novel solutions proposed by the research development. This paper summarizes the actual state-of-art of whole performance of ZEBs and the related technical solutions, analysing their increasing potential in energy consumption. A collection of the different case studies reported in literature involving ZEBs is presented, compiling an analysis of the performance of the common solutions actually applied. The technologies involved are described discussing their impact in meeting the ZEB requirements. A debate is proposed, pointing out the main aspects deserving further investigations and outlining the critical elements in making the zero-energy target the new standard for the buildings.}

abstract = {Over the last two decades, water smart metering programs have been launched in a number of medium to large cities worldwide to nearly continuously monitor water consumption at the single household level. The availability of data at such very high spatial and temporal resolution advanced the ability in characterizing, modeling, and, ultimately, designing user-oriented residential water demand management strategies. Research to date has been focusing on one or more of these aspects but with limited integration between the specialized methodologies developed so far. This manuscript is the first comprehensive review of the literature in this quickly evolving water research domain. The paper contributes a general framework for the classification of residential water demand modeling studies, which allows revising consolidated approaches, describing emerging trends, and identifying potential future developments. In particular, the future challenges posed by growing population demands, constrained sources of water supply and climate change impacts are expected to require more and more integrated procedures for effectively supporting residential water demand modeling and management in several countries across the world.}
