abstract = {With the transformation to smarter cities and the development of technologies, a large amount of data is collected from sensors in real-time. This paradigm provides opportunities for improving transportation systems' performance by allocating vehicles towards mobility predicted demand proactively. However, how to deal with uncertainties in demand probability distribution for improving the average system performance is still a challenging and unsolved task. Considering this problem, in this work, we develop a data-driven distributionally robust vehicle balancing method to minimize the worst-case expected cost. We design an efficient algorithm for constructing uncertainty sets of random demand probability distributions, and leverage a quad-tree dynamic region partition method for better capturing the dynamic spatial-temporal properties of the uncertain demand. We then prove equivalent computationally tractable form for numerically solving the distributionally robust problem. We evaluate the performance of the data-driven vehicle balancing framework based on four years of taxi trip data for New York City. We show that the average total idle driving distance is reduced by 30% with the distributionally robust vehicle balancing method using quad-tree dynamic region partition method, compared with vehicle balancing solutions based on static region partitions without considering demand uncertainties. This is about 60 million miles or 8 million dollars cost reduction annually in NYC.},

abstract = {Despite advances in vehicle technology and road modernization, traffic accidents are a huge global issue, causing deaths and injuries, especially among pedestrians and cyclists. This often happens due to pedestrians and cyclists in drivers' blind spots or distractions delaying drivers' reactions. Therefore, timely warning drivers about critical situations is important to increase traffic safety. New edge computing and communication technologies have been proposed to reduce latency in critical IoT systems. However, state-of-the-art solutions either do not focus on traffic safety or do not consider low-latency requirements in this context.We propose InTraSafEd5G (Increasing Traffic Safety with Edge and 5G) to address these issues. InTraSafEd5G performs real-time edge analytics to detect critical situations and deliver early warnings to drivers. After describing our design choices, we provide a prototype implementation and evaluate its performance in a real-world setup. The evaluation shows that InTraSafEd5G can (i) detect critical situations in real-time and (ii) notify affected drivers in 108.73ms on average using 5G, which is within expected latency requirements of road safety IoT applications. Our solution shows a promising step towards increasing overall traffic safety and supporting decision-making in critical situations.},

abstract = {IoT systems are very complex systems with a extensive attack surface which makes them susceptible to a large variety of threats. Their high complexity and large number of vulnerabilities require some global control for the coordination and management of their defenses. To provide this control, handle large amounts of data, and decrease latency, IoT architectures, in addition to things, often include cloud and fog systems. We present here a pattern that describes this architecture, indicating its threats and corresponding defenses. The pattern defines security protection for data assets and for the communication channels in order to neutralize the IoT system threats and reduce the complexity of managing security. The defenses include authentication, authorization, security logger/auditor, secure channel, and firewall/Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This is an addition to a set of patterns focusing on the security of IoT ecosystems, being built by our group.},

abstract = {Through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. Digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. Hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. Foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. Developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.},

abstract = {As Electric Vehicles (EVs) become increasingly popular, their battery-related problems (e.g., short driving range and heavy battery weight) must be resolved as soon as possible. Velocity optimization of EVs to minimize energy consumption in driving is an effective alternative to handle these problems. However, previous velocity optimization methods assume that vehicles will pass through traffic lights immediately at green traffic signals. Actually, a vehicle may still experience a delay to pass a green traffic light due to a vehicle waiting queue in front of the traffic light. Also, as velocity optimization is for individual vehicles, previous methods cannot avoid rear-end collisions. That is, a vehicle following its optimal velocity profile may experience rear-end collisions with its frontal vehicle on the road. In this article, for the first time, we propose a velocity optimization system that enables EVs to immediately pass green traffic lights without delay and to avoid rear-end collisions to ensure driving safety when EVs follow optimal velocity profiles on the road. We collected real driving data on road sections of US-25 highway (with two driving lanes in each direction and relatively low traffic volume) to conduct extensive trace-driven simulation studies. Results show that our velocity optimization system reduces energy consumption by up to 17.5% compared with real driving patterns without increasing trip time. Also, it helps EVs to avoid possible collisions compared with existing collision avoidance methods.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the emerging Information Retrieval (IR) task of contextual suggestion in location-based social networks. The aim of this task is to make personalised recommendations of venues for entertainments or activities whilst visiting a city, by appropriately representing the context of the user, such as their location and personal interests. Instead of only representing the specific low-level interests of a user, our approach is driven by estimates of the high-level categories of venues that the user may be interested in. Moreover, we argue that an effective model for contextual suggestion should not only promote the categories that the user is interested in, but it should also be capable of eliminating redundancy by diversifying the recommended venues in the sense that they should cover various categories of interest to the given user. Therefore, we adapt web search result diversification approaches to the task of contextual suggestion. For categorising the venues, we use the category classifications employed by location-based social networks such as FourSquare, urban guides such as Yelp, and a large collection of web pages, the ClueWeb12 corpus, to build a textual classifier that is capable of predicting the category distribution for a certain venue given its web page. We thoroughly evaluate our approach using the TREC 2013 Contextual Suggestion track. We conduct a number of experiments where we consider venues from the closed environments of both FourSquare and Yelp, and the general web using the ClueWeb12 corpus. Our empirical results suggest that category diversification consistently improves the effectiveness of the recommendation model over a reasonable baseline that only considers the similarity between the user's profile and venue. The results also give insights on the effectiveness of our approach with different types of users.},

When developing a service that relies on such data, ensuring privacy preserving data sharing and processing is one of the main challenges. Often several entities are involved in these steps and the interested parties are manifold. To ensure data privacy, a variety of different de-identification techniques exist that all exhibit unique peculiarities to be considered. In this paper, we show at the example of a location-based service for weather prediction of an energy grid operator, how the different de-identification techniques can be evaluated. With this, we aim to provide a better understanding of state-of-the-art de-identification techniques and the pitfalls to consider by implementation. Finally, we find that the optimal technique for a specific service depends highly on the scenario specifications and requirements.},

abstract = {Edge computing is a trending notion introduced a decade ago as a new computing paradigm for interactive mobile applications. The initial vision of the edge was a multi-tenant resource that will be used opportunistically for low-latency mobile applications. Despite that vision, we see in practice a different set of applications, driven by large-scale enterprises that have emerged and are driving realworld edge deployments today. In these applications, the edge is the primary place of storage and computation and, if network conditions allow, the cloud is opportunistically used alongside. We show how these enterprise deployments are driving innovation in edge computing. Enterprise-driven scenarios have a different motivation for using the edge. Instead of latency, the primary factors are limited bandwidth and unreliability of the network link to the cloud. The enterprise deployment layout is also unique: on-premise, single-tenant edges with shared, redundant outbound links. These previously unexplored characteristics of enterprise-driven edge scenarios open up a number of unique and exciting future research challenges for our community.},

abstract = {Routing plays a fundamental role in network applications, but it is especially challenging in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs). These are a kind of mobile ad hoc networks made of, e.g., (possibly, unmanned) vehicles and humans where, despite a lack of continuous connectivity, data must be transmitted while the network conditions change due to the nodes’ mobility. In these contexts, routing is NP-hard and is usually solved by heuristic “store and forward” replication-based approaches, where multiple copies of the same message are moved and stored across nodes in the hope that at least one will reach its destination. Still, the existing routing protocols produce relatively low delivery probabilities. Here, we genetically improve two routing protocols widely adopted in DTNs, namely, Epidemic and PRoPHET, in the attempt to optimize their delivery probability. First, we dissect them into their fundamental components, i.e., functionalities such as checking if a node can transfer data, or sending messages to all connections. Then, we apply Genetic Improvement (GI) to manipulate these components as terminal nodes of evolving trees. We apply this methodology, in silico, to six test cases of urban networks made of hundreds of nodes and find that GI produces consistent gains in delivery probability in four cases. We then verify if this improvement entails a worsening of other relevant network metrics, such as latency and buffer time. Finally, we compare the logics of the best evolved protocols with those of the baseline protocols, and we discuss the generalizability of the results across test cases.},

On one hand, trajectories are usually associated with and affected by user profiles (e.g., a person's daily routines and preferred modes of transportation). On the other hand, an individual's movements are also affected by environmental conditions and interactions with other traffic participants, particularly in urban scenarios (e.g., routing choices due to congestion or road conditions). Such contextual trajectories provide a more realistic representation of the mobility patterns of traffic participants. Due to the lack of such datasets or trace generators, this work presents ConTraSim (<u>Con</u>textual <u>Tra</u>jectory <u>Sim</u>ulation), a novel approach for generating contextual trajectories based on the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator. More specifically, the proposed approach is designed to produce GPS traces annotated by contextual information that mimic the movements of multiple types of traffic participants in urban areas. As a case study, we also generate a sample dataset using the proposed method and compare it to real-world data to demonstrate how well the synthetic data reflects real-world data characteristics.},

abstract = {Software systems are increasingly open, handle large amounts of personal or other sensitive data and are intricately linked with the daily lives of individuals and communities. This poses a range of privacy requirements. Such privacy requirements are typically treated as instances of requirements pertaining to compliance, traceability, access control, verification or usability. Though important, such approaches assume that the scope for the privacy requirements can be established a priori and that such scope does not vary drastically once the system is deployed. User data and information, however, exists in an open, hyper-connected and potentially "unbounded" environment. Furthermore, "privacy requirements - present" and "privacy requirements - future" may differ significantly as the privacy implications are often emergent a posteriori. Effective treatment of privacy requirements, therefore, requires techniques and approaches that fit with the inherent openness and fluidity of the environment through which user data and information flows. This paper surveys state of the art and presents some potential directions in the way privacy requirements should be treated. We reflect on the limitations of existing approaches with regards to unbounded privacy requirements and highlight a set of key challenges for requirements engineering research with regards to managing privacy in such unbounded settings.},

abstract = {Nowadays, we are assisting to three continuously demands from companies: (i) developing analytical applications around Data Warehouse systems (DW) from numerous data sources, (ii) the explicitation the semantic of these sources to reduce heterogeneities and (iii) contextualization of sources. By examining the literature, we identify the existence of several efforts attempting to offer solutions merging these three issues. The merging has been performed partially. To be more concrete, we have identified that the two first demands have been merged. Similarly, the second and the third ones gave raise to contextual ontologies. Unfortunately, all three are not well merged. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology to design multi-contextual semantic DWs. Our approach consists first in merging context and ontologies and then with DWs. Firstly, a connection between ontologies and context model is built at meta model level. Secondly, a formalization of multi-contextual semantic data warehouse is given, followed by a deep description of the most important steps of the data warehouse design. Finally, a case tool and experiments are conducted using a contextualized hospital ontology to show the effectiveness of our approach.},

The larger is the user base, the more difficult it is to control the quality of data that is spread from producers to consumers. This can easily hamper the usability of such systems as the amount of low quality data received by consumers grows uncontrolled. In this paper we propose a novel solution to automatically filter new data injected in event-based systems with the aim of delivering to consumers only content they are actually interested in. Filtering is executed at run-time by first profiling both producers and consumers, and then matching their profiles as new data is produced.},

The network analysis is a time-consuming and labor-intensive activity which requires good network knowledge. Creating a solution which automates the administrator's work can dramatically speed up the analysis process and can make the whole process easier for less experienced administrators. In this paper, we describe a method that uses a predefined set of rules to identify incident patterns. Though this principle is used by many security tools, the new aspect is that the presented approach uses the Wireshark tool which is well known among the administrators, and it is expressive enough to specify complex relations among source data thus being able to detect quite sophisticated attacks. The created rule's format uses the same language as the Wireshark filters.},

In the push to create exascale computing platforms, simply increasing the number of hardware devices is not an acceptable option given the limitations of power consumption, heat dissipation, and programming models which are designed for current hardware platforms. Instead, new hardware technologies, coupled with improved programming abstractions and more autonomous runtime systems, are required to achieve this goal.This position paper presents the design of a new runtime for a new heterogeneous hardware platform being developed to explore energy efficient, high performance computing. By extending and enhancing the OpenCL framework, this work will both simplify the programming of current and future HPC applications, as well as automating the scheduling of data and computation across this new hardware platform. Also, this work explores the use of FPGAs to achieve both the power and performance goals of exascale, as well as utilising the runtime to automatically effect dynamic configuration and reconfiguration of hardware platforms.},

abstract = {AI-based automated decisions are increasingly used as part of new services being deployed to the general public. This approach to building services presents significant potential benefits, such as the reduced speed of execution, increased accuracy, lower cost, and ability to adapt to a wide variety of situations. However, equally significant concerns have been raised and are now well documented such as concerns about privacy, fairness, bias, and ethics. On the consumer side, more often than not, the users of those services are provided with no or inadequate explanations for decisions that may impact their lives. In this article, we report the experience of developing a socio-technical approach to constructing explanations for such decisions from their audit trails, or provenance, in an automated manner. The work has been carried out in collaboration with the UK Information Commissioner’s Office. In particular, we have implemented an automated Loan Decision scenario, instrumented its decision pipeline to record provenance, categorized relevant explanations according to their audience and their regulatory purposes, built an explanation-generation prototype, and deployed the whole system in an online demonstrator.},

The integration of digital economy with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm in recent years has enabled fundamental shifts in development of technology. As a result, massive devices such as sensors and smart objects with divergent capabilities and limited resources (exchangeable energy, processing power, storage capabilities) have commenced to form disordered interactions. In order to improve network performance with subsequent cost-effectiveness and efficient resource utilization an effective distribution of these IoT resources is required. Considering heterogeneity and widespread use of IoT a highly beneficial resource allocation is warranted. In this paper, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) base meta-heuristic is presented which encompasses distribution of blocks of codes. Our findings demonstrate that Particle Swarm Optimization advantages in terms of cost-benefits outweighs other resource allocation algorithm such as Sequential Resource Allocation (SRA) and multi-level graph partitioning.},

abstract = {In urban transportation systems, transfer stations refer to hubs connecting a variety of bus and subway lines and, thus, are the most important nodes in transportation networks. The pervasive availability of large-scale travel traces of passengers, collected from automated fare collection (AFC) systems, has provided unprecedented opportunities for understanding citywide transfer patterns, which can benefit smart transportation, such as smart route recommendation to avoid crowded lines, and dynamic bus scheduling to enhance transportation efficiency. To this end, in this article, we provide a systematic study of the measurement, patterns, and modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics of passenger transfers. Along this line, we develop a data-driven analytical system for modeling the transfer volumes of each transfer station. More specifically, we first identify and quantify the discriminative patterns of spatiotemporal dynamics of passenger transfers by utilizing heterogeneous sources of transfer related data for each station. Also, we develop a multi-task spatiotemporal learning model for predicting the transfer volumes of a specific station at a specific time period. Moreover, we further leverage the predictive model of passenger transfers to provide crowdedness-aware route recommendations. Finally, we conduct the extensive evaluations with a variety of real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modeling method and its applications for smart transportation.},

abstract = {There is an increasing demand for Internet of Things (IoT) systems comprised of resource-constrained sensor and actuator nodes executing increasingly complex applications, possibly simultaneously. IoT devices will not be able to execute computationally expensive tasks and will require more powerful computing nodes, called edge nodes, for such execution, in a process called computation offloading. When multiple powerful nodes are available, a selection problem arises: which edge node should a task be submitted to? This problem is even more acute when the system is subjected to attacks, such as DoS, or network perturbations such as system overload. In this paper, we present a trust model-based system architecture for computation offloading, based on behavioural evidence. The system architecture provides confidentiality, authentication and non-repudiation of messages in required scenarios and will operate within the resource constraints of embedded IoT nodes. We demonstrate the viability of the architecture with an example deployment of Beta Reputation System trust model on real hardware.},

However, most of the SR methods are limited in visual perception, for example, they look too smooth. Generative adversarial network (GAN) favors SR visual effects over most of the deep SR models but is poor in objective criteria. In order to trade off the objective and subjective SR performance, we design a joint-attention discriminator with which GAN improves the SR performance in PSNR and SSIM, as well as maintaining the visual effect compared with non-attention GAN based SR models. The joint-attention discriminator contains dense channel-wise attention and cross-layer attention blocks. The former is applied in the shallow layers of the discriminator for channel-wise weighting combination of feature maps. The latter is employed to select feature maps in some middle and deep layers for effective discrimination. Extensive experiments are conducted on six benchmark datasets and the experimental results show that our proposed discriminator combining with different generators can achieve more realistic visual performances.},

Many issues concerning security and privacy can be resolved if we use data analytics in services to represent data as Resource Description Framework (RDF). The automated transformation mechanism in relational database taken from mobile sensors and applications into semantically annotated RDF stores. This study is comprised of a methodology for refining compatibility between different data models by introducing real-time RDF context model for adopting data to smart querying in mobile applications. Smart querying capabilities come from transformation between sensors with activity services data and RDF data store for mobile applications. Whereas, case study built-up out of applications data is used to show data adaptation process for smart querying for human-care in mobile devices. Multiple queries are used to extract mobile video information smartly and efficiently.

abstract = {The study aims at exploring the Internet of things (IoT) system from the perspective of data and further improving the performance of the IoT system. The IoT data energy collection and information transmission system model is constructed by combining IoT and wireless relay cooperative transmission technology. Moreover, the energy efficiency, outage probability (OP), and accuracy of the model are evaluated by simulation experiments. The results show that, in the energy efficiency analysis, with the increase of power split factor ρ, the information transmission ability of the system increases. Whereas, the energy collection ability decreases, so the energy efficiency is reduced. Thus, choosing a more suitable power split factor for the energy efficiency of IoT is important. By analyzing OP and bit error rate (BER), as the values of m (Nakagami, the fading index of the fading distribution) and multi-hop paths increase, the OP and BER are reduced while the system performance is increased. Therefore, this article uses wireless relay cooperative transmission technology to integrate big data analysis into the IoT system. Finally, by adding multi-hop path and other methods to reduce the OP and BER of system, the system performance is improved. It provides experimental basis for the development of IoT systems.},

abstract = {Internet-based Indoor Navigation Service-Oriented Architectures (IIN-SOA) organize signals collected by IoT-based devices to enable a wide range of novel applications indoors, where people spend 80--90% of their time. In this article, we study the problem of prefetching (or hoarding) the most important IoT data from an IIN-SOA to a mobile device, without knowing its user’s destination during navigation. Our proposed Grap (Graph Prefetching) framework structurally analyzes building topologies to identify important areas that become virtual targets to an online heuristic search algorithm we developed. We tested Grap with datasets from a real IIN-SOA and found it to be impressively accurate.},

abstract = {Fire as a common disaster, because of its perniciousness, which has aroused a lot of attention of public. Fire rescue is one of the most urgent tasks that we need to take care. Normally, firefighters make the rescue plan by the 2D map, but things cannot be predicted well without enough information. And because of the interference of fire, the transmission of data can be easily blocked. In order to play the full potential of the IoT design, and consider all the factors that may influence the indoor-environment to help make the fire rescue. First, we use Raspberry Pi to work as the fog server, Arduino mega 2560 to make the sensor, combined with PC (personal computer) to make the framework of the IoT (Internet of thing) design. And here, we put the crowd and the indoor environment as the main factors. We use PSO-SVM (Particle Swarm Optimization-Support Vector Machine) to reduce the error of prediction, neural network to analysis the image to give the number of people. And according to all the result to make the plan based on a 3D view to help make the rescue. We also make some experiments to show that the algorithms can have a good performance to improve the work.},

abstract = {With ever-increasing number of car-mounted electronic devices that are accessed, managed, and controlled with smartphones, car apps are becoming an important part of the automotive industry. Audio classification is one of the key components of car apps as a front-end technology to enable human-app interactions. Existing approaches for audio classification, however, fall short as the unique and time-varying audio characteristics of car environments are not appropriately taken into account. Leveraging recent advances in mobile sensing technology that allow for effective and accurate driving environment detection, in this paper, we develop an audio classification framework for mobile apps that categorizes an audio stream into music, speech, speech+music, and noise, adaptably depending on different driving environments. A case study is performed with four different driving environments, i.e., highway, local road, crowded city, and stopped vehicle. More than 420 minutes of audio data are collected including various genres of music, speech, speech+music, and noise from the driving environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the average classification accuracy by up to 166%, and 64% for speech, and speech+music, respectively, compared with a non-adaptive approach in our experimental settings.},

abstract = {This paper presents an argued vision on urban acupuncture as a research-based tool to manage urban territories by taking local actions in specific points. We argue that if based on analysis of social media data, urban acupuncture becomes an informative source for e-government and allows to design targeted urban planning decisions minimizing resources and increasing civil participation. While traditional urban acupuncture method relied on expert interviews with architects and urban planners, which is quite biased 'subjective' data source, urban acupuncture based on geo-located data from social media produced by users themselves allows to account for actual social behaviours. Urban acupuncture 2.0., as we name it here, provides insights into citizens' activities and attitudes towards certain city locations and serves as a solid grounding for taking decisions concerning specific territories. Social media data covers the whole city and involves a bigger variety of social groups; due to these specifics of data urban acupuncture 2.0. becomes more informative and representative for taking decisions. In this paper we show urban acupuncture 2.0. approach on the case-study of Samara-city, Russia, and development of its public spaces. Data used is from Vkontakte, Twitter and Instagram social media. We apply series of data mining tools, in particular, PCA and LDA methods, to user-generated texts. Results show popularity of public spaces by time and location, dominant type of activity and dominant type of users. Results also reveal mismatches between functionality of a public space and a type of activity there. Based on these findings recommendations are generated on how to develop Samara public spaces in line with acupuncture approach: targeted interventions deriving from existing citizens' subjective attitudes and habits towards these places are proposed.},

abstract = {This article presents a rigorous step towards design-for-assurance by introducing a new class of logically reconfigurable design resilient to design reverse engineering. Based on the non-volatile spin transfer torque (STT) magnetic technology, we introduce a basic set of non-volatile reconfigurable Look-Up-Table (LUT) logic components (NV-STT-based LUTs). An STT-based LUT with a significantly different set of characteristics compared to CMOS provides new opportunities to enhance design security yet makes it challenging to remain highly competitive with custom CMOS or even SRAM-based LUT in terms of power, performance, and area. To address these challenges, we propose several algorithms to select and replace custom CMOS gates with reconfigurable STT-based LUTs during design implementation such that the functionality of STT-based components and therefore the entire design cannot be determined in any manageable time, rendering any design reverse engineering attack ineffective. Our study, conducted on a large number of standard circuit benchmarks, concludes significant resiliency of hybrid STT-CMOS circuits against various types of attacks. Furthermore, the selection algorithms on average have a small impact on the performance of the circuit. We also tested these techniques against satisfiability attacks developed recently and show that these techniques also render more advanced reverse-engineering techniques computationally infeasible.},

abstract = {Human mobility modeling has many applications in location-based services, mobile networking, city management, and epidemiology. Previous sensing approaches for human mobility are mainly categorized into two types: stationary sensing systems (e.g., surveillance cameras and toll booths) and mobile sensing systems (e.g., smartphone apps and vehicle tracking devices). However, stationary sensing systems only provide mobility information of human in limited coverage (e.g., camera-equipped roads) and mobile sensing systems only capture a limited number of people (e.g., people using a particular smartphone app). In this work, we design a novel system Mohen to model human mobility with a heterogeneous sensing system. The key novelty of Mohen is to fundamentally extend the sensing coverage of a large-scale stationary sensing system with a small-scale sensing system. Based on the evaluation on data from real-world urban sensing systems, our system outperforms them by 35% and achieves a competitive result to an Oracle method.},

abstract = {There is a growing trend for employing cyber-physical systems to help smart homes improve the comfort of residents. However, a residential cyber-physical system is different from a common cyber-physical system since it directly involves human interaction, which is full of uncertainty. The existing solutions could be effective for performance enhancement in some cases when no inherent and dominant human factors are involved. Besides, the rapidly rising interest in the deployments of cyber-physical systems at home does not normally integrate with energy management schemes, which is a central issue that smart homes have to face. In this article, we propose a cyber-physical-system-based energy management framework to enable a sustainable-edge computing paradigm while meeting the needs of home energy management and residents. This framework aims to enable the full use of renewable energy while reducing electricity bills for households. A prototype system was implemented using real-world hardware. The experiment results demonstrated that renewable energy is fully capable of supporting the reliable running of home appliances most of the time and electricity bills could be cut by up to 60% when our proposed framework was employed.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is being deployed in an ever-growing range of applications, from industrial monitoring to smart buildings to wearable devices. Each of these applications has specific computational requirements arising from their networking, system security, and edge analytics functionality. This diversity in requirements motivates the need for adaptable end-devices, which can be re-configured and re-used throughout their lifetime to handle computation-intensive tasks without sacrificing battery lifetime. To tackle this problem, this article presents Chimera, a low-power platform for research and experimentation with reconfigurable hardware for the IoT end-devices. Chimera achieves flexibility and re-usability through an architecture based on a Flash Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) with a reconfigurable software stack that enables over-the-air hardware and software evolution at runtime. This adaptability enables low-cost hardware/software upgrades on the end-devices and an increased ability to handle computationally-intensive tasks. This article describes the design of the Chimera hardware platform and software stack, evaluates it through three application scenarios, and reviews the factors that have thus far prevented FPGAs from being utilized in IoT end-devices.},

abstract = {This paper critiques the idea of full autonomy, as illustrated by Oxford University's Robotcar. A fully autonomous driverless car relies on no external inputs, including GPS and solely learns from its environment using learning algorithms. These cars decide when they drive, learn from human drivers and bid for insurance in real time. Full autonomy is pitched as a good end in itself, fixing human inadequacies and creating safety and certainty by the elimination of human involvement. Using the ACTIVE ethics framework, an ethical response to the fully autonomous driverless cars is developed by addressing autonomy, community, transparency, identity, value and empathy. I suggest that the pursuit of full autonomy does not recognise the essential importance of interdependencies between humans and machines. The removal of human involvement should require the driverless car to be more connected with its environment, drawing all the information it can from infrastructure, internet and other road users. This requires a systemic view, which addresses systems and relationships, which recognises the place of driverless cars in a connected system, which is open to the study of complex relationships, both networked and hierarchical.},

abstract = {A Ground Control Station (GCS) is an essential element to supervise and control autonomous vehicles performing complex missions in real time. In the new era of Internet of Things, where systems are highly connected, these missions demand enormous amounts of computational power to correctly manage the coordination of all the vehicles involved. In this scope, the set of Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) included in the mission must achieve more difficult tasks everyday. As a consequence, the development of a robust, reusable and adaptable GCS framework to allow a single operator to monitor and control a team of heterogeneous agents raises a number of research and engineering challenges. In this paper we introduce an adaptive event-driven framework specially designed for GCSs involved in heterogeneous multi-agent missions that takes advantage of two features: 1) it allows the GCS to add or remove both actual or simulated agents in real time, changing the number or types of monitored agents, and 2) from a software design perspective, the graphical user interface dynamically changes its view in order to minimize operators fatigue and mental workload, facilitating the success of the mission in such complex environments. We also show one of the tests performed with the adaptive framework, where after observing how a real UV deployed in a water surface performs successfully a set of previously planned trajectories, we will see how a simulated UV joins the mission in order to fulfill a leader-follower maneuver.},

abstract = {In 2015, the top 10 largest amusement park corporations saw a combined annual attendance of over 400 million visitors. Daily average attendance in some of the most popular theme parks in the world can average 44,000 visitors per day. These visitors ride attractions, shop for souvenirs, and dine at local establishments; however, a critical component of their visit is the overall park experience. This experience depends on the wait time for rides, the crowd flow in the park, and various other factors linked to the crowd dynamics and human behavior. As such, better insight into visitor behavior can help theme parks devise competitive strategies for improved customer experience. Research into the use of attractions, facilities, and exhibits can be studied, and as behavior profiles emerge, park operators can also identify anomalous behaviors of visitors which can improve safety and operations. In this article, we present a visual analytics framework for analyzing crowd dynamics in theme parks. Our proposed framework is designed to support behavioral analysis by summarizing patterns and detecting anomalies. We provide methodologies to link visitor movement data, communication data, and park infrastructure data. This combination of data sources enables a semantic analysis of who, what, when, and where, enabling analysts to explore visitor-visitor interactions and visitor-infrastructure interactions. Analysts can identify behaviors at the macro level through semantic trajectory clustering views for group behavior dynamics, as well as at the micro level using trajectory traces and a novel visitor network analysis view. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through two case studies of simulated theme park visitors.},

abstract = {Inferring the localness of people is to classify people who are local residents in a city from people who visit the city by analyzing online check-in points that are contributed by online users. This information is critical for the urban planning, user profiling, and localized recommendation systems. Supervised learning approaches have been developed to infer the location of people in a city by assuming the availability of high-quality training datasets with complete geotemporal information. In this article, we develop an unsupervised model to accurately identify local people in a city by using the incomplete online check-in data that are publicly available. In particular, we develop an incomplete geotemporal expectation maximization (IGT-EM) scheme, which incorporates a set of hidden variables to represent the localness of people and a set of estimation parameters to represent the likelihood of venues to attract local and nonlocal people, respectively. Our solution can accurately classify local people from nonlocal nones without requiring any training data. We also implement a parallel IGT-EM algorithm by leveraging the computing power of a graphic processing unit (GPU) that consists of 2,496 cores. In the evaluation, we compare our new approach with the existing solutions through four real-world case studies using data from the New York City, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, DC. The results show that our approach can identify the local people and significantly outperform the compared baselines in estimation accuracy and execution time.},
