abstract = {The machine learning community has been overwhelmed by a plethora of deep learning--based approaches. Many challenging computer vision tasks, such as detection, localization, recognition, and segmentation of objects in an unconstrained environment, are being efficiently addressed by various types of deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent networks, adversarial networks, and autoencoders. Although there have been plenty of analytical studies regarding the object detection or recognition domain, many new deep learning techniques have surfaced with respect to image segmentation techniques. This article approaches these various deep learning techniques of image segmentation from an analytical perspective. The main goal of this work is to provide an intuitive understanding of the major techniques that have made a significant contribution to the image segmentation domain. Starting from some of the traditional image segmentation approaches, the article progresses by describing the effect that deep learning has had on the image segmentation domain. Thereafter, most of the major segmentation algorithms have been logically categorized with paragraphs dedicated to their unique contribution. With an ample amount of intuitive explanations, the reader is expected to have an improved ability to visualize the internal dynamics of these processes.},

abstract = {Deep learning has recently gained popularity achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks involving text, sound, or image processing. Due to its outstanding performance, there have been efforts to apply it in more challenging scenarios, for example, 3D data processing. This article surveys methods applying deep learning on 3D data and provides a classification based on how they exploit them. From the results of the examined works, we conclude that systems employing 2D views of 3D data typically surpass voxel-based (3D) deep models, which however, can perform better with more layers and severe data augmentation. Therefore, larger-scale datasets and increased resolutions are required.},

abstract = {Imitation learning techniques aim to mimic human behavior in a given task. An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications, and highlight current and future research directions.},

abstract = {Active learning (AL) attempts to maximize a model’s performance gain while annotating the fewest samples possible. Deep learning (DL) is greedy for data and requires a large amount of data supply to optimize a massive number of parameters if the model is to learn how to extract high-quality features. In recent years, due to the rapid development of internet technology, we have entered an era of information abundance characterized by massive amounts of available data. As a result, DL has attracted significant attention from researchers and has been rapidly developed. Compared with DL, however, researchers have a relatively low interest in AL. This is mainly because before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few labeled samples, meaning that early AL is rarely according the value it deserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most of this success is due to a large number of publicly available annotated datasets. However, the acquisition of a large number of high-quality annotated datasets consumes a lot of manpower, making it unfeasible in fields that require high levels of expertise (such as speech recognition, information extraction, medical images, etc.). Therefore, AL is gradually coming to receive the attention it is due.It is therefore natural to investigate whether AL can be used to reduce the cost of sample annotation while retaining the powerful learning capabilities of DL. As a result of such investigations, deep active learning (DeepAL) has emerged. Although research on this topic is quite abundant, there has not yet been a comprehensive survey of DeepAL-related works; accordingly, this article aims to fill this gap. We provide a formal classification method for the existing work, along with a comprehensive and systematic overview. In addition, we also analyze and summarize the development of DeepAL from an application perspective. Finally, we discuss the confusion and problems associated with DeepAL and provide some possible development directions.},

abstract = {Event recognition is one of the areas in multimedia that is attracting great attention of researchers. Being applicable in a wide range of applications, from personal to collective events, a number of interesting solutions for event recognition using multimedia information sources have been proposed. On the other hand, following their immense success in classification, object recognition, and detection, deep learning has been shown to perform well in event recognition tasks also. Thus, a large portion of the literature on event analysis relies nowadays on deep learning architectures. In this article, we provide an extensive overview of the existing literature in this field, analyzing how deep features and deep learning architectures have changed the performance of event recognition frameworks. The literature on event-based analysis of multimedia contents can be categorized into four groups, namely (i) event recognition in single images; (ii) event recognition in personal photo collections; (iii) event recognition in videos; and (iv) event recognition in audio recordings. In this article, we extensively review different deep-learning-based frameworks for event recognition in these four domains. Furthermore, we also review some benchmark datasets made available to the scientific community to validate novel event recognition pipelines. In the final part of the manuscript, we also provide a detailed discussion on basic insights gathered from the literature review, and identify future trends and challenges.},

abstract = {In recent years, with rapid technological advancement in both computing hardware and algorithm, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant advantage over human being in a wide range of fields, such as image recognition, education, autonomous vehicles, finance, and medical diagnosis. However, AI-based systems are generally vulnerable to various security threats throughout the whole process, ranging from the initial data collection and preparation to the training, inference, and final deployment. In an AI-based system, the data collection and pre-processing phase are vulnerable to sensor spoofing attacks and scaling attacks, respectively, while the training and inference phases of the model are subject to poisoning attacks and adversarial attacks, respectively. To address these severe security threats against the AI-based systems, in this article, we review the challenges and recent research advances for security issues in AI, so as to depict an overall blueprint for AI security. More specifically, we first take the lifecycle of an AI-based system as a guide to introduce the security threats that emerge at each stage, which is followed by a detailed summary for corresponding countermeasures. Finally, some of the future challenges and opportunities for the security issues in AI will also be discussed.},

Several dimensions of the technology have not been adequately investigated by academia. These dimensions include outline management, security, and standardization. Discovering and highlighting aspects of this technology that may have or have not been covered by academic research is the first step toward helping academia bridge the gap with industry or even go one step further to lead industry in the right direction. This suggests a comprehensive survey on research works in this regard. The literature in this area has already come up with some surveys and taxonomies, but some of them are outdated or do not cover every aspect of CDN while others fail to detect existing trends or to develop a holistic roadmap for research on the technology. Furthermore, none of the existing surveys aim at enlightening the dark aspects of the technology that have not been subject to academic research. In this survey, we first extract the lifecycle of a CDN as suggested by the existing research. Then, we investigate previous relevant works on each phase of the lifecycle to clarify where the research is currently located and headed. We show how CDN technology tends to converge with emerging paradigms such as cloud computing, edge computing, and machine learning, which are more mature in terms of academic research. This helps us determine the right direction for further research by revealing the deficiencies in existing works.},

abstract = {Interaction design for Augmented Reality (AR) is gaining attention from both academia and industry. This survey discusses 260 articles (68.8% of articles published between 2015–2019) to review the field of human interaction in connected cities with emphasis on augmented reality-driven interaction. We provide an overview of Human-City Interaction and related technological approaches, followed by reviewing the latest trends of information visualization, constrained interfaces, and embodied interaction for AR headsets. We highlight under-explored issues in interface design and input techniques that warrant further research and conjecture that AR with complementary Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) is a crucial enabler for ubiquitous interaction with immersive systems in smart cities. Our work helps researchers understand the current potential and future needs of AR in Human-City Interaction.},

abstract = {Wireless indoor positioning has been extensively studied for the past 2 decades and continuously attracted growing research efforts in mobile computing context. As the integration of multiple inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) to nowadays smartphones in recent years, human-centric mobility sensing is emerging and coming into vogue. Mobility information, as a new dimension in addition to wireless signals, can benefit localization in a number of ways, since location and mobility are by nature related in the physical world. In this article, we survey this new trend of mobility enhancing smartphone-based indoor localization. Specifically, we first study how to measure human mobility: what types of sensors we can use and what types of mobility information we can acquire. Next, we discuss how mobility assists localization with respect to enhancing location accuracy, decreasing deployment cost, and enriching location context. Moreover, considering the quality and cost of smartphone built-in sensors, handling measurement errors is essential and accordingly investigated. Combining existing work and our own working experiences, we emphasize the principles and conduct comparative study of the mainstream technologies. Finally, we conclude this survey by addressing future research directions and opportunities in this new and largely open area.},

Sustainability is already well established as a concern and a topic of study and practice, given the alarming increase of environmental degradation, pollution, and other adverse effects of industrialization and urbanization. Computational sustainability, which focuses on the use of effective computational models and computational approaches to help achieve the goal of sustainability, has attracted interest from computer science researchers worldwide. We review recent work on computational techniques applied to a range of domains related to sustainability, from bio-surveillance to poverty mapping, from renewable energy production forecasting to crop disease monitoring, and from agent-based modeling to stochastic network design. In sustainable computing, we discuss some directions that have recently been explored. Finally, we analyze research directions that could be explored in the future to achieve the goal of long-term environmental sustainability.},

abstract = {Autonomous systems will soon be integrating into our lives as home assistants, delivery drones, and driverless cars. The implementation of the level of automation in these systems from being manually controlled to fully autonomous would depend upon the autonomy approach chosen to design these systems. This article reviews the historical evolution of autonomy, its approaches, and the current trends in related fields to build robust autonomous systems. Toward such a goal and with the increased number of cyberattacks, the security of these systems needs special attention from the research community. To gauge the extent to which research has been done in this area, we discuss the cybersecurity of these systems. It is essential to model the system from a security perspective, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, and then model the attacks. A survey in this direction explores the theoretical/analytical system and attack models that have been proposed over the years and identifies the research gap that needs to be addressed by the research community.},

abstract = {Social engineering is used as an umbrella term for a broad spectrum of computer exploitations that employ a variety of attack vectors and strategies to psychologically manipulate a user. Semantic attacks are the specific type of social engineering attacks that bypass technical defences by actively manipulating object characteristics, such as platform or system applications, to deceive rather than directly attack the user. Commonly observed examples include obfuscated URLs, phishing emails, drive-by downloads, spoofed websites and scareware to name a few. This article presents a taxonomy of semantic attacks, as well as a survey of applicable defences. By contrasting the threat landscape and the associated mitigation techniques in a single comparative matrix, we identify the areas where further research can be particularly beneficial.},

abstract = {The use of robots in our daily lives is increasing. Different types of robots perform different tasks that are too dangerous or too dull to be done by humans. These sophisticated machines are susceptible to different types of faults. These faults have to be detected and diagnosed in time to allow recovery and continuous operation. The field of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) has been studied for many years. This research has given birth to many approaches and techniques that are applicable to different types of physical machines. Yet the domain of robotics poses unique requirements that are very challenging for traditional FDD approaches. The study of FDD for robotics is relatively new, and only few surveys were presented. These surveys have focused on traditional FDD approaches and how these approaches may broadly apply to a generic type of robot. Yet robotic systems can be identified by fundamental characteristics, which pose different constraints and requirements from FDD. In this article, we aim to provide the reader with useful insights regarding the use of FDD approaches that best suit the different characteristics of robotic systems. We elaborate on the advantages these approaches have and the challenges they must face. To meet this aim, we use two perspectives: (1) we elaborate on FDD from the perspective of the different characteristics a robotic system may have and give examples of successful FDD approaches, and (2) we elaborate on FDD from the perspective of the different FDD approaches and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each approach with respect to robotic systems. Finally, we describe research opportunities for robotic systems’ FDD. With these three contributions, readers from the FDD research communities are introduced to FDD for robotic systems, and the robotics research community is introduced to the field of FDD.},

The security solutions for such systems need to be adaptive for the continuous satisfaction of the software systems’ security goals. Whilst the existing research on self-adaptive security has made notable advancement towards designing and engineering self-adaptive security solutions, there exists little work on the taxonomic analysis of the architectures of the reported research and its applicability for open and ultra-large environments. We propose an architecture-centric taxonomy for mapping and comparing the current research and identifying the future research directions in this field. The proposed taxonomy has been used to review the representative work on the architectural characteristics that self-adaptive security systems must maintain for their effective application in large-scale open environments. We reflect on the findings from the taxonomic analysis and discuss the design principles, research challenges and limitations reported in the state of the art and practice. We outline the directions for the future research on architectural level support for self-adaptive security systems for large-scale open environments.},

abstract = {Autonomous robots are playing important roles in academic, technological, and scientific activities. Thus, their behavior is getting more complex, particularly, in tasks related to mapping an environment and localizing themselves. These tasks comprise the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. Representation of knowledge related to the SLAM problem with a standard, flexible, and well-defined model, provides the base to develop efficient and interoperable solutions. As many existing works demonstrate, Semantic Web seems to be a clear approach, since they have formulated ontologies, as the base data model to represent such knowledge. In this article, we survey the most popular and recent SLAM ontologies with our aim being threefold: (i) propose a classification of SLAM ontologies according to the main knowledge needed to model the SLAM problem; (ii) identify existing ontologies for classifying, comparing, and contrasting them, in order to conceptualize SLAM domain for mobile robots; and (iii) pin-down lessons to learn from existing solutions in order to design better solutions and identify new research directions and further improvements. We compare the identified SLAM ontologies according to the proposed classification and, finally, we explore new data fields to enrich existing ontologies and highlight new possibilities in terms of performance and efficiency for SLAM solutions.},

Examples of SoS arise in areas such as power grid technology, transport, production, and military enterprises. SoS engineering is challenged by the independence, heterogeneity, evolution, and emergence properties found in SoS. This article focuses on the role of model-based techniques within the SoS engineering field. A review of existing attempts to define and classify SoS is used to identify several dimensions that characterise SoS applications. The SoS field is exemplified by a series of representative systems selected from the literature on SoS applications. Within the area of model-based techniques the survey specifically reviews the state of the art for SoS modelling, architectural description, simulation, verification, and testing. Finally, the identified dimensions of SoS characteristics are used to identify research challenges and future research areas of model-based SoS engineering.},
