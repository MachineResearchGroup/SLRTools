In this paper, we critique ICT's current and projected climate impacts. Peer-reviewed studies estimate ICT's current share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at 1.8%–2.8% of global GHG emissions; adjusting for truncation of supply chain pathways, we find that this share could actually be between 2.1% and 3.9%. For ICT's future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts' projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of policy mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that, without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector's footprint aligned with the Paris Agreement.}

However, they have been rarely included in several energy-related studies due to the complexity of their mechanical and operational systems. The purpose of this research is to propose benchmark metrics to investigate the energy performance of existing and future airport terminal buildings. By using measured data of total 30 existing ones in North America and simulated results of total 90 specific space type models, a more improved multivariate regression model can refine the values for average of energy use. When revalued from their characteristics based on the refined average, energy performance forecasts are improved by from 1.1% to 3.0% as compared to the case of the simple average. In addition, it can be used to define a higher energy baseline reflecting some weights adjusted by the building characteristics and to apply it into the space configurations for new airport terminal buildings.}

In an Internet of Things (IoT) network, the messages are exchanged and routed in an open multiple devices, therefore security is one of the major issue. Hence, the most important requirements in IoT networks is integrity of information, optimized energy consumption and data security. All the group members uses the shared symmetric key called Group Key (GK) for maintaining data confidentiality within a group. A forward and backward secrecy are maintained by redistributing the GK while joining and leaving of a group member. But, when consuming the scarce network resources, the key management includes generation and distribution process causes overhead. In this research study, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is used to design the lightweight and secure Group Communication (GC) and finally, preserved the data integrity by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). By using AES-PKI algorithm, the method achieved secure GCs in network against attacks, lower bandwidth utilization and network overhead in key re-distribution and management operations. In addition, the proposed AES-PKI method ensured the data confidentiality by backward and forward secrecy in key distribution method and also effective against the network mobility in scalable IoT networks. The performance of AES-PKI is validated by simulation dynamic results of energy consumption and packet receiving ratio.}

abstract = {With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) connecting billions of mobile and stationary devices to serve real-time applications, cloud computing paradigms face some significant challenges such as high latency and jitter, non-supportive location-awareness and mobility, and non-adaptive communication types. To address these challenges, edge computing paradigms, namely Fog Computing (FC), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and Cloudlet, have emerged to shift the digital services from centralized cloud computing to computing at edges. In this article, we analyze cloud and edge computing paradigms from features and pillars perspectives to identify the key motivators of the transitions from one type of virtualized computing paradigm to another one. We then focus on computing and network virtualization techniques as the essence of all these paradigms, and delineate why virtualization features, resource richness and application requirements are the primary factors for the selection of virtualization types in IoT frameworks. Based on these features, we compare the state-of-the-art research studies in the IoT domain. We finally investigate the deployment of virtualized computing and networking resources from performance perspective in an edge-cloud environment, followed by mapping of the existing work to the provided taxonomy for this research domain. The lessons from the reviewed are that the selection of virtualization technique, placement and migration of virtualized resources rely on the requirements of IoT services (i.e., latency, scalability, mobility, multi-tenancy, privacy, and security). As a result, there is a need for prioritizing the requirements, integrating different virtualization techniques, and exploiting a hierarchical edge-cloud architecture.}

Hence, in this paper, Artificial intelligence assisted Semantic Internet of Things (AI-SIoT) has been proposed using a wireless sensor network (WSN) for the environmental monitoring system and the real economy. The Artificial Intelligence technique can very effectively analyze data and make precise decisions on the provision of services in different types. This study provides a mathematical framework for the analysis of interdependent aspects of the WSN protocol for communication and design of signal processing. The Internet of Things (IoT) based framework comprises the complete information system from the sensor level to data management about the environment. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides an effective way to analyze the long-term monitoring of environmental data.

An eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing approach performs well in such an uncertain environment, but does not mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem, which evolves with the future Internet of Things (IoT) rollout. In this paper, we propose a multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO) based cognitive radio scheme for the Internet of Things (CR-IoT) with weighted-eigenvalue detection (WEVD) for the analysis of sensing, system throughput, energy efficiency and expected lifetime. In this scheme, each CR-IoT user is being equipped with MIMO antennas; we calculate the WEVD ratio, which is defined as the ratio between the difference of the maximum eigenvalue and minimum eigenvalue to the sum of the maximum eigenvalue and minimum eigenvalue. This mitigates against the spectrum scarcity problem, enhances system throughput, improves energy efficiency, prolongs expected lifetime and lowers error probability. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme; here the WEVD technique demonstrates a better detection gain and enhanced system throughput in comparison to the conventional scheme with eigenvalue based detection (EVD) and ED techniques in a noise uncertainty environment (i.e. SNR < -28). Furthermore, the proposed scheme has a lower energy consumption, prolonged expected lifetime and achieves a low error probability when compared with other schemes like the conventional single-input and single-output (SISO) based CR-IoT scheme with EVD and ED spectrum sensing.}

abstract = {Renewable energy resources (RESs) are highly speared to cover colossal electricity demand. Smart microgrids (SMGs) are engaged with demand-side management (DSM) to save more energy and maximize energy efficiency. Voltage and frequency regulations, CO2 emission, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), RES stochastic nature, and load dynamics are still considered the most SMG challenges. New control and management approaches are needed to overcome these challenges. Internet of Things (IoT) is accomplished to provide adaptive monitoring of energy consumption and ensure an economical and secure operation of the SMG. This paper proposes an advanced DSM and control strategy for an efficient energy management system (EMS) in SMG. An optimal cost-effective EMS operation is firstly introduced based on a two-level genetic algorithm (GA) optimization problem and augmented with the time-of-use pricing (ToU) principle. Secondly, the SMG voltage and frequency are optimally regulated using an improved PID-based mixed sensitivity H-infinity (PID-MSH∞) control scheme while operating in islanded mode. The proposed DSM and control strategy harness the immense IoT aptitudes to ensure an economic and secure operation of the SMG. Finally, a SMG lab-scale prototype is experimentally implemented to realize and validate the proposed DSM and control strategy. The experimental results prove the efficacy of the proposed EMS and the effectiveness of the SMG operation. The results confirm the proposed scheme's capability to get an optimal DSM scheme with reducing the SMG energy cost, emission cost, and PAR. The proposed control scheme accomplishes the SMG voltage and frequency regulations in adherence to IEEE Standard-1547 and provides customers' quality of service while customizing voltage for regulating DSM.}

In this paper, we take advantage of next-generation network technologies to propose a responsive and lightweight framework for smart transportation system which employs blockchain for authentication using fog computing’s improvement over cloud computing for distributed applications to provide an efficient and secure transportation system. We take into account the future technologies of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G) and argue that the integration of B5G technologies, federated learning, blockchain, and edge computing provides the perfect platform necessary for a smart transportation system The evaluation of the proposed framework is done by comparing it to the current cloud-based approach in iFogSim, a popular simulation tool for fog computing research. The evaluation of blockchain-based authentication was done using a customized implementation of blockchain executed in an experimental setup. The simulation results showed that the proposed framework provides superior performance in terms of security, latency, and energy consumption of the system.}

This paradigm shift from CPS to CPSS was mainly attributed to the increasing use of sensor enabled smart devices and the tight link with the users. The concept of CPSS has been around for over a decade and it has gained an increasing attention over the past few years. The evolution to incorporate human aspects in the CPS research has unlocked a number of research challenges. Particularly human dynamics brings additional complexity that is yet to be explored. The exploration to conceptualise the notion of CPSS has been partially addressed in few scientific literatures. Although its conceptualisation has always been use-case dependent. Thus, there is a lack of generic view as most works focus on specific domains. Furthermore the systemic core and design principles linking it with the theory of systems are loose. This work aims at addressing these issues by first exploring and analysing scientific literatures to understand the complete spectrum of CPSS through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Thereby identifying the state-of-the-art perspectives on CPSS regarding definitions, underlining principles and application areas. Subsequently, based on the findings of the SLR, we propose a domain-independent definition and a meta-model for CPSS, grounded in the Theory of Systems. Finally a discussion on feasible future research directions is presented based on the systemic notion and the proposed meta-models.}

This way, any binary classifier can be used to address the original problem, since one classifier is learned for each possible pair of classes. As in every ensemble method, classifier combination becomes a vital step in the classification process. Even though many combination models have been developed in the literature, none of them have dealt with the possibility of reducing the number of generated classifiers after the training phase, i.e., ensemble pruning, since every classifier is supposed to be necessary. On this account, our objective in this paper is two-fold: (1) We propose a transformation of the aggregation step, which lead us to a new combination strategy where instances are classified on the basis of the similarities among score-matrices. (2) This fact allows us to introduce the possibility of reducing the number of binary classifiers without affecting the final accuracy. We will show that around 50% of classifiers can be removed (depending on the base learner and the specific problem) and that the confidence degrees obtained by these base classifiers have a strong influence on the improvement in the final accuracy. A thorough experimental study is carried out in order to show the behavior of the proposed approach in comparison with the state-of-the-art combination models in the One-vs-One strategy. Different classifiers from various Machine Learning paradigms are considered as base classifiers and the results obtained are contrasted with the proper statistical analysis.}

Within a scale of 0.5 km grid, trip production and attraction were stratified according to the traveling intensity, and the critical information related to economy, intermodal connection, land use, and time were also obtained through the multi-source data. The experiment results from an ordinal logistic regression (OLR) analysis show that average house price has a dominating and positive effect on the traveling intensity for both trip production and attraction, followed by land-use factors. However, the effect of scenic spots is found significant only on trip attraction. In addition, shopping is found to insignificantly affect the traveling intensity for both trip production and attraction. Unexpectedly, time factors also have diverse impacts. These findings are expected to help better understand the relationship between urban mobility and built environment factors, providing passengers with better services, and offering useful insights into future urban and transportation planning.}

First of all, an affordable and flexible hardware platform is employed. Secondly, the motion detection algorithm is specifically tailored to involve a very small computational load. Thirdly, a fixed point programming paradigm is followed in implementing the system so as to further reduce the computational requirements.

Such constraints offer an open scope for enhancing the accuracy of optimized user-specific recommendations. Many techniques have been utilized for this, like Particle Swarm Optimization and other evolutionary collaborative filtering algorithms. The proposed approach utilizes the Apriori algorithm to form users’ profiles from the items’ ratings and categorical attributes. The user profile creation is performed using the apriori algorithm. The profile of each user involves the likes and disliking of categorical characteristics of objects by users.

This paper presents a Multi-local Collaborative AutoEncoder (MC-AE), which consists of novel multi-local collaborative representation RBM (mcrRBM) and multi-local collaborative representation GRBM (mcrGRBM) models. Here, the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) method is used to divide the input data into multi-local cross blocks which contains multi-local collaborative relationships of the unlabeled data and features since the similar multi-local instances and features of the input data are divided into the same block. In mcrRBM and mcrGRBM models, the structure and multi-local collaborative relationships of unlabeled data are integrated into their encoding procedure. Then, the local hidden features converges on the center of each local collaborative block. Under the collaborative joint influence of each local block, the proposed MC-AE has powerful capability of representation learning for unsupervised clustering. However, our MC-AE model perhaps perform training process for a long time on the large-scale and high-dimensional datasets because more local collaborative blocks are integrate into it. Five most related deep models are compared with our MC-AE. The experimental results show that the proposed MC-AE has more excellent capabilities of collaborative representation and generalization than the contrastive deep models.}

abstract = {Due to the large scale of the typical deployments and the involvement of moving objects to the Internet of Things, participating nodes opportunistically establish data exchanging connections, spanning across multiple organizations and security domains. This opportunistic behavior causes the impossibility of defining valid security policies to rule node authorization, and the ineffectiveness of traditional static access control models based on roles or attributes. Trust management is a promising solution to complement these conventional rules and models by realizing a more dynamic security approach and regulating connection request acceptance or rejection based on monitored behaviors. As a centralized authority cannot be established within multi-tenant and large scale infrastructures, decentralized approaches have recently emerged, supported by the blockchain technology, and applied to the case of useful Internet of Things implementations. However, they are vulnerable to possible attacks aiming at discrediting honest nodes (by lowering their trust degree) and/or redeem malicious nodes (by increasing their trust degree). The widely-accepted protection consists of securing the communications by using SSL/TLS, and restricting the nodes allowed to update the trust degree. However, they are known to be ineffective against compromised nodes that, despite holding legitimate security claims and cryptographic material, they deviate from the correct behavior by sending false and mendacious scores. This work proposes to exploit on game theory to realize robust decentralized trust management able to tolerate malicious nodes sending mendacious scores. Explicitly, a signaling node has been formalized to model the interactions between the IoT and the edge nodes by refusing potentially untrue scores. Moreover, the evolutionary Dempster-Shafer theory is used to combine the collected scores to update nodes’ trust degrees, by excluding diverging scores far from the majority. Such solutions have been implemented within the context of a blockchain-supported trust management solution for IoT, and an empirical assessment is provided to show the quality of the proposed approach.}

The paper proposes NexT, a next-place prediction framework, which exploits LBSNs data to forecast the next location of an individual based on the observations of her mobility behavior over some period of time and the recent locations that she has visited (individuals typical mobility routines) and on global mobility in the considered geographic area (e.g., mobility routines of all the Twitter users). The approach integrates frequent pattern mining and feature-based supervised classification, exploiting a set of spatio-temporal features characterizing locations and movements among them. The features are combined into a decision tree prediction model. The experimental evaluation, performed on real-world tweets shows the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach in predicting users next places, achieving a remarkable accuracy and prediction rate, outperforming state-of-the art approaches.}

Large-scale deployments of wireless sensor networks (WSN) involving hundreds or thousands of devices and limited budgets often constrain the choice of sensing hardware, which generally has reduced accuracy, precision, and reliability. Therefore, it is challenging to achieve good data quality and maintain error-free measurements during the whole system lifetime. Self-calibration or recalibration in ad hoc sensor networks to preserve data quality is essential, yet challenging, for several reasons, such as the existence of random noise and the absence of suitable general models. Calibration performed in the field, without accurate and controlled instrumentation, is said to be in an uncontrolled environment. This paper provides current and fundamental self-calibration approaches and models for wireless sensor networks in uncontrolled environments.}

In previous studies, the natural correspondence across multi-source geospatial data has often been ignored in the description of one object, which would influence the performance of data fusion. Therefore, this study introduces the cross-correlations mechanism to achieve the natural correspondence by taking remote sensing images, point of interest (POI), and real-time social media users as an example. It proposes a new cross-correlations based functional urban land use (CC-FLU) model to infer urban functions. The presented model extracts physical and human semantic features from multi-source geospatial data, then maps them to their common subspaces to obtain their cross-correlations respectively. These semantic features and their cross-correlations are integrated together to classify urban functions. An experiment in Shenzhen, China was implemented to evaluate the performance of the presented model at a fine scale. The results show that the proposed CC-FLU model achieved a better performance than previous methods, yielding OA and Kappa values of 0.851 and 0.812, respectively. The results of the presented approach outperform those of methods using one single source geospatial data. The results demonstrate that the skilled information of each type of geospatial data is fully melted into the data fusion model, and simultaneously achieves the natural correspondence across multi-source geospatial data. Moreover, this study resolves the possible disadvantages of models using one single source data and fusion methods by sequentially concatenating multi-source features. The results will benefit urban planners and urban policy-makers.}

To address measurement scarcity problem in distribution systems, this paper proposes a distribution system state estimation framework that relies on robust pseudo-measurement modeling. User-level metering data is used to train gradient boosting tree models for generating pseudo-measurements. A ladder iterative state estimator is then applied on the pseudo-measurements to solve for system states. Simulation studies are performed on the IEEE 13-bus and 123-bus test feeders.

Specifically, each of the connected vehicles can be regarded as an agent which is able to communicate and collaborate with others based on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technologies. A case study on distributed traffic control system without traffic signal is presented in this paper. In particular, we consider traffic control at intersection problem as a group mutual exclusion problem where only connected vehicles in non-conflict relationship are able to enter the core of intersection simultaneously. Therefore, we extend the Ricart–Agrawala based-logical clock algorithm to deal with this problem. Various parameters (e.g., number of message exchange, average waiting time, total number of vehicle passing) have been measured to evaluate our approach. The simulated results show that our approach outperforms compared with existing traffic systems and previous works.}

Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) represent the critical enablers of 5G technology with the development of next-generation intelligent vehicular networks and applications. In recent years, researchers have focused on the integration of SDN and VANET, and looked at different topics related to the architecture, the benefits of software-defined VANET services, and the new functionalities to adapt them. However, the security and robustness of the complete architecture is still questionable and have been largely neglected by the research community. Moreover, the deployment and integration of different entities and several architectural components drive new security threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, first, we survey the state-of-the-art SDN based Vehicular ad-hoc Network (SDVN) architectures for their networking infrastructure design, functionalities, benefits, and challenges. Then we discuss these architectures against major security threats that violate the key security services such as availability, privacy, authentication, and data integrity. We also discuss different countermeasures for these threats. Finally, we present the lessons learned with the directions of future research work towards provisioning stringent security solutions in new SDVN architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that presents a comprehensive survey and security analysis on SDVN architectures, and we believe that it will help researchers to address various challenges (e.g., flexible network management, control and high resource utilization, and scalability) in vehicular communication systems which are required to improve the future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).}

abstract = {Consider a fleet of N autonomous electric vehicles (EVs), where EV n has a battery state βn. Customers arrive at rate λ and each customer requests a trip that costs some battery charge b. The goal is to coordinate the pick-ups and charging of the fleet in order to minimize the discounted number of unpicked customers over an infinite time horizon. Solving the dynamic program for this scheduling problem is infeasible since the state space has an exponential size in N. We propose a distributed approach instead where each EV models the fleet as a "field" that picks the customer i.i.d. at random with some pick-up probability α (b). Based on this model, each EV computes its optimal charging and pick-up strategy, and reports which customer they are available to pick-up (as a function of b) or if they decided to charge. The server computes a maximal matching between customers and EVs, taking into account their reported availability. The process continues iteratively as each EV recomputes its optimal response to the new empirical α (b). We prove that the optimal local strategy is a threshold policy with respect to βn, where the threshold depends on α (b) and b. We also prove that the empirical pick-up probability α (b) converges to the true stationary probability, which explains why our algorithm converges to an equilibrium. We then study our algorithm in simulations, that show that at equilibrium, its performance is significantly better than that of an uncoordinated charging strategy. Therefore, our solution has low-complexity but is still sophisticated enough to coordinate the charging of the fleet.}

Exploring POI configurations of urban regions facilitates to understand their functionalities, vibrancy, and developments. However, current studies and applications mainly make statistics toward POI counts on various types separately, neglecting the implicit semantic relations between different types and failing to uncover POI-configuration patterns intuitively. This study proposes a novel framework for visualizing and exploring POIs on POI-type semantic space, with semantic relations of the types being considered. Firstly, using a word-embedding technique (i.e., Word2Vec), the embeddings of POI types are learned from their neighborships on geographic space. Secondly, using a dimension-reduction technique (i.e., t-SNE), all POI-type embeddings are mapped onto 2-dimensional semantic space, where related or similar types would be nearer to each other. Finally, taking the POI-type semantic space as a “base map”, POI configuration of each region is rendered as a “thematic map” by POI counts on various types, which can help intuitively understand and conveniently compare urban regions. The proposed framework can be applied to any urban region and any POI data source, which provides an effective information delivery method for urban planning and POI related urban studies and applications.}

While the challenges that AI creates for democratic responsiveness and accountability have a novel technological dimension, they are nonetheless in continuity with existing transparency and accountability problems. Avoiding a negative impact will require institutionalizing suitable governance mechanisms – a task that is challenging already at the throughout and output level, but particularly difficult, and important, at the input level of politics.}

Nevertheless, simulators are usually tailor-made for a specific application. This paper proposes an original approach, an architecture for a software tool capable of simulating any electric power system application, the first energy-oriented meta-simulator. This tool would only require the definition of a set of behavior rules, easing the process of developing new simulators aimed at the energy sector. Its applications range from pure software simulators, that could be used with, for example, benchmarking, decision-making or competition purposes, to applications monitoring and controlling energy assets in real-time, such as hardware devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, or power plants) or digital twins. The proposed architecture resulted by studying previous tools and simulators with the objective of finding common blocks and elements to abstract them. For this reason, the proposed architecture intents to encompass any tool that aims to model the energy sector. Additionally, the proposed architecture is compliant with lightweight Internet of Things (IoT) protocols and smart systems and supports the synchronization with other frameworks at different levels.}

abstract = {In the trackers based on correlation filter, the limitation of tracking samples and the efficiency of the solution affect the performance of the trackers. Based on the Discriminative Scale Space Tracking(DSST), we proposed a new framework to improve correlation filter tracking via context fusion and subspace constraint. First, the target and background are jointly modeled to enhance the ability to distinguish between target and background. Second, to achieve higher robustness, subspace constraint is applied to DSST, and it can be solved efficiently by subspace-based alternating direction method of multipliers(SADMM). Finally, through the model update strategy, high-quality samples are selected to update. The proposed algorithm is validated on the OTB2013, OTB2015 and TC128. Experimental results show that compared with fast DSST(fDSST), success rate and accuracy of the proposed method are increased by 4.2% and 6.8% respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art trackers, the proposed method achieves a competitive result with real-time speed.}

Second, a hierarchical adaptive fusion (HAF) is constructed to fulfill the complementary strengths of different-level salient features.

Handling changes in user habits is a significant technical challenge in activity recognition. Ideally, a model should adapt to newly emerging classes and concept drift dynamically. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised class incremental learning method, namely, disagreement-based class incremental random forest (Di-CIRF). The proposed model can detect newly emerging classes and update a previously established activity recognition model through streaming data. First, it is necessary to identify novel candidates by employing the disagreement-based confidence voting mechanism and minimum bounding box (MBB)-based separation detection to annotate newly emerging data accurately. Then, the coarse coding-based cohesion detection strategy is adopted to filter out the true novelty instances. This paper also proposes the iterative MBB-based splitting strategy and the pseudo-instance generation mechanism in Di-CIRF for updating the activity model without retaining the trained data. According to experimental results on four public activity recognition datasets, Di-CIRF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}

IoV promises to enable a myriad of vehicular applications and is committed to providing road safety above all things. However, to take full advantage of IoV, an adequate coordination between IoV, the emerging technologies and the existing ones must be achieved. In this paper, we show how these technologies help existing and future driving-support systems and propose an integrated fuzzy-based driving-support system for real-time risk management that considers many parameters, including the vehicle technical condition (VTC). The proposed system considers the current condition of parameters that could impact the driver and the vehicle performance to assess the risk level. The parameters include the vehicle speed, weather and road condition, and factors that affect the driver’s ability to drive, such as his/her current health condition and the inside environment in which he/she is driving, in addition to the VTC. The data for input parameters can come from different sources, such as on-board and on-road sensors and cameras, and from communications between vehicles and infrastructure based on the penetration of IoV. We show through simulations the effect of the considered parameters on the evaluation of the driving risk and demonstrate a few actions that can be performed accordingly. When the risk remains less than 0.2 the driving situation is marked as safe, otherwise an alarm is generated and the appropriate actions are taken. A VTC less or equal than 0.5 causes an alarm even if all the other parameters are in good conditions.}

These include real-time power balance, control of bi-directional energy flow, power quality, distributed optimization, state estimation and topology estimation in distribution grids, and multi-level electricity trading. To overcome these challenges and to create situational awareness in energy grids, pervasive sensing becomes essential. To overcome hurdles such as implementation and cost of such pervasive sensing, in addition to traditional contact-sensing methods, contactless sensors that can measure key variables in the grid needs to be leveraged. Contactless sensing enables measurement of process variables that may be hard to measure due to technological limitations of contact sensing, large measurement delays, or high costs. In addition to contactless sensing, pervasive sensing proves advantageous as it can leverage ongoing technological advances in Internet of Things (IoT), as they can lead to enhanced network connectivity between sensors as well as between the edge and the cloud. Finally, pervasive sensing proves even more attractive by integrating contactless sensing not only with wireless communication but also with shielding and energy harvesting. This paper reviews pervasive sensing techniques in power grids that encompass contactless sensing technologies, IoT connectivity, energy harvesting and shielding. In addition, we also explore how pervasive sensing in a Cyber-Enabled Grid (CEG) can contribute to the development roadmap of Autonomous Energy Grids (AEGs), a futuristic concept where the grid will be making automated operational decisions. The potential challenges and research opportunities in this pioneering research field such as data deluge, cybersecurity, and sensor fusion will be discussed. This review article, which addresses the role of pervasive sensing in CEGs, is a first of its kind. It will help engineers and scientists to understand its significant potential to shape future energy systems.}

The full range of use for these observations by water suppliers is only beginning to be realized. Potential applications include leak detection, improved demand forecasting, variable water pricing, and improved network operations. Here we develop an approach for the classification of demand patterns and apply this approach to a set of demands collected from smart meters within a single District Metered Area (DMA) of a municipal network. The goal of this work is to develop a robust procedure for classification of demands derived from smart metering and test this procedure on observational data. A fundamental aspect of many feature classification tools is representation of what are often complex and noisy data in a low dimensional feature space that captures the important attributes of the signal. In this work, we employ Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM's) as the basis set for representing demand patterns. GMM's provide a flexible approach to representing the temporal demand patterns with a relatively small number of parameters. The values of these parameters then serve as the feature set for multivariate classification. A data set of hourly demand readings spanning a six-month study period serve as the test case for analysis here. The smart meters record demands to both residential and commercial consumers. Results show that the GMM approach captures variations in the demand patterns between locations. To the first order, the identified patterns appear to be explained by the differences between residential and commercial consumers. The resulting groupings are compared to classifications made using total demand as the sole feature. The stability of the patterns over time is tested by independently clustering each month of data.}

Three dimensional city model utilizes light detection and ranging data that covers an area of 5400 km2 for the whole city. The main object classes such as ground, building, vegetation were derived, buildings are vectorized and a digital elevation model are used for the generation of a second level of detail. Using the geometric data of the buildings in Istanbul as input to the developed software, the electricity production of panels is calculated on the suitable roofs of the buildings considering the observed climatic conditions and solar radiation for the city. A photovoltaic weather mobile vehicle measurement system was designed and applied for verification of developed model in eight different areas of Istanbul for stationing 50 days at each location. Results of difference between measurements and calculations of solar irradiation and electrical energy production are 2.44% and 14.70%, respectively. Batch processing was performed on 39 districts of Istanbul with 1.3 million buildings and annual electrical energy production from the roofs of all buildings is calculated to be 30.8 TWh at the point of common coupling to the utility. Total rooftop electricity production of Istanbul has a potential to meet 67% of the total electricity consumption for the year 2019.}

However, the existing data storage schemes are not suitable for processing the gathered data in blockchain enabled edge computing and the efficiency of the data error locating in the previous schemes is very low. In this paper, a secure distributed data storage scheme is proposed, which can be used in blockchain enabled edge computing. In the design of the proposed scheme, the technologies of bilinear pairing and BLS-HLA (BLS-Homomorphic Linear Authenticator) are used, which allows end clients to check the uploaded data storage. In addition, the mechanisms of error locating and data dynamics are supported due to the utilization of CBF (Counting Bloom Filter).

However, there is a limited understanding of the factors influencing citizens' user experience when services supported by AI-based SST are provided. Thus, with insights from the Consumer Value Theory, this paper aims to explore the factors that are important to AI-based SST user experience and the conditional role of trust in government. The on-site survey of 379 citizens in a public service center in China indicates that user experience positively relates to personalization and aesthetics and negatively associates with perceived time spent on the AI-based self-service machines. In addition, the results suggest that citizens with more trust in government are more likely to have a pleasant experience coming from AI-based SST's personalization and aesthetics. Public managers should ensure that the AI-based SST is aesthetically appealing and should be able to personalize the delivery of the right contents to the right person at the right time. Furthermore, they should always prioritize cultivating more trust from citizens to achieve a more positive user experience.}

abstract = {The ameliorations in high-precision phasor measurement units (μPMUs) and synchrophasor units have accommodated the distribution grid with peculiar visibility. Therefore, investigating the challenges of uncertainty consideration on precise fault detection in microgrids has become a new research milestone. This paper presents an effective data-driven stochastic method that justifies the adoption of only two μPMUs that are communicating under an IoT-based umbrella to detect and allocate irregularities in a microgrid. The proposed method has the ability to operate under a variety of case studies and scenarios including but not limited to the capacitor bank switching, distributed energy resources (DERs) diversity and high impedance fault occurrence, whilst considering the uncertainty in load, without installing individual sensors. Furthermore, a two-point estimate approach is utilized to model the uncertainties of the problem. Not only does the proposed stochastic framework benefit from the voltage magnitude measurement, but it also utilizes its angle in event allocation, which manifests better performance compared to ordinary voltage and current sensors. The simulation results on the proposed microgrid indicate the high accuracy and a sound success is obtained under a variety of case studies. The results show the high accuracy and applicable aspect of the proposed data-driven approach for fault allocation using a few μPMUs in the IoT context.}

To deal with the enormous volumes of trade customs administrations rely more and more on information technology (IT) and risk assessment, and are starting to explore the possibilities that data analytics (DA) can offer to support their supervision tasks. Driven by customs as our empirical domain, we explore the use of DA to support the supervision role of government. Although data analytics is considered to be a technological breakthrough, there is so far only a limited understanding of how governments can translate this potential into actual value and what are barriers and trade-offs that need to be overcome to lead to value realisation. The main question that we explore in this paper is: How to identify the value of DA in a government supervision context, and what are barriers and trade-offs to be considered and overcome in order to realise this value? Building on leading models from the information system (IS) literature, and by using case studies from the customs domain, we developed the Value of Data Analytics in Government Supervision (VDAGS) framework. The framework can help managers and policy-makers to gain a better understanding of the benefits and trade-offs of using DA when developing DA strategies or when embarking on new DA projects. Future research can examine the applicability of the VDAGS framework in other domains of government supervision.}

The main innovation of the method is matching the data collected by multiple sensors to form a fusion feature waveform for a single vehicle.

Hyper-spectral data-based estimation of nitrogen allows for a low-cost, effective and environmentally beneficial diagnosis of plant growth. In this paper, a novel approach to characterize the Total Nitrogen Content (TNC) from canopy spectral reflectance through a fractional order derivative (FOD) and optimized spectral indices (NDSI, RSI) is proposed. A total of 60 sampling plots designed in field experiments, canopy spectral data and total nitrogen content are tested for each plot. Optimized remote sensing indices derived from FOD spectra were applied to investigate sensitive wavebands; finally, a Support Vector Machine Regression model for estimating cotton TNC was generated. Our results showed that small FOD orders improved the spectral resolution and provided abundant absorption features; as the orders increased, the spectral strength decreased and the curves were smoothed gradually. The coefficient of correlation (R) peak appeared at the 1.25 order with a value of 0.652. The coefficient of determination (R2) between TNCs and optimized spectral indices peaked at NDSI beyond the 1.5 order (R2 = 0.592). Fourteen TNC estimation models were created via SVR methods using optimized spectral indices. Modeling results indicated that the optimal model was original reflectance-RSI, where the highest R2 was 0.784, the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) was 1.333, and the residual prediction deviation (RPD) was 1.80. Overall, FOD can potentially exploit spectral characteristics and eliminate spectral redundancy. However, original reflectance still shows a high potential for accurate predictions of the total nitrogen content in cotton.}

To achieve this purpose, an improved observer merging the benefits of a piecewise switched linear traffic (PWSL) modeling approach and Kalman filter (KF) is introduced. The PWSL-KF observer is utilized as a virtual sensor to emulate the traffic evolution in free-flow mode. In the proposed approach, residuals from the PWSL-KF model are used as the input to k-nearest neighbors (kNN) schemes for congestion detection. Here, kNN-based Shewhart and exponential smoothing schemes are designed for discovering the traffic congestions. The proposed detectors merge the desirable properties of kNN to appropriately separating normal from abnormal features and the capability of the monitoring schemes to better identify traffic congestions. In addition, kernel density estimation has been utilized to set nonparametric control limits of the proposed detectors and compared them with their parametric counterparts. Tests on traffic measurements from the four-lane State Route 60 in California freeways show the effectiveness of the PWSL-KF-based kNN methods in supervising traffic congestions.}

abstract = {Insurance plays a crucial role in human efforts to adapt to environmental hazards. Effective insurance can serve as both a measure to distribute, and a method to communicate risk. In order for insurance to fulfil these roles successfully, policy pricing and cover choices must be risk-based and founded on accurate information. This is reliant on a robust evidence base forming the foundation of policy choices. This paper focuses on the evidence available to insurers and emergent innovation in the use of data. The main risk considered is coastal flooding, for which the insurance sector offers an option for potential adaptation, capable of increasing resilience. However, inadequate supply and analysis of data have been highlighted as factors preventing insurance from fulfilling this role. Research was undertaken to evaluate how data are currently, and could potentially, be used within risk evaluations for the insurance industry. This comprised of 50 interviews with those working and associated with the London insurance market. The research reveals new opportunities, which could facilitate improvements in risk-reflective pricing of policies. These relate to a new generation of data collection techniques and analytics, such as those associated with satellite-derived data, IoT (Internet of Things) sensors, cloud computing, and Big Data solutions. Such technologies present opportunities to reduce moral hazard through basing predictions and pricing of risk on large empirical datasets. The value of insurers' claims data is also revealed, and is shown to have the potential to refine, calibrate, and validate models and methods. The adoption of such data-driven techniques could enable insurers to re-evaluate risk ratings, and in some instances, extend coverage to locations and developments, previously rated as too high a risk to insure. Conversely, other areas may be revealed more vulnerable, which could generate negative impacts for residents in these regions, such as increased premiums. However, the enhanced risk awareness generated, by new technology, data and data analytics, could positively alter future planning, development and investment decisions.}

We study how the usage of algorithms for managerial decisions affects procedural justice as reported by public employees. We argue that some public management practices may be more suitable for algorithmic decision-making than others. We hypothesize that employees' perceptions differ depending on the complexity of the practice at hand. We test this through two survey experiments on 109 Dutch public employees and 126 public employees from the UK. Our results show that when a decision is made by an algorithm for practices that are low in complexity, procedural justice increases. Our results also show that, for practices that are high in complexity, decisions involving a public manager are perceived as higher in procedural justice compared to decisions that were made automatically by computers using algorithms. Nevertheless, adding an algorithm to a public manager's decision-making process can increase procedural justice for high complexity practices. We conclude that managers should explore automation opportunities for low complexity practices, but to be cautious when using algorithms to replace public managers' decisions for high complexity practices. In the latter case, transparency about algorithms and open dialogues on perceptions could be beneficial, but this should not be seen as a panacea.}

This narrative takes sociomaterial arrangements for granted and conceptualizes technology affordance - the problem-solving capability of a technology - as a standard built-in feature that automatically activates during technology deployment, leading to undiversified and predetermined collective benefits. This paper demonstrates that not everything is as it seems; implementing a technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for triggering its potential problem-solving capability. The potential affordance and effects of a technology are mediated by the sociomaterial arrangements that users assemble to connect their goals to the materiality of technological artifacts and socio-organizational context in which technology deployment takes place. To substantiate this argument and illustrate the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements, we build on sociomateriality and technology affordance theory, and we present the results of a systematic review of Covid-19 literature in which 2187 documents are examined. The review combines text data mining, co-occurrence pattern recognition, and inductive coding, and it focuses on four digital technologies that public authorities have deployed as virus containment measures: infrared temperature-sensing devices; ICT-based surveillance and contact-tracing systems; bioinformatic tools and applications for laboratory testing; and electronic mass communications media. Reporting on our findings, we add nuances to the academic debate on sociomateriality, technology affordance, and the governance of technology in public health crises.

This unsupervised application is named as ‘conceptualization’. This conceptualization technique is also tested with real-time video data in an internet of things (IoT) architecture. The merits of rough sets in the framework of granular computing are explored to execute the task. The proposed method is designed for the video sequences that are acquired by simple static RGB sensors. Here the video sequences are granulated with our newly defined ‘motion granules’ and then those are modeled as rough sets over this granulation for moving object/ background estimation. Video conceptualization is performed afterwards by quantifying the approximation with a new measure, namely, motion entropy. The values obtained by this measure reflect the amount of uncertainty present in the motion of each individual moving object which enables precognition of events. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with extensive experiments in identifying the different motion patterns present in a video sequence. The frames with possibilities of events present therein are identified with this analysis. Both offline and real-time sequences are used for this verification. An IoT architecture is formed to test the proposed algorithm with physical devices in identifying the frames containing possible events.}

abstract = {In recent years, with the continuous expansion of metropolitan area networks, the routing security problem has become more and more serious. In particular, promise-violating attack to inter-domain routing protocol is one of the most difficult attacks to defend, which always leads to serious consequences, such as maliciously attracting traffic and disrupting the network. To deal with such attack, current research generally adopts routing verification. However, it can only detect attacks violating a specific routing policy triggered by one malicious node, and no research has yet solved the problem caused by multiple collusion nodes. In this paper, we propose BRVM, a blockchain-based routing verification model, to address the issue that violating the shortest AS Path policy. The main idea of BRVM is to construct a route proof chain to verify whether a route violates the policy with the help of the blockchain technology. The precondition that avoiding the collusion attack is that the proportion of the malicious verification nodes is lower than the fault tolerance rate of the consensus algorithm. Then, we prove the correctness of BRVM in theory, and implement a prototype based on Quagga and Hyperledger Fabric. Some experiments on this prototype show that BRVM can indeed solve the promise-violating problem caused by multiple collusion nodes, and about 15.5% faster in performance compared with SPIDeR.}

The convergence of these disciplines proceeds from both an improved appreciation of the fundamental relationships between the disciplines and from the technological developments that have brought measurement and computing ever closer together. The paper points to the underlying relationships between measurement science and computer science and suggests that these relationships can form a principled basis for tackling the design challenges that technological convergence presents.

However, it is labor-intensive to manually annotate the semantic labels for these data, posing the challenge of label insufficiency to the vehicle classification tasks. In this context, we use a semi-supervised learning model to classify vehicle types, which only needs a small number of pre-labeled data and propagates these labels to the rest data at hand. In our model, we combine multiple features via fusing their affinity matrices to enhance the classification accuracy. We conduct several experiments to validate our method on a public vehicle dataset. Experimental results support the effectiveness of our method.}

The calibration of BEM helps to ensure the accuracy of the model, whereas it remains a challenge. Conventional manual or automated methods are mostly deterministic and neglect the inherent uncertainties of BEM. In comparison, the recent development of the stochastic BEM calibration based on Bayesian inference has gained attention, whereas many are baffled by its underlying theory, strengths, limitations, and implementations. There are also various mathematical models and tools in the literature, making it hard for selection. This paper aims to unravel the myths about the Bayesian inference and critically review various implementation options with a series of model selections suggested so that a user would be able to employ the Bayesian inference calibration at the end of the paper. We also hope that the review contributes to facilitating a broader implementation of the method for BEM calibrations. First, an overview is summarized for the current status and development of Bayesian inference calibration in building energy modeling. Second, the theory and methodology of model calibration, Bayesian statistics, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo are illustrated. Third, the implementation of Bayesian inference is described, including several practical issues such as BEM determination, unknown calibration parameters number, their ranges and distributions, Meta-model selections, and programming languages based on the statistical package R. The review ends with conclusions and future work identified.}

Swarm Intelligence (SI), a major branch of artificial intelligence, was rendered to model the collective behavior of social swarms in nature. Ultimately, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is arguably one of the most popular SI paradigms. Over the past two decades, PSO has been applied successfully, with good return as well, in a wide variety of fields of science and technology with a wider range of complex optimization problems, thereby occupying a prominent position in the optimization field. However, through in-depth studies, a number of problems with the algorithm have been detected and identified; e.g., issues regarding convergence, diversity, and stability. Consequently, since its birth in the mid-1990s, PSO has witnessed a myriad of enhancements, extensions, and variants in various aspects of the algorithm, specifically after the twentieth century, and the related research has therefore now reached an impressive state. In this paper, a rigorous yet systematic review is presented to organize and summarize the information on the PSO algorithm and the developments and trends of its most basic as well as of some of the very notable implementations that have been introduced recently, bearing in mind the coverage of paradigm, theory, hybridization, parallelization, complex optimization, and the diverse applications of the algorithm, making it more accessible. Ease for researchers to determine which PSO variant is currently best suited or to be invented for a given optimization problem or application. This up-to-date review also highlights the current pressing issues and intriguing open challenges haunting PSO, prompting scholars and researchers to conduct further research both on the theory and application of the algorithm in the forthcoming years.}

abstract = {The evolving trends of mobility, cloud computing and collaboration have blurred the perimeter separating corporate networks from the wider world. These new tools and business models enhance productivity and present new opportunities for competitive advantage although they also introduce new risks. Currently, security is one of the most limiting issues for technological development in fields such as Internet of Things or Cyber-physical systems. This work contributes to the cyber security research field with a design that can incorporate advanced scheduling algorithms and predictive models in a parallel and distributed way, in order to improve intrusion detection in the current scenario, where increased demand for global and wireless interconnection has weakened approaches based on protection tasks running only on specific perimeter security devices. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework to properly distribute intrusion detection system (IDS) tasks, considering security requirements and variable availability of computing resources. To accomplish this, we propose a novel approach, which promotes the integration of personal and enterprise computing resources with externally supplied cloud services, in order to handle the security requirements. For example, in a business environment, there is a set information resources that need to be specially protected, including data handled and transmitted by small mobile devices. These devices can execute part of the IDS tasks necessary for self-protection, but other tasks could be derived to other more powerful systems. This integration must be achieved in a dynamic way: cloud resources are used only when necessary, minimizing utility computing costs and security problems posed by cloud, but preserving local resources when those are required for business processes or user experience. In addition to satisfying the main objective, the strengths and benefits of the proposed framework can be explored in future research. This framework provides the integration of different security approaches, including well-known and recent advances in intrusion detection as well as supporting techniques that increase the resilience of the system. The proposed framework consists of: (1) a controller component, which among other functions, decides the source and target hosts for each data flow; and (2) a switching mechanism, allowing tasks to redirect data flows as established by the controller scheduler. The proposed approach has been validated through a number of experiments. First, an experimental DIDS is designed by selecting and combining a number of existing IDS solutions. Then, a prototype implementation of the proposed framework, working as a proof of concept, is built. Finally, singular tests showing the feasibility of our approach and providing a good insight into future work are performed.}

Aside from popular assumptions of how researchers are lonely isolated individuals sitting disconnected from the rest of the world enmeshed in thought, a considerable part of research involves working with data. Whether this data is quantitative, qualitative, gathered through experiments or involves writing code, all of this data is not just magically ‘invented’ out of thin air, but instead develops in a process of interaction with both human beings and technical systems. However only a small fragment of this process is presented to outside reviewers, the outputs and the framing often specifically designed to make a specific point. How the author got there, and which assumptions were made on the way and how these assumptions developed over time is seldom included in the final write-up. The following article argues that rather than just providing output data to be considered in research – or providing explanations for technical outcomes as is frequently proposed in computer science, accountability can only be developed by better understanding the research process. In order to do this, we suggest a series of mechanisms that can be built into existing research practices to make them more intelligible to outside reviewers and scholars. These mechanisms are designed to develop the accountability principle of the GDPR and ensure more accountable scientific research. As the GDPR recitals also explicitly references scientific research, an accountability by design approach to technology research is grounded both in the articles and recitals of the GDPR. By documenting the key elements of a narrative research story which explains not just what you believe to have discovered but also how researchers got there, it may also be possible to create better accountability mechanisms.}

This growing importance is due to the need for policymakers, urban managers, port authorities, local administrators, shipping companies, couriers, and so on to develop increasingly digitalized and sustainable logistic processes. Therefore, in a global context characterized by intense datafication and globalization of trade, the data-based approach has become a necessary modus operandi to promote smart and sustainable logistics development. This forward-looking model of port logistics uses technologies such as IoT, sensors, cloud computing platforms, Big Data analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), GPS tracking systems, radars, drones, real-time monitoring stations, smart grids, and so on in order to collect, process, monitor and analyse data and information concerning the economic, environmental, social and technological sphere of port cities. In this sense, mobile and fixed platforms help logistics operators to optimize the management of flows (e.g., water, waste, emissions, raw materials, people, monetary investments, etc.) in an efficient and digitized manner. The study proposes a systematic literature review of the most recurring themes concerning smart and sustainable logistics initiatives within port cities in order to develop a multidimensional framework capable of holistically integrating the prevailing enabling factors (Ecosystem, Internal Organization, Data and Security, Policy and Regulation, Finance and Funding, and Digital and Technology), domains (Mobility, Environment, Economy, Telecommunications, Safety and Security, Government, and Community) and goals (Sustainable Development and Digitalization) that characterize smart and sustainable logistical development. To this end, the best practices of several pioneering port cities such as Rotterdam, Hamburg, Singapore, Los Angeles, Amsterdam, etc. implemented in partnerships with technology companies such as Cisco, IBM, Huawei and SAP were also analysed. Therefore, the results of this research show that smart and sustainable logistics initiatives in port cities: (a) have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the economic, environmental, social and technological flows; (b) increase the involvement and awareness of stakeholders such as couriers, shippers, shipping companies, citizens, port authorities, municipalities, security officers, gate and terminal personnel, and so on; and (c) provide a detailed overview of the enabling factors, domains and goals that must be activated by port cities to foster a smart and sustainable logistic transition.}

However, due to the networks’ open and possibly unattended environment of operation, as well as to the nodes’ constraints, the security of the protocol is a challenging issue, currently under thorough investigation. New and innovative Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been proposed in the literature over the last years to address the protocol’s security issues. In that regard, our survey paper: i) begins with extracting a set of design requirements for RPL-related IDSs based on discussing the diversity of attacks on the protocol and investigating their impact; ii) continues with identifying best practices and gaps in an IDS design which are derived by studying the evolution of the related bibliography (2013–2020); and iii) concludes with a number of guidelines extracted once we map the 22 IDSs under study to the attacks they encounter and compare them in line with the design requirements we introduce. Our analysis considers feedback from the corresponding authors for a deeper investigation.}

abstract = {It is undoubted that fog computing contributes in catering the latency-stringent applications of 5G, and one of the enabling technologies that fundamentally ensures the success of fog computing is virtualization as it offers isolation and platform independence. Although the emergence of vehicle-based fog (referred to as v-fog) facilities can certainly benefit from these desirable features of virtualization, there are several challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize the full potential that v-fogs can offer. One of the challenges of virtualization in v-fog is Virtual Machine (VM) migration. There are several factors that trigger a VM migration in a v-fog such as vehicle resource depletion. VM migrations would not only lead to nonessential usage of valuable resources (e.g. energy, bandwidth, memory) in the v-fogs, but also incur various overheads and performance degradation throughout the whole network. Thus, minimizing VM migrations is necessary. Furthermore, to ensure the seamless VM migrations between v-fogs, trust of v-fogs is required. While there exists studies of trust in the virtualization of cloud, they are irrelevant to v-fogs as v-fogs are different in nature (i.e. heterogeneous, mobile) from the cloud. Additionally, trust is not included in the decision making mechanisms of VM allocation for vehicular environments in the existing works. Moreover, as vehicle resources are constrained, their energy has to be utilized efficiently. In this paper, we propose EnTruVe, an ENergy and TRUst-aware VM allocation in VEhicle fog computing solution that aims to minimize the number of VM migrations while reducing VM processing associated energy consumption as much as possible. The VM allocation algorithm in EnTruVe provides a larger selection pool of v-fogs that meets the VMs requirements (e.g. trust, latency), thereby ensuring higher chances of success of VM allocation. Using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the proposed EnTruVe solution evaluates the v-fogs based on a set of metrics (e.g. energy consumption and end-to-end latency) to select the optimal v-fog for a VM allocation. Results obtained demonstrate that EnTruVe has the least number of VM migrations and it is the most energy efficient solution. Additionally, it shows that EnTruVe provides the highest utilization of v-fogs of up to 57.6% in comparison to other solutions as the number of incoming requests increases.}

abstract = {The wide network applications of Internet of Things (IoT) urge to integrate the different wireless networking technologies. However, the future generation technologies like Software Defined Networking (SDN) can be useful to alleviate the associated challenges such as security, installation issues, coverage, etc. The growing number of IoT users produce massive volume of traffic causing heavy network load conditions, resulting in the state of network congestion. The network congestion may cause severe performance degradation issues such as frequent packet drops, longer delays, low throughput, etc. Thus, a promising solution is needed to reduce and/or prevent the network congestion. This paper presents an Optimized load balancing based Admission Control Mechanism (Opt-ACM) for effective network flow management resulting in the reduced network congestion. In addition to this, the paper highlights the challenges of the existing solutions, and discusses a Software Defined Hybrid Wireless based IoT (SDHW-IoT) network architecture consisting of Software Defined Wireless Sensor Network (SDWSN) and Software Defined Wireless Mesh Network (SDWMN). To validate the efficiency of Opt-ACM, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) based optimization problem is formulated and tested using a well-known mathematical optimization solver called Gurobi. Additionally, Opt-ACM is also emulated in Mininet-Wifi with varying network scenarios against some traditional (OLSR and OSPF) and state-of-the-art (FACOR and EASDN) approaches. Opt-ACM achieves an overall efficiency of 9.47% and 12.32% over other approaches for Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) respectively. Similarly, an average improved efficiency of 26.77% and 33.10% is achieved with respect to the Average Delay (AD) and Average Jitter (AJ) metrics respectively.}

However, given the state-of-the-art battery technology and embedded systems, most battery-powered mobile devices still do not support continuous vision. In order to reduce energy and storage requirements, there have been proposals to offload energy-demanding computations to the cloud Naderiparizi et al.

However, these proposals either require a fat communication bandwidth or have to sacrifice capturing of important events. In this paper, we present — ZenCam 1 1Parts of this work have been previously published in 2019 IEEE 15th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS) Fang et al. (2019) [3].,which is an always-on body camera that exploits readily available information in the encoded video stream from the on-chip firmware to classify the dynamics of the scene. This scene-context is further combined with simple inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based activity level-context of the wearer to optimally control the camera configuration at run-time to keep the device under the desired energy budget. We describe the design and implementation of ZenCam and thoroughly evaluate its performance in real-world scenarios. Our evaluation shows a 29.8%–35% reduction in energy consumption and 48.1-49.5% reduction in storage usage when compared to a standard baseline setting of 1920x1080 at 30fps while maintaining a competitive or better video quality at the minimal computational overhead.}

The proposed framework comprises a community-level power flow-based model to solve the energy procurement problem of the community and a building-level physics-aware simulation model to estimate a set of day-ahead aggregate load scenarios with potential joint-flexibilities. At the building-level, a least-cost multi-objective optimization provides a sequence of optimal temperature setpoints for all thermal zones that is fed into an accurate Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to estimate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) load trajectories while considering human comfort, occupancy patterns, building thermal response, and intraday electricity prices. The community-level model co-optimizes day-ahead schedules of shared distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicle (EV) chargings while directing the building cluster to adapt the joint-flexibilities to balance the community network under different operation conditions. Finally, a test building cluster located in Qatar University is investigated through several case studies. The simulation results reveal the model’s practicality in fully capturing the joint-flexibilities of the building cluster for an adaptable community operation which cuts the operation cost by 21.04%.}

The convergence of building information modeling with the smart water field provides an opportunity to transcend existing operational barriers. Such research would pave the way for demand-side management, active consumers, and demand-optimized networks, through interoperability and a system of systems approach. This paper presents a semantic knowledge management service and domain ontology which support a novel cloud-edge solution, by unifying domestic socio-technical water systems with clean and waste networks at an urban scale, to deliver value-added services for consumers and network operators. The web service integrates state of the art sensing, data analytics and middleware components. We propose an ontology for the domain which describes smart homes, smart metering, telemetry, and geographic information systems, alongside social concepts. This integrates previously isolated systems as well as supply and demand-side interventions, to improve system performance. A use case of demand-optimized management is introduced, and smart home application interoperability is demonstrated, before the performance of the semantic web service is presented and compared to alternatives. Our findings suggest that semantic web technologies and IoT can merge to bring together large data models with dynamic data streams, to support powerful applications in the operational phase of built environment systems.}

abstract = {The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is experiencing a period of intense progress due to the consolidation of several key technological enablers. AI is already deployed widely and has a high impact on work and daily life activities. The continuation of this process will likely contribute to deep economic and social changes. To realise the tremendous benefits of AI while mitigating undesirable effects will require enlightened responses by many stakeholders. Varying national institutional, economic, political, and cultural conditions will influence how AI will affect convenience, efficiency, personalisation, privacy protection, and surveillance of citizens. Many expect that the winners of the AI development race will dominate the coming decades economically and geopolitically, potentially exacerbating tensions between countries. Moreover, nations are under pressure to protect their citizens and their interests—and even their own political stability—in the face of possible malicious or biased uses of AI. On the one hand, these different stressors and emphases in AI development and deployment among nations risk a fragmentation between world regions that threatens technology evolution and collaboration. On the other hand, some level of differentiation will likely enrich the global AI ecosystem in ways that stimulate innovation and introduce competitive checks and balances through the decentralisation of AI development. International cooperation, typically orchestrated by intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, private sector initiatives, and by academic researchers, has improved common welfare and avoided undesirable outcomes in other technology areas. Because AI will most likely have more fundamental effects on our lives than other recent technologies, stronger forms of cooperation that address broader policy and governance challenges in addition to regulatory and technological issues may be needed. At a time of great challenges among nations, international policy coordination remains a necessary instrument to tackle the ethical, cultural, economic, and political repercussions of AI. We propose to advance the emerging concept of technology diplomacy to facilitate the global alignment of AI policy and governance and create a vibrant AI innovation system. We argue that the prevention of malicious uses of AI and the enhancement of human welfare create strong common interests across jurisdictions that require sustained efforts to develop better, mutually beneficial approaches. We hope that new technology diplomacy will facilitate the dialogues necessary to help all interested parties develop a shared understanding and coordinate efforts to utilise AI for the benefit of humanity, a task whose difficulty should not be underestimated.}

In our design, the variational auto-encoder (VAE) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are joined together. The prediction block (LSTM) takes clean input from the reconstructed time series by VAE, which makes it robust to the anomalies and noise for prediction task. In the meantime, the LSTM block maintains the long-term sequential patterns, which are out of the sight of a VAE encoding window. This leads to the better performance of VAE in anomaly detection than it is trained alone. In the whole processing pipeline, the spectral residual analysis is integrated with VAE and LSTM to boost the performance of both. The superior performance on two tasks is confirmed with the experiments on two challenging evaluation benchmarks.}

Three cellular networks have been jointly used in a multihoming/multipath setup, leveraging the variable coverage offered in both urban and suburban environments. Taking into account both Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics, the target parameters measured in this testbed are: latency, packet error rate, and video quality, which accounts for frames integrity, continuity, and fluidity. Data collected on the field allow to evaluate both QoS and QoE in the presence of a multipath architecture, showing how the latter, in the presence of network diversity, offer the possibility to improve the QoE at the receiver. We also design a framework to characterize the error model and to map it into a QoE model, therefore providing an analytical characterisation of a multipath channel.}

An assessment is required to check how well a set of discovered rules describes the input data, and to determine to what extent data complies with predefined rules. Particularly in declarative process mining, Support and Confidence are used most often, yet they are reportedly unable to provide a sufficiently rich feedback to users and cause rules representing coincidental behavior to be deemed as representative for the event logs. In addition, these measures are designed to work on a predefined set of rules, thus lacking generality and extensibility. In this paper, we address this research gap by developing a measurement framework for temporal rules based on (LTLpf). The framework is suitable for any temporal rules expressed in a reactive form and for custom measures based on the probabilistic interpretation of such rules. We show that our framework can seamlessly adapt well-known measures of the association rule mining field to declarative process mining. Also, we test our software prototype implementing the framework on synthetic and real-world data, and investigate the properties characterizing those measures in the context of process analysis.}

Trading and negotiating personal data, which includes data generated by owned smart devices, is gaining attention and acceptance in the Internet of Things (IoT) era. There is a global trend to move towards open innovation ecosystems that allow data owners to have better control over their data and privacy, choosing if/what and with whom to share/trade specific data streams. Nonetheless, this requires the design of IoT ecosystems that integrate automatic enforcing mechanisms to guarantee the delivery of the negotiated data, or still the capability of making near-instantaneous payments for the data (in the form of micro-units). This paper discusses the requirements that need to be fulfilled to properly support (micro)-payment in IoT, and further the extent to which different blockchain technologies can fulfill those requirements. Based on this analysis, our paper progresses the current state-of-the-art in three-respect: (i) by carrying out a benchmark performance analysis between LN and other-like solutions; (ii) by integrating the Lightning Network (LN) off-chain technology within an existing IoT ecosystem, developed as part of the bIoTope H2020 project, and (iii) by designing a novel algorithm for payment channel fee reduction. Experiments carried out in this paper show that LN outperforms traditional blockchain solutions under IoT-specific constraints and objectives, and that an optimal parameter setting of the proposed algorithm can be identified.}

abstract = {Homologous array pseudolite with simple time synchronization technique can provide high-precision larger-area indoor location service with outdoor GNSS receiver, but this architecture is born with several drawbacks, such as poor geometry, larger linearization error and multi-path error caused by signal reflection, and indoor positioning with this homologous array pseudolite can easily lead to potential divergence. Besides, fluctuation of time-delay, error of phase center and potential multipath error break integer propriety of carrier phase ambiguity and can’t be ignored for indoor PPP (Precise Point Positioning). Under these constrictions, optimal ambiguity-float indoor PPP algorithm with trust region is proposed, and performance of this optimal algorithm with the modified Levenberg-Marquardt technique, which is designed to avoid potential divergence particularly for poor geometry, is assessed with simulation and observation filed experiment. Meanwhile, the domain factor affecting performance of PPP and mechanism of accumulative error when moving are analyzed. The experimental result reveals that: unavoidable inaccuracy of position of pseudolite transmitting antenna can cause larger error of carrier phase bias that can be larger than 0.105 cycles, and it along with fluctuation of hardware group delay and multi-path error will cause position error that can be larger than 0.12 for most cases, the indoor static and kinematic PPP can obtain a few centimeter and smooth trace respectively, and the accuracy of indoor positioning based on this optimal algorithm can be better than 0.1668 m even at the corner of experiment area with poor geometry. Still there is particular circumstance that accuracy of this algorithm can be larger than 0.5741 m due to serious accumulative error with less satellite available when moving, the mechanism for it is analyzed with relationship between error of position and measurement error and depicted as follows: when some satellites with cycle slip occurs, the accuracy of position determined will reduce greatly due to less satellite available particularly with indoor homologous array pseudolite. Afterwards, the error of the position determined will lead to error of carrier phase ambiguity biases, which will cause large biases of subsequent position determined.}

These networks allow experimenters to establish dedicated network connections between research facilities for transferring large amounts of data. Recently, R&E networks have started using Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Software-Defined Exchanges (SDX) for deploying these connections. AtlanticWave/SDX is a response to the growing demand to support end-to-end network services spanning multiple SDN domains. However, requesting these services is a challenging task for domain-expert scientists, because the interfaces of the R&E networks have been developed by network operators for network operators. In this paper, we propose interfaces that allow domain-expert scientists to reserve resources of the scientific network using abstractions that focus on their data transfer needs for scientific workflow management. Recent trends in the networking field pursue better interfaces for requesting network services (e.g., intent-based networking). Although intents are sufficient for the needs of network operations, they are not abstract enough in most cases to be used by domain-expert scientists. This is an issue we are addressing in the AtlanticWave/SDX design: network operators and domain-expert scientists will have their own interfaces focusing on their specific needs.}

On the other hand, the competition in the automotive industry has turned into an unprecedented race to who will be the first to provide the fully autonomous cars. However, the fully autonomous driving is still a bit far from deployment, and for now, they are providing automation only at a certain level and, at the same time, are offering connected services through their mobility service platforms. With Fog and Edge computing integrated in VANETs, these mobility platforms will be standardized to provide services for every car on the road, which will help VANETs to accomplish one of its main goals, the road safety. In this paper, we propose an intelligent Fuzzy-based Driver Monitoring System (FDMS) for safe driving. We present and compare two fuzzy-based systems: FDMS1 and FDMS2. To make a decision, FDMS1 considers Vehicle’s Environment Temperature (VET), Noise Level (NL) and Heart Rate (HR). While, for FDMS2, we consider Respiratory Rate (RR) as a new parameter to decide Driver’s Situational Awareness (DSA). We evaluate the ability of the driver to safely operate the vehicle by monitoring his condition and subsequently, based on the system output, a smart box informs the driver and provides assistance. We show through simulations and experiments the effect of the considered parameters on the determination of the driver’s situation and demonstrate the actions that can be performed accordingly.}

abstract = {Urban environments are urgently required to become smarter. However, building advanced applications on the Internet of Things requires seamless interoperability. This paper proposes a water knowledge management platform which extends the Internet of Things towards a Semantic Web of Things, by leveraging the semantic web to address the heterogeneity of web resources. Proof of concept is demonstrated through a decision support tool which leverages both the data-driven and knowledge-based programming interfaces of the platform. The solution is grounded in a comprehensive ontology and rule base developed with industry experts. This is instantiated from GIS, sensor, and EPANET data for a Welsh pilot. The web service provides discoverability, context, and meaning for the sensor readings stored in a scalable database. An interface displays sensor data and fault inference notifications, leveraging the complementary nature of serving coherent lower and higher-order knowledge.}
