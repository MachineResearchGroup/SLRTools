abstract={Quadrotor UAVs are one of the most preferred type of small unmanned aerial vehicles because of the very simple mechanical construction and propulsion principle. However, the nonlinear dynamic behavior requires a rather advanced stabilizing control of these vehicles. One possible approach that relaxes the difficult task of nonlinear control design is the application of a learning algorithm that allows the training of suitable control actions. Here we apply reinforcement learning as one form of unsupervised learning. In this paper, we first propose a nonlinear autopilot for quadrotor UAVs based on feedback linearization. This controller is then compared to an autopilot which has been learned by reinforcement learning using fitted value iteration with regard to design effort and performance. First simulation and experimental results underline the outcome of this comparison.},

abstract={Thanks to the high mobility and rich sensing capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, they are increasingly leveraged to perform a series of military and civilian tasks today. Meanwhile, UAVs are also facing various security and safety concerns raised by both external attacks and internal hardware/software failures. Therefore, detecting the abnormal status of a UAV is a critical task to protect it against malicious adversaries and prevent potential crashes. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection system for UAVs by monitoring and analyzing their sensor data in real-time using deep learning approaches. The proposed system leverages the convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract and learn features automatically from raw sensor data and then process them to support anomaly detection. We construct a data set of UAV IMU sensor data using our UAV cybersecurity simulation platform to support the training of our CNN model. Different deep learning models are also evaluated and compared in this paper. We validate the performance of the proposed detection system using extensive experimental evaluation, which demonstrates that our system achieves high detection accuracy under different conditions.},

abstract={Monitoring air pollution plumes in emergency situations (industrial accidents, natural disasters, deliberate terrorist releases, etc.) becomes an issue of utmost importance in our society given the dramatic effects that the released pollutants can cause. Considering these situations, the pollution plume is strongly dynamic leading to a fast dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere. Thus, the need for real-time response is very strong and a solution to get precise mapping of pollution dispersion is required to mitigate risks. However, monitoring and forecasting air quality in real time in such situations remains a highly challenging endeavour. In this paper, we suggest a systemic approach for monitoring dynamic air pollution based on aerial sensing (sensors mounted on UAVs). The proposed framework consists of a cycle with feedback loop which will constantly combine a spatio-temporal forecasting model based on a convolutional long short term memory (ConvLSTM) network with a data assimilation technique to get accurate pollution maps, while adjusting at each time the trajectories of drones following uncertainty forecasts. Our solution was evaluated and validated using a highly dynamic real world data set namely Fusion Field Trial 2007 (FFT07). The proposed strategy, together with the obtained evaluation results, are presented, and carefully analyzed.},

abstract={Path planning methods for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are typically designed for one specific type of mission. This work presents a method for autonomous UAV path planning based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that can be applied to a wide range of mission scenarios. Specifically, we compare coverage path planning (CPP), where the UAV's goal is to survey an area of interest to data harvesting (DH), where the UAV collects data from distributed Internet of Things (IoT) sensor devices. By exploiting structured map information of the environment, we train double deep Q-networks (DDQNs) with identical architectures on both distinctly different mission scenarios to make movement decisions that balance the respective mission goal with navigation constraints. By introducing a novel approach exploiting a compressed global map of the environment combined with a cropped but uncompressed local map showing the vicinity of the UAV agent, we demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently scale to large environments. We also extend previous results for generalizing control policies that require no retraining when scenario parameters change and offer a detailed analysis of crucial map processing parameters' effects on path planning performance.},

To this end, we propose a novel multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework, coined a graph attention exchange network (GAXNet). In GAXNet, each UAV constructs an attention graph locally measuring the level of attention to its neighboring UAVs, while exchanging the attention weights with other UAVs so as to reduce the attention mismatch between them. Simulation results corroborates that GAXNet achieves up to 4.5x higher rewards during training. At execution, without incurring inter-UAV collisions, G2ANet improves reliability of air-to-ground network in terms of latency and error rate.},

The nature of generative models is used to capture the distributions of high dimensional data, where the LSTM module is used to learn the temporal relationships. The proposed framework is designed with the capability to reconstruct input data after training, and the reconstruction errors based anomaly scores are assigned to each time step in the time series, which determines the anomalies.

As a typical application of swarm intelligence, swarm of drones systems generally exhibit decentralized control achieved through simple agent behaviors and interactions developing a self-organization that is considered an emergence of order from the system. Together the system is greater than the sum of its parts, capable of solving complex problems that no agent could accomplish singularly. Effective communication mechanisms are a key requirement for drone swarms and their meaningful deployment. Swarm with a large size requires a fully distributed communication system which scales well and optimizes the ‚Äúmany-to-many‚Äù communication.

abstract={High-quality data collection is crucial for mobile crowd sensing (MCS) with various applications like smart cities and emergency rescues, where various unmanned mobile terminals (MTs), e.g., driverless cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are equipped with different sensors that aid to collect data. However, they are limited with fixed carrying capacity, and thus, MT's energy resource and sensing range are constrained. It is quite challenging to navigate a group of MTs to move around a target area to maximize their total amount of collected data with the limited energy reserve, while geographical fairness among those point-of-interests (PoIs) should also be maximized. It is even more challenging if fully distributed execution is enforced, where no central control is allowed at the backend. To this end, we propose to leverage emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques for directing MT's sensing and movement and to present a novel and highly efficient control algorithm, called energy-efficient distributed MCS (Edics). The proposed neural network integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction and then makes decision under the guidance of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method in a fully distributed manner. We also propose two enhancements into Edics with N-step return and prioritized experienced replay buffer. Finally, we evaluate Edics through extensive simulations and found the appropriate set of hyperparameters in terms of number of CNN hidden layers and neural units for all the fully connected layers. Compared with three commonly used baselines, results have shown its benefits.},

abstract={Recent object detection studies have been focused on video sequences, mostly due to the increasing demand of industrial applications. Although single-image architectures achieve remarkable results in terms of accuracy, they do not take advantage of particular properties of the video sequences and usually require high parallel computational resources, such as desktop GPUs. In this work, an inattentional framework is proposed, where the object context in video frames is dynamically reused in order to reduce the computation overhead. The context features corresponding to keyframes are fused into a synthetic feature map, which is further refined using temporal aggregation with ConvLSTMs. Furthermore, an inattentional policy has been learned to adaptively balance the accuracy and the amount of context reused. The inattentional policy has been learned under the reinforcement learning paradigm, and using our novel reward-conditional training scheme, which allows for policy training over a whole distribution of reward functions and enables the selection of a unique reward function at inference time. Our framework shows outstanding results on platforms with reduced parallelization capabilities, such as CPUs, achieving an average latency reduction up to 2.09√ó, and obtaining FPS rates similar to their equivalent GPU platform, at the cost of a 1.11√ó mAP reduction.},

abstract={Alfalfa is a valuable and widely adapted forage crop, and its nutritive value directly affects animal performance and ultimately affects the profitability of livestock production. Traditional nutritive value measurement method is labor-intensive and time-consuming and thus hinders the determination of alfalfa nutritive values over large fields. The adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) facilitates the generation of images with high spatial and temporal resolutions for field-level agricultural research. Additionally, compared with other imaging modalities, hyperspectral data usually consist of hundreds of narrow spectral bands and allow the accurate detection, identification, and quantification of crop quality. Although various machine-learning methods have been developed for alfalfa quality prediction, they were all single-task models that learned independently for each quality trait and failed to utilize the underlying relatedness between each task. Inspired by the idea of multitask learning (MTL), this study aims to develop an approach that simultaneously predicts multiple quality traits. The algorithm first extracts shared information through a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based common hidden layer. To enhance the model flexibility, it is then divided into multiple branches, each containing the same or different number of task-specific fully connected hidden layers. Through comparison with multiple mainstream single-task machine-learning models, the effectiveness of the model is illustrated based on the measured alfalfa quality data and multitemporal UAV-based hyperspectral imagery.},

abstract={Solving the path planning problem of a UAV is a challenging issue especially if there are too many checkpoints to visit. Mainly, the brute force approach is used to find the shortest path in the mission area, which requires too many times to find a solution. Therefore, evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence techniques are used to find a feasible solution in an acceptable time. In this study, path planning problem of a UAV is solved by using a highly parallelized Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm on CUDA platform. The UAV path is constructed for disseminating keys and collecting data from a Wireless Sensor Network, which is previously defined. Due to its simplicity and effectiveness, ACO is selected as a path planning algorithm. However, ACO is not satisfactory if the mission area becomes large and there are an excessive number of checkpoints and/or additional constraints. In order to increase the performance, some parallelization techniques must be used in high performance computing platforms. GPU architecture has emerged as a powerful and low cost architecture for enabling impressive speedups for scientific calculations. Therefore, the parallel structure is constructed on CUDA architecture. The experimental results are compared with the CPU performance of the serial algorithm, and they clearly show that the proposed approach have a great potential for acceleration of ACO and allow to solve many complex tasks such as UAV path planning problem. We also present the execution results with different parameter values to expose the results for the researchers.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the detection and classification of micro-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)using radio frequency (RF)fingerprints of the signals transmitted from the controller to the micro-UAV. In the detection phase, raw signals are split into frames and transformed into the wavelet domain to remove the bias in the signals and reduce the size of data to be processed. A naive Bayes approach, which is based on Markov models generated separately for UAV and non-UAV classes, is used to check for the presence of a UAV in each frame. In the classification phase, unlike the traditional approaches that rely solely on time-domain signals and corresponding features, the proposed technique uses the energy transient signal. This approach is more robust to noise and can cope with different modulation techniques. First, the normalized energy trajectory is generated from the energy-time-frequency distribution of the raw control signal. Next, the start and end points of the energy transient are detected by searching for the most abrupt changes in the mean of the energy trajectory. Then, a set of statistical features is extracted from the energy transient. Significant features are selected by performing neighborhood component analysis (NCA)to keep the computational cost of the algorithm low. Finally, selected features are fed to several machine learning algorithms for classification. The algorithms are evaluated experimentally using a database containing 100 RF signals from each of 14 different UAV controllers. The signals are recorded wirelessly using a high-frequency oscilloscope. The data set is randomly partitioned into training and test sets for validation with the ratio 4:1. Ten Monte Carlo simulations are run and results are averaged to assess the performance of the methods. All the micro-UAVs are detected correctly and an average accuracy of 96.3% is achieved using the k-nearest neighbor (kNN)classification. Proposed methods are also tested for different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)levels and results are reported.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be deployed in a variety of applications in future mobile networks due to several advantages they bring over the deployment of ground base stations. However, despite the recent interest in UAVs in mobile networks, some issues still remain, such as determining the placement of multiple UAVs in different scenarios. In this paper we propose a solution to determine the optimal 3D position of multiple UAVs in a capacity enhancement use-case, or in other words, when the ground network cannot cope with the user traffic demand. For this scenario, real data from the city of Milan, provided by Telecom Italia is utilized to simulate an event. Based on that, a solution based on k-means, a machine learning technique, to position multiple UAVs is proposed and it is compared with two other baseline methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed solution is able to significantly outperform other methods in terms of users covered and quality of service.},

abstract={Detection of line component defects in UAV transmission line inspection is always a difficult problem. In order to solve the problem of identifying the defects of insulators and anti-vibration hammers in transmission lines, a target detection technique based on deep learning is proposed to diagnose the typical defects of transmission lines. SSD algorithm based on candidate regions is selected to locate and identify the defects. Firstly, the influence of different feature extraction networks and network parameters on the accuracy and speed of target detection is studied. The network is improved by adjusting network parameters and model optimization method, and the network parameters that are most conducive to transmission line defect detection are selected.Then, the influence of different data enhancement methods on the accuracy of defect detection is studied. The training samples are expanded by multi-scale training and horizontal mirror method to further improve the accuracy of target detection.Finally, the recognition and classification experiments are carried out using the actual images collected by UAV. The experimental results show that the target detection method based on deep learning can accurately locate the location of defects from the transmission line image, and can be applied to the fault diagnosis task in the transmission line scene.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been emerging as an effective solution for IoT data collection networks thanks to their outstanding flexibility, mobility, and low operation costs. However, due to the limited energy and uncertainty from the data collection process, speed control is one of the most important factors while optimizing the energy usage efficiency and performance for UAV collectors. This work aims to develop a novel autonomous speed control approach to address this issue. To that end, we first formulate the dynamic speed control task of a UAV as a Markov decision process taking into account its energy status and location. In this way, the Q-learning algorithm can be adopted to obtain the optimal speed control policy for the UAV. To further improve the system performance, we develop a highly-effective deep dueling double Q-learning algorithm utilizing outstanding features of the deep neural networks as well as advanced dueling architecture to quickly stabilize the learning process and obtain the optimal policy. Through simulations, we show that our proposed solution can achieve up to 40% greater performance, i.e., an average throughput of the system, compared with other conventional methods. Importantly, the simulation results also reveal significant impacts of UAV's energy and charging time on the system performance.},

To identify the merits and limitations of a swarm intelligence approach to remote sensing, we propose here a decentralised multi-agent system for a field coverage and weed mapping problem, which is efficient, intrinsically robust and scalable to different group sizes. The proposed solution is based on a reinforced random walk with inhibition of return, where the information available from other agents (UAVs) is exploited to bias the individual motion pattern.

abstract={Currently, that multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) complete the tracking tasks cooperatively has became an important development trend. However, in multi-UAVs tracking network, the mobility of tracking UAVs will seriously affect the performance of the network, resulting in frequent network interruption, prolonging convergence delay of consensus algorithm, and even unable to meet the tracking requirements. In this paper, we proposed an approach by deploying a relay UAV to improve the connectivity and consensus performance of the multi-UAVs tracking network. We divide the process of deploying relay UAV into two steps. Firstly, DQN-based deployment algorithm is proposed to obtain the initial position of relay UAV, whose energy consumption and consensus convergence delay of the tracking network are optimized. Secondly, during the movement of tracking UAVs, DQN-based trajectory planning algorithm is proposed, which effectively improves the consensus success probability and reduces the outage probability of the multi-UAVs tracking network. Simulations verify that the DQN-based algorithms have superior performances compared with existing works.},

This paper brings artificial intelligence into the UAVs data offloading process in a multi-server Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environment, by adopting principles and concepts from game theory and reinforcement learning. Initially, the autonomous MEC server selection for partial data offloading is performed by the UAVs, based on the theory of the stochastic learning automata. A non-cooperative game among the UAVs is then formulated to determine the UAVs' data to be offloaded to the selected MEC servers, while the existence of at least one Nash Equilibrium (NE) is proven by exploiting the power of submodular games. A best response dynamics framework and two alternative reinforcement learning algorithms are introduced that converge to an NE, and their tradeoffs are discussed. The overall framework performance evaluation is achieved via modeling and simulation, in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness, under different operation approaches and scenarios.},

abstract={Next generation mobile networks have proposed the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations (UAV-BS) to serve ground nodes. Despite the advantages of UAV-BSs, their dependence on the on-board, limited-capacity battery hinders their service continuity. Shorter trajectories can save flying energy, however UAV-BSs must also serve nodes based on their service priority since nodes' service requirements are not always the same. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient trajectory optimization for a UAV assisted IoT system in which the UAV-BS considers the IoT nodes' service priorities in making its movement decisions. We solve the trajectory optimization problem using Double Q- Learning algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the Q-Learning based optimized trajectory outperforms a benchmark algorithm, namely Greedily served algorithm, in terms of reducing the average energy consumption of the UAV-BS as well as the service delay for high priority nodes.},

abstract={With the current popularity of drones and UAVs, there is an urgent need to be able to classify the aerial objects with sufficient accuracy. Hence, several methods have been proposed for classification of drones and UAVs. Such methods are often based on visual sources and thus classification becomes dependent on extraneous parameters. In contrast, the use of Radar Cross Section (RCS) for drone classification shows less dependency of extraneous parameters. Radar Cross Section (RCS) is a significant radar signature that is popularly used for identification of targets. In this paper, the primary objective is to demonstrate a viable solution to classify drones based on their RCS values. During the process, various classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes Classifier, Neural Networks have been investigated for performance and accuracy.},

abstract={In this paper, we develop a mobility and energy aware data routing protocol for unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted vehicular ad-hoc networks (UAV-assisted VANETs). One of the UAV act as a flying roadside Uunit (RSU) collecting data from ground vehicles, while the other UAVs play the role of relays to deliver the data to mobility service center (MSC). The UAVs can adjust their three-dimensional (3D) locations within a predefined range, if needed, in order to ensure reliable communication links. The proposed approach aims to minimize the energy consumed by the UAVs in both data transfer and movement. which ensures fair distribution of the routing effort across the different UAVs in the network. This is achieved by taking the residual UAV energy into account in the routing decision. We formulate such a routing problem as a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) to determine both the selected route and the locations of the UAVs participating in the data transfer process. Since such a problem is non-convex, we proceed with a joint optimization solution where the route is optimized using an ILP and the UAVs‚Äô 3D locations are determined using the meta-heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

The pests' positions are then used to plan the optimal pesticide spraying route for the agricultural drone. Apart from planning the optimized spraying of pesticide for the spraying drone, the TX2 embedded platform also transmits the position and generation of pests to the cloud to record and analyze the growth of longan with a computer or mobile device.

The agricultural drone sprays pesticides only where needed, which reduces pesticide use, decreases damage to the environment, and increases crop yield.},

In the proposed algorithm, each UAV takes autonomous decisions to find its flight path towards a designated mission area while avoiding collisions to stationary and mobile obstacles. The main distinction with similar algorithms is that the target destination for each UAV is not apriori fixed and the UAVs locate themselves such that they collectively cover a potentially time-varying mission area. One potential application for this algorithm is deploying a team of autonomous drones to collectively cover an evolving forest wildfire and provide virtual reality for fire fighters. We formulated the algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a new method to accommodate continuous state space for adjacent locations. To consider more realistic scenario, we assess the impact of localization errors on the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that success probability for this algorithm is about 80% when the observation error variance is as high as 100 (SNR:-6dB).},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of data routing in flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) composed of multiple flying nodes, i.e., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by communication platforms. The objective is to exploit the mobility of UAVs in order to establish routing paths and transfer a message between two ground nodes at minimum transmission time. Assuming that the UAVs are already deployed to execute a given primary task, the cooperation of the UAVs in the data transfer process, considered as a secondary task, becomes subject to three conditions. First, the energy consumed by each UAV has to respect the allocated budget for the data routing process. Second, the UAVs cannot move out of the boundaries of a tolerated and well-defined region in order to maintain the operation of the primary task. Finally, the UAVs need to reduce their traveled distances in order to reduce the delay of the transfer. A mixed non-linear integer programming problem determining the routing path and the new locations of the UAVs participating in the data transfer process is formulated. Due to its nonconvexity, we proceed with a deterministic exploratory strategy inspired from the Hooke-Jeeves algorithm to meet the problem goals. Selected numerical results investigate the performance of the proposed solution for different scenarios and compare some of them to those of a metaheuristic approach based on swarm intelligence.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) becoming more and more common. They show excellent potential for multiple types of autonomous work, although they must achieve these tasks safely. For flight-safety, it must be assured that the UAV will avoid collision with any objects in its flight path during autonomous operations. Computer vision and artificial neural networks have shown to be effective in many applications. However, biological vision systems and the brain areas responsible for visual processing may hold solutions capable of acquiring information effectively. We are proposing a novel system, which performs visual cue extraction with algorithms based on the structure and functionality of the retina and the visual cortex of the mammalian visual system, and a convolutional neural network processing data to detect a predefined obstacle using the onboard camera of the UAV. We also examined the effect of preprocessing on calculation time and recognition effectiveness.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide great value in off-shore operations that require aerial surveillance, for example by detecting objects on the water surface. For efficient operations by autonomous aerial surveillance, a reliable automatic detection system must be in place: one that will limit the amount of false negatives, but not at the expense of too many false positives. In this paper, we assess multiple aspects of the detection system that may provide significant impact in off-shore aerial surveillance: First by assessing detection architectures based on convolutional neural networks, then by adding tracking algorithms to utilize temporal information, and finally by investigating the use of different imaging modalities. Through a comparison of several detection models, the experiments prove that misclassification of objects is a particular issue, where input resolution and size of objects influence the overall model performance. The use of a tracking algorithm allows for decreasing the confidence threshold, which results in fewer false negatives, without a significant increase in false positives. In addition, comparing information obtained from visual and thermal imaging systems shows that these modalities provide complementary information in the presence of sunlight reflection.},

abstract={The boom of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is projected to fundamentally shift paradigms of transportations, logistics, agricultures, and public safety as a dominating unmanned application in following decades. To optimally process assigned tasks, each UAV requires prompt and ubiquitous information provisioning regarding the varying operation conditions, which renders exploiting base stations (BSs) of existing wireless infrastructures a tractable solution. To receive services from a BS, a UAV should stay within the coverage area of a BS, which however limits the operation range of a UAV. This obstacle thus drives the deployment of a special sort of UAV, known as an aerial base station (ABS), to relay signals between a BS and a UAV. Based on different flight paths of UAVs, an ABS should autonomously decide its own flight trajectory so as to maximize the number of UAVs which can receive wireless services. However, the inherently non-stationary environment renders the optimum autonomous deployment of an ABS a challenging issue. Inspired by the merit of interacting with the environment, we consequently propose a reinforcement learning scheme to optimize the flight trajectory of an ABS. To eliminate the engineering concern in the conventional Q-learning scheme that most state-action pairs may not be fully visited in the deployment of an ABS, in this paper, a state-amount-reduction (SAR) k-step Q-learning scheme is proposed to avoid the issue in the conventional Q-learning, so as to maximize the number of UAVs receiving services from an ABS. Through providing analytical foundations and simulation studies, outstanding performance of the proposed schemes is demonstrated as compared with that of the conventional reinforcement learning based ABS deployment.},

abstract={Developing the flocking behavior for a dynamic squad of fixed-wing UAVs is still a challenge due to kinematic complexity and environmental uncertainty. In this paper, we deal with the decentralized flocking and collision avoidance problem through deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, we formulate a decentralized DRL-based decision making framework from the perspective of every follower, where a collision avoidance mechanism is integrated into the flocking controller. Then, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm PS-CACER for training a shared control policy for all the followers. Besides, we design a plug-n-play embedding module based on convolutional neural networks and the attention mechanism. As a result, the variable-length system state can be encoded into a fixed-length embedding vector, which makes the learned DRL policy independent with the number and the order of followers. Finally, numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the learned policies can be directly transferred to semi-physical simulation without any parameter finetuning.},

abstract={The number of offshore windmills keeps growing around the world since they are an essential part of any strategy to produce energy without using nuclear power plants or burning fossil resources. Due to the growing number of installations new monitoring and inspection strategies and routines need to be developed that are not only effective but efficient. In this work we will present first results from a joint project of industry partners and academia that aims at the development of new approaches making use of modern imaging technologies and new methods from artificial intelligence and computer vision research. We investigate three different strategies for collecting digital photos or video and posterior computational analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our results indicate, that patterns of interest like rust or coating damage can be detected and classified with F1 scores between 0.80 and 0.94 in photos collected by inspectors. In videos collected with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) rust patterns, oils spills and coating damage were detected with F1= 0.91. To support users in the time-consuming task of visual data exploration, we present a new visualization method referred to as ‚Äúvirtual twin‚Äù. Using hand - recorded image collections, a data-driven 3D model of a windmill is generated, that can be used to investigate damage patterns in the full context of the windmill and in full detail. Altogether our results indicate, that although each single approach has its limitations, a combination of different imaging methods, deep learning computer vision algorithms and sophisticated visual data exploration by experienced users appears to have potential to overcome the bottleneck in data analysis, interpretation and decision making in the context of the future inspections of offshore windmills, platforms or other constructions.},

abstract={In the application of the deep learning to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous inspection, a problem about the insufficiency of both quantity and quality for insulator images emerges. In the light of this situation, a sample expansion method based on a combination of statute and 3D modelling technology is proposed. Its feasibility is verified in a deep convolutional neural network by using five kinds of insulator simulated samples. The classification accuracy acquired by the proposed method is higher verified by the comparison of the experimental results, which proves its superiority to the traditional method containing no simulated samples. It is concluded that the simulated intensive samples of pure background have a significant effect on the accuracy of network classification. And when the ratio of real samples to simulated intensive samples goes to an appropriate value, the classification has the best accuracy.},

abstract={The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively used in providing intelligence such as target tracking. In our field experiments, a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) is deployed on the UAV to identify a target from the captured video frames and enable UAV to keep tracking. However, tracking in real time by the DNN requires a lot of computational resources. This motivates us to consider offloading this type of machine learning (ML) tasks to a mobile edge computing (MEC) server. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical ML tasks distribution framework for the UAV tracking system, where the UAV is embedded with lower layers of the pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model due to its limited computing capability, while the MEC server with rich computing resources will handle the higher layers of the CNN model. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the CNN inference delay while taking into account the communications delay, computing time, and ML error. Insights are provided to understand the tradeoff between communications and ML computing in offloading decisions. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ML tasks distribution framework with the optimized offloading strategy.},

abstract={Object detection and tracking algorithms for specific targets are important technologies in the fields of autonomous driving and video surveillance. The verification of related algorithms and the training of data-driven machine learning methods often rely on high-quality and large-scale data support. Therefore, data simulation methods are usually used to supplement the quantity and richness of data. This paper proposes an image simulation performance evaluation method based on the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learnable theory: experience consistency loss, which is used to quantitatively evaluate simulated images. Compared with the traditional performance evaluation method based on expert score and Turing test, this evaluation method can objectively and quantitatively reflect the characteristic consistency between the simulated image and the real image. The experimental results show that the evaluation results of this method are consistent with the qualitative analysis results, which can directly reflect the performance improvement of the simulation image for the machine learning model.},

abstract={Modern surveillance networks are able to provide trajectories of all kinds for aircrafts and vessels worldwide or at least in extended areas of the airspace or earth surface. Best known are Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) and (Satellite-) Automatic Identification System (AIS) used in air and maritime surveillance. Both of them are cooperative systems. Besides these sources, sensors based on ground installations or mounted on airborne and space-based platforms deliver object trajectories independently of any transponders. This is done by advanced tracking and fusion algorithms generating trajectories out of sensor measurements. Examples include GMTI radar-based systems operating on UAV platforms or imaging systems based on high altitude pseudo satellites (HAPS) and satellites. These surveillance systems enable a continuous extraction of mid- and long-term trajectories of objects. Besides the trajectory generation, the challenge will be to place them into the right context and to provide situational awareness. This includes the estimation of the intents of the tracked objects, activity-based intelligence, and the determination of patterns of life. Otherwise, even modern surveillance systems are not able to take a real advantage of the gathered data. Therefore, trajectories are further processed by data analytics and machine learning. Unsupervised machine learning offers techniques to cluster and to partition trajectories, extract highly frequented routes and points of interest, predict object movement and identify anomalous behaviour. On the other hand, transponder and broadcast systems provide additional attributes of the tracked trajectories. These labels pave the way for numerous supervised machine learning methods. The derived predictors realise the determination of object types and activities. Finally, these new data analytic techniques have to be integrated in existing near real time surveillance systems. This requires specific system architectures as well as a completely new software and hardware landscape. In summary, trajectory-based data analytics, machine learning and risk assessment are embedded on local or global clouds and use dedicated mechanisms for distributed and parallel processing.},

The problem is partially solved by proposing a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based controller that uses Least Square Policy Iteration (LSPI) to learn the optimal control policies required for generating these trajectories. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through both simulation and real-world experiments with actual Parrot AR drone 2.0. According to our study, this is the first time such experimental results have been presented using RL based controller for drone landing, making it a novel contribution in this field.},

abstract={The air ground integrated networks can leverage unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications to tackle the ever-increasing and unbalanced traffic load in future communication systems. This paper investigates the UAV enabled traffic offloading problem in air ground integrated networks with mixed user traffic. The problem jointly maximizes the system load balance and the total UAV reward, which can be formulated under a two-layer network graph model. In the cellular network graph, the association between the delay-sensitive users and the access points (APs) as well as the association between the UAVs and the APs are formulated. In the UAV network graph, the association between the delay-insensitive users and the UAVs is formulated. By observing the coupling relationship of the decision variables, we decouple the problem into three sub-problems and solve the first two sub-problems with reduced complexity. Then, we devise a Deep Neural Network (DNN) empowered genetic algorithm to solve the last sub-problem. The DNN can be leveraged to filter out the non-optimal solutions in the initialization operator of the genetic algorithm for improving the efficiency. Performance comparisons are provided between the proposed traffic offloading scheme and the existing ones, which validate the advantages of the DNN empowered genetic algorithm regarding its convergence, accuracy, and robustness.},

However, the stringent regulations governing data privacy potentially impedes data sharing across independently owned UAVs. To this end, we propose the adoption of a Federated Learning (FL) based approach to enable privacy-preserving collaborative Machine Learning for the development of IoV applications, e.g., for traffic prediction and car park occupancy management. Given the information asymmetry and incentive mismatches between the UAVs and model owner, we leverage on the self-revealing properties of a multi-dimensional contract to ensure truthful reporting of the UAV types, while accounting for the multiple sources of heterogeneity, e.g., in sensing and transmission costs. Then, we adopt the Gale-Shapley algorithm to match the lowest cost UAV to each subregion. The simulation results validate the incentive compatibility of our contract design and shows the efficiency of our matching.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can now be considered as aerial base stations (BSs) to support ultra-reliable and low-latency communications by establishing line-of-sight (LoS) connections to ground users. Moreover, combining UAVs with millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) will be a promissing solution. It can provide potentially high capacity wireless services due to their aerial positions and their ability to deploy on demand at specific locations. In this paper, we propose a low-cost and energy-efficient hybrid precoding architecture for UAVs, where the antenna part is realized by lens array. We investigate an efficient and energy-saving hybrid precoding scheme with robustness, which is inspired by the cross-entropy (CE) optimization in machine learning and the relative error estimation optimization. As for each selection of the hybrid precoders for obtaining the optimized precoder, we regarded it as a training process in machine learning, in which the training target is the CE-loss function between the predicted precoders and the target precoders. It aims to minimize the relative error between the predicted and actual values for optimizing the probability distributions of the elements in the analog hybrid precoder. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve higher sum rate and energy efficiency.},

abstract={Autonomous obstacle avoidance flight is a key capability for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the automatic terrain following application, which ensures that the UAVs can perform complex, versatile and difficult movements in the flight. Existing obstacle avoidance methods such as the visual SLAM, generally require artificially specifying the feature values that need to be extracted and are susceptible to illumination and obstacle positions. While artificial intelligence technology has made breakthroughs in many fields, the advantages of the neural networks overcome these shortcomings. Therefore, we propose an autonomous obstacle avoidance algorithm using deep reinforcement learning method. Concretely, a virtual three-dimensional visual simulation environment is established firstly, which simulates the flight states of the UAV and output the state image in real time according to the control decision. A deep convolutional neural network is then built as the brain of the intelligent agent, which takes the state image of the UAV as input, and outputs the discretized control decision to control the UAV. Moreover, The Deep Q Network method is employed to train the convolutional neural network in an autonomous way, that is the intelligent agent can try to control the UAV to avoidance the obstacle by itself. After training, the UAV is controlled by the trained convolutional neural network to complete the autonomous obstacle avoidance task during the flight. This algorithm is realized through continuous self-learning and self-evolution, which enables the UAVs to utilize visual information in complex scenes, adjust flight height in real time according to terrain height and obstacle height.

abstract={With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) composed of multiple sensor nodes (SNs) have been able to provide a large number of high-quality services, such as continuous environmental monitoring, automatic control, and transmission of data for intelligent decision-making. SNs in WSNs are typically energy limited and often exist in large numbers, which are widely distributed in hard-to-reach areas. Hence, it is difficult to collect data from SNs without infrastructure support such as base stations (BSs). The low cost and high maneuverability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an efficient solution for data acquisition in WSNs but with the challenge of control system of the UAV. In this paper, we proposed a deep reinforcement learning based UAV control system to intelligently solve the data harvesting problem in WSNs. Our optimization target is to jointly optimize the trajectory of the UAV and the bandwidth resources of the airborne base station to maximize the data acquisition success rate when the UAV is limited in energy. The objective function and constraints of this problem are highly non-convex. To solve this problem, we first modeled the movement of the UAV and the bandwidth allocation of the airborne base station in each time slot as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then we designed a deep reinforcement learning architecture to solve the above MDP. Compared with the existing data harvesting algorithms, the proposed method has a great improvement in data acquisition success rate.},

abstract={This article presents an enhanced fault-tolerant synchronization tracking control scheme using fractional-order (FO) calculus and intelligent learning architecture for networked fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against actuator and sensor faults. To increase the flight safety of networked UAVs, a recurrent wavelet fuzzy neural network (RWFNN) learning system with feedback loops is first designed to compensate for the unknown terms induced by the inherent nonlinearities, unexpected actuator, and sensor faults. Then, FO sliding-mode control (FOSMC), involving the adjustable FO operators and the robustness of SMC, are dexterously proposed to further enhance flight safety and reduce synchronization tracking errors. Moreover, the dynamic parameters of the RWFNN learning system embedded in the networked fixed-wing UAVs are updated based on adaptive laws. Furthermore, the Lyapunov analysis ensures that all fixed-wing UAVs can synchronously track their references with bounded tracking errors. Finally, comparative simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract={Precise and rapid methods of plant disease detection and evaluation are key factors to accelerate resistant variety development in the rice breeding program. Conventional methods for the disease detection and evaluation is mainly carried out using standard visual estimation by trained experts which is slow and prone to high level of subjectivity. Rigorous research has recently recognized innovative, sensor-based methods for the detection and evaluation of plant diseases. Among different type of sensors, aerial multispectral imaging provides a fast and nondestructive way of scanning plants in diseased regions and has been used by various researchers to classify symptom levels on the spectral profile of a plant. In this paper, we developed machine learning models to classify rice breeding lines infected by rice Hoja Blanca virus (RHBV) using multispectral images collected from UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). Our results revealed that, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) methods were not significantly different in their ability to separate susceptible from non-susceptible classes, but SVM best classifiers showed a better sensitivity rates 0.74 (SVM) versus 0.71 (RF). The tool developed from this study will allow rice breeders to characterize Hoja Blanca virus resistant varieties considerably earlier, and subsequent in reduced costs.},

The suggested approach utilizes a state-of-the-art CNN model for the task. We suggest a novel approach utilizing the video feed derived from the UAV front camera to determine the next maneuver in the deep neural network model. The process is viewed as a classification activity, where the deep neural network model classifies the image as a stair or no-stair and LiDAR sensor data are used for distance calculation. The training is performed from a dataset of images obtained from multiple stairs. We show the effectiveness of the proposed device in indoor stairs scenarios in real-time.},

To this end, we first formulate the dynamic UAV trajectory planning problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with non-uniform time steps, where the set of valid actions is coupled with the agent's observations. Then, a deep recurrent reinforcement learning (DRRL) algorithm is devised to find the policy minimizing the expectation of the weighted average AoI, in which a modified discount mechanism is utilized to deal with the challenge from non-uniform time steps and an action elimination mechanism is introduced to address the coupling between the valid actions and observations.

abstract={A novel framework for Quality of experience (QoE)-driven deployment and movement of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. The problem of joint non-concave 3D deployment and dynamic movement for maximizing the sum mean opinion score (MOS) of users is formulated, which is proved to be NP-hard. In an effort to solve this problem, we proposed a three-step approach to obtain 3D deployment and dynamic movement of multiple UAVs. More specifically, in the first step, GAK-means algorithm is invoked to obtain the cell partitioning of ground users. Secondly, Q-learning based deployment algorithm is proposed, in which each UAV is considered as an agent, making its own decision to obtain 3D position. In contrast to conventional genetic algorithm based learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm is capable of training the policy of making decision offline. Thirdly, Q-learning algorithm is invoked when the ground users roam. Unlike the other trajectory obtaining algorithms, the proposed approach enables each UAV learn its movement gradually through trials and errors, and updates the direction selection strategy until it reaches convergence. Numerical results reveal that the proposed 3D deployment scheme outperforms K-means algorithm and IGK algorithm with low complexity. Additionally, with the aid of proposed approach, 3D real-time dynamic movement of UAVs is obtained.},

It may need highly complex machine learning algorithms with the demand of extensive computing power. With the rising edge computing technology, the heavily-loaded object detection tasks can be offloaded to edge computing systems. To enable such edge-based object detection with low overhead, we discover that it is critical to minimize the response time of the detection while maximizing the frequency of detected image frames. In this paper, we identify three key research challenges, conduct an experimental case study to show that current edge-based naive solutions cannot achieve the above goal, and finally point out major ideas for potential solutions.},

abstract={The rapid technological development of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) has led to an increase in capabilities of aerial image collection and analysis for monitoring a variety of wildlife species including waterfowl. Biologists mainly rely on conducting ocular surveys from fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters to estimate waterfowl abundance. sUAS provide an alternative that is safer, less expensive, and more flexible. Researchers have attempted to estimate waterfowl abundance from aerial imagery, but this method has proven to be too time consuming. Machine learning provides the opportunity to more efficiently estimate waterfowl abundance from aerial imagery. In this paper, we present a new integrated system of sUAS and machine learning for waterfowl population surveys. This system provides a user-friendly process for sUAS survey design, deployment, and data post-processing using deep learning methods to automatically detect and count waterfowl. To develop this system, we conducted many sUAS flights to capture a diversity of imagery and assembled six datasets of imagery taken from both fix-winged aircraft and sUAS flights. We used these datasets to develop and evaluate state-of-the-art deep learning models for waterfowl detection. Our system of using a combination of sUAS and machine learning has proved to be an efficient and accurate approach for collecting, analyzing, and estimating waterfowl abundance.},

Surveillance by multiple nodes in ad hoc mode is directly dependent upon the continuous data sharing, cooperative decision making and stabilized network formation. Failures in network can hinder the performance and can decrease its operability. It is difficult to aloof network from discrete failures. Therefore, stabilized model is required which can provide stability to the whole network. For this, a self-healing neural model is developed which is capable of handling uncertain failures.

A Novel and cost effective Light Emitting Diode (LED) based wireless communication of field sensor data to server has been recently explored.

The LED pattern image can be captured using any decent resolution cameras that can be mounted on UAVs. The proposed framework generates LED sequences with the help of embedded boards and utilizes image processing and deep learning for the decoding of the sensor data from the LED pattern image. The experiments are carried out with the images taken under various lighting conditions from different heights in the field.

abstract={Vegetation is an important parameter in all bio- and ecosystems, and it should be monitored to conserve and restore the environment. This paper presents a design and implementation of a compact system for vegetation cover monitoring, which consists of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with four different cameras (RGB, NIR, NDVI, and red). These cameras simultaneously record videos and wirelessly send them to a ground station that applies on them a set of algorithms to construct a mosaic representing the covered area and segment vegetative regions. Mosaicing is performed using a fast multi-threaded approach based on binary descriptors. For segmenting vegetation, two scenarios are tested by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The first scenario trained a CNN using the images obtained from the four cameras, and then used it with the constructed mosaics. In the second scenario, we trained individual CNNs using images from each of the four cameras individually. The performance of the former scenario exceeded the others from the perspective of accuracy. Moreover, it proved to be highly comparable to previous approaches utilizing level sets, while the processing time is reduced. The proposed approach obtained high accuracy in terms of the Dice similarity coefficient (97 %), which demonstrates its favorable performance.},

abstract={The importance of satellite imagery analysis has increased dramatically over the last several years, keeping pace with the rapid improvements seen in both remote sensing platforms and sensors. As this field expands, so too does the interest in using machine learning methods to automate parts of the imagery analyst's workflow. In this paper we address one aspect of this challenge: the development of a method for the automatic extraction of parking lots from aerial imagery. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work conducted on the development of an end-to-end pipeline for this particular task. Due to the limited size of our dataset and to accommodate the potentially limited size of future datasets, we propose a deep learning approach using transfer learning. This process hinges upon the use of state of the art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), trained on general image classification datasets. These networks were then fine-tuned on our custom dataset, to establish a comprehensive benchmark for this task. Our method exhibits promising results for automatic parking lot extraction, and is generalizable enough to work with different input types, including high resolution aerial orthoimagery, satellite imagery, full motion video (FMV), and UAV imagery.},

abstract={This paper proposes two novel deep learning models for 2D and 3D classification of objects in extremely low-resolution time-of-flight imagery. The models have been developed to suit contemporary range imaging hardware based on a recently fabricated Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) camera with 64 œá 64 pixel resolution. Being the first prototype of its kind, only a small data set has been collected so far which makes it challenging for training models. To bypass this hurdle, transfer learning is applied to the widely used VGG-16 convolutional neural network (CNN), with supplementary layers added specifically to handle SPAD data. This classifier and the renowned Faster-RCNN detector offer benchmark models for comparison to a newly created 3D CNN operating on time-of-flight data acquired by the SPAD sensor. Another contribution of this work is the proposed shot noise removal algorithm which is particularly useful to mitigate the camera sensitivity in situations of excessive lighting. Models have been tested in both low-light indoor settings and outdoor daytime conditions, on eight objects exhibiting small physical dimensions, low reflectivity, featureless structures and located at ranges from 25m to 700m. Despite antagonist factors, the proposed 2D model has achieved 95% average precision and recall, with higher accuracy for the 3D model.},

abstract={Autonomous landing of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in crowded scenarios is crucial for successful deployment of UAVs in populated areas, particularly in emergency landing situations where the highest priority is to avoid hurting people. In this work, a new visual-based algorithm for identifying Safe Landing Zones (SLZ) in crowded scenarios is proposed, considering a camera mounted on a UAV, where the people in the scene move with unknown dynamics. To do so, a density map is generated for each image frame using a Deep Neural Network, from where a binary occupancy map is obtained aiming to overestimate the people's location for security reasons. Then, the occupancy map is projected to the head's plane, and the SLZ candidates are obtained as circular regions with a minimum security radius, within the head's plane. Finally, to keep track of the SLZ candidates, a multiple instance tracking algorithm is implemented using Kalman Filters along with the Hungarian algorithm for data association. Several scenarios were studied to prove the validity of the proposed strategy, including public datasets and real uncontrolled scenarios with people moving in public squares, taken from a UAV in flight. The study showed promising results in the search of preventing the UAV from hurting people during emergency landing.},

abstract={We introduce a robust wearable sensor suite fusing arm motion and hand gesture recognition for operator control of UAVs. The sensor suite fuses mechanomyography (MMG) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to capture multi-modal (arm movement and hand gesture) command signals simultaneously. The IMU produces world referenced orientation and acceleration data while concomitant MMG tracks muscle activation through surface vibration. The use of surface muscle vibration for gesture recognition removes the need for electrical contact with the skin, which has impeded other forms of muscle measurement for gesture recognition in the field. This investigation presents hardware design, inertial recognition of arm movement, and the detailed structure of a convolutional neural network (CNN) system used for real-time hand gesture recognition based on MMG signals. The system achieved 94% accuracy for five gestures with simple calibration for each user, thereby providing an intuitive gesture based UAV control system. To our knowledge this is the first wearable system enabling multimodal control of UAVs through intuitive gestures that does not require electrical skin contact. Future work involves testing the system with larger UAV swarms.},

abstract={Significantly outperforming traditional machine learning methods, deep convolutional neural networks have gained increasing popularity in the application of image classification and segmentation. Nevertheless, deep learning-based methods usually require a large amount of training data, which is quite labor-intensive and time-demanding. To deal with the problem in generating training data, we propose in this paper a novel approach to generate image annotations by transferring labels from aerial images to UAV images and refine the annotations using a densely connected CRF model with an embedded naive Bayes classifier. The generated annotations not only present correct semantic labels, but also preserve accurate class boundaries. To validate the utility of these automatic annotations, we deploy them as training data for pixel-wise image segmentation and compare the results with the segmentation using manual annotations. Experiment results demonstrate that the automatic annotations can achieve comparable segmentation accuracy as the manual annotations.},

abstract={The deep neural networks are capable of processing large amounts of data for image processing applications like classification, segmentation and identification etc. Conditional- Generative Adversarial Network (C-GAN) is an example of Deep Learning (DL)-based image processing algorithm that is used widely for identifying targets in images. In a Deep Learning based image processing application the quality of the input image plays an important role. The quality and variations within the dataset helps the neural network filters to derive the best features for the classification and identification of the target in the image. Many deep learning approaches will have a preprocessing pipeline which improves the quality of the input training data. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of preprocessing methods to improve C-GAN's ability to detect epiphytes in images acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). These methods include 1) trimming the training images to include mostly the target plant, 2) generating annotation images with a thresholding technique, and 3) incorporating binary cross entropy loss function. Results obtained from this study shows that the percent occupancy of input images and annotation method plays an important role in identifying the target plant.},

The main contributions of this article are 1) proposing an adaptive neural network compensation method : INDI with neural network(INDI_NN) to correctly consider the model uncertainties; 2) a quaternion based reference model which is suitable for vehicles to experience a high angle maneuver. The simulation results support the proposed control scheme in getting better tracking performance during large range of attitudes. Hence, the proposed control method makes INDI controller more practical and more suitable for high angle maneuver like Immelman Turn.},

abstract={Nowadays, the development of robots and smart tractors for the automation of sowing, harvesting, weeding etc. is transforming agriculture. Farmers are moving from an agriculture where everything is applied uniformly to a much more targeted farming. This new kind of farming is commonly referred to as precision agriculture. However for autonomous guidance of these agricultural machines and even sometimes for weed detection an accurate detection of crop rows is required. In this paper we propose a new method called CRowNet which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) and the Hough transform to detect crop rows in images taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The method consists of a model formed with SegNet (S-SegNet) and a CNN based Hough transform (HoughCNet). The performance of the proposed method was quantitatively compared to traditional approaches and it showed the best and most robust result. A good crop row detection rate of 93.58% was obtained with an IoU score per crop row above 70%. Moreover the model trained on a given crop field is able to detect rows in images of different types of crops.},

abstract={Different applications in remote sensing, such as crop monitoring and visual surveillance, demand the automatic detection of changes from sets of images acquired over time. Most traditional approaches use satellite imagery, which, besides the known issues such as cloud cover and image acquisition frequency for nongeostationary satellites, are very costly. In this context, with the recent technological advances, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become ubiquitous in numerous applications. In this letter, we present a fully convolutional Siamese autoencoder method for change detection in aerial images, in particular for those obtained with UAVs. We show that, by using an autoencoder, we can further reduce the number of labeled samples required to achieve competitive results. We evaluated the performance of our approach on two different data sets, and the results showed that our methodology outperforms the state of the art, while demanding less training data.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) deployment is investigated for visible light communication (VLC)-enabled UAV networks. Here, UAVs can simul-taneously provide communications and illumination services to ground users. In this model, ambient illumination distribution of the service area must be considered since it can cause interference over the VLC link and affects the illumination requirements of users. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which jointly considers UAV deployment, user association, power efficiency, and predictions of the illumination distribution. To solve this problem, we first need to predict illumination distribution to proactively determine the UAV deployment and user association so as to minimize total transmission power of UAVs. To predict the illumination distribution of the entire service area, a federated learning framework based on the machine learning algorithm of convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) is proposed. Compared to the centralized machine learning algorithms that requires complete illumination data for centralized training, the proposed algorithm enables the UAVs to train their local CAE with partial illumination data and cooperatively build a global CAE model that can predict the entire illumination distribution. Using these predictions, the optimal UAV deployment and user association policy that minimizes the total transmission power of UAVs is determined. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the transmission power of UAVs up to 14.8% and 25.1%, respectively, compared to the local CAE prediction models and the conventional optimal algorithm without illumination distribution predictions.},

The controller is composed of trajectory outer-loop and attitude inner-loop. The dynamic inversion method is used to design these loops. In addition, the angular rate error equations with proportional-integral desired dynamics are used to design the adaptive update law for compensating the system model error. The main advantage of this approach is its ability of the fast adaptation that leads to good steady and transient performance as well as simple design process. The longitudinal nonlinear dynamic simulations show that this approach improves the stability and transient response of attitude angle and achieves the transition flight control of the CRW UAV successfully.},

abstract={Over the past few years, the use of swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in monitoring and remote area surveillance applications has become widespread thanks to the price reduction and the increased capabilities of drones. The drones in the swarm need to cooperatively explore an unknown area, in order to identify and monitor interesting targets, while minimizing their movements. In this work, we propose a distributed Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach that scales to larger swarms without modifications. The proposed framework relies on the possibility for the UAVs to exchange some information through a communication channel, in order to achieve context-awareness and implicitly coordinate the swarm‚Äôs actions. Our experiments show that the proposed method can yield effective strategies, which are robust to communication channel impairments, and that can easily deal with non-uniform distributions of targets and obstacles. Moreover, when agents are trained in a specific scenario, they can adapt to a new one with minimal additional training. We also show that our approach achieves better performance compared to a computationally intensive look-ahead heuristic.},

They are being engaged in many types of missions, ranging from military to agriculture passing by entertainment and rescue or even delivery. Nonetheless, for being able to perform such tasks, UAVs have to navigate safely in an often dynamic and partly unknown environment. This brings many challenges to overcome, some of which can lead to damages or degradations of different body parts. Thus, new tools and methods are required to allow the successful analysis and identification of the different threats that UAVs have to manage during their missions or flights. Various approaches, addressing this domain, have been proposed. However, most of them typically identify the changes in the UAVs behavior rather than the issue. This work presents an approach, which focuses not only on identifying degradations of UAVs during flights, but estimate the source of the failure as well.},
