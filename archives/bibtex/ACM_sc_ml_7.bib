abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting adversarial examples by training a binary classifier with both origin data and saliency data. Saliency In the case of image classification model, saliency simply explain how the model makes decisions by identifying significant pixels for prediction. A model shows wrong classification output always learns wrong features and shows wrong saliency as well. Our approach shows good performance on detecting adversarial perturbations. We quantitatively evaluate generalization ability of the detector, showing that detectors trained with strong adversaries perform well on weak adversaries.},

abstract = {Real-time traffic volume inference is key to an intelligent city. It is a challenging task because accurate traffic volumes on the roads can only be measured at certain locations where sensors are installed. Moreover, the traffic evolves over time due to the influences of weather, events, holidays, etc. Existing solutions to the traffic volume inference problem often rely on dense GPS trajectories, which inevitably fail to account for the vehicles which carry no GPS devices or have them turned off. Consequently, the results are biased to taxicabs because they are almost always online for GPS tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the citywide traffic volume inference using both dense GPS trajectories and incomplete trajectories captured by camera surveillance systems. Our approach employs a high-fidelity traffic simulator and deep reinforcement learning to recover full vehicle movements from the incomplete trajectories. In order to jointly model the recovered trajectories and dense GPS trajectories, we construct spatiotemporal graphs and use multi-view graph embedding to encode the multi-hop correlations between road segments into real-valued vectors. Finally, we infer the citywide traffic volumes by propagating the traffic values of monitored road segments to the unmonitored ones through masked pairwise similarities. Extensive experiments with two big regions in a provincial capital city in China verify the effectiveness of our approach.},

Firstly, the data of banking institutions are analyzed and cleaned to convert the categorical data into numeric data. Then, to "split" preprocessing the data after processing, divided into training set and test set. In the training set, LR, Naive Bayes, K-NN, Decision Tree, Random Forests, Extra - trees, AdaBoost, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost algorithm (via the grid search method GridSearchCV) are established to study the customer's deposit ordering tendency respectively. Finally, the Stacking fusion algorithm in Ensemble Learning(The meta-learner adopts LR algorithm) is used to fuse each single model to build the best bank customer time deposit ordering classification model. The research results show that using python, based on the different dimensions of bank customer information, the Stacking fusion algorithm based on Ensemble algorithm has better prediction effect than the single model, and the Stacking fusion algorithm has better robustness. Therefore, this paper takes the Stacking fusion model as the final prediction model to effectively identify bank customers and help banking institutions understand customer subscription tendency.},

The indexing process automatically identifies the spatial and temporal fields, normalizes and cleans those fields, and then loads them into a big data store where the information can be efficiently searched, queried, and analyzed. We evaluated our approach on 600 datasets published by the City of Los Angeles and show that we can automatically process their data and can efficiently access and analyze the indexed data.},

abstract = {In this paper and in order to design a smart decision support system able to discriminate the community-acquired meningitis categories, we studied three different decision rule induction approaches. Two of these approaches are based on rough sets but differ in the number of stages in their processes and in the method used to generate rules. The first approach contains three stages namely continuous attributes' discretization, conditional features' reduction and decision rule induction and it applies the Indiscernibility Based Rule (IBR) algorithm. However, the second only includes two stages, which are discretization and decision rule generation, and utilizes the LEM2 (Learning from Examples Module, version 2) method. The third approach is similar to the second one except that it determines decision rules relied on AQ (Algorithm Quasi-optimal) or CN2 algorithm. The experiments were conducted on two multidimensional databases, one derived from the other, of clinical records concerning 310 cases of bacterial or viral meningitis. The obtained results showed that: combined with the "Greedy Heuristic for Computing Decision Reducts and Approximate Decision Reducts" (GHCADR) and the "Equal Width Interval Discretization" (EWID) methods, IBR algorithm offers the best performances in term of prediction accuracy, quality and compactness of generated decision rule sets.},

In the first step, we design a synchronous mechanism that makes correlated devices synchronized and obtain the pseudo labels to form the original training set. In the second step, we propose a sample selection method based on reliability and diversity to filter the original training set, based on which we automatically accomplish the model construction. We conduct empirical evaluation of our SSL method compared with three state-of-the-art methods; and the evaluation shows that by applying our SSL method, we can achieve the classifier with higher accuracy.},

The solution features the use of similarity between spatiotemporal scenarios to retrieve offline decisions as the initial solution for online fine tuning, which significantly shortens the online decision time. A fast query algorithm that exploits the correlation of spatiotemporal scenarios is utilized in the decision framework to quickly retrieve the best offline decisions. The solution is demonstrated using simulation studies, and can be utilized in other decision applications where spaiotemporal environments play a crucial role in the decision process and the allowed decision time window is short.},

abstract = {Pan-sharpening is used to fuse multispectral images with low spatial resolution and a panchromatic (Pan) image with high spatial resolution to generate synthesized images featured with high spatial and multispectral properties. The pan-sharpened images are assumed valuable for further application. However, there have been a few investigations on the effectiveness of the pan-sharpened products in practice (i.e. object detection), compared with the fact many algorithms for pan-sharpening have been developed. In this paper, improvements contributed by pan-sharpening process for the object detection in multispectral imagery were investigated. Original multispectral images along with the corresponding Pan images acquired by Gaojing-1 (SuperView-1, as the first sub-meter high-resolution commercial remote sensing satellite independently developed in China) satellite were used. Seven algorithms widely used in pan-sharpening were applied separately and compared, while the object detection experiments were done by implementing Faster RCNN. The preliminary findings show: (1) the pan-sharpened images present obviously positive contribution to object detection with Faster RCNN, compared to the original multispectral images; (2) detection results of the pan-sharpened images vary with the algorithms used in pan-sharpening process. Furthermore, this investigation suggests none of the pan-sharpening algorithms showed absolute advantages in image fusion to achieve better object detection consequently.},

However, due to the structural complexity of ground objects and noise introduced during the generation stage of ground truth labels, it is challenging to automatically recover the regularized height map from only one orthogonal photography. In this paper, we propose a novel deep network for estimating accurate and regularized height map from a single aerial image. The network mainly contains two sub-networks, namely the height map derivation sub-network and the boundary guidance sub-network. They are sequentially connected together, so that the corresponding boundary map can be directly calculated after the height map is obtained. We also propose a loss function suitable for semantic boundary guidance, which is similar to SSIM loss function at the edges of the ground targets. Apart from pursuing accuracy of height regression, boundary regularity constraints derived from semantic labels are also employed to form a joint metric criterion. We perform a qualitative and quantitative evaluations on ISPRS remote sensing dataset, and the result indicate that our framework improve both accuracy and regularity of estimated depth map.},

The proposed strategy combines three important elements of limb motion: the motion pattern, the number of repetitions, and the period of each repetition. Two methods are adopted to recognize the motion pattern: support vector machine and MoveNet, which is a deep neural network we proposed base on CNN and LSTM. A method combining zero-crossing detection and wavelet transform is used to count the number of repetitions and analyze the period of each repetition. The experimental results illustrate that the precision of workout-action identification is up to 97.71%, and the average error between the period calculated and the actual value is 4.03%.},

abstract = {An algorithm that can effectively distinguish different vehicles with high similarity by identifying vehicle photos collected from multiple angles is called vehicle recognition algorithm. This algorithm has been extensively applicable to the region of intelligent transportation and urban computing, but it is always challenging to implement the algorithm. In this paper, an modified feature extraction method is provided, which enhances the traditional nonlocal neural networks and improves its ability to capture the relationship between different positions in the image. At the same time, we adopt a multi-branch global and local information learning strategy, which not merely captures the global features, moreover, those local parts of the feature can be more focused on finer discrimi-nating information in each part of the partition and filtering information on other partitions as the number of partitions increases. Finally, a hybrid relationship between channel feature fusion and channel level is introduced based on this learning strategy. The experimental results show that the MAP and Rank-1 indexes on the VERI-776 mainstream public dataset are 78.9% and 93.86%, which are the highest running scores in this dataset at the present stage, proving that the proposed algorithm is excelled other main stream design.},

abstract = {In recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based trackers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets. Most of these trackers train a binary classifier to distinguish the target from its background. However, they suffer from two limitations. Firstly, these trackers cannot effectively handle significant appearance variations due to the limited number of positive samples. Secondly, there exists a significant imbalance of gradient contributions between easy and hard samples, where the easy samples usually dominate the computation of gradient. In this paper, we propose a robust tracking method via Statistical Positive sample generation and Gradient Aware learning (SPGA) to address the above two limitations. To enrich the diversity of positive samples, we present an effective and efficient statistical positive sample generation algorithm to generate positive samples in the feature space. Furthermore, to handle the issue of imbalance between easy and hard samples, we propose a gradient sensitive loss to harmonize the gradient contributions between easy and hard samples. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets including OTB50, OTB100 and VOT2016 demonstrate that the proposed SPGA performs favorably against several state-of-the-art trackers.},

Building footprints are elevated in world coordinates and projected onto images. Building heights are estimated by scoring projected footprints based on their alignment with building features in images. Building footprints with estimated heights can be converted to simple 3D building models, which are projected back to images to identify buildings. In this procedure, accurate camera projections are critical. However, camera position errors inherited from external sensors commonly exist, which adversely affect results. We derive a solution to precisely locate cameras on maps using correspondence between image features and building footprints. Experiments on real-world datasets show the promise of our method.},

abstract = {Spatial event forecasting is challenging and crucial for urban sensing scenarios, which is beneficial for a wide spectrum of spatial-temporal mining applications, ranging from traffic management, public safety, to environment policy making. In spite of significant progress has been made to solve spatial-temporal prediction problem, most existing deep learning based methods based on a coarse-grained spatial setting and the success of such methods largely relies on data sufficiency. In many real-world applications, predicting events with a fine-grained spatial resolution do play a critical role to provide high discernibility of spatial-temporal data distributions. However, in such cases, applying existing methods will result in weak performance since they may not well capture the quality spatial-temporal representations when training triple instances are highly imbalanced across locations and time. To tackle this challenge, we develop a hierarchically structured Spatial-Temporal ransformer network (STtrans) which leverages a main embedding space to capture the inter-dependencies across time and space for alleviating the data imbalance issue. In our STtrans framework, the first-stage transformer module discriminates different types of region and time-wise relations. To make the latent spatial-temporal representations be reflective of the relational structure between categories, we further develop a cross-category fusion transformer network to endow STtrans with the capability to preserve the semantic signals in a fully dynamic manner. Finally, an adversarial training strategy is introduced to yield a robust spatial-temporal learning under data imbalance. Extensive experiments on real-world imbalanced spatial-temporal datasets from NYC and Chicago demonstrate the superiority of our method over various state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {The neighborhood-based recommendation method is a basic collaborative-filtering method, and one of the methods still used in the industry. The main basis for recommendation is the user's scoring data in the neighborhood-based recommendation method. However, due to the sparsity of user scoring data, the number of recommendations for long-tail items in the neighborhood-based method is relatively small. Although deep-learning technology has been widely applied to the neighborhood-based method, user scoring data are still needed in the methods, so the number of long-tail items in recommendation results is still very small. In order to increase the number of long-tail items recommended in the neighborhood-based method, this paper proposes a long-tail recommendation framework using frequent neighbors, and applies the framework to two real-world datasets. Experiments showed that the recommendation framework proposed in this paper effectively increases the number of long-tail items recommended in the neighborhood-based method and significantly improves the coverage metric.},

abstract = {Urban villages refer to the residential areas lagging behind the rapid urbanization process in many developing countries. These areas are usually with overcrowded buildings, high population density, and low living standards, bringing potential risks of public safety and hindering the urban development. Therefore, it is crucial for urban authorities to identify the boundaries of urban villages and estimate their resident and floating populations so as to better renovate and manage these areas. Traditional approaches, such as field surveys and demographic census, are time consuming and labor intensive, lacking a comprehensive understanding of urban villages. Against this background, we propose a two-phase framework for urban village boundary identification and population estimation. Specifically, based on heterogeneous open government data, the proposed framework can not only accurately identify the boundaries of urban villages from large-scale satellite imagery by fusing road networks guided patches with bike-sharing drop-off patterns, but also accurately estimate the resident and floating populations of urban villages with a proposed multi-view neural network model. We evaluate our method leveraging real-world datasets collected from Xiamen Island. Results show that our framework can accurately identify the urban village boundaries with an IoU of 0.827, and estimate the resident population and floating population with R2 of 0.92 and 0.94 respectively, outperforming the baseline methods. We also deploy our system on the Xiamen Open Government Data Platform to provide services to both urban authorities and citizens.},

In this work, we propose a geographically context-aware random forest model for street-level air quality inference using high spatial resolution data collected by an opportunistic mobile sensor network. Compared with a traditional random forest model, the proposed method builds a local model for each location by considering the neighbors in both geographical and feature space.

Yet, restaurants continue to attract couples and augment the landscape with visible signs of affection at a table for two---or more. User-generated content (UGC) of restaurant reviews from online review site Yelp (http://yelp.com) provide text on romantic keywords such as "date", "love", "boyfriend", "wife", "anniversary", "family" by geolocated restaurants. We use these to distinguish restaurants and discover features of restaurants associated with various romantic keywords. These features include restaurant ratings and location, as well as comments about the ambiance, food, service, etc.Using data from the Yelp Dataset Challenge in U.S. cities Charlotte, NC, Las Vegas, NM, Phoenix, AZ, and Pittsburgh, PA, we employ different data mining and correlation tools as well as GIS modeling to learn more about what types of romantic relationships use which parts of the city, and how their choices of restaurants differ by relationship stage. We find that families prefer restaurants that are outside of the central business district (CBD), have good service and high-rated food, while couples---married or dating---prefer hot spots with great ambiance for nightlife. We also find that inexpensive food is not associated with romantic dates, and the quality of service also plays a secondary role to a "classy" and "cozy" atmosphere.},

abstract = {Cities across the country (20 to date) are rapidly passing laws to mandate the collection and disclosure of energy usage data with the hopes that such data could be utilized to benchmark building energy performance and provide a basis for designing and deploying efficiency measures. However, numerous municipalities are struggling to translate such data into actionable insights on which buildings are the best candidates for energy efficiency interventions. Current studies are limited in their ability to compare energy efficiency of buildings at the city scale and maintain interpretability necessary to result in effective decision making that can facilitate municipal policy and program design. In this paper, we present an integrated data-driven method based on recursive partitioning and stochastic frontier analysis to benchmark energy performance of building stock across an entire city. We implement the proposed method on a dataset of over 10,000 buildings in New York City. The preliminary results begin to quantify the potential for building energy efficiency and give further support to city officials for examining effects of possible interventions. We aim to establish a robust methodology that provides a standard way to benchmark building energy performance at the city scale, which can be easily applied to other cities across the country.},

abstract = {Due to lack of high-resolution data both in space and time, mapping land use change in built-up areas remain challenging. In this work, we developed an approach that integrates multiple "geo-sensor" data sources, including remote sensing and social media, for mapping urban land use changes. The approach starts by mapping built-up expansion annually in small patches, using dense time periods of remotely sensed imagery. We refine these patches and identify the major categories of land use such as residential, commercial, manufacturing, recreational, and office. We further select one major category---residential---and use social media data and house trading records to classify it into three sub-categories: gated communities, ordinary communities, and urban slums. We demonstrate our approach using the multi-sourced data of Kunming, a medium-sized city in China. The results showed that our approach provides an efficient and integrative way for mapping large-scale land use change in urban regions with significant details that are not feasible only with limited remote sensing data.},

abstract = {Due to the emergence of social media, there is a paradigm shift in the area of information production, processing and consumption. Hence, investigation in the utilization of open social media data is a relevant research topic. The openness of data, social media data, enables innovation and societal value creation. Social media analytics is an evolving research domain with interdisciplinary methods that are common in data mining such as text mining, social network analysis, trend analysis, and sentiment analysis. Also, social media analytics deals with development and evaluation of frameworks and informatics tools to process noisy and unstructured social media data. On the other hand, Internet of Things (IoT) enables the utilization of digital artifacts with well-established solutions and allows things to be connected regardless of location and time. However, a literature review about social media analytics and IoT integration is missing. In this paper, we conducted a systematic literature review of social media analytics and IoT integration. The literature review indicates that there are fewer research works done in the area of social media analytics and IoT compared to Data Mining and IoT. This paper facilitates discussion and elicits research potentials in social media analytics and IoT integration.},

abstract = {During the past few years, the analysis of data generated from Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have aided in the identification of urban patterns, understanding activity behaviours in urban areas, as well as producing novel recommender systems that facilitate users’ choices. Recognizing crowd-mobility patterns in cities is very important for public safety, traffic managment, disaster management, and urban planning. In this article, we propose a framework for Recognizing the Crowd Mobility Patterns in Cities using LBSN data. Our proposed framework comprises four main components: data gathering, recurrent crowd-mobility patterns extraction, temporal functional regions detection, and visualization component. More specifically, we employ a novel approach based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization and Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation for extracting the recurrent crowd-mobility patterns in cities illustrating how crowd shifts from one area to another during each day across various time slots. Moreover, the framework employs a hierarchical clustering-based algorithm for identifying what we refer to as temporal functional regions by modeling functional areas taking into account temporal variation by means of check-ins’ categories. We build the framework using a spatial-temporal dataset crawled from Twitter for two entire years (2013 and 2014) for the area of Manhattan in New York City. We perform a detailed analysis of the extracted crowd patterns with an exploratory visualization showing that our proposed approach can identify clearly obvious mobility patterns that recur over time and location in the urban scenario. Using same time interval, we show that correlating the temporal functional regions with the recognized recurrent crowd-mobility patterns can yield to a deeper understanding of city dynamics and the motivation behind the crowd mobility. We are confident that our proposed framework not only can help in managing complex city environments and better allocation of resources based on the expected crowd mobility and temporal functional regions but also can have a direct implication on a variety of applications such as personalized recommender systems, anomalous event detection, disaster resilience management systems, and others.},

abstract = {The availability of diverse embedded sensors in modern smartphones has created exciting opportunities for developing context-aware services and applications, such as Human activity recognition (HAR) in healthcare and smart buildings. However, recognizing human activities using smartphones remains a challenging task and requires efficient data processing approaches due to the limited resources of the device. For example, the training process is usually performed offline (on the server or the cloud) but rarely online on the mobile device itself, because traditional batch learning usually needs a large dataset of many users. Therefore, building models using complex multiclass algorithms is generally very time-consuming. In this paper, we have experimented two approaches in order to accelerate the training time. In the first approach, we conducted batch-learning experiments using a GPU platform. Results showed that High Performance Extreme Learning Machine (HPELM) offers the best compromise accuracy/time. Moreover, it achieved better performance on two dynamic activities, outperforming SVM in our previous study. In the second approach, we conducted experiments using online stream learning. Unlike the first approach, experiments were performed using accelerometer data only. We also studied the effects of user/device dependency and feature engineering on the classification performance by comparing five constructed real data streams. Experimental results showed that Hoeffding Adaptive Tree has comparable performance to batch learning, especially for user and device dependent data streams.},

abstract = {Citizen engagement and technology usage are two emerging trends driven by smart city initiatives. Typically, citizens report issues, such as broken roads, garbage dumps, etc. through web portals and mobile apps, in order for the government authorities to take appropriate actions. Several mediums - text, image, audio, video - are used to report these issues. Through a user study with 13 citizens and 3 authorities, we found that image is the most preferred medium to report civic issues. However, analyzing civic issue related images is challenging for the authorities as it requires manual effort. In this work, given an image, we propose to generate a Civic Issue Graph consisting of a set of objects and the semantic relations between them, which are representative of the underlying civic issue. We also release two multi-modal (text and images) datasets, that can help in further analysis of civic issues from images. We present an approach for adversarial adaptation of existing scene graph models that enables the use of scene graphs for new applications in the absence of any labelled training data. We conduct several experiments to analyze the efficacy of our approach, and using human evaluation, we establish the appropriateness of our model at representing different civic issues.},

abstract = {Mobility and the integration of public transport are concepts that are consolidating more and more on a global scale and Latin America it is not the exception. The need to establish more inclusive and sustainable public transport programs has brought larger cities in Latin America to seek new ways to enhance mobility and integration of transport systems. In this paper, we analyze the level of mobility and integration of public transport systems in eight Latin American cities. For each city we applied the mobility integration index introduced by Cohen [1] and Kamargianni [2] considering key factors including ticket and payment integration, use of information and communication technologies (ICT), institutional integration, clean energy transport and mobility packages. The study indicates that Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City and Buenos Aires have made most advances in implementing a more integrated and mobile public transport system, with S\~{a}o Paulo, Santiago de Chile and Curitiba showing an intermediate level of integration and Lima and Bogota struggling to achieve higher levels of mobility. While the study indicates that integrated mobility programs are taking off in Latin America, faster development is limited by multiple factors including a lacking vision on inclusive and sustainable public transport, resistance from transport operators, limitations in ICT infrastructure and limited financial resources to embark on mayor mobility programs in the region. Given that this research is limited to a comparison of Latin American cities and to advance with much needed mobility in the region, it is recommended to conduct further research and derive lessons learned from smart cities with more advanced levels of mobility in public transport in Europe or Asia.},

abstract = {Taxi demand prediction is of much importance, which enables the building of intelligent systems and smart city. It is necessary to predict taxi demand accurately to schedule taxi fleet in a reasonable and efficient way and to reduce the pressure of traffic jam. However, the taxi demand involves complex and non-linear spatial-temporal impacts. The superiority of deep learning makes people explore the possibility to apply it to traffic prediction. State-of-the-art methods on taxi demand prediction only capture static spatial correlations between regions (e.g., Using static graph embedding) and only take taxi demand data into consideration. We propose a Multi-Task Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (MSTGAT-Net) framework which models the correlations between regions dynamically with graph-attention network and captures the correlation between taxi pick up and taxi drop off with multi-task training. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper to address the taxi demand prediction problem with graph attention network and multi-task learning. Experiments on real-world taxi data show that our model is superior to state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {With increased focus on in situ analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are getting deployed on embedded devices at the network edge. Growing popularity of Deep Learning (DL) and inference largely due to minimization of feature engineering, availability of pre-trained models and fine-tunable datasets especially in image and video analytics, have made these de-facto standard. However, the embedded systems employing these models are often resource constrained and fail to handle scenarios where arrival rate and input data volume increase over a given time period. This has a direct effect on the storage and network usage of such devices, rendering the traditional strategies of input buffering and network offloading ineffective. This paper investigates the use of dynamic layer-wise partitioning and partial execution of DL inference phase to enable inelastic embedded systems to support varying sensing rates and large data volume. The proposed partial execution scheme and partitioning algorithm perform better than standard frame-wise inference methods, when evaluated using workloads of few popular CNNs used in standard object detection models.},

We propose a system which combines sensor data from autonomous vehicles and IoT data collected from pedestrians' mobile devices. Our approach includes two methods for vulnerable road user (VRU) detection and pedestrian movement intention prediction, and a model to combine the two outputs for potentially improving the autonomous decision-making. The first method creates a world model (WM) and accurately localizes VRUs using in-vehicle cameras and external mobile device data. The second method is a deep learning model to predict pedestrian's next movement steps using real-time trajectory and training with historical mobile device data. To test the system, we conduct three pilot tests at a university campus with a custom-built autonomous car and mobile devices carried by pedestrians. The results from our controlled experiments show that VRU detection can more accurately distinguish locations of pedestrians using IoT data. Furthermore, up to five future steps of pedestrians can be predicted within 2 m.},

Fog computing is enabling a new breed of IoT services, which is also a new opportunity for mobile crowdsensing. Thus, in this article, we introduce a framework enabling mobile crowdsensing in fog environments with a hierarchical scheduling strategy. We first introduce the crowdsensing framework that has a hierarchical structure to organize different resources. Since different positions and performance of fog nodes influence the quality of service (QoS) of IoT applications, we formulate a scheduling problem in the hierarchical fog structure and solve it by using a deep reinforcement learning–based strategy. From extensive simulation results, our solution outperforms other scheduling solutions for mobile crowdsensing in the given fog computing environment.},

Although existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of running deep neural network inference operations on mobile and embedded devices, they overlooked the reliability of mobile computing models. Reliability measurements such as predictive uncertainty estimations are key factors for improving the decision accuracy and user experience. In this work, we propose RDeepSense, the first deep learning model that provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimations for resource-constrained mobile and embedded devices. RDeepSense enables the predictive uncertainty by adopting a tunable proper scoring rule as the training criterion and dropout as the implicit Bayesian approximation, which theoretically proves its correctness. To reduce the computational complexity, RDeepSense employs efficient dropout and predictive distribution estimation instead of the model ensemble or sampling-based method for inference operations. We evaluate RDeepSense with four mobile sensing applications using Intel Edison devices. Results show that RDeepSense can reduce around 90% of the energy consumption while producing superior uncertainty estimations and preserving at least the same model accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

For this reason, we introduce an open-source design framework for highly-connected smart sensors, and we implemented it in an advanced controller for traffic light, providing a single component to support researchers and engineers from the earliest stages of development in laboratories till on-the-field research and testing.},

abstract = {Each edition of the challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events DCASE contained several tasks involving sound event detection in different setups. DCASE 2017 presented participants with three such tasks, each having specific datasets and detection requirements: Task 2, in which target sound events were very rare in both training and testing data, Task 3 having overlapping events annotated in real-life audio, and Task 4, in which only weakly labeled data were available for training. In this paper, we present three tasks, including the datasets and baseline systems, and analyze the challenge entries for each task. We observe the popularity of methods using deep neural networks, and the still widely used mel frequency-based representations, with only few approaches standing out as radically different. Analysis of the systems behavior reveals that task-specific optimization has a big role in producing good performance; however, often this optimization closely follows the ranking metric, and its maximization/minimization does not result in universally good performance. We also introduce the calculation of confidence intervals based on a jackknife resampling procedure to perform statistical analysis of the challenge results. The analysis indicates that while the 95% confidence intervals for many systems overlap, there are significant differences in performance between the top systems and the baseline for all tasks.},
