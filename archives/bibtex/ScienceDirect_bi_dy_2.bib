abstract = {The goal of the present study is to reveal how the neural mechanisms underlying non-native speech perception change throughout childhood. In a pre-attentive listening fMRI task, English monolingual and Spanish–English bilingual children – divided into groups of younger (6–8yrs) and older children (9–10yrs) – were asked to watch a silent movie while several English syllable combinations played through a pair of headphones. Two additional groups of monolingual and bilingual adults were included in the analyses. Our results show that the neural mechanisms supporting speech perception throughout development differ in monolinguals and bilinguals. While monolinguals recruit perceptual areas (i.e., superior temporal gyrus) in early and late childhood to process native speech, bilinguals recruit perceptual areas (i.e., superior temporal gyrus) in early childhood and higher-order executive areas in late childhood (i.e., bilateral middle frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobule, among others) to process non-native speech. The findings support the Perceptual Assimilation Model and the Speech Learning Model and suggest that the neural system processes phonological information differently depending on the stage of L2 speech learning.}

An analysis of spontaneous bilingual codeswitching in the Bangor Miami Corpus (Deuchar, Davies, Herring, Parafita Couto, & Carter, 2014) reveals that in anticipation of switching languages, Spanish–English bilinguals produce slowed speech rate and cross-language phonological influence on consonant voice onset time. A study of speech comprehension using the visual world paradigm demonstrates that bilingual listeners can indeed exploit these low-level phonetic cues to anticipate that a codeswitch is coming and to suppress activation of the non-target language. We discuss the implications of these results for current theories of bilingual language regulation, and situate them in terms of recent proposals relating the coupling of the production and comprehension systems more generally.}

abstract = {Background and objectives. Due to the large migrations over the past three decades, large numbers of individuals with schizophrenia are learning a second language and being seen in clinics in that second language. We conducted within-subject comparisons to clarify the contribution of clinical, linguistic and bilingual features in the first and second languages of bilinguals with schizophrenia. Methods. Ten bilingual Russian(L1) and Hebrew(L2) proficient patients, who developed clinical schizophrenia after achieving proficiency in both languages, were selected from 60 candidates referred for the study; they were resident in Israel 7–32 years with 3–10 years from immigration to diagnosis. Clinical, linguistic and fluency markers were coded in transcripts of clinical interviews. Results. There was a trend toward more verbal productivity in the first language (L1) than the second language (L2). Clinical speech markers associated with thought disorder and cognitive impairment (blocking and topic shift) were similar in both languages. Among linguistic markers of schizophrenia, Incomplete syntax and Speech role reference were significantly more frequent in L2 than L1; Lexical repetition and Unclear reference demonstrated a trend in the same direction. For fluency phenomena, Discourse markers were more prevalent in L1 than L2, and Codeswitching was similar across languages, showing that the patients were attuned to the socio-pragmatics of language use. Conclusions. More frequent linguistic markers of schizophrenia in L2 show more impairment in the syntactic/semantic components of language, reflecting greater thought and cognitive dysfunction. Patients are well able to acquire a second language. Nevertheless, schizophrenia finds expression in that language. Finally, more frequent fluency markers in L1 suggests motivation to maintain fluency, evidenced in particular by codeswitched L2 lexical items, a compensatory resource.}

The ‘head’ of a compound is the component that determines the grammatical category, the syntactic (e.g., the gender) and the semantic properties of the compound as a whole. For example, in the word ‘blackberry’ berry is the compound's head. The question was addressed of whether or not the privileged status of the head constituent influences processing and determines behavioural patterns in the breakdown of spatial attention in neglect. Italian right-headed (e.g. capobanda, band leader) and left-headed compounds (e.g. astronave, spaceship) were administered to 18 participants affected by neglect dyslexia. Left-headed compounds were read better than right-headed compounds. This result was not due to factors such as frequency, familiarity, age of acquisition or imageability, since these effects were controlled. It is suggested that attention is captured by the head component after implicit reading of the whole word. The head would require a relatively lighter processing load than the modifier and benefit from top-down facilitation.}

Activation also occurs across languages in bilingual adult readers, suggesting that the activation of phonological representations is not language specific. Less is known about developing readers. First, it is unclear whether there is automatic phonological activation during visual word recognition among children in general. Second, no empirical data exist on whether the activation of phonological representations is language specific or not in bilingual children. The current study investigated these issues in bilingual third and fifth graders using cross-language phonological masked priming in a lexical decision task. Targets were French words, and primes were English pseudowords of three types: (a) phonological primes, which share phonological information with the target beginning (e.g., dee-DIMANCHE [Sunday], pronounced /di:/-/dimãʃ/); (b) orthographic control primes, which control for letters shared by the phonological prime and target (e.g., d) and their position (e.g., doo-DIMANCHE, pronounced /du:/-/dimãʃ/); and (c) unrelated primes, which share no phonological or orthographic information with the target beginning (e.g., pow-DIMANCHE, pronounced /paʊ/-/dimãʃ/). Significant phonological priming was observed, suggesting that (a) phonological representations are rapidly and automatically activated by print during visual word recognition from Grade 3 onward and that (b) the activation of phonological representations is not language specific in bilingual children.}

However, it is still largely unknown how the functional brain network organizes to enable fast and effortless reading processing in the native language (L1) but not in a non-proficient second language (L2), and whether the mechanisms underlying local activity are associated with connectivity dynamics in large-scale brain networks. In the present study, we combined activation-based and multivariate graph-theory analysis with functional magnetic resonance imaging data to address these questions. Chinese–English unbalanced bilinguals read narratives for comprehension in Chinese (L1) and in English (L2). Compared with L2, reading in L1 evoked greater brain activation and recruited a more globally efficient but less clustered network organization. Regions with both increased network efficiency and enhanced brain activation in L1 reading were mostly located in the fronto-temporal reading-related network (RN), whereas regions with decreased global network efficiency, increased clustering, and more deactivation in L2 reading were identified in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, functional network efficiency was closely associated with local brain activation, and such associations were also modulated by reading efficiency in the two languages. Our results demonstrate that an economical and integrative brain network topology is associated with efficient reading, and further reveal a dynamic association between network efficiency and local activation for both RN and DMN. These findings underscore the importance of considering interregional connectivity when interpreting local BOLD signal changes in bilingual reading.}

We assessed cross-language interactions using cognates in three lexical decision (LD) tasks, and non-linguistic cognitive control with a flanker task. We also examined functional connectivity between brain regions crucial for language control and language processing. We observed the preservation of cognate effects in a generalized lexical decision task requiring little language control, which indicates intact functionality (and cross-lingual interactivity) of lexical representations. On the other hand, we found diminished linguistic as well as non-linguistic control abilities, suggesting a domain general control impairment. Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) analysis revealed altered connectivity between the patient's language control and processing network, consistent with the behavioral data. Altogether, these results are in line with the hypothesis that differential aphasia may originate from general cognitive control difficulties.}

Beyond academic success, findings highlight the social exclusion of children from play and affinity groups based on Mainstream American English linguistic competence and performance.

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of the study was to add to our knowledge of bilingual learning in children with Down syndrome (DS) using a syntactic bootstrapping task.
Method
Four groups of children and youth matched on non-verbal mental age participated. There were 14 bilingual participants with DS (DS-B, mean age 12;5), 12 monolingual participants with DS (DS-M, mean age 10;10), 9 bilingual typically developing children (TD-B; mean age 4;1) and 11 monolingual typically developing children (TD-M; mean age 4;1). The participants completed a computerized syntactic bootstrapping task involving unfamiliar nouns and verbs. The syntactic cues employed were a for the nouns and ing for the verbs.
Results
Performance was better on nouns than verbs. There was also a main effect for group. Follow-up t-tests revealed that there were no significant differences between the TD-M and TD-B or between the DS-M and DS-B groups. However, the DS-M group performed more poorly than the TD-M group with a large effect size. Analyses at the individual level revealed a similar pattern of results.
Conclusion
There was evidence that Down syndrome impacted performance; there was no evidence that bilingualism negatively affected the syntactic bootstrapping skills of individuals with DS. These results from a dynamic language task are consistent with those of previous studies that used static or product measures. Thus, the results are consistent with the position that parents should be supported in their decision to provide bilingual input to their children with DS. Learning outcomes: Readers of this article will identify (1) research evidence regarding bilingual development in children with Down syndrome and (2) syntactic bootstrapping skills in monolingual and bilingual children who are typically developing or who have Down syndrome.}

According to the Attentional Scaling Hypothesis, attempting to access lexical entries involves focusing attention on the initial letters of words to establish a cohort of potential matches with entries in the mental lexicon. We test this account by examining two predictions: (1) greater leftward bias for words should be evident in English readers in which the word beginning is on the left but not in Hebrew readers. (2) Dyslexics who have lexical impairments should show greater bias. Results reveal that word length modulated bisection bias differently for Hebrew and English readers, although the bias stays always leftward. Furthermore, dyslexics exhibited an exaggerated leftward bias than controls. We propose this effect arises from an interaction between reading and spatial attention rather than from the scaling of attention relative to the beginning of the word in the service of lexical access.}

These tests cover a range of functions including working memory, verbal fluency, prospective memory, and task switching. Interpretation of test results is based on comparison of the participant's score to standard scores that have been normed on a population database. However, a growing body of research has shown that the skills underlying these tests may be significantly different in monolingual and bilingual older adults, especially for those experiencing cognitive impairment, yet the standardized test scores do not account for such differences. Therefore, results of neuropsychological tests may be different for bilingual populations than for monolinguals, and those differences may be misinterpreted. The issue is important because the consequences of these interpretative errors may be over- or under-diagnosis of cognitive impairment. The present study examined the neuropsychological test scores of monolingual and bilingual older adults who were experiencing healthy aging or cognitive impairment to establish patterns in these scores that can more accurately guide the interpretation for bilingual older adults by considering group differences in the underlying abilities.}

This study aimed to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine the question of whether Mandarin-English bilingual speakers recruit the same cortical areas or develop distinct language-specific networks without overlaps for word processing.
Methods
Eight healthy Mandarin-English bilingual adults and eight healthy English monolingual adults were scanned while single-word paradigms were audio-visually presented.
Results
Our results showed significantly stronger beta-band power suppression in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) covering the supramarginal gyrus (BA 40) and angular gyrus (BA 39) for bilinguals when processing Mandarin versus English. Moreover, there were no significant differences between bilinguals and monolinguals in the left inferior frontal cortex (LIFC, BA 44/45) when both were processing their first language.
Conclusions
These results support the view that Mandarin-English bilinguals have a shared neural system for word processing in both the first and second language, which is highly similar to monolinguals’, but with stronger right hemisphere involvement.
Significance
To our knowledge, this is the first MEG study to investigate the spatio-temporal and frequency characteristics between bilinguals and monolinguals, which provides us a new angle to better understand the language system in bilinguals’ and monolingual’s brain.}

There was no effect of bilingual status on its own. The effect of language skills did not reach significance but was considerably higher in preschool settings in comparison with family and public situations. Results also indicated an association between parents’ orientation to the mainstream culture and children’s speaking behavior in preschool.

The 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with language deficits and weak intellectual functioning. In other clinical groups, linguistic and cognitive difficulties have been associated with impaired acquisition of narrative abilities. However, little is known about the narrative abilities of children with 22q11DS.
Aims
To describe the ability of children with 22q11DS to produce and comprehend narrative macrostructure. Additionally, to examine the role of intellectual functioning in explaining their narrative difficulties.
Methods and procedures
Narrative skills of 14 school-aged children with 22q11DS were compared to those of younger typically developing (TD) children matched on mental age and same-aged peers with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD).
Outcomes and results
Children with 22q11DS had significantly lower scores on narrative comprehension than younger TD children. No significant differences emerged on narrative production. Children with 22q11DS and children with DLD did not differ significantly on any of the narrative measures.
Conclusions and implications
Narrative comprehension in children with 22q11DS seems more affected than production. Narrative comprehension difficulties cannot be entirely explained by a low level of intellectual functioning. Narrative comprehension and production abilities in 22q11DS require further consideration.}

abstract = {Bilingualism has been found to delay onset of dementia and this has been attributed to an advantage in executive control in bilinguals. However, the relationship between bilingualism and cognition is complex, with costs as well as benefits to language functions. To further explore the cognitive consequences of bilingualism, the study used Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes, to examine whether bilingualism modifies the age at onset of behavioral and language variants of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) differently. Case records of 193 patients presenting with FTD (121 of them bilingual) were examined and the age at onset of the first symptoms were compared between monolinguals and bilinguals. A significant effect of bilingualism delaying the age at onset of dementia was found in behavioral variant FTD (5.7 years) but not in progressive nonfluent aphasia (0.7 years), semantic dementia (0.5 years), corticobasal syndrome (0.4 years), progressive supranuclear palsy (4.3 years) and FTD-motor neuron disease (3 years). On dividing all patients predominantly behavioral and predominantly aphasic groups, age at onset in the bilingual behavioral group (62.6) was over 6 years higher than in the monolingual patients (56.5, p=0.006), while there was no difference in the aphasic FTD group (60.9 vs. 60.6 years, p=0.851). The bilingual effect on age of bvFTD onset was shown independently of other potential confounding factors such as education, gender, occupation, and urban vs rural dwelling of subjects. To conclude, bilingualism delays the age at onset in the behavioral but not in the aphasic variants of FTD. The results are in line with similar findings based on research in stroke and with the current views of the interaction between bilingualism and cognition, pointing to advantages in executive functions and disadvantages in lexical tasks.}

The bilingual children were divided into Bi-low (at the early stage of English learning with low proficiency in English) and Bi-high (highly proficient in English) groups. Each participant was recorded producing one set of Mandarin words containing /a, i, u, y, ɤ/ and/or one set of English words containing /i, ɪ, e, ɛ, æ, u, ʊ, o, ɑ, ʌ/. Formant frequencies at five temporal locations were measured. Both static (midpoint formant values) and dynamic (formant movement pattern, trajectory length) acoustic properties were examined. Bi-low children showed a strong effect of L1 on L2. The L1 features were maintained and transferred to the new phonetic system. Bi-high children produced L2 vowels in a near-native manner. Meanwhile, they tended to transfer some L2 features to their L1 and moved the L1 vowels closer to L2 vowels, which suggested an assimilatory process. Both static and dynamic spectral features were affected by L1–L2 interactions.}

Language switching (LS) is an important phenomena usually observed in some bilingual communities. The ability to switch languages is a very fast, efficient and flexible process, being a fundamental aspect of bilingual efficient language communication. The aim of the present study was to characterize the specific role of non-language specific prefrontal regions in the neural network involved in LS in bilingual patients, during awake brain surgery and using electrical stimulation mapping (ESM).
Methods
In order to identify the neural regions involved in LS we used, a new specific ESM protocol in two patients undergoing awake brain surgery. Besides, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuropsychological testing and the assessment of daily conversational LS patterns post-surgery were used as complementary imaging and behavioral assessments.
Results
The outcome of the multimodal ESM-fMRI neuroimaging comparison in both patients pointed out to the crucial involvement of the inferior and middle frontal cortices in LS.
Conclusions
The present results add to previous findings highlighting the important role of non-language specific frontal structures in regulating LS. The new protocol developed here might allow neurosurgeons to plan ahead for surgical intervention in multilingual patients to ensure the preservation of regions involved in LS and therefore the prevention of pathological language mixing after intervention.}

Using functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) analysis, this study aimed at exploring the neural basis of diglossia during picture naming in two contexts. In the first, healthy young participants were instructed to name each image either in SA or LA on the basis of cue word appearing after the stimulus. In the second, they were instructed to name images either in SA or in Hebrew. Behavioral analysis showed that naming in SA was slightly easier than LA and considerably easier than Hebrew. fMRI analysis showed no difference between SA and LA. Hebrew compared to SA revealed activation differences explainable in terms of engagement of language control modules and second- to first-language effects. These findings, discussed in the light of previous findings in bilingual literature, support the view that dominance in diglossia is modality-dependent.}

These results are discussed with regard to reductionism and the importance of sensorimotor processing during early development.

In total, 278 third graders performed literacy tasks (word/pseudoword decoding and spelling), a rhythm production task, two phonological tasks (phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming), and motor tasks. Significant correlations were observed between literacy and each of rhythm skills, phonological skills, and motor skills. However, structural equation models showed that the influence of rhythm skills on literacy was mediated neither by phonological skills nor by motor abilities.

The results showed that when compared with typically developing controls, children with ASD manifested reduced MMN (mismatch negativity) amplitude at the left temporal-parietal and parietal sites, indicating that they were less sensitive to lexical stress. However, a more negative MMN response was found for ASD group than for typically developing group at the right central-parietal, temporal-parietal, and temporal sites. In addition, the right hemisphere was more activated than the left hemisphere for ASD group, which might be derived from the reversed asymmetry of brain activation for individuals with ASD when processing language-related stimuli.}

This study examined word identification among Spanish-English bilingual and English monolingual individuals, i.e., speech perception using a gated word task examining phonetic category formation.
Methods
Participants included 25 English-speaking monolingual and 10 fluent Spanish-English speaking bilingual adults. The experiment included a gating task incorporating Spanish sentences, English sentences, code-mixed Spanish-English sentences, and code-mixed English-Spanish sentences. The gated words at the end of the sentences consisted of voiceless initial consonants, voiced initial consonants, CV-tense words, or CV-lax words.
Results
There was a significant main effect for consonant voicing features and for language group. In addition, there was a significant interaction between consonant voicing features and language group. A significant main effect for vowel tenseness was also found along with a significant interaction between vowel tenseness and language group.
Discussion
Results suggest that bilinguals are capable of ultimate attainment, with phonotactic capabilities similar to that of monolingual speakers when identifying English words. Bilingual speakers may also be more sensitive to voicing features for both Spanish and English words.
Resumen
Introducción
Este estudio examinó la identificación de las palabras entre los individuos bilingües español-inglés y monolingües de habla inglesa, es decir, la percepción del lenguaje utilizando un sistema de palabras cerradas que examina la formación de la categoría fonética.
Métodos
Los participantes incluyeron 25 adultos monolingües de habla inglesa y 10 adultos bilingües español-inglés. El experimento incluyó un sistema cerrado que incorporaba frases en español, frases en inglés, frases español-inglés de código mixto y frases inglés-español de código mixto. Las palabras cerradas al final de las frases consistían en consonantes iniciales sordas, consonantes iniciales sonoras, palabras tensas con CV o palabras laxas con CV.
Resultados
Se produjo un efecto principal significativo para las características de entonación de las consonantes y para el grupo de lenguaje. Además, se produjo una interacción entre las características de entonación de las consonantes y el grupo de lenguaje. También se encontró un efecto principal significativo de la tensión de las vocales, y una interacción significativa entre la tensión de las vocales y el grupo de lenguaje.
Discusión
Los resultados sugieren que las personas bilingües son capaces de alcanzar un logro máximo, con capacidades fonotácticas similares a las de los hablantes monolingües, al identificar las palabras en inglés. Los hablantes bilingües pueden ser más sensibles también a las características de entonación de las palabras españolas e inglesas.}

Here we tested whether learning to read in two languages differing in their orthographic transparency yields different strategies used for encoding letter-strings as compared to learning to read in one (opaque) language only. Sixteen English monolingual and 16 early Welsh–English bilingual readers undergoing event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recordings were asked to report whether or not a target letter displayed at fixation was present in either a nonword (consonant string) or an English word presented immediately before. Bilinguals and monolinguals showed similar behavioural performance on target detection presented in words and nonwords, suggesting similar orthographic encoding in the two groups. By contrast, the amplitude of ERPs locked to the target letters (P3b, 340–570ms post target onset, and a late frontal positive component 600–1000ms post target onset) were differently modulated by the position of the target letter in words and nonwords between bilinguals and monolinguals. P3b results show that bilinguals who learnt to read simultaneously in an opaque and a transparent orthographies encoded orthographic information presented to the right of fixation more poorly than monolinguals. On the opposite, only monolinguals exhibited a position effect on the late positive component for both words and nonwords, interpreted as a sign of better re-evaluation of their responses. The present study shed light on how orthographic transparency constrains grain size and visual strategies underlying letter-string encoding, and how those constraints are influenced by bilingualism.}

Subjects perform these tasks differently depending on their dominant linguistic frame of reference: relative e.g. left/right terms, or absolute e.g. N/S/W/E terms. One prediction is that changes in the linguistic system should result in corresponding cognitive changes. Such a linguistic shift has occurred among Gurindji people (Australia). Traditionally Gurindji people used a system of cardinal directions, however many have now also been exposed to the English left/right system. This paper demonstrates that this language difference is reflected cognitively. The ‘Animals-in-a-row’ task was administered to 107 Gurindji people. The results show strong ‘viewpoint independent’ responses, nonetheless those with a Tertiary education gave significantly more ‘viewpoint dependent’ responses which we attribute to exposure to English, and perhaps associated literacy practices.}

Thirty 15-min sessions using dialogic book-reading strategies were provided in each language in the children's homes, in English by the primary investigator and in Spanish by the children's mothers, who were trained in the techniques of dialogic book-reading. Results showed that the children in the intervention group learned significantly more target words in each language following the intervention than the children in the control group. The children in the intervention group were also able to produce the acquired words at the time of a follow-up test 6 weeks after the end of the intervention. The gains in the overall vocabulary of the two groups of children did not differ significantly. The children's mothers expressed satisfaction with the program, and confirmed the benefits of dialogic book-reading for their children's learning of target words. Learning outcomes: The current paper describes a unique bilingual vocabulary intervention program for preschool children.

Therefore, a larger international multicenter proof-of-concept trial was launched, to directly compare the safety and efficacy of rTMS, tDCS, and sham stimulation as adjuvant therapy to speech and language therapy in subacute poststroke aphasia. In the 4 participating centers, subacute stroke patients with aphasia are randomized between 5 and 30 days after ischemic stroke to either receive rTMS, tDCS, or sham stimulation in combination with a daily 45 minutes speech and language therapy session for 10 days. Efficacy is evaluated at 1 and 30 days after the last of the 10 treatment sessions using 3 outcome measures, validated in all participating languages: Boston naming test, Token test, and verbal fluency test. Additionally, adverse events are recorded to prove safety. In this study, a total of 90 patients will be recruited, and data analysis will be completed in 2016.

The Simple View of Reading (SVR) predicts subtypes of reading disorder based on weaknesses in word recognition, listening comprehension, or both. This practice-based research study explores predictions of the SVR within a clinical practice setting.
Method
The study is a retrospective analysis of 112 assessment records from school-aged children (aged 6.0–16.7) referred for speech-language evaluation. Available scores within four areas (listening comprehension, word recognition, reading comprehension, and oral expression) were extracted and then converted to composites. Composite scores were used to categorize children into SVR subtypes. We examined the distribution of children across subtypes and the relationships among the four constructs.
Results
Children were distributed across all SVR subtypes, but few had impairments only in word recognition. Children with impairments in listening comprehension or word recognition showed poorer reading comprehension than those that did not, but there was imperfect prediction of reading comprehension impairment at an individual level. There were more significant correlations among constructs for younger children. Oral expression and listening comprehension were closely related across analyses.
Conclusions
The SVR is a clinically useful model for capturing variation and explaining relationships among oral and written language in school-age children.}

The samples were chosen by an accidental multistage cluster sampling. All the students of the sample were Arab bilinguals living in the south of Iran, Khuzestan Province. The data were gathered through teacher and student questionnaires. 5 Persian- speaking monolingual students were chosen by the same sampling method as the control group and they were interviewed by the same questionnaires. Descriptive statistical method, including percentage, frequency, and average, were used to analyze the quantitative data; then the quantitative and the qualitative data obtained were analyzed. The findings show that the most frequent morphological problems of these learners are in verbal inflections (mode, tense, number …) and subject-verb agreement. They have non-linguistic problems who reinforces language problems too.}

abstract = {Objective
The main objective of the present study was to examine THE EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE SKILLS and obtain a prevalence estimate of expressive language IMPAIRMENT (not skills) in Chinese Singaporean preschoolers with nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate (CLP).
Methods
A group of 43 Chinese Singaporean preschoolers aged 3 to 6 years with a diagnosis of nonsyndromic CLP was assessed using the Singapore English Action Picture Test (SEAPT). The SEAPT is an English Language screening tool standardised on typically developing English–Mandarin Chinese Singaporean preschoolers that assesses expressive vocabulary and grammatical usage. A grammar and/or information score below the 20th percentile on the SEAPT is indicative of an expressive language impairment. In addition, the medical records of this cohort were examined retrospectively for documentation of surgical timings, audiological history, articulation and resonance.
Results
Based on the results of the SEAPT, 33% of the preschoolers with CLP were identified as having a—possible expressive language impairment. Hence, the likelihood that a child with CLP with normal cognitive functioning will have an expressive language impairment is between 3.9 to 12.7 times more likely than in the general population. There was no statistical significance when comparisons were made between dominant language groups or CLP groups on SEAPT measures of information and grammar content. Significantly more males than females were identified with language difficulties, relative to the sex ratio in the sample. No significance was found for the other participant variables.
Conclusions
The findings of this study suggest that Chinese Singaporean preschoolers with CLP have more difficulty in the expressive use of grammar and vocabulary than their peers of typical development, with significantly more males affected than females. As language performance was not related to hearing, articulation or resonance; these early results suggest that a comprehensive investigation of cognition, literacy and family aggregation of communication disorders is urgently warranted to study other possible aetiologies for language impairment in children with CLP in Singapore.}

abstract = {Background
Children with early language delays are at increased risk of persistent language impairment. Early identification and intervention are desirable. Parent-report inventories are useful screening tools, but the screening context places limits at their length. Validity of parent-report screening tools in languages other than English has been rarely reported in detail.
Aims
The aim was to establish the concurrent validity of an existing 40-item parent-report vocabulary screening tool in Czech, using a picture-based examiner-administered comprehension and production task as a concurrent measure of vocabulary.
Methods & Procedures
Parents of 200 children aged 1;3 to 3;6 were given the screening inventory, in which they were asked if their child says or comprehends each of 40 words. At the same time, children were administered a picture-based comprehension and production task. Concurrent validity of the inventory was examined using correlations, partial correlations, and regression analyses controlling for age.
Outcomes & Results
The partial Spearman correlation (controlling for age) between production scores from parent-report and production scores from the examiner-administered task was 0.53; for comprehension, the correlation between parent report and test scores was 0.36. These values are similar to those reported for short and full versions of MacArthur-Bates CDI for 2-year-olds.
Conclusion & Implications
A 40-item tool shows clear concurrent relations with an examiner-administered picture comprehension and production task. The study demonstrates that short parent-report tools may be useful in early identification of language impairments, and they may be a good option particularly in languages that have limited repertoire of assessment instruments.}

Although metaphors have been shown to affect time conceptualisation, there is little evidence to date that the presence or absence of tense within a given language can affect how one processes temporal sequences of events. Here, we set out to characterise how native speakers of Mandarin Chinese – a tenseless language- deal with reference time misalignment using event-related brain potentials. Fluent Chinese-English participants and native speakers of English made acceptability judgements on sentences in which the adjunct clause started with the connective ‘after’ and was either temporally aligned or not with the main clause in terms of reference time conveyed by the verb. Native speakers of English failed to overtly report such reference time misalignments between clauses, but significant N400 modulations showed that they nevertheless required additional semantic processing effort. Chinese speakers, however, showed no such N400 modulation suggesting that they did not covertly detect reference time misalignments between clauses in real time. Critically, all participants manifested normal sentence comprehension as shown by a standard N400 semantic violation elicited by incongruent endings. We conclude that Chinese speakers of English experience difficulties locating events on a timeline in relation to one another when temporal information is conveyed by tense.}

Two groups of adult learners with high and low English proficiency finished a forward-masked lexical decision task. The results showed a complicated scenario on transposed-letter effects, implying that the late unbalanced Chinese-English bilinguals with low English proficiency still needed to adopt a letter-to-letter reading strategy, and that the L2 users with high English proficiency also had not properly developed the fine-grained orthographic route even they had a long experience of English learning in the foreign language learning settings in China. Overall, it is suggested that late unbalanced Chinese-English bilinguals generally follow a path similar to that of native readers in acquiring English visual word recognition skills developed from the letter-to-letter reading strategy to the parallel orthographic processing strategies. However, since L2 users usually have no or limited spoken vocabulary of English before accessing printed words and inadequate supervision in developing L2 word reading skills, their development would be much slower than that of English native speakers.}

The results indicated that the L2 activation is similar to the L1 activation for both KE and CE language groups. In addition, conjunction analyses revealed that the right inferior frontal gyrus and medial frontal gyrus were more activated in KK and KE than CC and CE, suggesting that these regions are more involved in Korean speakers than Chinese speakers for both L1 and L2. Finally, an ROI analysis at the left middle frontal gyrus revealed greater activation for CE than for KE and a positive correlation with accuracy in CE, but a negative correlation in KE. Taken together, we found evidence that important brain regions for L1 are carried over to L2 reading, maybe more so in highly proficient bilinguals.}

Children were administered an auditory Grammaticality Judgment task in English to measure morphosyntactic processing and a visual N-Back task and Corsi Blocks task to measure nonverbal working memory capacity. Analyses revealed that monolinguals were more sensitive to English morphosyntactic information than bilinguals, but the groups did not differ in reaction times or response bias. Furthermore, higher nonverbal working memory capacity was associated with greater sensitivity to morphosyntactic violations in bilinguals but not in monolinguals. The findings suggest that nonverbal working memory skills link more tightly to syntactic processing in populations with lower levels of language knowledge.}

Thus cognitive control is crucial for word production. Given that word retrieval difficulty is a hallmark feature of aphasia, the relationship between word retrieval and cognitive control in aphasia has not been sufficiently explored. This study examined whether persons with aphasia show 1) evidence of a cognitive control deficit, 2) bilingual status interacts with cognitive control deficit in persons with aphasia, and (3) a relationship between measures of word naming and cognitive control. Thirty-eight persons with aphasia were administered a task of cognitive control (Stroop color-word task) and two word production tasks (picture naming and category fluency). We found weakened cognitive control in aphasia relative to age-matched neurologically healthy adults. A bilingual advantage in cognitive control was found in neurologically healthy adults and in one group of bilingual speakers with aphasia, but not the other group. Word retrieval in persons with aphasia was not correlated with Stroop task performance. These findings show that cognitive control performance (as measured by the Stroop task) is compromised in persons with aphasia, irrespective of bilingual status. There was a bilingual advantage in two out of three groups, showing a general support for the bilingual inhibitory control advantage (BICA) hypothesis.}

Results revealed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on the short-term memory tasks but not the working memory and novel word-learning tasks.

Together, these findings indicate that processing-based tasks that engage verbal working memory rather than short-term memory may be better-suited for diagnostic purposes with bilingual children. However, even verbal working memory measures are sensitive to bilingual children’s language-specific knowledge and demographic characteristics, and therefore may have limited clinical utility.}

Younger children (5;1–6;3 years) did not appear to sub-vocally recode the verbal labels of visual stimuli during encoding, whereas older children (6;4–7;3 years) who were already attending elementary school looked longer at objects with multisyllabic labels.

Here we exploit the well-known fact that bilinguals routinely and automatically activate both their languages during comprehension to test whether this automatic process is, in turn, modulated by embodied simulatory processes. Dutch participants heard English sentences containing interlingual homophones and implying specific distance relations, and had to subsequently respond to pictures of objects matching or mismatching this implied distance. Participants were significantly slower to reject critical items when their perceptual features matched said distance relationship. These results suggest that bilinguals not only activate task-irrelevant meanings of interlingual homophones, but also automatically simulate these meanings in a detailed perceptual fashion. Our study supports the claim that embodied simulation is not due to participants' conscious strategies, but is an automatic component of meaning construction.}

By highlighting the relevance of hidden barriers, our study encourages a more comprehensive conceptualization of language barriers and uncovers the micro-foundations of knowledge processing in multilingual teams. Contrasting evident and hidden barriers, our study juxtaposes the instrumental and the cultural perspective on language. By distinguishing basic and sophisticated knowledge processing activities, we weigh the information processing against the socio-cognitive perspective on knowledge. We integrate these divergent perspectives on language and knowledge processing both within and across the respective research fields.}

In Experiment 1, we assessed the ability of both monolinguals and bilinguals on a basic CSSL task that contained only one-to-one mappings. In Experiment 2, learners were asked to form both one-to-one and two-to-one mappings, and were tested at three points during familiarization. Overall, monolinguals and bilinguals did not differ in their learning of one-to-one mappings. However, bilinguals more quickly acquired two-to-one mappings, while also exhibiting greater proficiency than monolinguals. We conclude that the fundamental SL mechanism may not be affected by language experience, in accord with previous studies. However, when the input contains greater variability, bilinguals may be more prone to detecting the presence of multiple structures.}

However, the majority of these studies tested bilinguals who did not necessarily code-switch on a regular basis. In order to investigate the impact of switching habits on language processing, two groups of French-English bilinguals (habitual code-switchers and non-habitual code-switchers) read sentences containing unilingual and switched determiner phrases while their EEG was recorded. The findings indicate important processing differences between the groups. Notably, switched trials (particularly those with a French determiner) generated an increased negativity from 300 to 500 ms for non-habitual code-switchers, but not for habitual code-switchers. The veritable impact of switching habits were also supported by a correlation analysis. This finding suggests that code-switching is not inherently effortful to process, but rather, that comprehension costs are related to idiosyncratic factors, such as the extent of prior exposure to code-switched input. An LPC was also observed from 500 to 900 for habitual code-switchers; for non-habitual switchers, this effect may have been attenuated by the long-lasting N400 effect. We advance several possible interpretations for the late positivity. Altogether, the results from the current study support the claim that the code-switching cost observed in previous literature may be linked to the bilingual samples tested in those studies: habitual code-switchers may not find switches effortful to process, but not all bilinguals code-switch. We highlight the importance of experience and individual differences in the study of bilingual cognition.}

Because of various close semiological resemblances with apraxia of speech, FAS has been hypothesized to be an apraxia subtype. In 2009 two cases of developmental FAS (dFAS) were described in whom the disorder was detected in an early stage of their speech-language development in the absence of brain damage or mental illness. In the present study, two listening panels consisting of 30 native speakers of two regiolects, Dutch and Flemish, evaluate the spontaneous speech of two native Flemish-speaking boys with suspected dFAS, three native Flemish-speaking children diagnosed with developmental apraxia of speech (dAoS), two bilingual children (L1 = Flemish, L2 = French or English), and six native Flemish-speaking children with typical speech-language development. Whereas the Dutch panellists were not able to distinguish the different groups, the Flemish listeners accurately identified the children with dFAS and the bilingual children. None of the listeners were able to discern between dFAS and dAoS. The latter finding supports the assumption that the two speech disorders not only share similar semiological and perceptual characteristics but also a common pathophysiological substrate. Although it is not always identified by listeners of the same language community but is by speakers of the same regiolect, in addition to FAS resulting from brain damage or a psychological disorder, dFAS appears a distinct form of apraxia of speech resulting from developmental deficits.}

A substantial number of behavioral studies have characterized when infants show changes in behavior towards speech sounds in relation to amount of experience with these sounds. However, these studies cannot explain to what extent the developmental timeline is influenced by experience with the language versus constraints imposed by cortical maturation. Studies using electrophysiological measures to examine the development of auditory and speech processing have shown great differences in infant and adult electrophysiological correlates of processing. Many of these differences are a function of immature cortex in the infant. In this paper, we examined the maturation of infant and child event-related-potential (ERP) electrophysiological components in processing an English vowel contrast and explored to what extent these components are influenced by intrinsic (e.g., sex) versus extrinsic factors, such as language experience (monolingual versus bilingual). Our findings demonstrate differences in the pattern of ERP responses related to age and sex, as well as language experience. These differences make it clear that general maturational factors need to be taken into consideration in examining the effect of language experience on the neurodevelopment of speech perception.}

There is hardly any previous research on bilinguals, especially of structurally different languages; and none on characterization of agrammatism in Swahili. The current study identifies the features of Swahili agrammatic narrative and spontaneous speech, and compares the use of verb inflections for tense and time reference in English and Swahili in six bilingual agrammatic speakers and 12 non-brain-damaged speakers matched on age, native language and education level to the agrammatic speakers. The results show a remarkable similarity between the agrammatic phenomena in both languages on the typical agrammatic features: utterance length and speech rate are reduced and the proportion of grammatical sentences and complex sentences is lower than normal. Analysis of verb inflection demonstrates that there are no qualitative differences between the Swahili and English samples: in both languages reference to the past is more impaired than reference to the present. However, the use of verb inflection in general is better preserved in Swahili than English. English verb inflections are frequently omitted, whereas Swahili verb inflections are substituted. The implications of these findings for theories on agrammatism are discussed.}

abstract = {Background
Very-low-birth-weight preterm infants have a higher rate of language impairments compared with children born full term. Early identification of preterm infants at risk for language delay is essential to guide early intervention at the time of optimal neuroplasticity. This study examined near-term structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and white matter microstructure assessed on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in relation to early language development in children born very preterm.
Methods
A total of 102 very-low-birth-weight neonates (birthweight≤1500g, gestational age ≤32-weeks) were recruited to participate from 2010 to 2011. Near-term structural MRI was evaluated for white matter and cerebellar abnormalities. DTI fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were assessed. Language development was assessed with Bayley Scales of Infant-Toddler Development-III at 18 to 22 months adjusted age. Multivariate models with leave-one-out cross-validation and exhaustive feature selection identified three brain regions most predictive of language function. Distinct logistic regression models predicted high-risk infants, defined by language scores >1 S.D. below average.
Results
Of 102 children, 92 returned for neurodevelopmental testing. Composite language score mean ± S.D. was 89.0 ± 16.0; 31 of 92 children scored <85, including 15 of 92 scoring <70, suggesting moderate-to-severe delay. Children with cerebellar asymmetry had lower receptive language subscores (P = 0.016). Infants at high risk for language impairments were predicted based on regional white matter microstructure on DTI with high accuracy (sensitivity, specificity) for composite (89%, 86%), expressive (100%, 90%), and receptive language (100%, 90%).
Conclusions
Multivariate models of near-term structural MRI and white matter microstructure on DTI may assist in identification of preterm infants at risk for language impairment, guiding early intervention.}

Algunos niños y niñas que crecen en entornos con oportunidades de comunicación en varias lenguas pueden necesitar en algún momento de su desarrollo apoyo de profesionales de la logopedia/fonoaudiología. El Comité de Expertos en Multilingüismo y Multiculturalidad de la Asociación Española de Logopedia, Foniatría y Fonoaudiología, e Iberoamericana de Fonoaudiología ha consensuado una propuesta de recomendaciones basadas en la evidencia para las prácticas en logopedia con el fin de facilitar que los/as niños/as puedan ejercer el derecho a su identidad cultural y a emplear su propio idioma. Se parte de una concepción dinámica del bi/multilingüismo centrado en la persona y su entorno, considerando un enfoque transcultural, transdisciplinar y funcional, dirigido a fomentar las oportunidades de aprendizaje. Considerando los resultados de investigaciones actuales sobre el desarrollo lingüístico-comunicativo de los/las niños/as bi/multilingües con y sin trastornos del lenguaje, habla y comunicación, se plantean herramientas para el desarrollo de la evaluación y la intervención logopédica/fonoaudiológica desde una perspectiva lingüístico-funcional. Así, se incluyen propuestas para realizar la entrevista e instrumentos para la evaluación directa y/o indirecta. Todo ello mediante la valoración del entorno bilingüe y la evaluación translingüística y funcional, en estrecha colaboración con las familias, las escuelas y otros profesionales de apoyo, como intérpretes. Finalmente se plantea la necesidad de formación continua en competencias profesionales, como las de gestión emocional para el trabajo con personas en entornos de origen lingüístico y cultural diverso.
Some children who grow up in environments in which there is the opportunity to learn more than one language may, at some point in their development, need the support of speech and language professionals. The present paper by the Expert Committee on Multilingualism and Multiculturalism of the Spanish and Ibero-American Association of Speech and Language Therapy (AELFA-IF) provides evidence-based recommendations for speech and language therapy practices that facilitate children's ability to exercise their right to their cultural identity and the use of their language(s) (United Nations, 1989). These recommendations are based on a dynamic conceptualization of bilingualism/multilingualism that is centred on the person and his or her environment, and use a cross-cultural, transdisciplinary and functional approach to providing learning opportunities for speech and language professionals. Based on the results of research on the linguistic-communicative development of bilingual/multilingual children with and without speech/language and communication disorders, tools for developing speech/language assessment methods and intervention from a functional-linguistic perspective are proposed. These include suggestions for conducting interviews and using direct and indirect evaluation instruments to assess the bilingual environment, as well as the use of cross-linguistic and functional evaluation methods, in close collaboration with families, schools and other support professionals, such as interpreters. Finally, the paper outlines the need for continuous training in professional competencies, such as interpersonal skills, needed for working with people from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds.}

However, these studies have mostly been limited to the study of vowels and consonants in monolingual learners. There is relatively little research on other types of phonetic segments, such as lexical tone, even though tone languages are very well represented across languages of the world. The goal of the present study is to investigate how Mandarin Chinese–English bilingual learners contend with non-phonemic pitch variation in English spoken word recognition. This is contrasted with their treatment of phonemic changes in lexical tone in Mandarin spoken word recognition. The experimental design was cross-sectional and three age-groups were sampled (7.5months, 9months and 11months). Results demonstrated limited generalization abilities at 7.5months, where infants only recognized words in English when matched in pitch and words in Mandarin that were matched in tone. At 9months, infants recognized words in Mandarin Chinese that matched in tone, but also falsely recognized words that contrasted in tone. At this age, infants also recognized English words whether they were matched or mismatched in pitch. By 11months, infants correctly recognized pitch-matched and – mismatched words in English but only recognized tonal matches in Mandarin Chinese.}

However, current scholarship lacks crucial insights into how children with DLD respond to L2 learning with minimal (classroom) exposure. In this paper, we report the results of a longitudinal study tracing the development of L1 Russian and English as a Foreign Language (EFL) skills in a group of learners with DLD (age of EFL onset: 7;9–12;1). The performance of the DLD group was compared to that of typically-developing controls, matched for classroom EFL exposure. Proficiency in English and Russian was measured three times (after one, one-and-a-half and two years of EFL instruction). At Time 1, there were no significant differences between groups on the EFL measures, but the performance of the typically-developing children significantly improved with time, and that of the DLD group did not. In the DLD group, age of EFL onset was positively related to English receptive vocabulary size. The relation between L1 and L2 proficiency in the DLD group was weaker than in the comparison group. This pattern is probably due to the floor performance of the DLD group in the grammatical domain, but may also indicate that the disorder affects cross-language transfer in the vulnerable domains.}

Semantic paralexias were observed in 9/340 subjects (2.4%). Our data and a review of the literature show that most deep dyslexics suffer from superficial and deep vascular damage in the territory of the left middle cerebral artery, and that they are relatively young, well-educated individuals, in the chronic stage of their disease. In these subjects, perisylvian damage might be mainly responsible for damage to sublexical grapheme–phoneme Conversion (GPC) procedures, and extrasylvian damage for lexical–semantic impairment. Semantic paralexias might originate in the right hemisphere, or in left perilesional regions. The functional impairment underlying deep dyslexia was analyzed with specific reference to the summation hypothesis, i.e., to the hypothesis that in reading, GPC procedures interact with lexical–semantic information, thus blocking semantically incorrect responses. On this account, semantic paralexias should only occur when, in the presence of lexical–semantic damage, GPC rules are disrupted to the point that the interaction can no longer take place. In agreement with the hypothesis, only cases with co-occurring lexical–semantic and GPC damage produced semantic paralexias; and, these were the subjects with the most severe GPC damage. The inability to apply approximately 45% GPC mappings is the critical level of sublexical damage that no longer allows GPC procedures to interact with lexical–semantic information.}

Six unskilled Chinese–English late bilingual patients with glioma in eloquent cortical regions underwent awake brain surgery. Preoperative blood-oxygen-level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) was performed to position bilingual regions. Direct cortical electrical stimulation (DCES) was conducted for intraoperative positioning of bilingual cortical regions. The identified language-positive regions were protected during tumor resection to preserve language function after surgery, and BOLD-fMRI and DCES results were compared. Results showed that 71 points were stimulated in 6 CEB patients. Three specific language regions (4.2%), including 2 specific English language regions (2.8%) and 1 specific Chinese language region (1.4%), were located in the frontal and temporal lobes. Comparisons between BOLD-fMRI and DCES showed a sensitivity, specificity and consistency of 75.0%, 30.9% and 40.9%, respectively. Non-fluent Chinese–English late bilinguals have specific bilingual cortical regions, and the test for both languages during surgery is necessary.

In Experiment 1 we investigated the lexicality and word frequency effects in reading aloud. Similarly to NI, both groups of bilinguals showed these effects. In Experiment 2 we investigated stress assignment – which is not predictable by rule – to Italian words. The SV group made more stress errors in reading words with a non-dominant stress pattern compared to the LV group. The results suggest that the size of the reader's L2 lexicon affects the probability of correct reading aloud. Overall, the results indicate that proficient adult bilinguals show a similar sensibility to the statistical and distributional properties of the language as compared to Italian monolinguals.}

In the context of neurological disorders, language assessment is traditionally based on the use of the standard language of the community in which the assessment is performed. Dialectal variables constitute a “forgotten” topic. This review aims to provide resources and working guidelines to overcome this limitation.
Development
The study was conducted as follows: 1) review of basic concepts of dialectology (language, dialect, isogloss line, idiolect, register, “standard variant,” bilingualism); 2) characterisation of Spanish and Catalan dialectologies and search for online resources for the development of neurological assessment tools; 3) ad hoc search on the PubMed database (keywords: “dialect,” “aphasia,” and “multilingual”).
Conclusions
We provide online resources to promote adequate development of assessment tools in Spanish and Catalan, accounting for dialectal considerations. We propose a set of working guidelines for the introduction of dialectal variables in language tests to ensure their ultimate objective: to evaluate the real use of the language, and not cultural knowledge of the standard language.

abstract = {Naturally acquiring a language shapes the human brain through a long-lasting learning and practice process. This is supported by previous studies showing that managing more than one language from early childhood has an impact on brain structure and function. However, to what extent bilingual individuals present neuroanatomical peculiarities at the subcortical level with respect to monolinguals is yet not well understood, despite the key role of subcortical gray matter for a number of language functions, including monitoring of speech production and language control — two processes especially solicited by bilinguals. Here we addressed this issue by performing a subcortical surface-based analysis in a sample of monolinguals and simultaneous bilinguals (N=88) that only differed in their language experience from birth. This analysis allowed us to study with great anatomical precision the potential differences in morphology of key subcortical structures, namely, the caudate, accumbens, putamen, globus pallidus and thalamus. Vertexwise analyses revealed significantly expanded subcortical structures for bilinguals compared to monolinguals, localized in bilateral putamen and thalamus, as well as in the left globus pallidus and right caudate nucleus. A topographical interpretation of our results suggests that a more complex phonological system in bilinguals may lead to a greater development of a subcortical brain network involved in monitoring articulatory processes.}

A final and more exploratory goal was to gain insight into caregivers’ perceptions of the intervention. 21 caregiver-child dyads participated in the intent-to-treat randomized control trial. Their children were 30-43 months old with language delays. Dyads were randomly assigned to receive 24 caregiver training sessions delivered at home in Spanish or a wait list control group. Pre, post and 3-month follow assessments included observational measures of caregiver-child interactions and child standardized vocabulary assessments. Caregivers completed surveys rating their perception of the intervention. Caregivers in the intervention group had significantly higher percentages of matched turns, expansions, and targets at post-assessment and of expansions and targets at follow-up compared to the control group. Overall, children in the intervention condition had significantly higher receptive vocabulary scores and performed better than children in the control condition on observational measure of their lexical diversity, with moderate effect sizes for most outcomes. Caregivers perceived the intervention as effective and culturally appropriate. Teach-Model-Coach-Review is effective in increasing Spanish-speaking caregivers’ use of EMT en Español strategies with their young children with language delays. The intervention also appears to be effective for child vocabulary outcomes and acceptable to caregivers.}

abstract = {Direct cortical electrostimulation was used to study cortical areas hypothetically involved in translation in bilinguals during brain tumour resections, with a view to sparing these functional areas. A series of seven proficient bilingual patients was studied: two left-handed and five right-handed individuals with no pre-existing language deficit. Hemispheric cortex (on the side contralateral to the patient’s hand-dominance) was directly stimulated whilst the patient performed naming and reading tasks in both languages and a translation task (of a written text from their second ‘learned’ language to their first or ‘native’ language). Of the 147 different cortical sites studied, 26 ‘language functional sites’ were detected, where electrostimulation affected reading and/or naming in the patient’s native and/or second learned language. Of these, 8 sites (in 4 patients) were “task-specific” and “language-specific” i.e., affecting only naming or reading in only one of the patient’s languages. Of the 26 “language sites”, only 3 produced any interferences in translation. All of these were located in frontal regions. Electrostimulation at these sites caused the patient to stop translating abruptly, but no language switching or other translation-related phenomenon was observed. No site was found that was involved only in translation and not other language tasks. Overall, in contrast to other language tasks, cortical structures of the convexity were rarely involved in translation. We suggest that translation interference could be more readily detected by subcortical stimulations. This spatial dissociation within the brain of translation function versus other language functions could explain the cases of dissociated language impairments observed in some bilingual patients with brain lesions. On a practical level, because the cortical sites found by translation tasks are few and related with other cortical language sites, we think that translation tasks provide little additional helpful information for cortical brain mapping in bilingual neurosurgical patients.}

The present study investigates the impact of orthographic depth on reading route by analyzing evoked potentials to words in a deep (French) and shallow (German) language presented to highly proficient bilinguals. ERP analyses to German and French words revealed significant topographic modulations 240–280ms post-stimulus onset, indicative of distinct brain networks engaged in reading over this time window. Source estimations revealed that these effects stemmed from modulations of left insular, inferior frontal and dorsolateral regions (German>French) previously associated to phonological processing. Our results show that reading in a shallow language was associated to a stronger engagement of phonological pathways than reading in a deep language. Thus, the lexical pathways favored in word reading are reinforced by phonological networks more strongly in the shallow than deep orthography.}

Here, we show that Chinese-English bilinguals actively inhibit the language not-to-be used before the onset of a picture to be named. Depending on the nature of a directive cue, participants named a subsequent picture in their native language, in their second language, or remained silent. The cue elicited a contingent negative variation of event-related brain potentials, greater in amplitude when the cue announced a naming trial as compared to when it announced a silent trial. In addition, the negativity was greater in amplitude when the picture was to be named in English than in Chinese, suggesting that preparation for speech in the second language requires more inhibition than preparation for speech in the native language. This result is the first direct neurophysiological evidence consistent with proactive inhibitory control in bilingual production.}

We addressed whether this causes the profiles of neurosurgery- and stroke-induced language impairments to be distinct. K-means clustering of language assessment data (neurosurgery cohort: N = 88, stroke cohort: N = 95) identified similar profiles in both cohorts. But critically, a cluster of individuals with specific phonological deficits was only evident in the stroke but not in the neurosurgery cohort. Thus, phonological deficits are less clearly distinguished from other language deficits after glioma surgery compared to stroke. Furthermore, the correlations between language production and comprehension scores at different linguistic levels were more extensive in the neurosurgery than in the stroke cohort. Our findings suggest that neurosurgery-induced language impairments do not correspond to those caused by stroke, but rather manifest as a ‘moderate global aphasia’ – a generalized decline of language processing abilities.}

In the present longitudinal study, we extend this finding by looking at the pattern of language deterioration over time in the same population of Catalan-Spanish bilingual patients. All the participants completed three language-processing tasks (picture naming, word translation and word comprehension), both in their dominant (L1) and non-dominant (L2) language. At one year, the final group was made up of 50 patients: 15 with MCI and 35 with AD. For AD but not MCI, the language deterioration over time was the same in both languages, as previously reported in the cross-sectional study. The results are discussed in the frame of the hypothesis of shared lexico-semantic processing in highly proficient bilinguals and the influence of executive control deficits in language production.}

Language functions under investigation include inner speech, cognitive, and communicative functions. The independent variables include acculturation level, social network profile, length of residence, and predicted future domicile. The study employed both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Respondents completed an online questionnaire and were interviewed by the researcher. The study included the Complementarity Principle into the operationalisation and measurement of language use in bilinguals (Grosjean, 2016). The findings revealed a consistent variation in the extent of L2 use across different language functions. Links were established between the extent of L2 internalisation and acculturation level, social network profile, and predicted future domicile. The results showed that sociocultural integration is a reliable predictor of the extent of L2 use across language functions. This study adds an acculturation perspective to current research on L2 internalisation and language development across lifespan, by measuring and juxtaposing the extent of L2 use across different language functions in sequential bilinguals following migration.}

In this study, the aim was to shed light on the brain basis of cognitive control using an approach that proved useful in previous studies investigating language control in bilinguals. We examined adult participants in one simple color naming context and two task selection mixed contexts. In the first mixed selection context, participants named the color or the shape of the stimulus based on a cue word. In the second, they named the color or the size of the stimulus. It was assumed that the comparison of brain responses to the same color naming in mixed selection contexts vs. in non-selection context will reveal the of engagement of cognitive control/task selection processes. Whole brain analysis of color naming in the different contexts showed a significant main effect of context. The comparison of brain responses in several frontal, parietal and sub-cortical regions, of which some are supposedly involved in cognitive control, demonstrated an increased activation during color naming in mixed relative the simple non-mixed context. The different cognitive control modules described in this study fit with recent bilingual language control and domain general cognitive models.}

Bilinguals used a more distributed neural network than monolinguals that captured the nonverbal mixing effect and showed earlier discrimination for the switching effect in the ERPs. In language switching, more distributed networks for bilinguals than monolinguals were found for the switching effect. The scalp distributions revealed more overlap between task switching and language switching for bilinguals than monolinguals. For switch costs, both groups showed P3/LPC modulations in both tasks, but bilinguals showed extended activation to central regions for both switching tasks. For mixing costs, both groups revealed modulations of the N2 but only bilinguals showed extended activation to the occipital region.

abstract = {Objective
To investigate the role of the period of emergence of the first words and its interactions with other risk factors in predicting the development of speech sound disorder (SSD) among 4- to 5-year-old children.
Methods
After 373 children underwent otolaryngology and speech pathology examinations, their parents answered a questionnaire about potential risk factors for speech impairment. The presence of SSD was identified by a speech pathologist who administered Fanzago's Articulation Test to each child. Multivariate logistic analysis was used to explore the relationships between variables and outcomes.
Results
Mean age at first words was 17.8 ± 6.5 months of life; 25.7% of patients suffered from SSD, and 3.7% from stuttering. A family history of language impairment was found in 12.9% of the sample, whereas a family history of reading difficulty was reported in only 5.4% of cases. No differences in terms of mean age (p = 0.3) or gestational age (p = 0.16) were found between children affected by SSD and those who were not. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that male sex (p < 0.001), a family history of language impairment (p < 0.001) and stuttering (p = 0.001) were significantly associated to SSD. Age at first words did not result a predictor of speech impairment.
Conclusion
In contrast to male sex (p < 0.001), family history of language impairment (p < 0.001) and stuttering (p = 0.001) which resulted significantly associated to SSD, age at first words does not seem to be a predictor of SSD (p = 0.11); however, it remains a useful indicator of language delay and, when considered in association with other language milestones, can be a reason of concern for parents and caregivers about their children's developmental and speech therapy needs.}

Rhyming ability is among the earliest metaphonological skills to be acquired during the process of speech and language acquisition. Metalinguistic skills, particularly metaphonological skills, greatly influence language learning during early, school grades and reportedly children with learning disorders are poor at these skills.
Aim and objectives
To develop and validate a Bengali rhyming checklist and study the auditory perception of non-sense and familiar Bengali rhyming words in children with and without specific learning disability (SLD).
Method
60 children, age range 8–11years, participated in two groups; group-A included children with SLD and group-B, typically developing children (TDC). All participants were native Bengali speakers, attending regular school, with hearing sensitivity less than 25dBHL, no history of ear discharge and middle socioeconomic background. A rhyming checklist was developed in Bengali, consisting of familiar (section-A) and non-sense (section-B) words. Test–retest reliability and validity measures were obtained. The items on the checklist were audio recorded and presented to the participants in a rhyming judgment task in one to one set up. Scores were obtained and statistically analyzed using SPSS software (version-11.0).
Result
Children with SLD scored significantly low on the rhyming judgment task as against TDC (p<.05) for both familiar and non-sense words. Children with SLD performed significantly better on familiar word rhyming judgment task against non-sense words (p<.05). TDC showed no significant difference on familiar and non-sense words rhyming judgment tasks (p>.05).
Conclusion
Semantic content influences rhyming perception in children with SLD but has no significant effect on TDC. The developed rhyming checklist may be used as a screening tool for children at risk of SLD at primary school grades. Rhyming activities may be utilized by teachers and parents, to promote language learning in young learners.}

Both groups had acquired L2 late (formal learning at primary school) and presented with mild cognitive impairment. Parkinson's patients had greater linguistic impairments in L1 than L2, and they had greater L1 and L2 impairments than healthy controls. These findings strongly replicate previous ones (Zanini et al., 2004) and suggest that L1 grammar processing mainly recruits cortical-subcortical language networks in agreement with the Declarative/Procedural model of language acquisition (Paradis, 1994; Ullman, 2001) and that general cognitive functioning ought to be carefully investigated with respect to linguistic impairments in bilingual subjects, especially in the case of adult subjects with neurodegenerative disorders.}

Aphasia is common following stroke, with associated negative impacts on quality of life and psychosocial functioning. However, the language function of individuals who develop non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) has been minimally investigated from a speech-language pathology (SLP) perspective.
Aims
To examine and characterise the language function of individuals following non-traumatic SAH in the acute phase and describe the clinical profile and outcomes of individuals in this cohort with language impairment.
Methods & Procedures
Prospective cohort study of adults admitted to a tertiary hospital with primary non-traumatic SAH over a 12-month period (June 2018 to June 2019). Language assessment using the Brisbane Evidence-Based Language Test (EBLT) was performed within 72 hours of medical stability. Assessment scores were analysed for 43 participants.
Outcomes & Results
Language impairment was present in 18.6% (n=8/43) of the cohort, and was associated with increased intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) (p<0.01) and increased hospital length of stay (p=0.01). The profile of participants with impaired language was highly variable with difficulties across auditory comprehension, verbal expression, reading comprehension, and written expression. Associated cognitive and attention difficulties also impacted test performance in this cohort. Six of the eight participants with impaired language required ongoing SLP support beyond hospital discharge.
Conclusions & Implications
Early, routine assessment of language function of individuals following non-traumatic SAH is essential and should be incorporated into clinical care pathways.}

Seventy-six studies were reviewed, all published between 2004 and 2015. Keywords were developed to choose accurately eligible abstracts to be reviewed: child language development, environmental factors, communication disorders, and predictive factors. Of the 76 eligible abstracts that comprehensively addressed prediction factors of child language development, environmental factors represented the largest portion (45/76 abstracts, 59%), social and genetic factors were second (20/76 – 26%), and valid predictors of child language development delay had the smallest portion (11/76 – 14%). The review revealed the important roles of social class, family history, environmental, and genetic factors in prediction of child language development. It was established that the interplay between environmental, social, and genetic factors influence child language development; specifically, environmental exposure to toxins like lead and mercury were noted to have a complex interplay with the biological aspects of communication disorders. Our review highlighted the need for further research on the specific interplay of the prediction factors (like environmental and social class) on language development among infants and toddlers.}

To address these questions, we studied fourteen English-speaking monolingual adults enrolled in a 12-week intensive French language-training program in Montreal. Using functional MRI, we investigated the neural changes associated with new language acquisition. The participants were scanned before the start of the immersion program and at the end of the 12 weeks. The fMRI scan aimed to investigate the brain regions recruited in a sentence reading task both in English, their first language (L1), and in French, their second language (L2). For the L1, fMRI patterns did not change from Time 1 to Time 2, while for the L2, the brain response changed between Time 1 and Time 2 in language-related areas. Of note, for the L2, there was higher activation at Time 2 compared to Time 1 in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) including the supramarginal gyrus. At Time 2 this higher activation in the IPL correlated with faster L2 reading speed. Moreover, higher activation in the left IPL at Time 1 predicted improvement in L2 reading speed from Time 1 to Time 2. Our results suggest that learning-induced plasticity occurred as early as 12 weeks into immersive second-language training, and that the IPL appears to play a special role in language learning.}

The purpose was to discuss how cultural and linguistic factors were addressed in the interventions, examine the methodological rigor of the studies, identify the outcomes and measures used, determine the efficacy of the interventions on language skills in English and in children’s home language(s), and describe the reported social validity of the interventions. Forty articles reporting on 41 studies met inclusionary criteria. Interventions focused on four areas: explicit instruction on targeted skills; classroom curriculum interventions; interactive book reading and/or book making interventions; and naturalistic, routines-based interventions. Most interventions were delivered to children above age 3 who were from Latino and/or Spanish-speaking backgrounds. Also, linguistic adaptations (primarily in Spanish) were more common in interventions as compared to cultural adaptations. Vocabulary was the most common outcome targeted, with a wide variety of measures used across studies. Most interventions had positive effects in English and/or a language other than English particularly when the interventions were linguistically- and culturally-responsive. Several cultural or linguistic factors were also identified as variables affecting intervention fidelity, engagement, and effects. Limitations of the current research base and implications for practice are discussed.}

Inhibitory control was gauged by lag-2 task repetition costs, namely decreased performance on the final trial of sequences of type ABA relative to CBA, due to persisting inhibition of the recently abandoned task. Bilinguals had larger lag-2 repetition costs, which reflect stronger inhibition of a no-longer relevant task to facilitate a switch into a new task. Monitoring ability was measured by the fadeout effect, which reflects adaptation to simpler task demands when a single task block immediately and unexpectedly follows mixed task blocks. Bilinguals did not differ from monolinguals in the magnitude or trajectory of the fade-out effect. Thus, results support the notion of increased bilingual inhibitory control, even when it is detrimental to performance, and do not demonstrate a specific bilingual advantage in monitoring. These findings are discussed in the context of the recent debate concerning the locus of bilingual advantages.}

Reading elicited language intrusions (e.g., saying la instead of the), and several types of within-language errors (e.g., saying their instead of the). Patients produced more intrusions (and self-corrected less often) than controls, particularly when reading non-dominant language paragraphs with switches into the dominant language. Patients also produced more within-language errors than controls, but differences between groups for these were not consistently larger with dominant versus non-dominant language targets. These results illustrate the potential utility of speech errors for diagnosis of AD, suggest a variety of linguistic and executive control impairments in AD, and reveal multiple cognitive mechanisms needed to mix languages fluently. The observed pattern of deficits, and unique sensitivity of intrusions to AD in bilinguals, suggests intact ability to select a default language with contextual support, to rapidly translate and switch languages in production of connected speech, but impaired ability to monitor language membership while regulating inhibitory control.}

In the 23 children with L2 vocabularies, recent language exposure estimates accounted for 69% of the variation in L2 vocabulary size, and the VABS-II expressive scale score explained an additional 13% of the difference. The complete sample was then subgrouped into three levels of L2 vocabulary size to compare children with no L2 vocabularies (NON-B, n=10), low L2 word counts (LOW-B, n=11) and high L2 counts (HIGH-B, n=12), as determined by a median split procedure. The HIGH-B group had significantly larger L1 vocabularies than both the LOW-B (p=.045) and the NON-B (p=.003) groups, and higher VABS-II expressive scale scores than both the LOW-B (p=.008) and the NON-B (p=.012) groups. Social impairment did not significantly differ across groups and cognitive impairment did not preclude the development of L2 vocabularies. Expressive bilingualism in this population appears related to high levels of recent direct L2 exposure in combination with stronger dominant language abilities.}

In two thirds of affected children, dyscalculia is associated with another developmental disorder like dyslexia, attention-deficit disorder, anxiety disorder, visual and spatial disorder, or cultural deprivation. Infants, primates, some birds, and other animals are born with the innate ability, called subitizing, to tell at a glance whether small sets of scattered dots or other items differ by one or more item. This nonverbal approximate number system extends mostly to single digit sets as visual discrimination drops logarithmically to “many” with increasing numerosity (size effect) and crowding (distance effect). Preschoolers need several years and specific teaching to learn verbal names and visual symbols for numbers and school agers to understand their cardinality and ordinality and the invariance of their sequence (arithmetic number line) that enables calculation. This arithmetic linear line differs drastically from the nonlinear approximate number system mental number line that parallels the individual number-tuned neurons in the intraparietal sulcus in monkeys and overlying scalp distribution of discrete functional magnetic resonance imaging activations by number tasks in man. Calculation is a complex skill that activates both visual and spatial and visual and verbal networks. It is less strongly left lateralized than language, with approximate number system activation somewhat more right sided and exact number and arithmetic activation more left sided. Maturation and increasing number skill decrease associated widespread non-numerical brain activations that persist in some individuals with dyscalculia, which has no single, universal neurological cause or underlying mechanism in all affected individuals.}

All children performed equivalently on the basic intelligence tests, but performance on the language and executive functioning tasks was influenced by both SES and bilingualism. Middle-class children outperformed working-class children on all measures, and bilingual children obtained lower scores than monolingual children on language tests but higher scores than monolingual children on the executive functioning tasks.

Here, we investigated local structural differences along two language-related white matter trajectories, the arcuate fasciculus and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), between early simultaneous bilinguals and late sequential bilinguals. We also examined whether early exposure to two languages might lead to a more bilateral structural organization of the arcuate fasciculus. Fractional anisotropy, mean and radial diffusivities (FA, MD, and RD respectively) were extracted to analyse tract-specific changes. Additionally, global voxel-wise effects were investigated with Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). We found that relative to late exposure, early exposure to L2 leads to increased FA along a phonology-related segment of the arcuate fasciculus, but induces no modulations along the IFOF, associated to semantic processing. Late sequential bilingualism, however, was associated with decreased MD along the bilateral IFOF. Our results suggest that early vs. late bilingualism may lead to qualitatively different kind of changes in the structural language-related network. Furthermore, we show that early bilingualism contributes to the structural laterality of the arcuate fasciculus, leading to a more bilateral organization of these perisylvian language-related tracts.}

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on three participants with aphasia and three normal controls who had demonstrated a shift toward dominance in their second language (English). The behavioral and imaging results indicate that all participants processed their non-dominant native language (Spanish) differently compared to their dominant second language (English). Specifically, increased activation was observed in the left frontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus during the weaker native language processing. Further, in participants with aphasia, increased bilateral activation was observed during the weaker native language processing, indicating that decreased language usage/proficiency results in a distributed network of activation. The results of this study demonstrate that the neural substrates of language recovery in bilingual stroke patients are similar to regions engaged by normal bilinguals but include additional regions reflecting a compensatory network to subserve successful language processing.}

An interesting question is to what extent phonological similarity of translation equivalents across the first language (L1) and L2 affects speech-sound processing and lexical access in an L2. The present study examined this question by comparing processing of Spanish-English translation equivalents that either were phonologically similar (cognates) or dissimilar (non-cognates) in fifteen monolingual English-speakers and 15 late Spanish-English bilinguals. Event related potentials (ERP) were used to examine whether late L2-learners had more difficulty discriminating mispronunciations of vowels in English words that have Spanish cognates compared to words that do not have cognates. Behavioral results indicated effects of language background and cognate status on discrimination, with bilinguals showing poorer discrimination of English vowel mispronunciations than the American-English monolingual control group. ERP results revealed that cognate words facilitated L2 phonological processing as evidenced by a larger frontal positive component (P400) ERP effect, similar in amplitude to the P400 from monolinguals. Results suggest that cognate words facilitate speech processing in adult L2 learners, and, thus, may also be useful as a tool for perceptual learning of L2 phonology.}

Surprisingly, differences between patients and controls were larger using dominant-language than nondominant-language naming scores, and bilinguals with AD were either more likely than controls (in English-dominant bilinguals), or equally likely (in Spanish-dominant bilinguals), to name some pictures in the nondominant language that they could not produce in their dominant language. These findings suggest that dominant language testing may provide the best assessment of language deficits in bilingual AD, and argue against the common notion that the nondominant language is particularly susceptible to dementia. The greater vulnerability of the dominant language may reflect the increased probability of AD affecting richer semantic representations associated with dominant compared to nondominant language names.}

abstract = {Research on bilinguals with brain lesions is complicated by high patient variability, making it difficult to find well-matched controls. We benefitted from a database of over 700 patients and conducted an analysis of pre-operative functional magnetic resonance imaging data to assess language dominance in 25 early, highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals, and 25 carefully matched monolingual controls. Our results showed that early bilingualism is associated with greater bilateral hemispheric involvement, and monolingualism is associated with stronger left hemisphere lateralization (p=0.009). The bilinguals showed more pronounced right hemisphere activation (p=0.008). Although language dominance values were concordant in the bilingual group, there were a few (12%) atypical cases with different lateralization patterns in L1 and L2. Finally, we found distinct areas of activity in first and second language within the language network, in addition to regions of convergence. These data underscore the need to map all languages proficiently spoken by surgical candidates.}

abstract = {Visual perception is often not homogenous across the visual field and can vary depending on situational demands. The reasons behind this inhomogeneity are not clear. Here we show that directing attention that is consistent with a western reading habit from left to right, results in a ~32% higher sensitivity to detect transient visual events in the right hemifield. This right visual field advantage was largely reduced in individuals with reading difficulties from developmental dyslexia. Similarly, visual detection became more symmetric in skilled readers, when attention was guided opposite to the reading pattern. Taken together, these findings highlight a higher sensitivity in the right visual field for detecting the onset of sudden visual events that is well accounted for by left hemisphere dominated reading habit.}

abstract = {In this study, I explore the relationship between migrants' linguistic resources, their environment, and their emotions, focusing on two Assyrian-Iranian migrants in Germany. By adopting an ecological approach, I examine how the memories they have created in Iran and Germany impact their emotional attachments to the Persian, Assyrian, and German languages. I argue that their experiences with these languages cause them to ascribe distinct emotional values to each. On the one hand, their strong feelings of belonging to a place (Iran), which correspond to their good memories of speaking Persian in that place, lead them to highly value that language and incorporate it into most aspects of their social lives. On the other hand, the migrants’ memories of a language with negative or neutral connotations (in this case, German) correspond with a lower level of reported social interactions in that language. This study shows that the language which these participants use to express their emotional involvement in particular moments of their life invokes specific feelings, and represents their inner world better than their other linguistic resources.}
