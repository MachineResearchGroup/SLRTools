abstract={Helicopter unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be widely used for both military and civilian operations. Because these helicopters are underactuated nonlinear mechanical systems, high-performance controller design for them presents a challenge. This paper presents an optimal controller design for trajectory tracking of a helicopter UAV using a neural network (NN). The state-feedback control system utilizes the backstepping methodology, employing kinematic and dynamic controllers. The online approximator-based dynamic controller learns the infinite-horizon Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation in continuous time and calculates the corresponding optimal control input to minimize the HJB equation forward-in-time. Optimal tracking is accomplished with a single NN utilized for cost function approximation. The overall closed-loop system stability is demonstrated using Lyapunov analysis, with the position, orientation, angular and translational velocity tracking errors, and NN weight estimation errors uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) in the presence of bounded disturbances and NN functional reconstruction errors.},

abstract={Man overboard (MOB) incidents in open sea travel are a risk for the shipping industry. In this work we aim to design an autonomous system in charge of planning and executing a search for a person in water (PIW), victim of MOB. The proposed solution consists of an autonomous UAV that initiates a SAR mission when it receives a MOB signal. The UAV is located in an autonomous docking mechanism onboard the ship. The probabilistic leeway model is implemented to find the location of the PIW and a Deep Learning object detection algorithm (Faster R-CNN) is employed to locate the PIW. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a search system on-board a vessel -capable of live planning and execution- is proposed. Our results indicate that employing our solution would increase the success probability of finding a PIW and decrease the total search time.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have received a huge interest in military and civil applications. Applications of UAS are dependent on successful communications of these systems with different entities in their networks. A UAS network can include the UAS, ground control station, navigation satellite system, and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) receiver. Through these entities, a UAS is vulnerable to different cyber-attacks such as GPS spoofing. In this attack, a malicious user transmits fake signals to the GPS receiver on the UAS. The fake signals can mislead not only the aircraft but also air traffic controllers, leading to serious problems. These problems range from aircraft hijacking to collisions and human casualties. This paper proposes a supervised machine learning method based on the artificial neural network to detect GPS spoofing signals. Different features such as pseudo range, Doppler shift, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are used to perform the classification of GPS signals. We examine and compare the efficiency of one-and two-hidden-layer neural networks with various numbers of hidden neurons. The results show that our proposed method provides a high probability of detection and a low probability of false alarm.},

abstract={In this work, we present a perception-aware path-planning pipeline for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for navigation in challenging environments. The objective is to reach a given destination safely and accurately by relying on monocular camera-based state estimators, such as Keyframe-based Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems. Motivated by the recent advances in semantic segmentation using deep learning, our path-planning architecture takes into consideration the semantic classes of parts of the scene that are perceptually more informative than others. This work proposes a planning strategy capable of avoiding both texture-less regions and problematic areas, such as lakes and oceans, that may cause large drift or failures in the robot's pose estimation, by using the semantic information to compute the next best action with respect to perception quality. We design a hierarchical planner, composed of an A* path-search step followed by B-Spline trajectory optimization. While the A* steers the UAV towards informative areas, the optimizer keeps the most promising landmarks in the camera's field of view. We extensively evaluate our approach in a set of photo-realistic simulations, showing a remarkable improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art in active perception.},

abstract={A sliding mode control method is presented in this paper, which is proven to achieve asymptotic limit cycle oscillation (LCO) suppression in unmanned aerial vehicle wings equipped with synthetic jet actuators (SJA). With a focus on applications involving small unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAV) with limited onboard computing resources, the proposed control law is designed to be inexpensively implemented, requiring no adaptive laws, function approximators, or pitching and plunging velocity measurements. Challenges in the control design include input-multiplicative uncertainty due to the parametric uncertainty and nonlinearity that are inherent in the SJA dynamic model. To achieve the result, a sliding mode control strategy is amalgamated with a velocity estimator, which is designed using a bank of dynamic filters. This is the first output feedback control result that achieves asymptotic LCO regulation in the presence of an uncertain, nonlinear SJA dynamic model, without the use of adaptive laws or neural networks. A detailed model of the SUAV dynamics is utilized along with a rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis to prove asymptotic regulation of the pitching and plunging displacements, and numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed control design.},

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models are increasingly deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT), paving the evolution of the IoT into the AI of things (AIoT). Currently, the predominant approach for AI model training is cloud-centric and involves the sharing of data with external parties. To preserve privacy while enabling collaborative model training across distributed IoT devices, the machine learning paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed. The future FL network is envisioned to involve up to millions of distributed IoT devices involved in collaborative learning. However, communication failures and dropouts by nodes can lead to inefficient FL. Inspired by the UAV-assisted communications in 5G heterogeneous networks (HetNet), we propose the UAV-assisted FL in this article. The FL model owner may employ UAVs to provide the intermediate model aggregation in the sky and mobile relay of the updated model parameters from data owners to the model owner. This therefore increases the reach of FL to data owners that face uncertain network conditions and improves the communication efficiency. To incentivize the UAV service providers, we adopt the multi-dimensional contract incentive design as a case study. The incentive compatibility of the contract ensures that the UAVs only choose an incentive package corresponding to its type, for example, traveling cost. The simulation results show that the UAV-assisted FL achieves significant improvement in communication efficiency and validates the incentive compatibility of our contract design.},

abstract={Iterative learning control (ILC) is an effective control technique to enhance system performance. ILC requires the system to execute identical operations repetitively such that the system performance can be improved by learning from previous iterations. To remove the requirement of repetitive operation, this paper leverages recent advances in deep learning and proposes a new ILC scheme, named Deep ILC, with detailed formulation, analysis, and validation. The proposed Deep ILC consists of two main components, the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network based prediction and the optimization based learning filter design. In particular, we formulate the learning filter design problem into an optimization problem by purposely constructing an augmented dynamic feedback system, of which the to-be-designed learning filter is in the feedback loop. The proposed Deep ILC is applied to the trajectory tracking of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and its effectiveness is validated through experimental studies.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel strategy for weed monitoring, using images taken with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and concepts of image analysis and machine learning. Weed control in precision agriculture designs site-specific treatments based on the coverage of weeds, where the key is to provide precise weed maps timely. Most traditional remote platforms, e.g. piloted planes or satellites, are, however, not suitable for early weed monitoring, given their low temporal and spatial resolutions, as opposed to he ultra-high spatial resolution of UAVs. The system here proposed makes use of UAV-imagery and is based on: 1) Divide the image, 2) compute and binarise the vegetation indexes, 3) detect crop rows, 4) optimise the parameters and 4) learn a classification model. Since crops are usually organised in rows, the use of a crop row detection algorithm helps to separate properly weed and crop pixels, which is a common handicap given the spectral similitude of both. Several artificial intelligence paradigms are compared in this paper to identify the most suitable strategy for this topic (i.e. unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised approaches). Our experiments also study the effect of different parameteres: the flight altitude, the sensor and the use of previously trained models at a different height. Our results show that 1) very promising performance can be obtained, even when using very few labelled data and 2) the classification model can be learnt in a subplot of the experimental field at low altitude and then applied to the whole field at a higher height, which simplifies the whole process. These results motivate the use of this strategy to design weed monitoring strategies for early post-emergence weed control.},

abstract={Most existing control methods for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are based on the primary assumption that the center of gravity (CoG) is fixed and is in the same position as the centroid, which is not necessarily true with swing load as continuously making CoG vary with the swing angle and substantially complicating the dynamic model of UAV. This article presents an adaptive learning and fault-tolerant control scheme for quadrotor UAVs with varying CoG and unknown moment of inertia. First, we establish the dynamic model of quadrotor UAVs in the presence of time-varying CoG, input saturation, and actuator fault. Then, we design a fault-tolerant adaptive learning controller for the quadrotor UAVs and show that both linear and angular velocity tracking errors are ensured to converge to a residual set around zero in the presence of full-state constraints. Furthermore, all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation studies also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

abstract={In this paper, we tackle several problems that appear in robotics and autonomous systems: algorithm tuning, automatic control, and intelligent design. All those problems share in common that they can be mapped to global optimization problems where evaluations are expensive. Bayesian optimization (BO) has become a fundamental global optimization algorithm in many problems where sample efficiency is of paramount importance. BO uses a probabilistic surrogate model to learn the response function and reduce the number of samples required. Gaussian processes (GPs) have become a standard surrogate model for their flexibility to represent a distribution over functions. In a black-box settings, the common assumption is that the underlying function can be modeled with a stationary GP. In this paper, we present a novel kernel function specially designed for BO, that allows nonstationary behavior of the surrogate model in an adaptive local region. This kernel is able to reconstruct nonstationarity even with the irregular sampling distribution that arises from BO. Furthermore, in our experiments, we found that this new kernel results in an improved local search (exploitation), without penalizing the global search (exploration) in many applications. We provide extensive results in well-known optimization benchmarks, machine learning hyperparameter tuning, reinforcement learning, and control problems, and UAV wing optimization. The results show that the new method is able to outperform the state of the art in BO both in stationary and nonstationary problems.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of proactive deployment of cache-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for optimizing the quality-of-experience (QoE) of wireless devices in a cloud radio access network is studied. In the considered model, the network can leverage human-centric information, such as users' visited locations, requested contents, gender, job, and device type to predict the content request distribution, and mobility pattern of each user. Then, given these behavior predictions, the proposed approach seeks to find the user-UAV associations, the optimal UAVs' locations, and the contents to cache at UAVs. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' QoE while minimizing the transmit power used by the UAVs. To solve this problem, a novel algorithm based on the machine learning framework of conceptor-based echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. Using ESNs, the network can effectively predict each user's content request distribution and its mobility pattern when limited information on the states of users and the network is available. Based on the predictions of the users' content request distribution and their mobility patterns, we derive the optimal locations of UAVs as well as the content to cache at UAVs. Simulation results using real pedestrian mobility patterns from BUPT and actual content transmission data from Youku show that the proposed algorithm can yield 33.3% and 59.6% gains, respectively, in terms of the average transmit power and the percentage of the users with satisfied QoE compared with a benchmark algorithm without caching and a benchmark solution without UAVs.},

abstract={Deploying wireless routers on the ground and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the air is believed to be a fast and efficient approach to providing the emergency communication service to disaster areas. The network lifetime is restricted to the lifetime of mesh networks of routers that are scattered across a complex disaster environment. We consider the problem of multi-UAVs relaying and moving with the goal of maximizing the network lifetime. UAVs must learn where to move in order to relay messages from the routers efficiently. However, under the dynamics of the router traffic, that is, the uncertainty of the environment, it is challenging for UAVs to find a movement mechanism that maximizes the network lifetime. By embracing the on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm Sarsa, we are able to demonstrate a greedy movement policy. Specifically, we study the trajectory planning of multiple UAVs in a dense wireless router mesh networks (WMNs) on the ground. UAVs can learn the unknown environment by a little movement of UAVs in each step, in which communication connections between routers with UAVs are retained. A Q-table of movement actions and environment states is formed after multiple attempts of movements. Simulation results show the proposal effectiveness comparing with other methods.},

abstract={Plant disease is a major factor in yield reduction. Thus, plant breeders currently rely on selecting disease-resistant plant cultivars, which involves disease severity rating of a large variety of cultivars. Traditional visual screening of these cultivars is an error-prone process, which necessitates the development of an automatic framework for disease quantification based on field-acquired images using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to augment the throughput. Since these images are impaired by complex backgrounds, uneven lighting, and densely overlapping leaves, state-of-the-art frameworks formulate the processing pipeline as a dichotomy problem (i.e. presence/absence of disease). However, additional information regarding accurate disease localization and quantification is crucial for breeders. This paper proposes a deep framework for simultaneous segmentation of individual leaf instances and corresponding diseased region using a unified feature map with a multi-task loss function for an end-to-end training. We test the framework on field maize dataset with Northern Leaf Blight (NLB) disease and the experimental results show a disease severity correlation of 73% with the manual ground truth data and run-time efficiency of 5fps.},

abstract={Dynamic soaring (DS) is an aerobatic maneuver whereby a gliding aircraft harnesses energy from horizontal wind that varies in strength and/or direction to support flight. Typical approaches to dynamic soaring in autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) use nonlinear optimizers to generate energy-gaining trajectories, which are then followed using traditional controllers. The effectiveness of such a strategy is limited by both the local optimality of the generated trajectory, as well as controller tracking errors. In this paper, we investigate a reinforcement learning (RL) approach working in continuous space to control a DS aircraft flying in shear wind conditions. The RL controller operates in two stages: In the first stage, it observes a traditional sample-based controller flying a locally optimal DS trajectory generated a priori. In the second stage, the sample-based controller is removed and authority is passed to the RL algorithm. We show that by deviating from the original planned trajectory, the RL controller is able to achieve better performance than its baseline teacher controller.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) edge network has connected lots of heterogeneous smart devices, thanks to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their groundbreaking emerging applications. Limited computational capacity and energy availability have been major factors hindering the performance of edge user equipment (UE) and IoT devices in IoT edge networks. Besides, the edge base station (BS) with the computation server is allowed massive traffic and is vulnerable to disasters. The UAV is a promising technology that provides aerial base stations (ABSs) to assist the edge network in enhancing the ground network performance, extending network coverage, and offloading computationally intensive tasks from UEs or IoT devices. In this paper, we deploy a clustered multi-UAV to provide computing task offloading and resource allocation services to IoT devices. We propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based approach to minimize the overall network computation cost while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) requirements of IoT devices or UEs in the IoT network. We formulate our problem as a natural extension of the Markov decision process (MDP) concerning stochastic game, to minimize the long-term computation cost in terms of energy and delay. We consider the stochastic time-varying UAVs’ channel strength and dynamic resource requests to obtain optimal resource allocation policies and computation offloading in aerial to ground (A2G) network infrastructure. Simulation results show that our proposed MADRL method reduces the average costs by 38.643%, and 55.621% and increases the reward by 58.289% and 85.289% compared with the different single agent DRL and heuristic schemes, respectively.},

abstract={Radio maps provide metrics such as power spectral density for every location in a geographic area and find numerous applications such as UAV communications, interference control, spectrum management, resource allocation, and network planning to name a few. Radio maps are constructed from measurements collected by spectrum sensors distributed across space. Since radio maps are complicated functions of the spatial coordinates due to the nature of electromagnetic wave propagation, model-free approaches are strongly motivated. Nevertheless, all existing schemes for radio occupancy map estimation rely on interpolation algorithms unable to learn from experience. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel approach in which the spatial structure of propagation phenomena such as shadowing is learned beforehand from a data set with measurements in other environments. Relative to existing schemes, a significantly smaller number of measurements is therefore required to estimate a map with a prescribed accuracy. As an additional novelty, this is also the first work to estimate radio occupancy maps using deep neural networks. Specifically, a fully convolutional deep completion autoencoder architecture is developed to effectively exploit the manifold structure of this class of maps.},

abstract={Humans and animals have learned or evolved to use magnetic fields for navigation. Knowing how to model and estimate these fields can be used for motion planning. However, computing the propagation of electromagnetic fields in a given environment requires solving complex differential equations with advanced numerical methods, and therefore it is not suitable for real-time decision making. In this latter, we present a real-time approximator for Maxwell's equations based on deep neural networks that predicts the distribution of a virtual magnetic field. We show how our approximator can be used to perform autonomous 2D navigation tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art navigation algorithms, ensuring completeness, and providing a near-optimal path up to 200 times per second without any post processing stage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with physics-based simulations of an unmanned aerial vehicle, an autonomous car, as well as real-world experiments using a small off-road autonomous racing vehicle. Furthermore, we show how the approach can be applied to multi-robot systems, video game technology, and can be extended to 3D problems.},

abstract={Vehicle detection in aerial image is the foundation of some applications, such as the traffic management, parking lot utilization, etc. Recently, universal object detection methods based on the convolutional neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performances, this is mainly because CNNs can extract more effective features compared with the handcrafted features in early mainstream methods. Extracting effective feature is crucial for vehicle detection in aerial image where the vehicles are small and the background is rather complicated. As a result, these methods based on CNNs have been used to detect the vehicles in aerial image. However, the performance may be poor when directly performing these universal methods. Firstly, these existing methods mostly detect the vehicles with horizontal bounding boxes. But these horizontal boxes do not match the vehicles in aerial image with arbitrary orientations and multiply aspect ratios. As a result, this kind of box would harm the detection accuracy directly. In addition, these methods are mostly computationally expensive, so they are not suitable for the platform with limited computational resources, for example the unmanned aerial vehicle. To address these problems above, by introducing the rotated bounding box regression and a lightweight network into SSD, we propose our vehicle detection networks, VDetor. Specifically, we use rotated bounding box rather than horizontal one to match the vehicle well and use a lightweight network, PeleeNet, as the backbone network of SSD to speed up the inference. Experiments on VEDAI dataset illustrate that our model performs better than SSD in terms of the detection accuracy and detection speed.},

The paper compares several mapping algorithms including Gaussian Process regression, Neural networks and polynomial and piecewise linear interpolation. The methods are compared in Monte Carlo simulations using a well known plume model and in indoor experiments using a ground robot. Unlike previous work on mapping using unmanned vehicles, the indoor experiments were performed in a controlled and repeatable manner where a steady state ground truth could be obtained in order to properly assess the various regression methods using data from a real dispersive source and sensor. The effect of sampling time during data collection was assessed with regards to the mapping accuracy, and the data collected during the experiments have been made available. Overall, the Gaussian Process method was found to perform the best among the regression algorithms, showing more robustness to the noisy measurements obtained from short sampling periods, enabling an accurate map to be produced in significantly less time. Finally, plume mapping results are presented in uncontrolled outdoor conditions, using an unmanned aerial vehicle, to demonstrate the system in a realistic uncontrolled environment.},

abstract={A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided air-to-ground uplink non-orthogonal transmission framework is investigated for next generation multiple access. Occupying the same spectrum resource, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) users and ground users (GUs) are connected to terrestrial cellular networks via the uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocol. As the flight safety is important for employing UAVs in civil airspace, the collision avoidance mechanism has to be considered during the flight. Therefore, a joint optimization problem of the UAV trajectory design, RIS configuration, and uploading power control is formulated for maximizing the network sum rate, while ensuring the UAV’s fight safety and satisfying the minimum data rate requirements of both the UAV and GU. The resultant problem is a sequential decision making one across multiple coherent time slots. Besides, the unknown locations of obstacles bring uncertainties into the decision making process. To tackle this challenging problem, a sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to optimize the UAV trajectory, RIS configuration, and power control simultaneously. Moreover, considering the ambiguous uncertainties in the environment, a distributionally robust DRL algorithm is further proposed to provide the worst-case performance guarantee. Numerical results demonstrate that the two proposed DRL algorithms outperform the conventional ones in terms of learning efficiency and robustness. It is also shown that the network sum rate is significantly improved by the proposed RIS-NOMA scheme compared to the conventional RIS-orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme and the case where no RIS is deployed.},

abstract={Object detection and semantic segmentation are two main themes in object retrieval from high-resolution remote sensing images, which have recently achieved remarkable performance by surfing the wave of deep learning and, more notably, convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we are interested in a novel, more challenging problem of vehicle instance segmentation, which entails identifying, at a pixel level, where the vehicles appear as well as associating each pixel with a physical instance of a vehicle. In contrast, vehicle detection and semantic segmentation each only concern one of the two. We propose to tackle this problem with a semantic boundary-aware multitask learning network. More specifically, we utilize the philosophy of residual learning to construct a fully convolutional network that is capable of harnessing multilevel contextual feature representations learned from different residual blocks. We theoretically analyze and discuss why residual networks can produce better probability maps for pixelwise segmentation tasks. Then, based on this network architecture, we propose a unified multitask learning network that can simultaneously learn two complementary tasks, namely, segmenting vehicle regions and detecting semantic boundaries. The latter subproblem is helpful for differentiating “touching” vehicles that are usually not correctly separated into instances. Currently, data sets with a pixelwise annotation for vehicle extraction are the ISPRS data set and the IEEE GRSS DFC2015 data set over Zeebrugge, which specializes in a semantic segmentation. Therefore, we built a new, more challenging data set for vehicle instance segmentation, called the Busy Parking Lot Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Video data set, and we make our data set available at http://www.sipeo.bgu.tum.de/downloads so that it can be used to benchmark future vehicle instance segmentation algorithms.},

However, coverage extension faces crucial challenges such as user mobility and determining the best coordinates for new base station deployment. In this paper, we address this problem based on the prediction of users' spatial distribution that allows Aerial base stations (ABS) to adjust their position accordingly. We first analyze the performance of two machine learning schemes (Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based encoder-decoder and self-attention-based Transformer) for user mobility prediction based on a real DataSet. Then, we use these schemes to enhance the ABS deployment algorithm. Numerical results reveal significant gains when applying the proposed mobility prediction models over traditional deployment algorithms. In four hours of the day, both the Transformer and LSTM based models show, respectively, more than 31% and 22% gain in coverage rates compared to regular deployment schemes.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of trajectory design of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for maximizing the number of satisfied users is studied in a UAV based cellular network where the UAV works as a flying base station that serves users, and the user indicates its satisfaction in terms of completion of its data request within an allowable maximum waiting time. The trajectory design is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the number of satisfied users. To solve this problem, a machine learning framework based on double Q-learning algorithm is proposed. The algorithm enables the UAV to find the optimal trajectory that maximizes the number of satisfied users. Compared to the traditional learning algorithms, such as Q-learning that selects and evaluates the action using the same Q-table, the proposed algorithm can decouple the selection from the evaluation, therefore avoid overestimation which leads to sub-optimal policies. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve up to 19.4% and 14.1% gains in terms of the number of satisfied users compared to random algorithm and Q-learning algorithm.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel concept of three-dimensional (3D) cellular networks, that integrate drone base stations (drone-BS) and cellular-connected drone users (drone-UEs), is introduced. For this new 3D cellular architecture, a novel framework for network planning for drone-BSs and latency-minimal cell association for drone-UEs is proposed. For network planning, a tractable method for drone-BSs' deployment based on the notion of truncated octahedron shapes is proposed, which ensures full coverage for a given space with a minimum number of drone-BSs. In addition, to characterize frequency planning in such 3D wireless networks, an analytical expression for the feasible integer frequency reuse factors is derived. Subsequently, an optimal 3D cell association scheme is developed for which the drone-UEs' latency, considering transmission, computation, and backhaul delays, is minimized. To this end, first, the spatial distribution of the drone-UEs is estimated using a kernel density estimation method, and the parameters of the estimator are obtained using a cross-validation method. Then, according to the spatial distribution of drone-UEs and the locations of drone-BSs, the latency-minimal 3D cell association for drone-UEs is derived by exploiting tools from an optimal transport theory. The simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the latency of drone-UEs compared with the classical cell association approach that uses a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion. In particular, the proposed approach yields a reduction of up to 46% in the average latency compared with the SINR-based association. The results also show that the proposed latency-optimal cell association improves the spectral efficiency of a 3D wireless cellular network of drones.},

abstract={Emerging applications of quadrotor vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles in various fields have created a need for demanding controllers that are able to counter several challenges, inter alia, nonlinearity, underactuated dynamics, lack of modeling, and uncertainties in the working environment. This study compares and contrasts type-1 and type-2 fuzzy neural networks (T2FNNs) for the trajectory tracking problem of quadrotor VTOL aircraft in terms of their tracking accuracy and control efforts. A realistic trajectory consisting of both straight lines and curvatures for a surveillance operation with minimum snap property, which is feasible regarding input constraints of the quadrotor, is generated to evaluate the proposed controllers. In order to imitate the outdoor noisy and time-varying working conditions, realistic uncertainties, such as wind and gust disturbances, are fed to the real-time experiment in the laboratory environment. Furthermore, a cost function based on the integral of the square of the sliding surface, which gives the optimal parameter update rules, is used to train the consequent part parameters of the T2FNN. Thanks to the learning capability of the proposed controllers, experimental results show the efficiency and efficacy of the learning algorithms that the proposed T2FNN-based controller with the optimal tuning algorithm is 50% superior to a conventional proportional-derivative (PD) controller in terms of control accuracy but requires more control effort. T2FNN structures are also shown to possess better noise reduction property as compared to their type-1 counterparts in the presence of unmodeled noise and disturbances.},

abstract={This paper proposes an improved back-stepping control approach and its application to small nonlinear UAV control systems with uncertainties such as external disturbance. Unlike traditional back-stepping control methods, the idea of prescribed performance function (PPF) is incorporated into the control design, such that both the transient and steady-state control performance can be strictly guaranteed. Moreover, we design a novel tracking differentiator to avoid the “differential expansion” problem well caused by the calculation of derivative. Significantly, the function approximators (e.g. neural networks) that are widely used to address the unknown nonlinearities in the nonlinear control designs are not needed. Finally, the numerical simulation verifies the convergence and robustness of the system, and the results show that the control strategy can obtain better transient and steady-state performance.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) also known as drones are increasingly populating our skies. This represents a relevant issue both for the legislator and the researcher. While the regulation plans often assume precautionary approaches, stating restrictive conditions of use for the sake of public safety, the applied research is exploring novel strategies to develop autonomous vehicles endowed with trusty operating mechanisms. The challenge is to let drones overflying even populated areas while keeping a steady control of the situation on the ground, thus enabling the possibility of safe landing with no harm for people. This can be done employing on-board cameras and embedded GPUs which allow for the execution in real-time of computer vision applications. In this paper, we introduce a crowd detection method for drone safe landing. The pivotal points of our proposal are related to the computational limitations imposed by the currently available hardware resources of UAVs. In this sense, our method is based on the light-weight scheme of a fully-convolutional neural network which conjugates nimble computations and effectiveness. We propose a two-loss model where a classification task (oriented to distinguish between crowded/non-crowded scenes) is supported by a regression task (aimed at better focusing the agglomeration tendency of the persons). This latter job is realized by resorting to the construction of a spatial graph for each analysed image and to the evaluation of the corresponding clustering coefficient. As a further element, our model is endowed with the capability to produce class activation heatmaps which contribute to the semantic enrichment of the flight maps. We tested our model on a large dataset of aerial images and we observed how it compares favorably with other approaches proposed in literature.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be integrated into the next generation wireless networks as new aerial mobile nodes, which can provide various live streaming applications such as surveillance, reconnaissance, etc. For such applications, due to the dynamic characteristics of traffic and wireless channels, how to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) is a challenging task. In this paper, with recent advances in scalable video coding (SVC), we study energy-efficient secure video streaming in rotary-wing UAV-enabled wireless networks. By jointly optimizing video levels selection, power allocation, and the UAV’s trajectory, we intend to maximize the long-term energy efficiency that is defined as the ratio of video quality to power consumption. Meanwhile, secrecy timeout probability is considered as a constraint cost to guarantee time delays requirements in a long run perspective. Our problem is modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and solved by safe deep Q-learning network (safe-DQN), where a safe policies set induced by constructing a Lyapunov function is dynamically adjusted to satisfy the constraint conditions of the CMDP. Extensive simulation results with different system parameters show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with other existing reinforcement learning algorithms.},

The system models the castaway location evolution using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that is trained before the rescue starts using a map of the sea wind and currents. The UAV predicts the position of the castaways with the prediction ANN and searches the castaways using a controller implemented with another ANN trained with searching behaviors. The USV, with a bigger computational power, incorporates a Particle Filter (PF) to estimate the castaway location. This PF uses the prediction ANN to predict the position of the particles and the measurements of the UAV and USV to update their weights.

abstract={Regular inspection and maintenance of roads are required to ensure safe transportation. While examining the state of structural health, cracks are considered as the primary indicators. In the past decades, researchers have been working on various image-based pavement crack detection techniques for non-destructive evaluation. The main advantages of these techniques over manual inspection are accuracy, efficiency and cost. However, the problems associated with the existing methods are their dependence on the handcrafted features, which may not give accurate results due to insufficient feature selection. In this paper, an automatic image-based crack detection algorithm for pavement crack detection using Convolutional Neural Network is proposed. The data set was obtained from various road surfaces of United Arab Emirates (UAE) by using an unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and was used in training and validation of the proposed system. The collected data was also used to create a composite view of the road by creating a continuous mosaic. From the experimental results, it was found that the proposed system has an accuracy of 92% in the validation stage and 90% in the testing stage and can be used for crack detection of road surfaces.},

abstract={The design of a long endurance UAV powered by solar energy, with autonomy flying over a pre specified forest area equipped with LiDAR which includes R, G, B and Infrared or near infrared bands to take clear and detail video of every part of the forest in order to recognize legal or illegal camp fires, dry areas providing hazardous conditions, upload temperature, humidity and other ground sensor data, helping to characterize the degree of forest fire vulnerability using pattern recognition, and communicating this information to firefighters either upon request, or as alarm events. The airplane electronic hardware software uses computational photography and virtual reality to create a detail 3-D forest video real time. It communicates all this information to a ground station real time. Although the aircraft has autonomy, trained pilots in the ground station can override the autonomy and fly the aircraft. In case of forest fire the aircraft electronic hardware software system can compute the exact area affected, the fire velocity and speed, the wind direction, and provide advice to the firefighters regarding the optimal way of fighting the fire. Often time forest fires destroy the communication infrastructure, so the airplane has a router to enable firefighters to exchange, text and voice information.},

abstract={This article proposes a visual navigation framework for the aerial recovery of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The framework is employed for pose estimation between the drogue and the probe to guide the recovery UAV to safely dock with the drogue. First, a deep learning-based detector and the proposed adaptive region of interest (AROI) tracker give the region of interest (ROI) of the drogue at high speed. Second, the centroids of the markers installed on the ring of the drogue can be extracted by image processing of the ROI, which can effectively reduce the computational overhead and the noise impact from other irrelevant areas. To improve the robustness of the framework, a marker compensation method is proposed to address situations of occlusion. After all the centroid coordinates in the image are obtained, stereo vision is employed to measure the drogue pose. Then, a Kalman filter (KF) is applied to accurately estimate the drogue pose. Finally, a ground semiphysical closed-loop experiment of the docking phase of aerial recovery is developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experimental results show that our framework has high accuracy, strong robustness, and good real-time performance.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which are at the forefront of cutting-edge technology, have unmatched potential for pioneering applications in a wide range of disciplines. In particular, in the field of cognitive radio (CR), which is a key aspect in the implementation of the new 5G telecommunication technology. The integration between the drone and CR consolidates the drone’s capabilities at the heart of the remarkably promising Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology supported by CR. The highly dynamic network topologies, weakly networked communication links, reliable line-of-sight (LOS) communication links, and orbital or flight paths are characteristic features of UAV communication compared to terrestrial wireless networks. Nevertheless, the implementation of this system is constrained by several severe challenges, such as energy efficiency, battery power limitation, spectrum handover, propagation channel modeling, routing protocols, security policy, and delay setbacks. In this paper, we consider the impact of energy scarcity faced by the UAV in various CR applications. We also analyze the impact of energy scarcity on communication-based applications and present the general problem of battery limitation. Finally, we give an overview and comparison between recent solutions proposed by researchers both in the field of communication and based on batteries, and consider possible future directions according to the state of the art, such as novel Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and machine learning (ML).},

This survey aims to provide a literature review on combining MBC techniques with ANNs for UAV flight control, with the goal of laying the foundation for efficient controller designs with performance guarantees.

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been intensively used in various fields thanks to their excellent maneuverability. However, the short operation time of the UAV is limiting the further utilization of the UAV. The limitation of the UAV can be overcome by landing on ground vehicles and charging the battery on them. Therefore, diverse researches have been done on robust landing on ground platforms. Unfortunately, the existing autonomous landing methods have such limitations that a) special tag or marker should be attached on the landing site; b) visibility of the landing site must be secured; c) platform should be static; In this paper, to robustly estimate the relative pose of the moving platform and successfully land on it, we propose a novel robust landing system of the UAV. A neural network based object detection is used to recognize the landing site without a special tag or marker, and an Ultra-wideband (UWB) sensor is adopted to compensate for the limited field of view of the camera. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for estimating the relative position of the moving platform by fusing the information obtained from various sensors is developed. Additionally, a robust autonomous landing controller is also designed. The performance of the proposed method is verified by the simulation of the UAV and the moving platform.},

abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming the first-class solution for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) applications, especially for tiny, resource-constrained, nano-UAVs, with a few tens of grams in weight and subten centimeters in diameter. DNN visual pipelines have been proven capable of delivering high intelligence aboard nanoUAVs, efficiently exploiting novel multi-core microcontroller units. However, one severe limitation of this class of solutions is the generalization challenge, i.e., the visual cues learned on the specific training domain hardly predict with the same accuracy on different ones. Ultimately, it results in very limited applicability of State-of-the-Art (SoA) autonomous navigation DNNs outside controlled environments. In this work, we tackle this problem in the context of the human pose estimation task with a SoA vision-based DNN [1]. We propose a novel methodology that leverages synthetic domain randomization by applying a simple but effective image background replacement technique to augment our training dataset. Our results demonstrate how the augmentation forces the learning process to focus on what matters most: the pose of the human subject. Our approach reduces the DNN’s mean square error — vs. a non-augmented baseline — by up to 40%, on a never-seen-before testing environment. Since our methodology tackles the DNN’s training stage, the improved generalization capabilities come at zero-cost for the computational/memory burdens aboard the nano-UAV.},

abstract={Personal monitoring devices such as cyclist helmet cameras to record accidents or dash cams to catch collisions have proliferated, with more companies producing smaller and compact recording gadgets. As these devices are becoming a part of citizens' everyday arsenal, concerns over the residents' privacy are progressing. Therefore, this paper presents SASSL, a secure aerial surveillance drone using split learning to classify whether there is a presence of a fire on the streets. This innovative split learning method transfers CCTV footage captured with a drone to a nearby server to run a deep neural network to detect a fire's presence in real-time without exposing the original data. We devise a scenario where surveillance UAVs roam around the suburb, recording any unnatural behavior. The UAV can process the recordings through its on-mobile deep neural network system or transfer the information to a server. Due to resource limitations of mobile UAVs, the UAV does not have the capacity to run an entire deep neural network on its own. This is where the split learning method comes in handy. The UAV runs the deep neural network only up to the first hidden layer and sends only the feature map to the cloud server, where the rest of the deep neural network is processed. By ensuring that the learning process is divided between the UAV and the server, the privacy of raw data is secured while the UAV does not overexert its minimal resources.},

abstract={This article considers the decentralized fractional-order fault-tolerant control problem for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) against wind disturbances and actuator faults in a directed communication network. A new composite adaptive disturbance observer-based decentralized fractional-order fault-tolerant control (CADOB-DFO-FTC) scheme, which incorporates fractional-order (FO) sliding-mode surfaces, nonlinear disturbance observers (NDOs), fuzzy wavelet neural networks (FWNNs), and robust controllers, is developed to achieve the attitude tracking control of networked UAVs in a decentralized way. Based on the FO sliding-mode surfaces, the NDOs are first developed to estimate the lumped uncertainties due to the aerodynamic parameter perturbations, wind disturbances, and actuator faults. Then, adaptive FWNNs with updating weighting matrices, mean vectors, and deviation vectors are constructed to effectively attenuate the adverse effects induced by the NDO estimation errors. Furthermore, to compensate the FWNN approximation errors, robust controllers are integrated into the developed control scheme to enhance the approximation abilities. It is shown that by using Lyapunov methods, all UAVs can track their attitude references. Finally, comparative simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={As a result of the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), large volumes of aerial videos have been produced. It is unrealistic for humans to screen such big data and understand the contents. Hence, methodological research on the automatic understanding of UAV videos is of paramount importance (Figure 1). In this article, we introduce a novel problem of event recognition in unconstrained aerial videos in the remote sensing community and present the large-scale, human-annotated Event Recognition in Aerial Videos (ERA) data set, consisting of 2,864 videos, each with a label from 25 different classes corresponding to an event unfolding for five seconds. All these videos are collected from YouTube. The ERA data set is designed to have significant intraclass variation and interclass similarity and captures dynamic events in various circumstances and at dramatically various scales. Moreover, to offer a benchmark for this task, we extensively validate existing deep networks. We expect that the ERA data set will facilitate further progress in automatic aerial video comprehension.

The basic principle of the concept relies on the selection of the most appropriate data processing algorithm available on board. To facilitate the determination of the most effective algorithm, performance models are used to predict the expected suitability of each algorithm for the given environmental conditions. Modeling the relation between the environmental state and the performance of the algorithms is achieved by two approaches leveraging expert knowledge and machine learning methods.

abstract={Although Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) have been proven to be a very powerful tool in deep learning-based image segmentation, they are still too computationally expensive to be incorporated into mobile platforms such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for real-time performance. While significant efforts have been made to make the encoder side of a FCN more efficient, the decoder side, which involves upsampling the feature maps, is still overlooked in comparison. This paper proposes two new efficient upsampling techniques, “Reversed Depthwise Separable Transposed Convolution (RDSTC)” and “Compression-Expansion Transposed Convolution (CETC)”. U-Net architecture and UAV-captured forest pile fire images have been used to evaluate the performance of these new efficient upsampling techniques. RDSTC and CETC achieve Dice scores of 0.8815 and 0.8832 respectively, outperforming commonly used bilinear interpolation and original transposed convolution, while significantly reducing the number of upsampling computations. The results of this paper demonstrate that upsampling operation in a deep learning architecture can be made more efficient without degradation in performance.},

abstract={In recent years, popularity of unmanned air vehicles enormously increased due to their autonomous moving capability and applications in various domains. This also results in some serious security threats, that needs proper investigation and timely detection of the amateur drones (ADr) to protect the security sensitive institutions. In this paper, we propose the novel machine learning (ML) framework for detection and classification of ADr sounds out of the various sounds like bird, airplanes, and thunderstorm in the noisy environment. To extract the necessary features from ADr sound, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and linear predictive cepstral coefficients (LPCC) feature extraction techniques are implemented. After feature extraction, support vector machines (SVM) with various kernels are adopted to accurately classify these sounds. The experimental results verify that SVM cubic kernel with MFCC outperform LPCC method by achieving around 96.7% accuracy for ADr detection. Moreover, the results verified that the proposed ML scheme has more than 17% detection accuracy, compared with correlation-based drone sound detection scheme that ignores ML prediction.},

Both the dataset and benchmark are made publicly available to the vision community on our website to advance research in the area of object detection from UAVs.},

abstract={Deploying aerial base stations (AeBSs) has been regarded as an effective solution to wireless network capacity enhancement in specific areas with excessive traffic burden but insufficient capacity. Since the traffic distributions in wireless networks tend to be ever-changing, the deployed AeBS need to adjust its position to rapidly and continuously adapt to the drifting capacity enhancement demands, which is difficult to handle with traditional optimization methods due to high computational complexity and poor scalability. In this paper, we design a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based 3D AeBS deployment algorithm with the goal of maximizing the system throughput, which is able to make decisions in dynamic environments and conducts in a distributed manner. Additionally, in order to address the interference issue between multiple AeBSs, we adopt the Coordinated Multiple Points Transmission (CoMP) in the air-to-ground communication and propose a clustering algorithm to form groups of AeBSs for cooperative communication based on the network interference characteristics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach has significant throughput gains over conventional schemes without CoMP, and that the proposed multi-agent deep Q network (MADQN) is more efficient than centralized DQN in deriving the solution.},

abstract={This paper investigates an air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing system, which is deployed by an infrastructure provider (InP). Under a business agreement with the InP, a third-party service provider provides computing services to the subscribed mobile users (MUs). MUs compete for the shared spectrum and computing resources over time to achieve their distinctive goals. From the perspective of an MU, we deliberately define the age of update to capture the staleness of information from refreshing computation outcomes. Given the system dynamics, we model the interactions among MUs as a stochastic game. In the Nash equilibrium without cooperation, each MU behaves in accordance with the local system states and conjectures. We can hence transform the stochastic game into a single-agent Markov decision process. As another major contribution, we develop an online deep reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that adopts two separate double deep Q-networks to approximate the Q-factor and the post-decision Q-factor, respectively. The deep RL scheme allows each MU to optimize the behaviours with unknown dynamic statistics. Numerical experiments show that our proposed scheme outperforms the baselines in terms of the average utility under various system conditions.},

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is able to learn patterns in sequences. In this letter, we propose a syntactic approach to represent visual patterns as sequences of symbols, and we use an LSTM as a classifier to learn the relationship between the symbols in sequences. An extensive experimental evaluation using aerial images from a soybean field captured by unmanned aerial vehicles has been conducted to compare our method with two deep learning architectures, one syntactic method, and one shallow learning algorithm. The results achieved by the proposed method maintain stability even when trained on small data sets, suggesting that representing visual patterns in a compositional way, repeating primitives, may be a viable alternative when there are only a limited number of samples for training.},

abstract={On-board processing elements on UAVs are currently inadequate for training and inference of Deep Neural Networks. This is largely due to the energy consumption of memory accesses in such a network. HadaNets introduce a flexible train-from-scratch tensor quantization scheme by pairing a full precision tensor to a binary tensor in the form of a Hadamard product. Unlike wider reduced precision neural network models, we preserve the train-time parameter count, thus out-performing XNOR-Nets without a train-time memory penalty. Such training routines could see great utility in semi-supervised online learning tasks. Our method also offers advantages in model compression, as we reduce the model size of ResNet-18 by 7.43× with respect to a full precision model without utilizing any other compression techniques. We also demonstrate a 'Hadamard Binary Matrix Multiply' kernel, which delivers a 10-fold increase in performance over full precision matrix multiplication with a similarly optimized kernel.},

abstract={Batch-normalization (BN) layers are thought to be an integrally important layer type in today's state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks for computer vision tasks such as classification and detection. However, BN layers introduce complexity and computational overheads that are highly undesirable for training and/or inference on low-power custom hardware implementations of real-time embedded vision systems such as UAVs, robots and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. They are also problematic when batch sizes need to be very small during training, and innovations such as residual connections introduced more recently than BN layers could potentially have lessened their impact. In this paper we aim to quantify the benefits BN layers offer in image classification networks, in comparison with alternative choices. In particular, we study networks that use shifted-ReLU layers instead of BN layers. We found, following experiments with wide residual networks applied to the ImageNet, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 image classification datasets, that BN layers do not consistently offer a significant advantage. We found that the accuracy margin offered by BN layers depends on the data set, the network size, and the bit-depth of weights. We conclude that in situations where BN layers are undesirable due to speed, memory or complexity costs, that using shifted-ReLU layers instead should be considered; we found they can offer advantages in all these areas, and often do not impose a significant accuracy cost.},

In this paper, we propose recently introduced bare bones fireworks algorithm for static drone placement in the wireless sensor networks. The proposed algorithm was tested in two different scenarios, with randomly deployed and clustered sensors. The obtained results indicate suitability of the proposed bare bones fireworks algorithm for aerial base station placement.},

abstract={The increasing number of skyscrapers along with the large number of tall bridges throughout the world also increases the demand of a robust, automated and remotely controlled health monitoring system for civil architectures. It is very difficult and sometimes not feasible to inspect the structures whose heights are beyond the limit of an average traditional structure of the same type. Therefore, in this paper an unmanned aerial vehicle is utilized to provide real time images of the structural site. A gradient of temporal range of images is used for such applications but the uncertainties caused by the camera locations make it quite difficult to evaluate the images from a same position on the structure to reveal any apparent structural damage. These images are, therefore, pre-processed for registration and are then classified automatically. A Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) based feature detection algorithm is the heart of the scheme presented here in order to determine its performance in image registration and classification for civil structures. Also, the damage detection has been shown, which is achieved using the complete algorithm presented here.},

abstract={Accidents often occur at sea, so effective maritime search and rescue is essential. In the current process of sea search and rescue, the operation efficiency of large search and rescue equipment is low and it cannot provide stable communication link. In this article, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are used to form a cognitive mobile computing network for co-operative search and rescue, and reinforcement learning (RL) is used to plan search path and improve communication throughput. Based on the scene of marine search and rescue, the grid method is used to model the search and rescue area. Meanwhile, an intragroup communication architecture based on UAVs and USVs is designed to assist intragroup communication by recognizing the link channel state between UAVs. Search and rescue path planning is carried out through the strategy iteration of Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, distributed RL is used to recognize the channel state and perform mobile computing, so as to optimize the data throughput in the communication group. The simulation results show that we have successfully completed the path planning task. Compared with conventional methods, RL based on different reward functions has better throughput performance under the same number of UAVs auxiliary communications.},

abstract={The autonomy of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) - self-governing in the aerospace discipline has been a remarkable research area with the development of the advanced bespoke microcontrollers embedded with advanced AI techniques for the last several decades. The road forward about the operational environment is certain about the swarms of fully automated UAVs (FAUAVs), that is, urban areas. FAUAVs with self-learning and self-decision-making abilities by executing non-trivial sequences of events with decimetre-level accuracy based on a set of rules, control loops and constraints using dynamic flight plans and trajectories are taking their indispensable parts within smart cities (SCs). Therefore, their integration with the SC components using real-time data analytics is urgent. This is mainly required to establish a better swarm intelligence along with a safer and optimised harmonious smart ecosystem that enables cooperative FAUAV-SC automation systems with collaborative automated intelligence engaging in the concepts of Internet of Everything (IoE) and Automation of Everything (AoE). Planning the future of cities with swarms of FAUAVs is explored in this paper to optimise the use of FAUAVs with a diverse range of applications and a contemporary methodology is proposed using a holistic framework - FAUAVinSCF equipped with various effective and efficient techniques along with a novel FAUAV routing technique customisable to the constraints of FAUAVs and urban areas. With the methodology, the components of SC and FAUAVs involving recent and impending technological advancements are moulded together to make this inevitable transformation a harmonious part of the inhabitants contributing to the cities' liveability and sustainability. The framework consists of a decentralized agent-based control architecture that monitors and controls the swarms of resource-constraint FAUAVs for their real-time requirements in optimising their urban uses. The outcomes of the methodology suggest that the constraints of FAUAVs can be mitigated significantly in urban areas and consequently, their efficacy can be increased in realising their diverse range of missions.},

abstract={Driving distraction is a main human factor of traffic accidents. Distraction would seriously affect the drivers’ cognitive process, inducing the inability to fully perceive the surrounding environment, make the correct judgments and perform the proper operations in time. It is important to identify the drivers’ attentional state accurately and quickly during the driving process. The objective of this study was to develop a novel driving distraction detection method based on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. A simultaneous driving and distraction experiment was designed, in which the alternative secondary tasks with a 2-back paradigm were utilized to induce the visual or auditory distraction. The EEG signals of 22 subjects were analysed to distinguish the focused state of the driver from distraction. Results indicated that the proposed method based on EEGNet and long short-term memory (LSTM) provided an average classification accuracy of 71.1% in three-class classification. Reducing the number of the electrodes from 63 to 14 would not significantly reduce the accuracy so that a higher model efficiency could be obtained.},

abstract={Recently, much progress has been made in using Neural Networks (NNs) for important yet narrowly focused tasks such as image classification (e.g., VGG-Net, ResNet), playing complex games like GO or other Computer Vision (CV) tasks. While these achievements are impressive, they are either achieved on computers with virtually unlimited resources or with little regard to real-time actionability. In this paper, we propose to combine the ubiquity of low-resource mobile devices, e.g., drones, with approximate- and distributed-computing techniques in order to make these NN techniques deployable on resource-constrained devices as well as to provide realtime information about the environment. We target situational awareness, which involves sensing the crucial factors in a new environment on a real-time basis. Specifically, we introduce intelligence to a team of drones in the form of real-time detection of a suspect/weapon using local resources and suspect identification in an emergency situation. We validate our proposed methods using Microsoft AirSim simulator via both simulations and hardware-in-the-loop emulations.},

In most developing countries, rural areas lack adequate medical facilities and medical staff for effective diagnosis and treatment. Recently, there have been several technological advancements across various engineering disciplines such as the Internet of Things, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, deep neural networks (DNNs), and intelligent robots. This work proposes a prototype that integrates these technologies to develop a payload deployable in a drone to help in providing rapid testing and healthcare. The proposed UAV prototype combines secure patient authentication, an automated disinfection system, and medical sensors as part of the UAV payload. It uses a DNN model for real-time COVID-19 detection.

pages={299-311},
abstract={Inferring behavior model of a running software system is quite useful for several automated software engineering tasks, such as program comprehension, anomaly detection, and testing. Most existing dynamic model inference techniques are white-box, i.e., they require source code to be instrumented to get run-time traces. However, in many systems, instrumenting the entire source code is not possible (e.g., when using black-box third-party libraries) or might be very costly. Unfortunately, most black-box techniques that detect states over time are either univariate, or make assumptions on the data distribution, or have limited power for learning over a long period of past behavior. To overcome the above issues, in this paper, we propose a hybrid deep neural network that accepts as input a set of time series, one per input/output signal of the system, and applies a set of convolutional and recurrent layers to learn the non-linear correlations between signals and the patterns, over time. We have applied our approach on a real UAV auto-pilot solution from our industry partner with half a million lines of C code. We ran 888 random recent system-level test cases and inferred states, over time. Our comparison with several traditional time series change point detection techniques showed that our approach improves their performance by up to 102%, in terms of finding state change points, measured by F1 score. We also showed that our state classification algorithm provides on average 90.45% F1 score, which improves traditional classification algorithms by up to 17%.},

abstract={Current autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving cars, autonomous drones, consumer robots, etc.) can already perform a wide variety of tasks and are predicted to be able to collaboratively assist humans in the near future. Thus, the need for efficient human-robot interaction (HRI) methods is greatly increasing. Gesture recognition is an effective HRI approach, since many robots are equipped with cameras and computer vision algorithms have progressed significantly in recent years, with advanced Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) being able to be executed on-board an autonomous system. However, computational/memory limitations are still significant for embedded AI methods, rendering the increase of DNN accuracy without imposing a penalty on runtime requirements a very important research priority. This paper investigates self-supervised DNN pretraining for a novel pretext task, relying on spatiotemporal video frame compression via tensor decomposition and low-rank approximation, as a means to augment gesture recognition performance, without inducing any runtime overhead during the inference stage. Thus, the method permits the use of less complex and much faster neural architectures that are well-suited to robotics applications and HRI. Quantitative evaluation on a gesture recognition dataset for autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) handling demonstrates the effectiveness and real-time performance of the proposed method on embedded AI compute hardware.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems are used in many areas of human life. But people do not pay enough attention to ensuring the security of these systems. As a result of the resulting security gaps, an attacker can launch an attack, not only shutting down the system, but also having some negative impact on the environment. The article examines denial of service attacks in ad-hoc networks, conducts experiments and considers the consequences of their successful execution. As a result of the research, it was determined that an attack can be detected by changes in transmitted traffic and processor load. The cyber-physical system operates on stable algorithms, and even if legal changes occur, they can be easily distinguished from those caused by the attack. The article shows that the use of statistical methods for analyzing traffic and other parameters can be justified for detecting an attack. This study shows that each attack affects traffic in its own way and creates unique patterns of behavior change. The experiments were carried out according to methodology with changings in the intensity of the attacks, with a change in normal behavior. The results of this study can further be used to implement a system for detecting attacks on cyber-physical systems. The collected datasets can be used to train the neural network.},

abstract={Lodging, the permanent bending over of food crops, leads to poor plant growth and development. Consequently, lodging results in reduced crop quality, lowers crop yield, and makes harvesting difficult. Plant breeders routinely evaluate several thousand breeding lines, and therefore, automatic lodging detection and prediction is of great value aid in selection. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture for lodging classification using five spectral channel orthomosaic images from canola and wheat breeding trials. Also, using transfer learning, we trained 10 lodging detection models using well-established deep convolutional neural network architectures. Our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art lodging detection methods in the literature that use only handcrafted features. In comparison to 10 DCNN lodging detection models, our proposed model achieves comparable results while having a substantially lower number of parameters. This makes the proposed model suitable for applications such as real-time classification using inexpensive hardware for high-throughput phenotyping pipelines.

abstract={Wireless and mobile technologies, as well as their users, are growing rapidly as the Internet of Things (IoT) products, such as sensor-network technologies, mobile devices, and supporting applications, become widely dispersed. Owing to the dynamic changes in the wireless networks and the exponential growth of the IoT products, which make it difficult to locate large quantities of users and devices, providing accurate tracking and trajectory predictions in open and highly condensed wireless networks is extremely difficult. An adaptive and scalable system is required to offer accurate location-based services (LBSs) for the success of IoT. To enhance the attainment of IoT, we propose a hybrid of principal component analysis (PCA) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithms for mobility predictions in a wireless urban area. During the system development processes, we first collect an LTE signal from three unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs), the Wi-Fi signal strength from each reachable Wi-Fi access points (APs), and channel information from the Wi-Fi signal media. We then apply PCA to reduce the number of Wi-Fi features and to decrease signal noise. Next, we train the GRU algorithm to develop models that can predict the mobility of IoT device users. Finally, we evaluate the tracking and trajectory models. To evaluate the proposed techniques, we compare the common parameters of the GRU with those of other deep learning types. The proposed technique provides plausible and state-of-the-art results for mobility predictions of IoT devices in a wireless environment.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a large-scale hurricane Michael dataset for visual perception in disaster scenarios, and analyze state-of-the-art deep neural network models for semantic segmentation. The dataset consists of around 2000 high-resolution aerial images, with annotated ground-truth data for semantic segmentation. We discuss the challenges of the dataset and train the state-of-the-art methods on this dataset to evaluate how well these methods can recognize the disaster situations. Finally, we discuss challenges for future research.},

abstract={Multirotor helicopter have generated much interest in recent years as a powerful tool both for civil and military applications. The trajectory of the aircraft is controlled by modifying the angular velocity of the rotors. Among different control techniques the PID controller finds great application due to its simplicity. It uses proportional, integral and derivative regulator to control one or more input signal. In this paper a novel real-time system, based on a real-time Neural Network, is presented to propose an alternative control technique to the PID. In order to prove the validity of the proposed approach simulations are performed through a real experimental test-bed.},
