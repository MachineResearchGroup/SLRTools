ABSTRACT = {Deep Learning (DL) has been recently introduced into the hyperspectral and multispectral image classification landscape. Despite the success of DL in the remote sensing field, DL models are computationally intensive due to the large number of parameters they need to learn. The high density of information present in remote sensing imagery with high spectral resolution can make the application of DL models to large scenes challenging. Methods such as patch-based classification require large amounts of data to be processed during the training and prediction stages, which translates into long processing times and high energy consumption. One of the solutions to decrease the computational cost of these models is to perform segment-based classification. Segment-based classification schemes can significantly decrease training and prediction times, and also offer advantages over simply reducing the size of the training datasets by randomly sampling training data. The lack of a large enough number of samples can, however, pose an additional challenge, causing these models to not generalize properly. Data augmentation methods are used to generate new synthetic samples based on existing data to increase the classification performance. In this work, we propose a new data augmentation scheme using data imputation and matrix completion methods for segment-based classification. The proposal has been validated using two high-resolution multispectral datasets from the literature. The results obtained show that the proposed approach successfully increases the classification performance across all the scenes tested and that data imputation methods applied to multispectral imagery are a valid means to perform data augmentation. A comparison of classification accuracy between different imputation methods applied to the proposed scheme was also carried out.},

ABSTRACT = {Misappropriation of public lands is an ongoing government concern. In Brazil, the beach zone is public property, but many private establishments use it for economic purposes, requiring constant inspection. Among the undue targets, the individual mapping of straw beach umbrellas (SBUs) attached to the sand is a great challenge due to their small size, high presence, and agglutinated appearance. This study aims to automatically detect and count SBUs on public beaches using high-resolution images and instance segmentation, obtaining pixel-wise semantic information and individual object detection. This study is the first instance segmentation application on coastal areas and the first using WorldView-3 (WV-3) images. We used the Mask-RCNN with some modifications: (a) multispectral input for the WorldView3 imagery (eight channels), (b) improved the sliding window algorithm for large image classification, and (c) comparison of different image resizing ratios to improve small object detection since the SBUs are small objects (&lt;322 pixels) even using high-resolution images (31 cm). The accuracy analysis used standard COCO metrics considering the original image and three scale ratios (2&times;, 4&times;, and 8&times; resolution increase). The average precision (AP) results increased proportionally to the image resolution: 30.49% (original image), 48.24% (2&times;), 53.45% (4&times;), and 58.11% (8&times;). The 8&times; model presented 94% AP50, classifying nearly all SBUs correctly. Moreover, the improved sliding window approach enables the classification of large areas providing automatic counting and estimating the size of the objects, proving to be effective for inspecting large coastal areas and providing insightful information for public managers. This remote sensing application impacts the inspection cost, tribute, and environmental conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweighting is a design strategy to reduce energy consumption through the reduction of mass of a product. Lightweighting can be applied to machine tools to reduce the amount of energy consumed during the use phase. Thus, the energy cost of machine operation will be reduced. One might also hypothesize that since a lighter-weight machine tool requires less material to build, the cost to produce such a machine will be less. However, it may also be the case that lightweighting a machine tool increases its complexity, which will likely drive up the cost to manufacture the machine. To explore the cost drivers associated with building a machine tool, data on the features associated with a wide variety of vertical milling machine tools are collected. Then, empirical cost models are fit to this data. The results from the cost models show that the machine tool mass is a significant cost driver; other key drivers are the number of axes and spindle power. The models are used to predict the cost benefits of lightweighting in terms of mass, which are compared to potential increased manufacturing costs associated with complexities introduced due to lightweighting.},

ABSTRACT = {Detection and assessment of cracks in civil engineering structures such as roads, bridges, dams and pipelines are crucial tasks for maintaining the safety and cost-effectiveness of those concrete structures. With the recent advances in machine learning, the development of ANN- and CNN-based algorithms has become a popular approach for the automated detection and identification of concrete cracks. However, most of the proposed models are trained on images taken in ideal conditions and are only capable of achieving high accuracy when applied to the concrete images devoid of irregular illumination conditions, shadows, shading, blemishes, etc. An overview of challenges related to the automatic detection of concrete cracks in the presence of shadows is presented in this paper. In particular, difficulties associated with the application of deep learning-based methods for the classification of concrete images with shadows are demonstrated. Moreover, the limitations of the shadow removal techniques for the improvement of the crack detection accuracy are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services (ES), including temperature regulation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Interest in ES has increased amongst policymakers, scientists, and citizens given the extent and growth of urbanized areas globally. However, the methods and techniques used to properly assess biodiversity and ES provided by vegetation in urban environments, at large scales, are insufficient. Individual tree identification and characterization are some of the most critical issues used to evaluate urban biodiversity and ES, given the complex spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas and the scarcity or complete lack of systematized urban tree inventories at large scales, e.g., at the regional or national levels. This often limits our knowledge on their contributions toward shaping biodiversity and ES in urban areas worldwide. This paper provides an analysis of the state-of-the-art studies and was carried out based on a systematic review of 48 scientific papers published during the last five years (2016&ndash;2020), related to urban tree and greenery characterization, remote sensing techniques for tree identification, processing methods, and data analysis to classify and segment trees. In particular, we focused on urban tree and forest characterization using remotely sensed data and identified frontiers in scientific knowledge that may be expanded with new developments in the near future. We found advantages and limitations associated with both data sources and processing methods, from which we drew recommendations for further development of tree inventory and characterization in urban forestry science. Finally, a critical discussion on the current state of the methods, as well as on the challenges and directions for future research, is presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Reliable detection of underground infrastructure is essential for infrastructure modernization works, the implementation of BIM technology, and 3D cadasters. This requires shortening the time of data interpretation and the automation of the stage of selecting the objects. The main factor that influences the quality of radargrams is noise. The paper presents the method of data filtration with use of wavelet analyses and Gabor filtration. The authors were inspired to conduct the research by the fact that the interpretation and analysis of radargrams is time-consuming and by the wish to improve the accuracy of selection of the true objects by inexperienced operators. The authors proposed automated methods for the detection and classification of hyperboles in GPR images, which include the data filtration, detection, and classification of objects. The proposed object classification methodology based on the analytic hierarchy process method introduces a classification coefficient that takes into account the weights of the proposed conditions and weights of the coefficients. The effectiveness and quality of detection and classification of objects in radargrams were assessed. The proposed methods make it possible to shorten the time of the detection of objects. The developed hyperbola classification coefficients show promising results of the detection and classification of objects.},

ABSTRACT = {Northern leaf blight (NLB) is a serious disease in maize which leads to significant yield losses. Automatic and accurate methods of quantifying disease are crucial for disease identification and quantitative assessment of severity. Leaf images collected with natural backgrounds pose a great challenge to the segmentation of disease lesions. To address these problems, we propose an image segmentation method based on YOLACT++ with an attention module for segmenting disease lesions of maize leaves in natural conditions in order to improve the accuracy and real-time ability of lesion segmentation. The attention module is equipped on the output of the ResNet-101 backbone and the output of the FPN. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art disease lesion-segmentation methods. The proposed method achieved 98.71% maize leaf lesion segmentation precision, a comprehensive evaluation index of 98.36%, and a mean Intersection over Union of 84.91%; the average processing time of a single image was about 31.5 ms. The results show that the proposed method allows for the automatic and accurate quantitative assessment of crop disease severity in natural conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Linear approximate segmentation and data compression of moving target spatio-temporal trajectory can reduce data storage pressure and improve the efficiency of target motion pattern mining. High quality segmentation and compression need to accurately select and store as few points as possible that can reflect the characteristics of the original trajectory, while the existing methods still have room for improvement in segmentation accuracy, reduction of compression rate and simplification of algorithm parameter setting. A trajectory segmentation and compression algorithm based on particle swarm optimization is proposed. First, the trajectory segmentation problem is transformed into a global intelligent optimization problem of segmented feature points, which makes the selection of segmented points more accurate; then, a particle update strategy combining neighborhood adjustment and random jump is established to improve the efficiency of segmentation and compression. Through experiments on a real data set and a maneuvering target simulation trajectory set, the results show that compared with the existing typical methods, this method has advantages in segmentation accuracy and compression rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Driving in an adverse rain environment is a crucial challenge for vision-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in the automotive industry. The vehicle windshield wiper removes adherent raindrops that cause distorted images from in-vehicle frontal view cameras, but, additionally, it causes an occlusion that can hinder visibility at the same time. The wiper-occlusion causes erroneous judgments by vision-based applications and endangers safety. This study proposes behind-the-scenes (BTS) that detects and removes wiper-occlusion in real-time image inputs under rainy weather conditions. The pixel-wise wiper masks are detected by high-pass filtering to predict the optical flow of a sequential image pair. We fine-tuned a deep learning-based optical flow model with a synthesized dataset, which was generated with pseudo-ground truth wiper masks and flows using auto-labeling with acquired real rainy images. A typical optical flow dataset with static synthetic objects is synthesized with real fast-moving objects to enhance data diversity. We annotated wiper masks and scenes as detection ground truths from the collected real images for evaluation. BTS outperforms by achieving a 0.962 SSIM and 91.6% F1 score in wiper mask detection and 88.3% F1 score in wiper image detection. Consequently, BTS enhanced the performance of vision-based image restoration and object detection applications by canceling occlusions and demonstrated it potential role in improving ADAS under rainy weather conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in remote sensing image analysis (RSIA). Fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the task of semantic segmentation of natural scene images. However, due to distinctive differences between natural scene images and remotely-sensed (RS) images, FCN-based semantic segmentation methods from the field of computer vision cannot achieve promising performances on RS images without modifications. In previous work, we proposed an RS image semantic segmentation framework SDFCNv1, combined with a majority voting postprocessing method. Nevertheless, it still has some drawbacks, such as small receptive field and large number of parameters. In this paper, we propose an improved semantic segmentation framework SDFCNv2 based on SDFCNv1, to conduct optimal semantic segmentation on RS images. We first construct a novel FCN model with hybrid basic convolutional (HBC) blocks and spatial-channel-fusion squeeze-and-excitation (SCFSE) modules, which occupies a larger receptive field and fewer network model parameters. We also put forward a data augmentation method based on spectral-specific stochastic-gamma-transform-based (SSSGT-based) during the model training process to improve generalizability of our model. Besides, we design a mask-weighted voting decision fusion postprocessing algorithm for image segmentation on overlarge RS images. We conducted several comparative experiments on two public datasets and a real surveying and mapping dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with the SDFCNv1 framework, our SDFCNv2 framework can increase the mIoU metric by up to 5.22% while only using about half of parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in search and rescue methods include the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to carry out aerial monitoring of terrains to spot lost individuals. To date, such searches have been conducted by human observers who view UAV-acquired videos or images. Alternatively, lost persons may be detected by automated algorithms. Although some algorithms are implemented in software to support search and rescue activities, no successful rescue case using automated human detectors has been reported on thus far in the scientific literature. This paper presents a report from a search and rescue mission carried out by Bieszczady Mountain Rescue Service near the village of Cergowa in SE Poland, where a 65-year-old man was rescued after being detected via use of SARUAV software. This software uses convolutional neural networks to automatically locate people in close-range nadir aerial images. The missing man, who suffered from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (as well as a stroke the previous day) spent more than 24 h in open terrain. SARUAV software was allocated to support the search, and its task was to process 782 nadir and near-nadir JPG images collected during four photogrammetric flights. After 4 h 31 min of the analysis, the system successfully detected the missing person and provided his coordinates (uploading 121 photos from a flight over a lost person; image processing and verification of hits lasted 5 min 48 s). The presented case study proves that the use of an UAV assisted by SARUAV software may quicken the search mission.},

ABSTRACT = {Timely observations of nearshore water depths are important for a variety of coastal research and management topics, yet this information is expensive to collect using in situ survey methods. Remote methods to estimate bathymetry from imagery include using either ratios of multi-spectral reflectance bands or inversions from wave processes. Multi-spectral methods work best in waters with low turbidity, and wave-speed-based methods work best when wave breaking is minimal. In this work, we build on the wave-based inversion approaches, by exploring the use of a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) to infer nearshore bathymetry from imagery of the sea surface and local wave statistics. We apply transfer learning to adapt a CNN originally trained on synthetic imagery generated from a Boussinesq numerical wave model to utilize tower-based imagery collected in Duck, North Carolina, at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center&rsquo;s Field Research Facility. We train the model on sea-surface imagery, wave conditions, and associated surveyed bathymetry using three years of observations, including times with significant wave breaking in the surf zone. This is the first time, to the authors&rsquo; knowledge, an FCNN has been successfully applied to infer bathymetry from surf-zone sea-surface imagery. Model results from a separate one-year test period generally show good agreement with survey-derived bathymetry (0.37 m root-mean-squared error, with a max depth of 6.7 m) under diverse wave conditions with wave heights up to 3.5 m. Bathymetry results quantify nearshore bathymetric evolution including bar migration and transitions between single- and double-barred morphologies. We observe that bathymetry estimates are most accurate when time-averaged input images feature visible wave breaking and/or individual images display wave crests. An investigation of activation maps, which show neuron activity on a layer-by-layer basis, suggests that the model is responsive to visible coherent wave structures in the input images.},

ABSTRACT = {The brain&ndash;computer interface (BCI) is a mechanism for extracting information from the brain, with this information used for various applications. This study proposes a method to control an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying through a BCI system using the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) approach. The UAV&rsquo;s screen emits three frequencies for visual stimulation: 15, 23, and 31 Hz for the UAV&rsquo;s left-turn, forward-flight, and right-turn functions. Due to the requirement of immediate response to the UAV flight, this paper proposes a method to improve the accuracy rate and reduce the time required to correct instruction errors in the resolution of brainwave signals received by UAVs. This study tested ten subjects and verified that the proposed method has a 10% improvement inaccuracy. While the traditional method can take 8 s to correct an error, the proposed method requires only 1 s, making it more suitable for practical applications in UAVs. Furthermore, such a BCI application for UAV systems can achieve the same experience of using the remote control for physically challenged patients.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning (DL) has shown promising performances in various remote sensing applications as a powerful tool. To explore the great potential of DL in improving the accuracy of individual tree species (ITS) classification, four convolutional neural network models (ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-40) were employed to classify four tree species using the combined high-resolution satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR data. A total of 1503 samples of four tree species, including maple, pine, locust, and spruce, were used in the experiments. When both WorldView-2 and airborne LiDAR data were used, the overall accuracies (OA) obtained by ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-40 were 90.9%, 89.1%, 89.1%, and 86.9%, respectively. The OA of ResNet-18 was increased by 4.0% and 1.8% compared with random forest (86.7%) and support vector machine (89.1%), respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the size of input images impacted on the classification accuracy of ResNet-18. It is suggested that the input size of ResNet models can be determined according to the maximum size of all tree crown sample images. The use of LiDAR intensity image was helpful in improving the accuracies of ITS classification and atmospheric correction is unnecessary when both pansharpened WorldView-2 images and airborne LiDAR data were used.},

ABSTRACT = {Supported by the advances in rocket technology, companies like SpaceX and Amazon competitively have entered the satellite Internet business. These companies said that they could provide Internet service sufficiently to users using their communication resources. However, the Internet service might not be provided in densely populated areas, as the satellites coverage is broad but its resource capacity is limited. To offload the traffic of the densely populated area, we present an adaptable aerial access network (AAN), composed of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and federated reinforcement learning (FRL)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using the proposed system, UAVs could operate with relatively low computation resources than centralized coverage management systems. Furthermore, by utilizing FRL, the system could continuously learn from various environments and perform better with the longer operation times. Based on our proposed design, we implemented FRL, constructed the UAV-aided AAN simulator, and evaluated the proposed system. Base on the evaluation result, we validated that the FRL enabled UAV-aided AAN could operate efficiently in densely populated areas where the satellites cannot provide sufficient Internet services, which improves network performances. In the evaluations, our proposed AAN system provided about 3.25 times more communication resources and had 5.1% lower latency than the satellite-only AAN.},

ABSTRACT = {The leakage of hazardous gases and chemical vapors is considered one of the dangerous accidents that can occur in laboratories, workshops, warehouses, and industrial sites that use or store these substances. The early detection and alarming of hazardous gases and volatile chemicals are significant to keep the safety conditions for the people and life forms who are work in and live around these places. In this paper, we investigate the available mobile detection and alarming systems for toxic, hazardous gases and volatile chemicals, especially in the laboratory environment.

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, an adaptive sliding mode fault-tolerant control scheme based on prescribed performance control and neural networks is developed for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) quadrotor carrying a load to deal with actuator faults. First, a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) control strategy is presented. In virtue of the proposed strategy, fast convergence and high robustness can be guaranteed without stimulating chattering. Secondly, to obtain correct fault magnitudes and compensate the failures actively, a radial basis function neural network-based fault estimation scheme is proposed. By combining the proposed fault estimation strategy and the NFTSM controller, an active fault-tolerant control algorithm is established. Then, the uncertainties caused by load variation are explicitly considered and compensated by the presented adaptive laws. Moreover, by synthesizing the proposed sliding mode control and prescribed performance control (PPC), an output error transformation is defined to deal with state constraints and provide better tracking performance. From the Lyapunov stability analysis, the overall system is proven to be uniformly asymptotically stable. Finally, numerical simulation based on a quadrotor helicopter is carried out to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {Most existing Siamese trackers mainly use a pre-trained convolutional neural network to extract target features. However, due to the weak discrimination of the target and background information of pre-trained depth features, the performance of the Siamese tracker can be significantly degraded when facing similar targets or changes in target appearance. This paper proposes a multi-channel-aware and adaptive hierarchical deep features module to enhance the discriminative ability of the tracker. Firstly, through the multi-channel-aware deep features module, the importance values of feature channels are obtained from both the target details and overall information, to identify more important feature channels. Secondly, by introducing the adaptive hierarchical deep features module, the importance of each feature layer can be determined according to the response value of each frame, so that the hierarchical features can be integrated to represent the target, which can better adapt to changes in the appearance of the target. Finally, the proposed two modules are integrated into the Siamese framework for target tracking. The Siamese network used in this paper is a two-input branch symmetric neural network with two input branches, and they share the same weights, which are widely used in the field of target tracking. Experiments on some Benchmarks show that the proposed Siamese tracker has several points of improvement compared to the baseline tracker.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the complexity and danger of Mars&rsquo;s environment, traditional Mars unmanned ground vehicles cannot efficiently perform Mars exploration missions. To solve this problem, the DeepLabV3+/Efficientnet hybrid network is proposed and applied to the scene area judgment for the Mars unmanned vehicle system. Firstly, DeepLabV3+ is used to extract the feature information of the Mars image due to its high accuracy. Then, the feature information is used as the input for Efficientnet, and the categories of scene areas are obtained, including safe area, report area, and dangerous area. Finally, according to three categories, the Mars unmanned vehicle system performs three operations: pass, report, and send. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the DeepLabV3+/Efficientnet hybrid network in the scene area judgment. Compared with the Efficientnet network, the accuracy of the DeepLabV3+/Efficientnet hybrid network is improved by approximately 18% and reaches 99.84%, which ensures the safety of the exploration mission for the Mars unmanned vehicle system.},

ABSTRACT = {Visual odometry is the process of estimating incremental localization of the camera in 3-dimensional space for autonomous driving. There have been new learning-based methods which do not require camera calibration and are robust to external noise. In this work, a new method that do not require camera calibration called the &ldquo;windowed pose optimization network&rdquo; is proposed to estimate the 6 degrees of freedom pose of a monocular camera. The architecture of the proposed network is based on supervised learning-based methods with feature encoder and pose regressor that takes multiple consecutive two grayscale image stacks at each step for training and enforces the composite pose constraints. The KITTI dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method yielded rotational error of 3.12 deg/100 m, and the training time is 41.32 ms, while inference time is 7.87 ms. Experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method to other state-of-the-art related works which shows the novelty of the proposed technique.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, jellyfish outbreaks have frequently occurred in offshore areas worldwide, posing a significant threat to the marine fishery, tourism, coastal industry, and personal safety. Effective monitoring of jellyfish is a vital method to solve the above problems. However, the optical detection method for jellyfish is still in the primary stage. Therefore, this paper studies a jellyfish detection method based on convolution neural network theory and digital image processing technology. This paper studies the underwater image preprocessing algorithm because the quality of underwater images directly affects the detection results. The results show that the image quality is better after applying the three algorithms namely prior defogging, adaptive histogram equalization, and multi-scale retinal enhancement, which is more conducive to detection. We establish a data set containing seven species of jellyfishes and fish. A total of 2141 images are included in the data set. The YOLOv3 algorithm is used to detect jellyfish, and its feature extraction network Darknet53 is optimized to ensure it is conducted in real-time. In addition, we introduce label smoothing and cosine annealing learning rate methods during the training process. The experimental results show that the improved algorithms improve the detection accuracy of jellyfish on the premise of ensuring the detection speed. This paper lays a foundation for the construction of an underwater jellyfish optical imaging real-time monitoring system.},

ABSTRACT = {Extracting road information from high-resolution remote sensing images (HRI) can provide crucial geographic information for many applications. With the improvement of remote sensing image resolution, the image data contain more abundant feature information. However, this phenomenon also enhances the spatial heterogeneity between different types of roads, making it difficult to accurately discern the road and non-road regions using only spectral characteristics. To remedy the above issues, a novel residual attention and local context-aware network (RALC-Net) is proposed for extracting a complete and continuous road network from HRI. RALC-Net utilizes a dual-encoder structure to improve the feature extraction capability of the network, whose two different branches take different feature information as input data. Specifically, we construct the residual attention module using the residual connection that can integrate spatial context information and the attention mechanism, highlighting local semantics to extract local feature information of roads. The residual attention module combines the characteristics of both the residual connection and the attention mechanism to retain complete road edge information, highlight essential semantics, and enhance the generalization capability of the network model. In addition, the multi-scale dilated convolution module is used to extract multi-scale spatial receptive fields to improve the model&rsquo;s performance further. We perform experiments to verify the performance of each component of RALC-Net through the ablation study. By combining low-level features with high-level semantics, we extract road information and make comparisons with other state-of-the-art models. The experimental results show that the proposed RALC-Net has excellent feature representation ability and robust generalizability, and can extract complete road information from a complex environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Object detection on aerial and satellite imagery is an important tool for image analysis in remote sensing and has many areas of application. As modern object detectors require accurate annotations for training, manual and labor-intensive labeling is necessary. In situations where GPS coordinates for the objects of interest are already available, there is potential to avoid the cumbersome annotation process. Unfortunately, GPS coordinates are often not well-aligned with georectified imagery. These spatial errors can be seen as noise regarding the object locations, which may critically harm the training of object detectors and, ultimately, limit their practical applicability. To overcome this issue, we propose a co-correction technique that allows us to robustly train a neural network with noisy object locations and to transform them toward the true locations. When applied as a preprocessing step on noisy annotations, our method greatly improves the performance of existing object detectors. Our method is applicable in scenarios where the images are only annotated with points roughly indicating object locations, instead of entire bounding boxes providing precise information on the object locations and extents. We test our method on three datasets and achieve a substantial improvement (e.g., 29.6% mAP on the COWC dataset) over existing methods for noise-robust object detection.},

ABSTRACT = {In countries characterized by arid and semi-arid climates, a precise determination of soil moisture conditions on the field scale is critically important, especially in the first crop growth stages, to schedule irrigation and to avoid wasting water. The objective of this study was to apply the operative methodology that allowed surface soil moisture (SSM) content in a semi-arid environment to be estimated. SSM retrieval was carried out by combining two scattering models (IEM and WCM), supplied by backscattering coefficients at the VV polarization obtained from the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), a vegetation descriptor NDVI obtained from the optical sensor, among other essential parameters. The inversion of these models was performed by Neural Networks (NN). The combined models were calibrated by the Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data collected on bare soil, and in cereal, pea and onion crop fields. To retrieve SSM, these scattering models need accurate measurements of the roughness surface parameters, standard deviation of the surface height (hrms) and correlation length (L). This work used a photogrammetric acquisition system carried on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to reconstruct digital surface models (DSM), which allowed these soil roughness parameters to be acquired in a large portion of the studied fields. The obtained results showed that the applied improved methodology effectively estimated SSM on bare and cultivated soils in the principal early growth stages. The bare soil experimentation yielded an R2 = 0.74 between the estimated and observed SSMs. For the cereal field, the relation between the estimated and measured SSMs yielded R2 = 0.71. In the experimental pea fields, the relation between the estimated and measured SSMs revealed R2 = 0.72 and 0.78, respectively, for peas 1 and peas 2. For the onion experimentation, the highest R2 equaled 0.5 in the principal growth stage (leaf development), but the crop R2 drastically decreased to 0.08 in the completed growth phase. The acquired results showed that the applied improved methodology proves to be an effective tool for estimating the SSM on bare and cultivated soils in the principal early growth stages.},

ABSTRACT = {With possible new use cases and demanding requirements of future 5th generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks, the future of mobile communications sounds promising. However, the propagation medium has been considered a randomly acting agent between the transmitter and the receiver. With the advent of the digital age of wireless communications, the received signal quality is degrading due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding artifacts. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and assisted application areas. With the RIS, the network operators can control radio waves&rsquo; scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics by resolving the harmful properties of environmental wireless propagation. Further, the RIS can effectively control the wavefront, such as amplitude, phase, frequency, and even polarization, without requiring complex encoding, decoding, or radio wave processing techniques. Motivated by technological advances, the metasurfaces, reflectarrays, phase shift, and liquid crystals are potential candidates for implementing RIS. Thus, they can be considered the front runner for realizing the 5G and beyond network. Furthermore, the current research activities in the evolving field of wireless networks operated by RIS are reviewed and discussed thoroughly. Finally, to fully explore the potential of RISs in wireless networks, the fundamental research issues to be addressed have been discussed.},

How to efficiently and accurately identify crops in a timely manner by remote sensing in order to determine the crop planting area and its temporal&ndash;spatial dynamic change information is a core issue of monitoring crop growth and estimating regional crop yields. Based on hundreds of relevant documents from the past 25 years, in this paper, we summarize research progress in relation to farmland vegetation identification and classification by remote sensing. The classification and identification of farmland vegetation includes classification based on vegetation index, spectral bands, multi-source data fusion, artificial intelligence learning, and drone remote sensing. Representative studies of remote sensing methods are collated, the main content of each technology is summarized, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are analyzed. Current problems related to crop remote sensing identification are then identified and future development directions are proposed.},

ABSTRACT = {Crop monitoring is crucial to understand crop production changes, agronomic practice decision-support, pests/diseases mitigation, and developing climate change adaptation strategies. Banana, an important staple food and cash crop in East Africa, is threatened by Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) disease. Yet, there is no up-to-date information about the spatial distribution and extent of banana lands, especially in Rwanda, where banana plays a key role in food security and livelihood. Therefore, delineation of banana-cultivated lands is important to prioritize resource allocation for optimal productivity. We mapped the spatial extent of smallholder banana farmlands by acquiring and processing high-resolution (25 cm/px) multispectral unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) imageries, across four villages in Rwanda. Georeferenced ground-truth data on different land cover classes were combined with reflectance data and vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, and EVI2) and compared using pixel-based supervised multi-classifiers (support vector models-SVM, classification and regression trees-CART, and random forest&ndash;RF), based on varying ground-truth data richness. Results show that RF consistently outperformed other classifiers regardless of data richness, with overall accuracy above 95%, producer&rsquo;s/user&rsquo;s accuracies above 92%, and kappa coefficient above 0.94. Estimated banana farmland areal coverage provides concrete baseline for extension-delivery efforts in terms of targeting banana farmers relative to their scale of production, and highlights opportunity to combine UAV-derived data with machine-learning methods for rapid landcover classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Most algorithms for steering, obstacle avoidance, and moving object detection rely on accurate self-motion estimation, a problem animals solve in real time as they navigate through diverse environments. One biological solution leverages optic flow, the changing pattern of motion experienced on the eye during self-motion. Here I present ARTFLOW, a biologically inspired neural network that learns patterns in optic flow to encode the observer&rsquo;s self-motion. The network combines the fuzzy ART unsupervised learning algorithm with a hierarchical architecture based on the primate visual system. This design affords fast, local feature learning across parallel modules in each network layer. Simulations show that the network is capable of learning stable patterns from optic flow simulating self-motion through environments of varying complexity with only one epoch of training. ARTFLOW trains substantially faster and yields self-motion estimates that are far more accurate than a comparable network that relies on Hebbian learning. I show how ARTFLOW serves as a generative model to predict the optic flow that corresponds to neural activations distributed across the network.},

ABSTRACT = {Shrublands are the main vegetation component in the Gobi region and contribute considerably to its ecosystem. Accurately classifying individual shrub vegetation species to understand their spatial distributions and to effectively monitor species diversity in the Gobi ecosystem is essential. High-resolution remote sensing data create vegetation type inventories over large areas. However, high spectral similarity between shrublands and surrounding areas remains a challenge. In this study, we provide a case study that integrates object-based image analysis (OBIA) and the random forest (RF) model to classify shrubland species automatically. The Gobi region on the southern slope of the Tian Shan Mountains in Northwest China was analyzed using readily available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB imagery (1.5 cm spatial resolution). Different spectral and texture index images were derived from UAV RGB images as variables for species classification. Principal component analysis (PCA) extracted features from different types of variable sets (original bands, original bands + spectral indices, and original bands + spectral indices + texture indices). We tested the ability of several non-parametric decision tree models and different types of variable sets to classify shrub species. Moreover, we analyzed three main shrubland areas comprising different shrub species and compared the prediction accuracies of the optimal model in combination with different types of variable sets. We found that the RF model could generate higher accuracy compared with the other two models. The best results were obtained using a combination of the optimal variable set and the RF model with an 88.63% overall accuracy and 0.82 kappa coefficient. Integrating OBIA and RF in the species classification process provides a promising method for automatic mapping of individual shrub species in the Gobi region and can reduce the workload of individual shrub species classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Obtaining accurate forest coverage of tree species is an important basis for the rational use and protection of existing forest resources. However, most current studies have mainly focused on broad tree classification, such as coniferous vs. broadleaf tree species, and a refined tree classification with tree species information is urgently needed. Although airborne LiDAR data or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can be used to acquire tree information even at the single tree level, this method will encounter great difficulties when applied to a large area. Therefore, this study takes the eastern regions of the Qilian Mountains as an example to explore the possibility of tree species classification with satellite-derived images. We used Sentinel-2 images to classify the study area&rsquo;s major vegetation types, particularly four tree species, i.e., Sabina przewalskii (S.P.), Picea crassifolia (P.C.), Betula spp. (Betula), and Populus spp. (Populus). In addition to the spectral features, we also considered terrain and texture features in this classification. The results show that adding texture features can significantly increase the separation between tree species. The final classification result of all categories achieved an accuracy of 86.49% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.83. For trees, the classification accuracy was 90.31%, and their producer&rsquo;s accuracy (PA) and user&rsquo;s (UA) were all higher than 84.97%. We found that altitude, slope, and aspect all affected the spatial distribution of these four tree species in our study area. This study confirms the potential of Sentinel-2 images for the fine classification of tree species. Moreover, this can help monitor ecosystem biological diversity and provide references for inventory estimation.},

ABSTRACT = {Modern cities require a tighter integration with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for bringing new services to the citizens. The Smart City is the revolutionary paradigm aiming at integrating the ICT with the citizen life; among several urban services, transports are one of the most important in modern cities, introducing several challenges to the Smart City paradigm. In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of new vehicular applications and services, Edge Computing (EC) is one of the most promising technologies when integrated into the Vehicular Networks (VNs). EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units&mdash;RSUs, 5G Base Stations&mdash;5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage. In the recent past, several new aerial platforms with integrated EC facilities have been deployed for achieving global connectivity. Such air-based EC platforms can complement the ground-based EC facilities for creating a futuristic VN able to deploy several new applications and services. The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services. By exploiting most modern technologies, with particular attention towards network softwarization, vehicular edge computing, and machine learning, we propose here three possible layered air-ground EC-enabled VN scenarios. For each of the discussed scenarios, a list of the possible challenges is considered, as well possible solutions allowing to overcome all or some of the considered challenges. A proper comparison is also done, through the use of tables, where all the proposed scenarios, and the proposed solutions, are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Surface defect detection for printed circuit board (PCB) is indispensable for managing PCB production quality. However, automatic detection of PCB surface defects is still a challenging task because, even within the same category of surface defect, defects present great differences in morphology and pattern. Although many computer vision-based detectors have been established to handle these problems, current detectors struggle to achieve high detection accuracy, fast detection speed and low memory consumption simultaneously. To address those issues, we propose a cost-effective deep learning (DL)-based detector based on the cutting-edge YOLOv4 to detect PCB surface defect quickly and efficiently. The YOLOv4 is improved upon with respect to its backbone network and the activation function in its neck/prediction network. The improved YOLOv4 is evaluated with a customized dataset, collected from a PCB factory. The experimental results show that the improved detector achieved a high performance, scoring 98.64% on mean average precision (mAP) at 56.98 frames per second (FPS), outperforming the other compared SOTA detectors. Furthermore, the improved YOLOv4 reduced the parameter space of YOLOv4 from 63.96 M to 39.59 M and the number of multiply-accumulate operations (Madds) from 59.75 G to 26.15 G.},

ABSTRACT = {Assigning geospatial objects with specific categories at the pixel level is a fundamental task in remote sensing image analysis. Along with the rapid development of sensor technologies, remotely sensed images can be captured at multiple spatial resolutions (MSR) with information content manifested at different scales. Extracting information from these MSR images represents huge opportunities for enhanced feature representation and characterisation. However, MSR images suffer from two critical issues: (1) increased scale variation of geo-objects and (2) loss of detailed information at coarse spatial resolutions. To bridge these gaps, in this paper, we propose a novel scale-aware neural network (SaNet) for the semantic segmentation of MSR remotely sensed imagery. SaNet deploys a densely connected feature network (DCFFM) module to capture high-quality multi-scale context, such that the scale variation is handled properly and the quality of segmentation is increased for both large and small objects. A spatial feature recalibration (SFRM) module was further incorporated into the network to learn intact semantic content with enhanced spatial relationships, where the negative effects of information loss are removed. The combination of DCFFM and SFRM allows SaNet to learn scale-aware feature representation, which outperforms the existing multi-scale feature representation. Extensive experiments on three semantic segmentation datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SaNet in cross-resolution segmentation.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes a unique meta-heuristic technique for hybridizing bio-inspired heuristic algorithms. The technique is based on altering the state of agents using a logistic probability function that is dependent on an agent&rsquo;s fitness rank. An evaluation using two bio-inspired algorithms (bat algorithm (BA) and krill herd (KH)) and 12 optimization problems (cross-in-tray, rotated hyper-ellipsoid (RHE), sphere, sum of squares, sum of different powers, McCormick, Zakharov, Rosenbrock, De Jong No. 5, Easom, Branin, and Styblinski&ndash;Tang) is presented. Furthermore, an experimental evaluation of the proposed scheme using the industrial three-bar truss design problem is presented. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid scheme outperformed the baseline algorithms (mean rank for the hybrid BA-KH algorithm is 1.279 vs. 1.958 for KH and 2.763 for BA).},

ABSTRACT = {Mapping surface ceramics through systematic pedestrian archaeological survey is considered a consistent method to recover the cultural biography of sites within a micro-region. Archaeologists nowadays conduct surface survey equipped with navigation devices counting, documenting, and collecting surface archaeological potsherds within a set of plotted grids. Recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and image processing analysis can be utilised to support such surface archaeological investigations. In this study, we have implemented two different artificial intelligence image processing methods over two areas of interest near the present-day village of Kophinou in Cyprus, in the Xeros River valley. We have applied a random forest classifier through the Google Earth Engine big data cloud platform and a Single Shot Detector neural network in the ArcGIS Pro environment. For the first case study, the detection was based on red&ndash;green&ndash;blue (RGB) high-resolution orthophotos. In contrast, a multispectral camera covering both the visible and the near-infrared parts of the spectrum was used in the second area of investigation. The overall results indicate that such an approach can be used in the future as part of ongoing archaeological pedestrian surveys to detect scattered potsherds in areas of archaeological interest, even if pottery shares a very high spectral similarity with the surface.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid and accurate plant growth and biomass estimation is essential for formulating and implementing targeted forest cultivation measures. In this study, RGB-D imaging technology was used to obtain the RGB and depth imaging data for a Toona sinensis seedling canopy to estimate plant growth and aboveground biomass (AGB). Three hundred T. sinensis seedlings from 20 varieties were planted under five different drought stress treatments. The U-Net model was applied first to achieve highly accurate segmentation of plants from complex backgrounds. Simple linear regression (SLR) was used for plant height prediction, and the other three models, including multivariate linear (ML), random forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regression, were applied to predict the AGB and compared for optimal model selection. The results showed that the SLR model yields promising and reliable results for the prediction of plant height, with R2 and RMSE values of 0.72 and 1.89 cm, respectively. All three regression methods perform well in the prediction of AGB estimation. MLP yields the highest accuracy in predicting dry and fresh aboveground biomass compared to the other two regression models, with R2 values of 0.77 and 0.83, respectively. The combination of Gray, Green minus red (GMR) and Excess green index (ExG) was identified as the key predictor by RReliefF for predicting dry AGB. GMR was the most important in predicting fresh AGB. This study demonstrated that the merits of RGB-D and machine learning models are effective phenotyping techniques for plant height and AGB prediction, and can be used to assist dynamic responses to drought stress for breeding selection.},

ABSTRACT = {Illumination variations in non-atmospherically corrected high-resolution satellite (HRS) images acquired at different dates/times/locations pose a major challenge for large-area environmental mapping and monitoring. This problem is exacerbated in cases where a classification model is trained only on one image (and often limited training data) but applied to other scenes without collecting additional samples from these new images. In this research, by focusing on caribou lichen mapping, we evaluated the potential of using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) for the normalization of WorldView-2 (WV2) images of one area to a source WV2 image of another area on which a lichen detector model was trained. In this regard, we considered an extreme case where the classifier was not fine-tuned on the normalized images. We tested two main scenarios to normalize four target WV2 images to a source 50 cm pansharpened WV2 image: (1) normalizing based only on the WV2 panchromatic band, and (2) normalizing based on the WV2 panchromatic band and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance (SR) imagery. Our experiments showed that normalizing even based only on the WV2 panchromatic band led to a significant lichen-detection accuracy improvement compared to the use of original pansharpened target images. However, we found that conditioning the cGAN on both the WV2 panchromatic band and auxiliary information (in this case, Sentinel-2 SR imagery) further improved normalization and the subsequent classification results due to adding a more invariant source of information. Our experiments showed that, using only the panchromatic band, F1-score values ranged from 54% to 88%, while using the fused panchromatic and SR, F1-score values ranged from 75% to 91%.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide an intermediate scale of spatial and spectral data collection that yields increased accuracy and consistency in data collection for morphological and physiological traits than satellites and expanded flexibility and high-throughput compared to ground-based data collection. In this study, we used UAV-based remote sensing for automated phenotyping of field-grown switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a leading bioenergy feedstock. Using vegetation indices calculated from a UAV-based multispectral camera, statistical models were developed for rust disease caused by Puccinia novopanici, leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen, and lignin contents. For the first time, UAV remote sensing technology was used to explore the potentials for multiple traits associated with sustainable production of switchgrass, and one statistical model was developed for each individual trait based on the statistical correlation between vegetation indices and the corresponding trait. Also, for the first time, lignin content was estimated in switchgrass shoots via UAV-based multispectral image analysis and statistical analysis. The UAV-based models were verified by ground-truthing via correlation analysis between the traits measured manually on the ground-based with UAV-based data. The normalized difference red edge (NDRE) vegetation index outperformed the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for rust disease and nitrogen content, while NDVI performed better than NDRE for chlorophyll and lignin content. Overall, linear models were sufficient for rust disease and chlorophyll analysis, but for nitrogen and lignin contents, nonlinear models achieved better results. As the first comprehensive study to model switchgrass sustainability traits from UAV-based remote sensing, these results suggest that this methodology can be utilized for switchgrass high-throughput phenotyping in the field.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper represents how typical advanced engineering design can be structured using a set of parameters and objective functions corresponding to the nature of the problem. The set of parameters can be in different types, including integer, real, cyclic, combinatorial, interval, etc. Similarly, the objective function can be presented in various types including integer (discrete), float, and interval. The simulated annealing with crystallization heuristic can deal with all these combinations of parameters and objective functions when the crystallization heuristic presents a sensibility for real parameters. Herein, simulated annealing with the crystallization heuristic is enhanced by combining Bates and Gaussian distributions and by incorporating feedback strategies to emphasize exploration or refinement, or a combination of the two. The problems that are studied include solving an electrical impedance tomography problem with float parameters and a partially evaluated objective function represented by an interval requiring the solution of 32 sparse linear systems defined by the finite element method, as well as an airplane design problem with several parameters and constraints used to reduce the explored domain. The combination of the proposed feedback strategies and simulated annealing with the crystallization heuristic is compared with existing simulated annealing algorithms and their benchmark results are shown. The enhanced simulated annealing approach proposed herein showed better results for the majority of the studied cases.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of a massive number of smart devices capable of data collection, storage, processing, and communication. The adoption of the IoT has brought about tremendous innovation opportunities in industries, homes, the environment, and businesses. However, the inherent vulnerabilities of the IoT have sparked concerns for wide adoption and applications. Unlike traditional information technology (I.T.) systems, the IoT environment is challenging to secure due to resource constraints, heterogeneity, and distributed nature of the smart devices. This makes it impossible to apply host-based prevention mechanisms such as anti-malware and anti-virus. These challenges and the nature of IoT applications call for a monitoring system such as anomaly detection both at device and network levels beyond the organisational boundary. This suggests an anomaly detection system is strongly positioned to secure IoT devices better than any other security mechanism. In this paper, we aim to provide an in-depth review of existing works in developing anomaly detection solutions using machine learning for protecting an IoT system. We also indicate that blockchain-based anomaly detection systems can collaboratively learn effective machine learning models to detect anomalies.},

ABSTRACT = {A vision-based approach has been employed in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of bridge infrastructure. The approach has many advantages: non-contact, non-destructive, long-distance, high precision, immunity from electromagnetic interference, and multiple-target monitoring. This review aims to summarise the vision- and Digital Image Correlation (DIC)-based SHM methods for bridge infrastructure because of their strategic significance and security concerns. Four different bridge types were studied: concrete, suspension, masonry, and steel bridge. DIC applications in SHM have recently garnered attention in aiding to assess the bridges&rsquo; structural response mechanisms under loading. Different non-destructive diagnostics methods for SHM in civil infrastructure have been used; however, vision-based techniques like DIC were only developed over the last two decades, intending to facilitate damage detection in bridge systems with prompt and accurate data for efficient and sustainable operation of the bridge structure throughout its service life. Research works reviewed in this article demonstrated the DIC capability to detect damage such as cracks, spalling, and structural parameters such as deformation, strains, vibration, deflection, and rotation. In addition, the reviewed works indicated that the DIC as an efficient and reliable technique could provide sustainable monitoring solutions for different bridge infrastructures.},

ABSTRACT = {Cleaning is one of the fundamental tasks with prime importance given in our day-to-day life. Moreover, the importance of cleaning drives the research efforts towards bringing leading edge technologies, including robotics, into the cleaning domain. However, an effective method to assess the quality of cleaning is an equally important research problem to be addressed. The primary footstep towards addressing the fundamental question of &ldquo;How clean is clean&rdquo; is addressed using an autonomous cleaning-auditing robot that audits the cleanliness of a given area. This research work focuses on a novel reinforcement learning-based experience-driven dirt exploration strategy for a cleaning-auditing robot. The proposed approach uses proximal policy approximation (PPO) based on-policy learning method to generate waypoints and sampling decisions to explore the probable dirt accumulation regions in a given area. The policy network is trained in multiple environments with simulated dirt patterns. Experiment trials have been conducted to validate the trained policy in both simulated and real-world environments using an in-house developed cleaning audit robot called BELUGA.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters usually face problems such as complex environments, heterogeneous combat subjects, and realistic interference factors in the course of mission assignment. In order to reduce resource consumption and improve the task execution rate, it is very important to develop a reasonable allocation plan for the tasks. Therefore, this paper constructs a heterogeneous UAV multitask assignment model based on several realistic constraints and proposes an improved half-random Q-learning (HR Q-learning) algorithm. The algorithm is based on the Q-learning algorithm under reinforcement learning, and by changing the way the Q-learning algorithm selects the next action in the process of random exploration, the probability of obtaining an invalid action in the random case is reduced, and the exploration efficiency is improved, thus increasing the possibility of obtaining a better assignment scheme, this also ensures symmetry and synergy in the distribution process of the drones. Simulation experiments show that compared with Q-learning algorithm and other heuristic algorithms, HR Q-learning algorithm can improve the performance of task execution, including the ability to improve the rationality of task assignment, increasing the value of gains by 12.12%, this is equivalent to an average of one drone per mission saved, and higher success rate of task execution. This improvement provides a meaningful attempt for UAV task assignment.},

ABSTRACT = {With the proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide diverse critical services, such as surveillance, disaster management, and medicine delivery, the accurate detection of these small devices and the efficient classification of their flight modes are of paramount importance to guarantee their safe operation in our sky. Among the existing approaches, Radio Frequency (RF) based methods are less affected by complex environmental factors. The similarities between UAV RF signals and the diversity of frequency components make accurate detection and classification a particularly difficult task. To bridge this gap, we propose a joint Feature Engineering Generator (FEG) and Multi-Channel Deep Neural Network (MC-DNN) approach. Specifically, in FEG, data truncation and normalization separate different frequency components, the moving average filter reduces the outliers in the RF signal, and the concatenation fully exploits the details of the dataset. In addition, the multi-channel input in MC-DNN separates multiple frequency components and reduces the interference between them. A novel dataset that contains ten categories of RF signals from three types of UAVs is used to verify the effectiveness. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art UAV detection and classification approaches in terms of 98.4% and F1 score of 98.3%.},

ABSTRACT = {The availability of remote-sensing multisource data from optical-based satellite sensors has created new opportunities and challenges for forest monitoring in the Amazon Biome. In particular, change-detection analysis has emerged in recent decades to monitor forest-change dynamics, supporting some Brazilian governmental initiatives such as PRODES and DETER projects for biodiversity preservation in threatened areas. In recent years fully convolutional network architectures have witnessed numerous proposals adapted for the change-detection task. This paper comprehensively explores state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks such as U-Net, ResU-Net, SegNet, FC-DenseNet, and two DeepLabv3+ variants on monitoring deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. The networks&rsquo; performance is evaluated experimentally in terms of Precision, Recall, F1-score, and computational load using satellite images with different spatial and spectral resolution: Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. We also include the results of an unprecedented auditing process performed by senior specialists to visually evaluate each deforestation polygon derived from the network with the highest accuracy results for both satellites. This assessment allowed estimation of the accuracy of these networks simulating a process &ldquo;in nature&rdquo; and faithful to the PRODES methodology. We conclude that the high resolution of Sentinel-2 images improves the segmentation of deforestation polygons both quantitatively (in terms of F1-score) and qualitatively. Moreover, the study also points to the potential of the operational use of Deep Learning (DL) mapping as products to be consumed in PRODES.},

ABSTRACT = {The ability to classify drones using radar signals is a problem of great interest. In this paper, we apply convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms of the simulated radar signals reflected from the drones. The drones vary in many ways that impact the STFT spectrograms, including blade length and blade rotation rates. Some of these physical parameters are captured in the Martin and Mulgrew model which was used to produce the datasets. We examine the data under X-band and W-band radar simulation scenarios and show that a CNN approach leads to an F1 score of 0.816&plusmn;0.011 when trained on data with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB. The neural network which was trained on data from an X-band radar with 2 kHz pulse repetition frequency was shown to perform better than the CNN trained on the aforementioned W-band radar. It remained robust to the drone blade pitch and its performance varied directly in a linear fashion with the SNR.},

ABSTRACT = {Everyday there are more disasters that require Humanitarian Supply Chain (HSC) attention; generally these problems are difficult to solve in reasonable computational time and metaheuristics (MHs) are the indicated solution algorithms. To our knowledge, there has not been a review article on MHs applied to HSC. In this work, 78 articles were extracted from 2016 publications using systematic literature review methodology and were analyzed to answer two research questions: (1) How are the HSC problems that have been solved from Metaheuristics classified? (2) What is the gap found to accomplish future research in Metaheuristics in HSC? After classifying them into deterministic (52.56%) and non-deterministic (47.44%) problems; post-disaster (51.28%), pre-disaster (14.10%) and integrated (34.62%); facility location (41.03%), distribution (71.79%), inventory (11.54%) and mass evacuation (10.26%); single (46.15%) and multiple objective functions (53.85%), single (76.92%) and multiple (23.07%) period; and the type of Metaheuristic: Metaphor (71.79%) with genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization as the most used; and non-metaphor based (28.20%), in which search algorithms are mostly used; it is concluded that, to consider the uncertainty of the real context, future research should be done in non-deterministic and multi-period problems that integrate pre- and post-disaster stages, that increasingly include problems such as inventory and mass evacuation and in which new multi-objective MHs are tested.},

ABSTRACT = {Human poses and the behaviour estimation for different activities in (virtual reality/augmented reality) VR/AR could have numerous beneficial applications. Human fall monitoring is especially important for elderly people and for non-typical activities with VR/AR applications. There are a lot of different approaches to improving the fidelity of fall monitoring systems through the use of novel sensors and deep learning architectures; however, there is still a lack of detail and diverse datasets for training deep learning fall detectors using monocular images. The issues with synthetic data generation based on digital human simulation were implemented and examined using the Unreal Engine. The proposed pipeline provides automatic &ldquo;playback&rdquo; of various scenarios for digital human behaviour simulation, and the result of a proposed modular pipeline for synthetic data generation of digital human interaction with the 3D environments is demonstrated in this paper. We used the generated synthetic data to train the Mask R-CNN-based segmentation of the falling person interaction area. It is shown that, by training the model with simulation data, it is possible to recognize a falling person with an accuracy of 97.6% and classify the type of person&rsquo;s interaction impact. The proposed approach also allows for covering a variety of scenarios that can have a positive effect at a deep learning training stage in other human action estimation tasks in an VR/AR environment.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a fault-tolerant control (FTC) tactic using a sliding mode controller&ndash;observer method for uncertain and faulty robotic manipulators is proposed. First, a finite-time disturbance observer (DO) is proposed based on the sliding mode observer to approximate the lumped uncertainties and faults (LUaF). The observer offers high precision, quick convergence, low chattering, and finite-time convergence estimating information. Then, the estimated signal is employed to construct an adaptive non-singular fast terminal sliding mode control law, in which an adaptive law is employed to approximate the switching gain. This estimation helps the controller automatically adapt to the LUaF. Consequently, the combination of the proposed controller&ndash;observer approach delivers better qualities such as increased position tracking accuracy, reducing chattering effect, providing finite-time convergence, and robustness against the effect of the LUaF. The Lyapunov theory is employed to illustrate the robotic system&rsquo;s stability and finite-time convergence. Finally, simulations using a 2-DOF serial robotic manipulator verify the efficacy of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a lightweight channel-wise attention model is proposed for the real-time detection of five representative pig postures: standing, lying on the belly, lying on the side, sitting, and mounting. An optimized compressed block with symmetrical structure is proposed based on model structure and parameter statistics, and the efficient channel attention modules are considered as a channel-wise mechanism to improve the model architecture.The results show that the algorithm&rsquo;s average precision in detecting standing, lying on the belly, lying on the side, sitting, and mounting is 97.7%, 95.2%, 95.7%, 87.5%, and 84.1%, respectively, and the speed of inference is around 63 ms (CPU = i7, RAM = 8G) per postures image. Compared with state-of-the-art models (ResNet50, Darknet53, CSPDarknet53, MobileNetV3-Large, and MobileNetV3-Small), the proposed model has fewer model parameters and lower computation complexity. The statistical results of the postures (with continuous 24 h monitoring) show that some pigs will eat in the early morning, and the peak of the pig&rsquo;s feeding appears after the input of new feed, which reflects the health of the pig herd for farmers.},

ABSTRACT = {Safety issues related to the electrification of more electric aircraft (MEA) need to be addressed because of the increasing complexity of aircraft electrical power systems and the growing number of safety-critical sub-systems that need to be powered. Managing the energy storage systems and the flexibility in the load-side plays an important role in preserving the system&rsquo;s safety when facing an energy shortage. This paper presents a system-level centralized operation management strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) for MEA to schedule battery systems and exploit flexibility in the demand-side while satisfying time-varying operational requirements. The proposed online control strategy aims to maintain energy storage (ES) and prolong the battery life cycle, while minimizing load shedding, with fewer switching activities to improve devices lifetime and to avoid unnecessary transients. Using a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, different objective functions are proposed to realize the control targets, with soft constraints improving the feasibility of the model. In addition, an evaluation framework is proposed to analyze the effects of various objective functions and the prediction horizon on system performance, which provides the designers and users of MEA and other complex systems with new insights into operation management problem formulation.},

ABSTRACT = {It is imperative to find new places other than Earth for the survival of human beings. Mars could be the alternative to Earth in the future for us to live. In this context, many missions have been performed to examine the planet Mars. For such missions, planetary precision landing is a major challenge for the precise landing on Mars. Mars landing consists of different phases (hypersonic entry, parachute descent, terminal descent comprising gravity turn, and powered descent). However, the focus of this work is the powered descent phase of landing. Firstly, the main objective of this study is to minimize the landing error during the powered descend landing phase. The second objective involves constrained optimization in a predictive control framework for landing at non-cooperative sites. Different control algorithms like PID and LQR have been developed for the stated problem; however, the predictive control algorithm with constraint handling&rsquo;s ability has not been explored much. This research discusses the Model Predictive Control algorithm for the powered descent phase of landing. Model Predictive Control (MPC) considers input/output constraints in the calculation of the control law and thus it is very useful for the stated problem as shown in the results. The main novelty of this work is the implementation of Explicit MPC, which gives comparatively less computational time than MPC. A comparison is done among MPC variants in terms of feasibility, constraints handling, and computational time. Moreover, other conventional control algorithms like PID and LQR are compared with the proposed predictive algorithm. These control algorithms are implemented on quadrotor UAV (which emulates the dynamics of a planetary lander) to verify the feasibility through simulations in MATLAB.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces a new intelligent fault diagnosis method based on stack pruning sparse denoising autoencoder and convolutional neural network (sPSDAE-CNN). This method processes the original input data by using a stack denoising autoencoder. Different from the traditional autoencoder, stack pruning sparse denoising autoencoder includes a fully connected autoencoding network, the features extracted from the front layer of the network are used for the operation of the subsequent layer, which means that some new connections will appear between the front and rear layers of the network, reduce the loss of information, and obtain more effective features. Firstly, a one-dimensional sliding window is introduced for data enhancement. In addition, transforming one-dimensional time-domain data into the two-dimensional gray image can further improve the deep learning (DL) ability of models. At the same time, pruning operation is introduced to improve the training efficiency and accuracy of the network. The convolutional neural network model with sPSDAE has a faster training speed, strong adaptability to noise interference signals, and can also suppress the over-fitting problem of the convolutional neural network to a certain extent. Actual experiments show that for the fault of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) blade damage, the sPSDAE-CNN model we use has better stability and reliable prediction accuracy than traditional convolutional neural networks. At the same time, For noise signals, better results can be obtained. The experimental results show that the sPSDAE-CNN model still has a good diagnostic accuracy rate in a high-noise environment. In the case of a signal-to-noise ratio of &minus;4, it still has an accuracy rate of 90%.},

ABSTRACT = {Environmental conditions are very changeable; fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, illumination intensity, and other factors can decrease a plant productivity and crop. The remote sensing of plants under these conditions is the basis for the protection of plants and increases their survivability. This problem can be solved through measurements of plant reflectance and calculation of reflectance indices. Reflectance indices are related to the vegetation biomass, specific physiological processes, and biochemical compositions in plants; the indices can be used for both short-term and long-term plant monitoring. In our review, we considered the applications of reflectance indices in plant remote sensing. In Optical Methods and Platforms of Remote Sensing of Plants, we briefly discussed multi- and hyperspectral imaging, including descriptions of multispectral and hyperspectral cameras with different principles and their efficiency for the remote sensing of plants. In Main Reflectance Indices, we described the main reflectance indices, including vegetation, water, and pigment reflectance indices, as well as the photochemical reflectance index and its modifications. We focused on the relationships of leaf reflectance and reflectance indices to plant biomass, development, and physiological and biochemical characteristics. In Problems of Measurement and Analysis of Reflectance Indices, we discussed the methods of the correction of the reflectance indices that can be used for decreasing the influence of environmental conditions (mainly illumination, air, and soil) and plant characteristics (orientation of leaves, their thickness, and others) on their measurements and the analysis of the plant remote sensing. Additionally, the variability of plants was also considered as an important factor that influences the results of measurement and analysis.},

It also compares the processing speed of software and hardware-based expert systems, showing that hardware-based systems typically operate two orders of magnitude faster than the software ones. The potential applications that hardware-based expert systems can be used for and the capabilities that they can provide are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Oxytropis ochrocephala Bunge is an herbaceous perennial poisonous weed. It severely affects the production of local animal husbandry and ecosystem stability in the source region of Yellow River (SRYR), China. To date, however, the spatiotemporal distribution of O. ochrocephala is still unclear, mainly due to lack of high-precision observation data and effective methods at a regional scale. In this study, an efficient sampling method, based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), was proposed to supply basic sampling data for species distribution models (SDMs, BIOMOD in this study). A total of 3232 aerial photographs were obtained, from 2018 to 2020, in SRYR, and the potential and future distribution of O. ochrocephala were predicted by an ensemble model, consisting of six basic models of BIOMOD. The results showed that: (1) O. ochrocephala mainly distributed in the southwest, middle, and northeast of the SRYR, and the high suitable habitat of O. ochrocephala accounted for 3.19%; (2) annual precipitation and annual mean temperature were the two most important factors that affect the distribution of O. ochrocephala, with a cumulative importance of 60.45%; and (3) the distribution probability of O. ochrocephala tends to increase from now to the 2070s, while spatial distribution ranges will remain in the southwest, middle, and northeast of the SRYR. This study shows that UAVs can potentially be used to obtain the basic data for species distribution modeling; the results are both beneficial to establishing reasonable management practices and animal husbandry in alpine grassland systems.},

ABSTRACT = {With rapid advancements in remote sensing image registration algorithms, comprehensive imaging applications are no longer limited to single-modal remote sensing images. Instead, multi-modal remote sensing (MMRS) image registration has become a research focus in recent years. However, considering multi-source, multi-temporal, and multi-spectrum input introduces significant nonlinear radiation differences in MMRS images for which researchers need to develop novel solutions. At present, comprehensive reviews and analyses of MMRS image registration methods are inadequate in related fields. Thus, this paper introduces three theoretical frameworks: namely, area-based, feature-based and deep learning-based methods. We present a brief review of traditional methods and focus on more advanced methods for MMRS image registration proposed in recent years. Our review or comprehensive analysis is intended to provide researchers in related fields with advanced understanding to achieve further breakthroughs and innovations.},

ABSTRACT = {The three-area power system is widely considered a suitable example to test load frequency control of the distributed generation system. In this article, for such a system, for the power stabilization task, we introduce two controllers: Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), which is model-based, and Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC), which is data-based. The purpose is to compare the two approaches from the point of view of (i) ease of implementation and tuning, and (ii) robustness to changes in the model. The model, together with controls strategies, has been implemented in the MATLAB software. Then, it has been tested for different simulation scenarios, taking into account the disturbances and faulty tie-lines between areas. Various quality measures allow to compare the performance of each control strategy. The comparison in terms of parameter change and load disturbances prompt us to propose suitable metrics and advice notes on the application of each controller.},

ABSTRACT = {Solar energy is one of the most strategic energy sources for the world&rsquo;s economic development. This has caused the number of solar photovoltaic plants to increase around the world; consequently, they are installed in places where their access and manual inspection are arduous and risky tasks. Recently, the inspection of photovoltaic plants has been conducted with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Although the inspection with UAVs can be completed with a drone operator, where the UAV flight path is purely manual or utilizes a previously generated flight path through a ground control station (GCS). However, the path generated in the GCS has many restrictions that the operator must supply. Due to these restrictions, we present a novel way to develop a flight path automatically with coverage path planning (CPP) methods. Using a DL server to segment the region of interest (RoI) within each of the predefined PV plant images, three CPP methods were also considered and their performances were assessed with metrics. The UAV energy consumption performance in each of the CPP methods was assessed using two different UAVs and standard metrics. Six experiments were performed by varying the CPP width, and the consumption metrics were recorded in each experiment. According to the results, the most effective and efficient methods are the exact cellular decomposition boustrophedon and grid-based wavefront coverage, depending on the CPP width and the area of the PV plant. Finally, a relationship was established between the size of the photovoltaic plant area and the best UAV to perform the inspection with the appropriate CPP width. This could be an important result for low-cost inspection with UAVs, without high-resolution cameras on the UAV board, and in small plants.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the first complete approach to achieving environmental intelligence support in the management of vegetation within electrical power transmission corridors. Contrary to the related studies that focused on the mapping of power lines, together with encroaching vegetation risk assessment, we realised predictive analytics with vegetation growth simulation. This was achieved by following the JDL/DFIG data fusion model for complementary feature extraction from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) derived data products and auxiliary thematic maps that feed an ensemble regression model. The results indicate that improved vegetation growth prediction accuracy is obtained by segmenting training samples according to their contextual similarities that relate to their ecological niches. Furthermore, efficient situation assessment was then performed using a rasterised parametrically defined funnel-shaped volumetric filter. In this way, RMSE&asymp;1 m was measured when considering tree growth simulation, while a 0.37 m error was estimated in encroaching vegetation detection, demonstrating significant improvements over the field observations.},

ABSTRACT = {The inspection and maintenance tasks of electrical installations are very demanding. Nowadays, insulator cleaning is carried out manually by operators using scaffolds, ropes, or even helicopters. However, these operations involve potential risks for humans and the electrical structure. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to reduce the risk of these tasks is rising. This paper presents an UAV to autonomously clean insulators on power lines. First, an insulator detection and tracking algorithm has been implemented to control the UAV in operation. Second, a cleaning tool has been designed consisting of a pump, a tank, and an arm to direct the flow of cleaning liquid. Third, a vision system has been developed that is capable of detecting soiled areas using a semantic segmentation neuronal network, calculating the trajectory for cleaning in the image plane, and generating arm trajectories to efficiently clean the insulator. Fourth, an autonomous system has been developed to land on a charging pad to charge the batteries and potentially fill the tank with cleaning liquid. Finally, the autonomous system has been validated in a controlled outdoor environment.},

ABSTRACT = {The DEVS formalism has been recognized to support generic open architectures that allow incorporating multiple engineering domains within integrated simulation models. What is missing for accelerated adoption of DEVS-based methodology for intelligent cyberphysical system design is a set of building blocks and architectural patterns that can be replicated and reused in system development. As a start in this direction, this paper offers a notional architecture for intelligent hybrid cyberphysical system design and proceeds to focus on the decision layer to consider DEVS models for basic behaviors such as choice of alternatives, perception of temporal event relations, and recognition and generation of finite state languages cast into DEVS time segments. We proceed to describe a methodology to define DEVS-based building blocks and architectural patterns for design of systems employing fast, frugal, and accurate heuristics. We identify some elements of this kind and establish their status as minimal realizations of their defined behaviors. As minimal realizations such designs must ipso facto underlie any implementation of the same cognitive behaviors. We discuss architectures drawn from the cognitive science literature to show that the fundamental elements drawn from the fast, frugal, and accurate paradigm provide insights into intelligent hybrid cyberphysical system design. We close with open questions and research needed to confirm the proposed concepts.},

ABSTRACT = {The continuous development of intelligent video surveillance systems has increased the demand for enhanced vision-based methods of automated detection of anomalies within various behaviors found in video scenes. Several methods have appeared in the literature that detect different anomalies by using the details of motion features associated with different actions. To enable the efficient detection of anomalies, alongside characterizing the specificities involved in features related to each behavior, the model complexity leading to computational expense must be reduced. This paper provides a lightweight framework (LightAnomalyNet) comprising a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained using input frames obtained by a computationally cost-effective method. The proposed framework effectively represents and differentiates between normal and abnormal events. In particular, this work defines human falls, some kinds of suspicious behavior, and violent acts as abnormal activities, and discriminates them from other (normal) activities in surveillance videos. Experiments on public datasets show that LightAnomalyNet yields better performance comparative to the existing methods in terms of classification accuracy and input frames generation.},

ABSTRACT = {Current methods of broadcast herbicide application cause a negative environmental and economic impact. Computer vision methods, specifically those related to object detection, have been reported to aid in site-specific weed management procedures for targeted herbicide application within a field. However, a major challenge to developing a weed detection system is the requirement for a properly annotated database to differentiate between weeds and crops under field conditions. This research involved creating an annotated database of 374 red, green, and blue (RGB) color images organized into monocot and dicot weed classes. The images were acquired from corn and soybean research plots located in north-central Indiana using an unmanned aerial system (UAS) flown at 30 and 10 m heights above ground level (AGL). A total of 25,560 individual weed instances were manually annotated. The annotated database consisted of four different subsets (Training Image Sets 1&ndash;4) to train the You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3) deep learning model for five separate experiments. The best results were observed with Training Image Set 4, consisting of images acquired at 10 m AGL. For monocot and dicot weeds, respectively, an average precision (AP) score of 91.48 % and 86.13% was observed at a 25% IoU threshold (AP @ T = 0.25), as well as 63.37% and 45.13% at a 50% IoU threshold (AP @ T = 0.5). This research has demonstrated a need to develop large, annotated weed databases to evaluate deep learning models for weed identification under field conditions. It also affirms the findings of other limited research studies utilizing object detection for weed identification under field conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Crop growth and development is a dynamic and complex process, and the essence of yield formation is the continuous accumulation of photosynthetic products from multiple fertility stages. In this study, a new stacking method for integrating multiple growth stages information was proposed to improve the performance of the winter wheat grain yield (GY) prediction model. For this purpose, crop canopy hyperspectral reflectance and leaf area index (LAI) data were obtained at the jointing, flagging, anthesis and grain filling stages. In this case, 15 vegetation indices and LAI were used as input features of the elastic network to construct GY prediction models for single growth stage. Based on Stacking technique, the GY prediction results of four single growth stages were integrated to construct the ensemble learning framework. The results showed that vegetation indices coupled LAI could effectively overcome the spectral saturation phenomenon, the validated R2 of each growth stage was improved by 10%, 22.5%, 3.6% and 10%, respectively. The stacking method provided more stable information with higher prediction accuracy than the individual fertility results (R2 = 0.74), and the R2 of the model validation phase improved by 236%, 51%, 27.6%, and 12.1%, respectively. The study can provide a reference for GY prediction of other crops.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents a methodology to estimate the seven indicators of the Setting and Infrastructure criterion of the UI GreenMetric World University Ranking based on three-dimensional data from a point cloud taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This study also estimated the potential aerial biomass, C and CO2, stored in the green spaces of a university campus using photogrammetric data analyzed in a Geographic Information System (GIS). The method was based on isolating classified point clouds using digital surface models (DSMs) and ground control points (GCPs) considering the canopy height model (CHM), the allometric equation (DBH, p, h), the biomass conversion factor, and carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e). The results confirmed that the national models for estimating the potential C reserves in natural forests are very close to reality and that the open space and green areas available to people on campus are adequate. The use of photogrammetric data facilitated the estimation of UI GreenMetric indicators from a highly detailed, low-cost three-dimensional model. The results of a case study revealed that the campus assimilates the CO2 emissions it produces and generates a surplus.},

ABSTRACT = {Analysis of animal morphometrics can provide vital information regarding population dynamics, structure, and body condition of cetaceans. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become the primary tool to collect morphometric measurements on whales, whereas on free ranging small dolphins, have not yet been applied. This study assesses the feasibility of obtaining reliable body morphometrics from Australian snubfin (Orcaella heinsohni) and humpback dolphins (Sousa sahulensis) using images collected from UAVs. Specifically, using a dolphin replica of known size, we tested the effect of the altitude of the UAV and the position of the animal within the image frame on the accuracy of length estimates. Using linear mixed models, we further assessed the precision of the total length estimates of humpback and snubfin dolphins. The precision of length estimates on the replica increased by ~2% when images were sampled at 45&ndash;60 m compared with 15&ndash;30 m. However, the precision of total length estimates on dolphins was significantly influenced only by the degree of arch and edge certainty. Overall, we obtained total length estimates with a precision of ~3% and consistent with published data. This study demonstrates the reliability of using UAV based images to obtain morphometrics of small dolphin species, such as snubfin and humpback dolphins.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has changed the worldwide network of people, smart devices, intelligent things, data, and information as an emergent technology. IoT development is still in its early stages, and numerous interrelated challenges must be addressed. IoT is the unifying idea of embedding everything. The Internet of Things offers a huge opportunity to improve the world&rsquo;s accessibility, integrity, availability, scalability, confidentiality, and interoperability. However, securing the Internet of Things is a difficult issue. The IoT aims to connect almost everything within the framework of a common infrastructure. This helps in controlling devices and, will allow device status to be updated everywhere and at any time. To develop technology via IoT, several critical scientific studies and inquiries have been carried out. However, many obstacles and problems remain to be tackled in order to reach IoT&rsquo;s maximum potential. These problems and concerns must be taken into consideration in different areas of the IoT, such as implementation in remote areas, threats to the system, development support, social and environmental impacts, etc. This paper reviews the current state of the art in different IoT architectures, with a focus on current technologies, applications, challenges, IoT protocols, and opportunities. As a result, a detailed taxonomy of IoT is presented here which includes interoperability, scalability, security and energy efficiency, among other things. Moreover, the significance of blockchains and big data as well as their analysis in relation to IoT, is discussed. This article aims to help readers and researchers understand the IoT and its applicability to the real world.},

ABSTRACT = {Although great success has been achieved in instance segmentation, accurate segmentation of instances remains difficult, especially at object edges. This problem is more prominent for instance segmentation in remote sensing imagery due to the diverse scales, variable illumination, smaller objects, and complex backgrounds. We find that most current instance segmentation networks do not consider the segmentation difficulty of different instances and different regions within the instance. In this paper, we study this problem and propose an ensemble method to segment instances from remote sensing images, considering the enhancement of hard-to-segment instances and instance edges. First, we apply a pixel-level Dice metric that reliably describes the segmentation quality of each instance to achieve online hard instance learning. Instances with low Dice values are studied with emphasis. Second, we generate a penalty map based on the analysis of boundary shapes to not only enhance the edges of objects but also discriminatively strengthen the edges of different shapes. That is, different areas of an object, such as internal areas, flat edges, and sharp edges, are distinguished and discriminatively weighed. Finally, the hard-to-segment instance learning and the shape-penalty map are integrated for precise instance segmentation. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method, we train with the classic instance segmentation network Mask R-CNN and conduct experiments on two different types of remote sensing datasets: the iSAID-Reduce100 and the JKGW_WHU datasets, which have extremely different feature distributions and spatial resolutions. The comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed method improved the segmentation results by 2.78% and 1.77% in mask AP on the iSAID-Reduce100 and JKGW_WHU datasets, respectively. We also test other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that focus on inaccurate edges. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms these methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent technological developments in the primary sector and machine learning algorithms allow the combined application of many promising solutions in precision agriculture. For example, the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) and ResNet Deep Learning architecture provide high-precision real-time identifications of objects. The advent of datasets from different perspectives provides multiple benefits, such as spheric view of objects, increased information, and inference results from multiple objects detection per image. However, it also raises crucial obstacles such as total identifications (ground truths) and processing concerns that can lead to devastating consequences, including false-positive detections with other erroneous conclusions or even the inability to extract results. This paper introduces experimental results from the machine learning algorithm (Yolov5) on a novel dataset based on perennial fruit crops, such as sweet cherries, aiming to enhance precision agriculture resiliency. Detection is oriented on two points of interest: (a) Infected leaves and (b) Infected branches. It is noteworthy that infected leaves or branches indicate stress, which may be due to either a stress/disease (e.g., Armillaria for sweet cherries trees, etc.) or other factors (e.g., water shortage, etc). Correspondingly, the foliage of a tree shows symptoms, while this indicates the stages of the disease.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning applications are becoming more ubiquitous in dairy farming decision support applications in areas such as feeding, animal husbandry, healthcare, animal behavior, milking and resource management. Thus, the objective of this mapping study was to collate and assess studies published in journals and conference proceedings between 1999 and 2021, which applied machine learning algorithms to dairy farming-related problems to identify trends in the geographical origins of data, as well as the algorithms, features and evaluation metrics and methods used. This mapping study was carried out in line with PRISMA guidelines, with six pre-defined research questions (RQ) and a broad and unbiased search strategy that explored five databases. In total, 129 publications passed the pre-defined selection criteria, from which relevant data required to answer each RQ were extracted and analyzed. This study found that Europe (43% of studies) produced the largest number of publications (RQ1), while the largest number of articles were published in the Computers and Electronics in Agriculture journal (21%) (RQ2). The largest number of studies addressed problems related to the physiology and health of dairy cows (32%) (RQ3), while the most frequently employed feature data were derived from sensors (48%) (RQ4). The largest number of studies employed tree-based algorithms (54%) (RQ5), while RMSE (56%) (regression) and accuracy (77%) (classification) were the most frequently employed metrics used, and hold-out cross-validation (39%) was the most frequently employed evaluation method (RQ6). Since 2018, there has been more than a sevenfold increase in the number of studies that focused on the physiology and health of dairy cows, compared to almost a threefold increase in the overall number of publications, suggesting an increased focus on this subdomain. In addition, a fivefold increase in the number of publications that employed neural network algorithms was identified since 2018, in comparison to a threefold increase in the use of both tree-based algorithms and statistical regression algorithms, suggesting an increasing utilization of neural network-based algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate power load forecasting has an important impact on power systems. In order to improve the load forecasting accuracy, a new load forecasting model, VMD&ndash;CISSA&ndash;LSSVM, is proposed. The model combines the variational modal decomposition (VMD) data preprocessing method, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model. A multi-strategy improved chaotic sparrow search algorithm (CISSA) is proposed to address the shortcomings of the SSA algorithm, which is prone to local optima and a slow convergence. The initial population is generated using an improved tent chaotic mapping to enhance the quality of the initial individuals and population diversity. Second, a random following strategy is used to optimize the position update process of the followers in the sparrow search algorithm, balancing the local exploitation performance and global search capability of the algorithm. Finally, the Levy flight strategy is used to expand the search range and local search capability. The results of the benchmark test function show that the CISSA algorithm has a better search accuracy and convergence performance. The volatility of the original load sequence is reduced by using VMD. The optimal parameters of the LSSVM are optimized by the CISSA. The simulation test results demonstrate that the VMD&ndash;CISSA&ndash;LSSVM model has the highest prediction accuracy and stabler prediction results.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a set of different search strategies for locating submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) are investigated. This set includes pre-defined path planning (PPP), adapted random walk (RW), particle swarm optimisation (PSO), inertia Levy-flight (ILF), self-organising-migration-algorithm (SOMA), and bumblebee search algorithm (BB). The influences of self-localisation and communication errors and limited travel distance of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) on the performance of the proposed algorithms are investigated. This study shows that the proposed search strategies could not outperform the classic search heuristic based on full coverage path planning if all AUVs followed the same search strategy. In this study, the influence of self-localisation and communication errors was investigated. The simulations showed that, based on the median error of the search runs, the performance of SOMA was in the same order of magnitude regardless the strength of the localisation error. Furthermore, it was shown that the performance of BB was highly affected by increasing localisation errors. From the simulations, it was revealed that all the algorithms, except for PSO and SOMA, were unaffected by disturbed communications. Here, the best performance was shown by PPP, followed by BB, SOMA, ILF, PSO, and RW. Furthermore, the influence of the limited travel distances of the AUVs on the search performance was evaluated. It was shown that all the algorithms, except for PSO, were affected by the shorter maximum travel distances of the AUVs. The performance of PPP increased with increasing maximum travel distances. However, for maximum travel distances &gt; 1800 m the median error appeared constant. The effect of shorter travel distances on SOMA was smaller than on PPP. For maximum travel distances &lt; 1200 m, SOMA outperformed all other strategies. In addition, it can be observed that only BB showed better performances for shorter travel distances than for longer ones. On the other hand, with different search strategies for each AUV, the search performance of the whole swarm can be improved by incorporating population-based search strategies such as PSO and SOMA within the PPP scheme. The best performance was achieved for the combination of two AUVs following PPP, while the third AUV utilised PSO. The best fitness of this combination was 15.9. This fitness was 26.4% better than the performance of PPP, which was 20.4 on average. In addition, a novel mechanism for dynamically selecting a search strategy for an AUV is proposed. This mechanism is based on fuzzy logic. This dynamic approach is able to perform at least as well as PPP and SOMA for different travel distances of AUVs. However, due to the better adaptation to the current situation, the overall performance, calculated based on the fitness achieved for different maximum travel distances, the proposed dynamic search strategy selection performed 32.8% better than PPP and 34.0% better than SOMA.},

ABSTRACT = {Citrus fruit detection can provide technical support for fine management and yield determination of citrus orchards. Accurate detection of citrus fruits in mountain orchards is challenging because of leaf occlusion and citrus fruit mutual occlusion of different fruits. This paper presents a citrus detection task that combines UAV data collection, AI embedded device, and target detection algorithm. The system used a small unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a camera to take full-scale pictures of citrus trees; at the same time, we extended the state-of-the-art model target detection algorithm, added the attention mechanism and adaptive fusion feature method, improved the model&rsquo;s performance; to facilitate the deployment of the model, we used the pruning method to reduce the amount of model calculation and parameters. The improved target detection algorithm is ported to the edge computing end to detect the data collected by the unmanned aerial vehicle. The experiment was performed on the self-made citrus dataset, the detection accuracy was 93.32%, and the processing speed at the edge computing device was 180 ms/frame. This method is suitable for citrus detection tasks in the mountainous orchard environment, and it can help fruit growers to estimate their yield.},

ABSTRACT = {Among natural disasters, earthquakes are recorded to have the highest rates of human loss in the past 20 years. Their unexpected nature has severe consequences on both human lives and material infrastructure, demanding urgent action to be taken. For effective emergency relief, it is necessary to gain awareness about the level of damage in the affected areas. The use of remotely sensed imagery is popular in damage assessment applications; however, it requires a considerable amount of labeled data, which are not always easy to obtain. Taking into consideration the recent developments in the fields of Machine Learning and Computer Vision, this study investigates and employs several Few-Shot Learning (FSL) strategies in order to address data insufficiency and imbalance in post-earthquake urban damage classification. While small datasets have been tested against binary classification problems, which usually divide the urban structures into collapsed and non-collapsed, the potential of limited training data in multi-class classification has not been fully explored. To tackle this gap, four models were created, following different data balancing methods, namely cost-sensitive learning, oversampling, undersampling and Prototypical Networks. After a quantitative comparison among them, the best performing model was found to be the one based on Prototypical Networks, and it was used for the creation of damage assessment maps. The contribution of this work is twofold: we show that oversampling is the most suitable data balancing method for training Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) when compared to cost-sensitive learning and undersampling, and we demonstrate the appropriateness of Prototypical Networks in the damage classification context.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (QUAVs) is a growing field due to their wide range of applications. QUAVs are complex nonlinear systems with a chaotic nature that require a controller with extended dynamics. PD and PID controllers can be successfully applied when the parameters are accurate. However, this parameterization process is complicated and time-consuming; most of the time, parameters are chosen by trial and error without guaranteeing good performance. The originality of this work is to present a novel nonlinear mathematical model with aerodynamic moments and forces in the Newton&ndash;Euler formulation, and identify metaheuristic algorithms applied to parameter optimization of compensated PD and PID controls for tracking the trajectories of a QUAV. Eight metaheuristic algorithms (PSO, GWO, HGS, LSHADE, LSPACMA, MPA, SMA and WOA) are reported, and RMSE is used to measure each dynamic performance of the simulations. For the PD control, the best performance is obtained with the HGS algorithm with an RMSE = 0.037247252379126. For the PID control, the best performance is obtained with the HGS algorithm with an RMSE = 0.032594309723623. Trajectory tracking was successful for the QUAV by minimizing the error between the desired and actual dynamics.},

ABSTRACT = {Chemical industrial parks, which act as critical infrastructures in many cities, need to be responsive to chemical gas leakage accidents. Once a chemical gas leakage accident occurs, risks of poisoning, fire, and explosion will follow. In order to meet the primary emergency response demands in chemical gas leakage accidents, source tracking technology of chemical gas leakage has been proposed and evolved. This paper proposes a novel method, Outlier Mutation Optimization (OMO) algorithm, aimed to quickly and accurately track the source of chemical gas leakage. The OMO algorithm introduces a random walk exploration mode and, based on Swarm Intelligence (SI), increases the probability of individual mutation. Compared with other optimization algorithms, the OMO algorithm has the advantages of a wider exploration range and more convergence modes. In the algorithm test session, a series of chemical gas leakage accident application examples with random parameters are first assumed based on the Gaussian plume model; next, the qualitative experiments and analysis of the OMO algorithm are conducted, based on the application example. The test results show that the OMO algorithm with default parameters has superior comprehensive performance, including the extremely high average calculation accuracy: the optimal value, which represents the error between the final objective function value obtained by the optimization algorithm and the ideal value, reaches 2.464e-15 when the number of sensors is 16; 2.356e-13 when the number of sensors is 9; and 5.694e-23 when the number of sensors is 4. There is a satisfactory calculation time: 12.743 s/50 times when the number of sensors is 16; 10.304 s/50 times when the number of sensors is 9; and 8.644 s/50 times when the number of sensors is 4. The analysis of the OMO algorithm&rsquo;s characteristic parameters proves the flexibility and robustness of this method. In addition, compared with other algorithms, the OMO algorithm can obtain an excellent leakage source tracing result in the application examples of 16, 9 and 4 sensors, and the accuracy exceeds the direct search algorithm, evolutionary algorithm, and other swarm intelligence algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Most 3D CityGML building models in street-view maps (e.g., Google, Baidu) lack texture information, which is generally used to reconstruct real-scene 3D models by photogrammetric techniques, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mapping. However, due to its simplified building model and inaccurate location information, the commonly used photogrammetric method using a single data source cannot satisfy the requirement of texture mapping for the CityGML building model. Furthermore, a single data source usually suffers from several problems, such as object occlusion. We proposed a novel approach to achieve CityGML building model texture mapping by multiview coplanar extraction from UAV remotely sensed or terrestrial images to alleviate these problems. We utilized a deep convolutional neural network to filter out object occlusion (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles, and trees) and obtain building-texture distribution. Point-line-based features are extracted to characterize multiview coplanar textures in 2D space under the constraint of a homography matrix, and geometric topology is subsequently conducted to optimize the boundary of textures by using a strategy combining Hough-transform and iterative least-squares methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach enables texture mapping for building fa&ccedil;ades to use 2D terrestrial images without the requirement of exterior orientation information; that is, different from the photogrammetric method, a collinear equation is not an essential part to capture texture information. In addition, the proposed approach can significantly eliminate blurred and distorted textures of building models, so it is suitable for automatic and rapid texture updates.},

ABSTRACT = {Multiple source satellite datasets, including the Gaofen (GF) series and Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral, are provided to detect and monitor the floods. Considering the complexity of land cover changes within the flooded areas and the different characteristics of the multi-source remote sensing dataset, we proposed a new coarse-to-fine framework for detecting floods at a large scale. Firstly, the coarse results of the water body were generated by the binary segmentation of GF-3 SAR, the water indexes of GF-1/6 multispectral, and Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral images. Secondly, the fine results were achieved by the deep neural networks with noisy-label learning. More specifically, the Unet with the T-revision is adopted as the noisy label learning method. The results demonstrated the reliability and accuracy of water mapping retrieved by the noisy learning method. Finally, the differences in flooding patterns in different regions were also revealed. We presented examples of Poyang Lake to show the results of our framework. The rapid and robust flood monitoring method proposed is of great practical significance to the dynamic monitoring of flood situations and the quantitative assessment of flood disasters based on multiple Chinese satellite datasets.},

ABSTRACT = {In low illumination situations, insufficient light in the monitoring device results in poor visibility of effective information, which cannot meet practical applications. To overcome the above problems, a detail preserving low illumination video image enhancement algorithm based on dark channel prior is proposed in this paper. First, a dark channel refinement method is proposed, which is defined by imposing a structure prior to the initial dark channel to improve the image brightness. Second, an anisotropic guided filter (AnisGF) is used to refine the transmission, which preserves the edges of the image. Finally, a detail enhancement algorithm is proposed to avoid the problem of insufficient detail in the initial enhancement image. To avoid video flicker, the next video frames are enhanced based on the brightness of the first enhanced frame. Qualitative and quantitative analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is superior to the contrast algorithm, in which the proposed algorithm ranks first in average gradient, edge intensity, contrast, and patch-based contrast quality index. It can be effectively applied to the enhancement of surveillance video images and for wider computer vision applications.},

ABSTRACT = {The scarcity of water for agricultural use is a serious problem that has increased due to intense droughts, poor management, and deficiencies in the distribution and application of the resource. The monitoring of crops through satellite image processing and the application of machine learning algorithms are technological strategies with which developed countries tend to implement better public policies regarding the efficient use of water. The purpose of this research was to determine the main indicators and characteristics that allow us to discriminate the phenological stages of maize crops (Zea mays L.) in Sentinel 2 satellite images through supervised classification models. The training data were obtained by monitoring cultivated plots during an agricultural cycle. Indicators and characteristics were extracted from 41 Sentinel 2 images acquired during the monitoring dates. With these images, indicators of texture, vegetation, and colour were calculated to train three supervised classifiers: linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbours (kNN) models. It was found that 45 of the 86 characteristics extracted contributed to maximizing the accuracy by stage of development and the overall accuracy of the trained classification models. The characteristics of the Moran&rsquo;s I local indicator of spatial association (LISA) improved the accuracy of the classifiers when applied to the L*a*b* colour model and to the near-infrared (NIR) band. The local binary pattern (LBP) increased the accuracy of the classification when applied to the red, green, blue (RGB) and NIR bands. The colour ratios, leaf area index (LAI), RGB colour model, L*a*b* colour space, LISA, and LBP extracted the most important intrinsic characteristics of maize crops with regard to classifying the phenological stages of the maize cultivation. The quadratic SVM model was the best classifier of maize crop phenology, with an overall accuracy of 82.3%.},

ABSTRACT = {A fire is an extraordinary event that can damage property and have a notable effect on people&rsquo;s lives. However, the early detection of smoke and fire has been identified as a challenge in many recent studies. Therefore, different solutions have been proposed to approach the timely detection of fire events and avoid human casualties. As a solution, we used an affordable visual detection system. This method is possibly effective because early fire detection is recognized. In most developed countries, CCTV surveillance systems are installed in almost every public location to take periodic images of a specific area. Notwithstanding, cameras are used under different types of ambient light, and they experience occlusions, distortions of view, and changes in the resulting images from different camera angles and the different seasons of the year, all of which affect the accuracy of currently established models. To address these problems, we developed an approach based on an attention feature map used in a capsule network designed to classify fire and smoke locations at different distances outdoors, given only an image of a single fire and smoke as input. The proposed model was designed to solve two main limitations of the base capsule network input and the analysis of large-sized images, as well as to compensate the absence of a deep network using an attention-based approach to improve the classification of the fire and smoke results. In term of practicality, our method is comparable with prior strategies based on machine learning and deep learning methods. We trained and tested the proposed model using our datasets collected from different sources. As the results indicate, a high classification accuracy in comparison with other modern architectures was achieved. Further, the results indicate that the proposed approach is robust and stable for the classification of images from outdoor CCTV cameras with different viewpoints given the presence of smoke and fire.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to realize the real-time and accurate detection of potted flowers on benches, in this paper we propose a method based on the ZED 2 stereo camera and the YOLO V4-Tiny deep learning algorithm for potted flower detection and location. First, an automatic detection model of flowers was established based on the YOLO V4-Tiny convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and the center points on the pixel plane of the flowers were obtained according to the prediction box. Then, the real-time 3D point cloud information obtained by the ZED 2 camera was used to calculate the actual position of the flowers. The test results showed that the mean average precision (MAP) and recall rate of the training model was 89.72% and 80%, respectively, and the real-time average detection frame rate of the model deployed under Jetson TX2 was 16 FPS. The results of the occlusion experiment showed that when the canopy overlap ratio between the two flowers is more than 10%, the recognition accuracy will be affected. The mean absolute error of the flower center location based on 3D point cloud information of the ZED 2 camera was 18.1 mm, and the maximum locating error of the flower center was 25.8 mm under different light radiation conditions. The method in this paper establishes the relationship between the detection target of flowers and the actual spatial location, which has reference significance for the machinery and automatic management of potted flowers on benches.},

ABSTRACT = {Manual inspection of infrastructure damages such as building cracks is difficult due to the objectivity and reliability of assessment and high demands of time and costs. This can be automated using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery of damages. Numerous computer vision-based approaches have been applied to address the limitations of crack detection but they have their limitations that can be overcome by using various hybrid approaches based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs), an application of the deep learning (DL) method, display remarkable potential for automatically detecting image features such as damages and are less sensitive to image noise. A modified deep hierarchical CNN architecture has been used in this study for crack detection and damage assessment in civil infrastructures. The proposed architecture is based on 16 convolution layers and a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). For this study, the crack images were collected using UAVs and open-source images of mid to high rise buildings (five stories and above) constructed during 2000 in Sydney, Australia. Conventionally, a CNN network only utilizes the last layer of convolution. However, our proposed network is based on the utility of multiple layers. Another important component of the proposed CNN architecture is the application of guided filtering (GF) and conditional random fields (CRFs) to refine the predicted outputs to get reliable results. Benchmarking data (600 images) of Sydney-based buildings damages was used to test the proposed architecture. The proposed deep hierarchical CNN architecture produced superior performance when evaluated using five methods: GF method, Baseline (BN) method, Deep-Crack BN, Deep-Crack GF, and SegNet. Overall, the GF method outperformed all other methods as indicated by the global accuracy (0.990), class average accuracy (0.939), mean intersection of the union overall classes (IoU) (0.879), precision (0.838), recall (0.879), and F-score (0.8581) values. Overall, the proposed CNN architecture provides the advantages of reduced noise, highly integrated supervision of features, adequate learning, and aggregation of both multi-scale and multilevel features during the training procedure along with the refinement of the overall output predictions.},

ABSTRACT = {Airport traffic flow prediction is a fundamental research topic in the field of air traffic flow management. Most existing works focus on the single airport traffic flow prediction with temporal dynamics but fail to consider the influence of the topological airport network. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based framework, called airport traffic flow prediction network (ATFPNet), is proposed to capture spatial-temporal dependencies of the historical airport traffic flow (departure and arrival) for the multiple-step situational (network-level) arrival flow prediction. Firstly, considering the nature of the airport distribution and the context of air transportation, a special semantic graph built on the flight schedule is applied to represent the airport network, which is the key to encoding the situational airport traffic flow into a single representation. Then, the graph convolution operator and the gated recurrent unit are combined to extract high-level transition patterns of airport traffic flow in the spatial and temporal dimensions. Finally, a real-world airport traffic flow dataset is applied to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and the experimental results demonstrate that the ATFPNet outperforms other baselines on different prediction horizons. Specifically, the proposed method achieves up to 17% MAE improvement compared to baselines. Based on the proposed approach, efficient traffic planning is expected to be achieved for airport management.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing number of severe storm events is threatening European forests. Besides the primary damages directly caused by storms, there are secondary damages such as bark beetle outbreaks and tertiary damages due to negative effects on the market. These subsequent damages can be minimized if a detailed overview of the affected area and the amount of damaged wood can be obtained quickly and included in the planning of clearance measures. The present work utilizes UAV-orthophotos and an adaptation of the U-Net architecture for the semantic segmentation and localization of windthrown stems. The network was pre-trained with generic datasets, randomly combining stems and background samples in a copy&ndash;paste augmentation, and afterwards trained with a specific dataset of a particular windthrow. The models pre-trained with generic datasets containing 10, 50 and 100 augmentations per annotated windthrown stems achieved F1-scores of 73.9% (S1Mod10), 74.3% (S1Mod50) and 75.6% (S1Mod100), outperforming the baseline model (F1-score 72.6%), which was not pre-trained. These results emphasize the applicability of the method to correctly identify windthrown trees and suggest the collection of training samples from other tree species and windthrow areas to improve the ability to generalize. Further enhancements of the network architecture are considered to improve the classification performance and to minimize the calculative costs.},

ABSTRACT = {The popularisation of aerial remote sensing using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), has boosted the capacities of agronomists and researchers to offer farmers valuable data regarding the status of their crops. This paper describes a methodology for the automated detection and individual delineation of tree crowns in aerial representations of crop fields by means of image processing and analysis techniques, providing accurate information about plant population and canopy coverage in intensive-farming orchards with a row-based plant arrangement. To that end, after pre-processing initial aerial captures by means of photogrammetry and morphological image analysis, a resulting binary representation of the land plot surveyed is treated at connected component-level in order to separate overlapping tree crown projections. Then, those components are morphologically transformed into a set of seeds with which tree crowns are finally delineated, establishing the boundaries between them when they appear overlapped. This solution was tested on images from three different orchards, achieving semantic segmentations in which more than 94% of tree canopy-belonging pixels were correctly classified, and more than 98% of trees were successfully detected when assessing the methodology capacities for estimating the overall plant population. According to these results, the methodology represents a promising tool for automating the inventorying of plants and estimating individual tree-canopy coverage in intensive tree-based orchards.},

ABSTRACT = {Using UAV and multispectral images has contributed to identifying field variability and improving crop management through different data modeling methods. However, knowledge on application of these tools to manage peanut maturity variability is still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare and validate linear and multiple linear regression with models using artificial neural networks (ANN) for estimating peanut maturity under irrigated and rainfed conditions. The models were trained (80% dataset) and tested (20% dataset) using results from the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons from irrigated and rainfed fields. In each field, plant reflectance was collected weekly from 90 days after planting using a UAV-mounted multispectral camera. Images were used to develop vegetation indices (VIs). Peanut pods were collected on the same dates as the UAV flights for maturity assessment using the peanut maturity index (PMI). The precision and accuracy of the linear models to estimate PMI using VIs were, in general, greater in irrigated fields with R2 &gt; 0.40 than in rainfed areas, which had a maximum R2 value of 0.21. Multiple linear regressions combining adjusted growing degree days (aGDD) and VIs resulted in decreased RMSE for both irrigated and rainfed conditions and increased R2 in irrigated areas. However, these models did not perform successfully in the test process. On the other hand, ANN models that included VIs and aGDD showed accuracy of R2 = 0.91 in irrigated areas, regardless of using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP; RMSE = 0.062) or Radial Basis Function (RBF; RMSE = 0.065), as well as low tendency (1:1 line). These results indicated that, regardless of the ANN architecture used to predict complex and non-linear variables, peanut maturity can be estimated accurately through models with multiple inputs using VIs and aGDD. Although the accuracy of the MLP or RBF models for irrigated and rainfed areas separately was high, the overall ANN models using both irrigated and rainfed areas can be used to predict peanut maturity with the same precision.},

ABSTRACT = {Japan was hit by typhoon Hagibis, which came with torrential rains submerging almost eight-thousand buildings. For fast alleviation of and recovery from flood damage, a quick, broad, and accurate assessment of the damage situation is required. Image analysis provides a much more feasible alternative than on-site sensors due to their installation and maintenance costs. Nevertheless, most state-of-art research relies on only ground-level images that are inevitably limited in their field of vision. This paper presents a water level detection system based on aerial drone-based image recognition. The system applies the R-CNN learning model together with a novel labeling method on the reference objects, including houses and cars. The proposed system tackles the challenges of the limited and wild data set of flood images from the top view with data augmentation and transfer-learning overlaying Mask R-CNN for the object recognition model. Additionally, the VGG16 network is employed for water level detection purposes. We evaluated the proposed system on realistic images captured at disaster time. Preliminary results show that the system can achieve a detection accuracy of submerged objects of 73.42% with as low as only 21.43 cm error in estimating the water level.},

In addition, Mask R-CNN with OpenCV is used for object detection and color analysis. The integration of the image caption and color recognition is then performed to provide better descriptive details of images. Moreover, the generated textual sentence is converted into speech. The validation results illustrate that the proposed method can provide more accurate description of images.},

ABSTRACT = {Semantic segmentation has been a fundamental task in interpreting remote sensing imagery (RSI) for various downstream applications. Due to the high intra-class variants and inter-class similarities, inflexibly transferring natural image-specific networks to RSI is inadvisable. To enhance the distinguishability of learnt representations, attention modules were developed and applied to RSI, resulting in satisfactory improvements. However, these designs capture contextual information by equally handling all the pixels regardless of whether they around edges. Therefore, blurry boundaries are generated, rising high uncertainties in classifying vast adjacent pixels. Hereby, we propose an edge distribution attention module (EDA) to highlight the edge distributions of leant feature maps in a self-attentive fashion. In this module, we first formulate and model column-wise and row-wise edge attention maps based on covariance matrix analysis. Furthermore, a hybrid attention module (HAM) that emphasizes the edge distributions and position-wise dependencies is devised combing with non-local block. Consequently, a conceptually end-to-end neural network, termed as EDENet, is proposed to integrate HAM hierarchically for the detailed strengthening of multi-level representations. EDENet implicitly learns representative and discriminative features, providing available and reasonable cues for dense prediction. The experimental results evaluated on ISPRS Vaihingen, Potsdam and DeepGlobe datasets show the efficacy and superiority to the state-of-the-art methods on overall accuracy (OA) and mean intersection over union (mIoU). In addition, the ablation study further validates the effects of EDA.},

ABSTRACT = {The breaching of tailings pond dams may lead to casualties and environmental pollution; therefore, timely and accurate monitoring is an essential aspect of managing such structures and preventing accidents. Remote sensing technology is suitable for the regular extraction and monitoring of tailings pond information. However, traditional remote sensing is inefficient and unsuitable for the frequent extraction of large volumes of highly precise information. Object detection, based on deep learning, provides a solution to this problem. Most remote sensing imagery applications for tailings pond object detection using deep learning are based on computer vision, utilizing the true-color triple-band data of high spatial resolution imagery for information extraction. The advantage of remote sensing image data is their greater number of spectral bands (more than three), providing more abundant spectral information. There is a lack of research on fully harnessing multispectral band information to improve the detection precision of tailings ponds. Accordingly, using a sample dataset of tailings pond satellite images from the Gaofen-1 high-resolution Earth observation satellite, we improved the Faster R-CNN deep learning object detection model by increasing the inputs from three true-color bands to four multispectral bands. Moreover, we used the attention mechanism to recalibrate the input contributions. Subsequently, we used a step-by-step transfer learning method to improve and gradually train our model. The improved model could fully utilize the near-infrared (NIR) band information of the images to improve the precision of tailings pond detection. Compared with that of the three true-color band input models, the tailings pond detection average precision (AP) and recall notably improved in our model, with the AP increasing from 82.3% to 85.9% and recall increasing from 65.4% to 71.9%. This research could serve as a reference for using multispectral band information from remote sensing images in the construction and application of deep learning models.},

ABSTRACT = {In the construction of new smart cities, traditional fire-detection systems can be replaced with vision-based systems to establish fire safety in society using emerging technologies, such as digital cameras, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. In this study, we developed a fire detector that accurately detects even small sparks and sounds an alarm within 8 s of a fire outbreak. A novel convolutional neural network was developed to detect fire regions using an enhanced You Only Look Once (YOLO) v4network. Based on the improved YOLOv4 algorithm, we adapted the network to operate on the Banana Pi M3 board using only three layers. Initially, we examined the originalYOLOv4 approach to determine the accuracy of predictions of candidate fire regions. However, the anticipated results were not observed after several experiments involving this approach to detect fire accidents. We improved the traditional YOLOv4 network by increasing the size of the training dataset based on data augmentation techniques for the real-time monitoring of fire disasters. By modifying the network structure through automatic color augmentation, reducing parameters, etc., the proposed method successfully detected and notified the incidence of disastrous fires with a high speed and accuracy in different weather environments&mdash;sunny or cloudy, day or night. Experimental results revealed that the proposed method can be used successfully for the protection of smart cities and in monitoring fires in urban areas. Finally, we compared the performance of our method with that of recently reported fire-detection approaches employing widely used performance matrices to test the fire classification results achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, the use of quadrotors has increased in numerous applications, such as agriculture, rescue, transportation, inspection, and localization. Time-optimal quadrotor waypoint tracking is defined as controlling quadrotors to follow the given waypoints as quickly as possible. Although PID control is widely used for quadrotor control, it is not adaptable to environmental changes, such as various trajectories and dynamic external disturbances. In this work, we discover that adjusting PID control frequencies is necessary for adapting to environmental changes by showing that the optimal control frequencies can be different for different environments. Therefore, we suggest a method to schedule the PID position and attitude control frequencies for time-optimal quadrotor waypoint tracking. The method includes (1) a Control Frequency Agent (CFA) that finds the best control frequencies in various environments, (2) a Quadrotor Future Predictor (QFP) that predicts the next state of a quadrotor, and (3) combining the CFA and QFP for time-optimal quadrotor waypoint tracking under unknown external disturbances. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing that it reduces the travel time of a quadrotor for waypoint tracking.},

ABSTRACT = {With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), obtaining high-resolution aerial images has become easier. Identifying and locating specific crops from aerial images is a valuable task. The location and quantity of crops are important for agricultural insurance businesses. In this paper, the problem of locating chili seedling crops in large-field UAV images is processed. Two problems are encountered in the location process: a small number of samples and objects in UAV images are similar on a small scale, which increases the location difficulty. A detection framework based on a prototypical network to detect crops in UAV aerial images is proposed. In particular, a method of subcategory slicing is applied to solve the problem, in which objects in aerial images have similarities at a smaller scale. The detection framework is divided into two parts: training and detection. In the training process, crop images are sliced into subcategories, and then these subcategory patch images and background category images are used to train the prototype network. In the detection process, a simple linear iterative clustering superpixel segmentation method is used to generate candidate regions in the UAV image. The location method uses a prototypical network to recognize nine patch images extracted simultaneously. To train and evaluate the proposed method, we construct an evaluation dataset by collecting the images of chilies in a seedling stage by an UAV. We achieve a location accuracy of 96.46%. This study proposes a seedling crop detection framework based on few-shot learning that does not require the use of labeled boxes. It reduces the workload of manual annotation and meets the location needs of seedling crops.},

ABSTRACT = {Noncollaborative surveillance of airborne UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) is a key enabler to the safe integration of UAS within a UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) ecosystem. Thus, a wide variety of new sensors (known as Counter-UAS sensors) are being developed to provide real-time UAS tracking, ranging from radar, RF analysis and image-based detection to even sound-based sensors. This paper aims to discuss the current state-of-the art technology in this wide variety of sensors (both academically and commercially) and to propose a set of simulation models for them. Thus, the review is focused on identifying the key parameters and processes that allow modeling their performance and operation, which reflect the variety of measurement processes. The resulting simulation models are designed to help evaluate how sensors&rsquo; performances affect UTM systems, and specifically the implications in their tracking and tactical services (i.e., tactical conflicts with uncontrolled drones). The simulation models cover probabilistic detection (i.e., false alarms and probability of detection) and measurement errors, considering equipment installation (i.e., monostatic vs. multistatic configurations, passive sensing, etc.). The models were integrated in a UTM simulation platform and simulation results are included in the paper for active radars, passive radars, and acoustic sensors.},

ABSTRACT = {Frequent waterlogging disasters can have serious effects on regional ecology, food safety, and socioeconomic sustainable development. Early monitoring of waterlogging stress levels is vital for accurate production input management and reduction of crop production-related risks. In this study, a pot experiment on winter wheat was designed using three varieties and seven gradients of waterlogging stress. Hyperspectral imagery of the winter wheat canopy in the jointing stage, heading stage, flowering stage, filling stage, and maturation stage were measured and then classified. Wavebands of imaging data were screened. Waterlogging stress level was assessed by a combined harmonic analysis method, and application of this method at field scale was discussed preliminarily. Results show that compared to the k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine algorithms, the random forest algorithm is the best batch classification method for hyperspectral imagery of potted winter wheat. It can recognize waterlogging stress well in the wavebands of red absorption valley (RW: 640&ndash;680 nm), red-edge (RE: 670&ndash;737 nm), and near-infrared (NIR: 700&ndash;900 nm). In the RW region, amplitudes of the first three harmonic sub-signals (c1, c2, and c3) can be used as indexes to recognize the waterlogging stress level that each winter wheat variety undertakes. The third harmonic sub-signal amplitude c3 of the RE region is also suitable for judging stress levels of JM31 (one of the three varieties which is highly sensitive to water content). This study has important theoretical significance and practical application values related to the accurate control of waterlogging stress, and functions as a new method to monitor other types of environmental stress levels such as drought stress, freezing stress, and high-temperature stress levels.},

ABSTRACT = {In the field of target classification, detecting a ground moving target that is easily covered in clutter has been a challenge. In addition, traditional feature extraction techniques and classification methods usually rely on strong subjective factors and prior knowledge, which affect their generalization capacity. Most existing deep-learning-based methods suffer from insufficient feature learning due to the lack of data samples, which makes it difficult for the training process to converge to a steady-state. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) sample enhancement method for ground moving target classification (GMT-WGAN). First, the micro-Doppler characteristics of ground moving targets are analyzed. Next, a WGAN is constructed to generate effective time&ndash;frequency images of ground moving targets and thereby enrich the sample database used to train the classification network. Then, image quality evaluation indexes are introduced to evaluate the generated spectrogram samples, with an aim to verify the distribution similarity of generated and real samples. Afterward, by feeding augmented samples to the deep convolutional neural networks with good generalization capacity, the classification performance of the GMT-WGAN is improved. Finally, experiments conducted on different datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Bird damage to fruit crops causes significant monetary losses to farmers annually. The application of traditional bird repelling methods such as bird cannons and tree netting become inefficient in the long run, requiring high maintenance and reducing mobility. Due to their versatility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be beneficial to solve this problem. However, due to their low battery capacity that equals low flight duration, it is necessary to evolve path planning optimization. A novel path planning optimization algorithm of UAVs based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented in this paper. This path planning optimization algorithm aims to manage the drone&rsquo;s distance and flight time, applying optimization and randomness techniques to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional systems. The proposed algorithm&rsquo;s performance was tested in three study cases: two of them in simulation to test the variation of each parameter and one in the field to test the influence on battery management and height influence. All cases were tested in the three possible situations: same incidence rate, different rates, and different rates with no bird damage to fruit crops. The field tests were also essential to understand the algorithm&rsquo;s behavior of the path planning algorithm in the UAV, showing that there is less efficiency with fewer points of interest, but this does not correlate with the flight time. In addition, there is no association between the maximum horizontal speed and the flight time, which means that the function to calculate the total distance for path planning needs to be adjusted. Thus, the proposed algorithm presents promising results with an outstanding reduced average error in the total distance for the path planning obtained and low execution time, being suited for this and other applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Intelligent traffic management is an important issue for smart cities. City councils try to implement the newest techniques and performant technologies in order to avoid traffic congestion, to optimize the use of traffic lights, to efficiently use car parking, etc. To find the best solution to this problem, Birmingham City Council decided to allow open-source predictive traffic forecasting by making the real-time datasets available. This paper proposes a multi-agent system (MAS) approach for intelligent urban traffic management in Birmingham using forecasting and classification techniques. The designed agents have the following tasks: forecast the occupancy rates for traffic flow, road junctions and car parking; classify the faults; control and monitor the entire process. The experimental results show that k-nearest neighbor forecasts with high accuracy rates for the traffic data and decision trees build the most accurate model for classifying the faults for their detection and repair in the shortest possible time. The whole learning process is coordinated by a monitoring agent in order to automate Birmingham city&rsquo;s traffic management.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have largely improved the performance of building segmentation from remote sensing images. However, the images for building segmentation are often in the form of traditional orthophotos, where the relief displacement would cause non-negligible misalignment between the roof outline and the footprint of a building; such misalignment poses considerable challenges for extracting accurate building footprints, especially for high-rise buildings. Aiming at alleviating this problem, a new workflow is proposed for generating rectified building footprints from traditional orthophotos. We first use the facade labels, which are prepared efficiently at low cost, along with the roof labels to train a semantic segmentation network. Then, the well-trained network, which employs the state-of-the-art version of EfficientNet as backbone, extracts the roof segments and the facade segments of buildings from the input image. Finally, after clustering the classified pixels into instance-level building objects and tracing out the roof outlines, an energy function is proposed to drive the roof outline to maximally align with the building footprint; thus, the rectified footprints can be generated. The experiments on the aerial orthophotos covering a high-density residential area in Shanghai demonstrate that the proposed workflow can generate obviously more accurate building footprints than the baseline methods, especially for high-rise buildings.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) is becoming increasingly frequent during search and rescue (SAR) operations conducted to find missing persons. These systems have proven to be particularly useful for operations executed in the wilderness, i.e., in open and mountainous areas. The successful implementation of those systems is possible thanks to the potential offered by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which help achieve a considerable reduction in operational times and consequently allow a much quicker finding of lost persons. This is crucial to enhance their chances of survival in extreme conditions (withholding hydration, food and medicine, and hypothermia). The paper presents the results of a preliminary assessment of a search and rescue method conducted in an unknown terrain, where groups were coordinated with the use of UAVs and a ground control station (GCS) workstation. The conducted analysis was focused on assessing conditions that would help minimise the time of arrival of the rescue team to the target, which in real conditions could be a missing person identified on aerial images. The results of executed field tests have proven that the time necessary to reach injured persons can be substantially shortened if imaging recorded by UAV is deployed, as it considerably enhances the chance of survival in an emergency situation. The GCS workstation is also one of the crucial components in the search system, which assures image transmission from the UAV to participants of the search operation and radio signal amplification in a difficult terrain. The effectiveness of the search system was tested by comparing the arrival times of teams equipped with GPS and a compass and those not equipped with such equipment. The article also outlined the possibilities of extending the functionality of the search system with the SARUAV module, which was used to find a missing person in Poland.},

ABSTRACT = {The article presents a method of designing a selected unmanned aerial platform flight scenario based on the principles of designing a reliable (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) UAV architecture operating in an environment in which other platforms operate. The models and results presented relate to the medium-range aerial platform, subject to certification under the principles set out in aviation regulations. These platforms are subject to the certification process requirements, but their restrictions are not as restrictive as in the case of manned platforms. Issues related to modeling scenarios implemented by the platform in flight are discussed. The article describes the importance of Functional Hazard Analysis (FHA) and Fault Trees Analysis (FTA) of elements included in the hardware and software architecture of the system. The models in Unified Modeling Language (UML) used by the authors in the project are described, supporting the design of a reliable architecture of flying platforms. Examples of the transformations from user requirements modeled in the form of Use Cases to platform operation models based on State Machines and then to the final UAV operation algorithms are shown. Principles of designing system test plans and designing individual test cases to verify the system&rsquo;s operation in emergencies in flight are discussed. Methods of integrating flight simulators with elements of the air platform in the form of Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) models based on selected algorithms for avoiding dangerous situations have been described. The presented results are based on a practical example of an algorithm for detecting an air collision situation of two platforms.},

ABSTRACT = {Agriculture is the primary source of income in developing countries like India. Agriculture accounts for 17 percent of India&rsquo;s total GDP, with almost 60 percent of the people directly or indirectly employed. While researchers and planters focus on a variety of elements to boost productivity, crop loss due to disease is one of the most serious issues they confront. Crop growth monitoring and early detection of pest infestations are still a problem. With the expansion of cultivation to wider fields, manual intervention to monitor and diagnose insect and pest infestations is becoming increasingly difficult. Failure to apply on time fertilizers and pesticides results in more crop loss and so lower output. Farmers are putting in greater effort to conserve crops, but they are failing most of the time because they are unable to adequately monitor the crops when they are infected by pests and insects. Pest infestation is also difficult to predict because it is not evenly distributed. In the recent past, modern equipment, tools, and approaches have been used to replace manual involvement. Unmanned aerial vehicles serve a critical role in crop disease surveillance and early detection in this setting. This research attempts to give a review of the most successful techniques to have precision-based crop monitoring and pest management in agriculture fields utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft. The researchers&rsquo; reports on the various types of UAVs and their applications to early detection of agricultural diseases are rigorously assessed and compared. This paper also discusses the deployment of aerial, satellite, and other remote sensing technologies for disease detection, as well as their Quality of Service (QoS).},

ABSTRACT = {Here, we developed a method for detecting cyber security attacks aimed at spoofing the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Most methods for detecting UAV anomalies indicative of an attack use machine learning or other such methods that compare normal behavior with abnormal behavior. Such approaches require large amounts of data and significant &ldquo;training&rdquo; time to prepare and implement the system. Instead, we consider a new approach based on other mathematical methods for detecting UAV anomalies without the need to first collect a large amount of data and describe normal behavior patterns. Doing so can simplify the process of creating an anomaly detection system, which can further facilitate easier implementation of intrusion detection systems in UAVs. This article presents issues related to ensuring the information security of UAVs. Development of the GPS spoofing detection method for UAVs is then described, based on a preliminary study that made it possible to form a mathematical apparatus for solving the problem. We then explain the necessary analysis of parameters and methods of data normalization, and the analysis of the Kullback&mdash;Leibler divergence measure needed to detect anomalies in UAV systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The leaf area index (LAI) is a key indicator of the status of forest ecosystems that is important for understanding global carbon and water cycles as well as terrestrial surface energy balances and the impacts of climate change. Machine learning (ML) methods offer promising ways of generating spatially explicit LAI data covering large regions based on optical images. However, there have been few efforts to analyze the LAI in heterogeneous subtropical forests with complex terrain by fusing high-resolution multi-sensor data from the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 digital elevation model (DEM). Here, forest LAI mapping was performed by integrating the MSI, SAR, and DEM data using a stacking learning (SL) approach that incorporates distinct predictions from a set of optimized individual ML algorithms. The method&rsquo;s performance was evaluated by comparison to field forest LAI measurements acquired in Xingguo and Gandong of subtropical China. The results showed that the addition of the SAR and DEM images using the SL model compared to the inputs of only optical images reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) by 26% and 18%, respectively, in Xingguo, and by 12% and 8%, respectively, in Gandong. Furthermore, the combination of all images had the best prediction performance. SL was found to be more robust and accurate than conventional individual ML models, while the MAE and RMSE were decreased by 71% and 64%, respectively, in Xingguo, and by 68% and 59%, respectively, in Gandong. Therefore, the SL model using the three-source data combination produced satisfied prediction accuracy with the coefficients of determination (R2), MAE, and RMSE of 0.96, 0.17, and 0.28, respectively, in Xingguo and 0.94, 0.30, and 0.47, respectively, in Gandong. This study revealed the potential of the SL algorithm for retrieving the forest LAI using multi-sensor data in areas with complex terrain.},

ABSTRACT = {Pine wilt is a devastating disease that typically kills affected pine trees within a few months. In this paper, we confront the problem of detecting pine wilt disease. In the image samples that have been used for pine wilt disease detection, there is high ambiguity due to poor image resolution and the presence of &ldquo;disease-like&rdquo; objects. We therefore created a new dataset using large-sized orthophotographs collected from 32 cities, 167 regions, and 6121 pine wilt disease hotspots in South Korea. In our system, pine wilt disease was detected in two stages: n the first stage, the disease and hard negative samples were collected using a convolutional neural network. Because the diseased areas varied in size and color, and as the disease manifests differently from the early stage to the late stage, hard negative samples were further categorized into six different classes to simplify the complexity of the dataset. Then, in the second stage, we used an object detection model to localize the disease and &ldquo;disease-like&rdquo; hard negative samples. We used several image augmentation methods to boost system performance and avoid overfitting. The test process was divided into two phases: a patch-based test and a real-world test. During the patch-based test, we used the test-time augmentation method to obtain the average prediction of our system across multiple augmented samples of data, and the prediction results showed a mean average precision of 89.44% in five-fold cross validation, thus representing an increase of around 5% over the alternative system. In the real-world test, we collected 10 orthophotographs in various resolutions and areas, and our system successfully detected 711 out of 730 potential disease spots.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) and electrocardiogram (ECG)-derived respiration (EDR) have been used to detect sleep apnea (SA) for decades. The present study proposes an SA-detection algorithm using a machine-learning framework and bag-of-features (BoF) derived from an ECG spectrogram. Methods: This study was verified using overnight ECG recordings from 83 subjects with an average apnea&ndash;hypopnea index (AHI) 29.63 (/h) derived from the Physionet Apnea-ECG and National Cheng Kung University Hospital Sleep Center database. The study used signal preprocessing to filter noise and artifacts, ECG time&ndash;frequency transformation using continuous wavelet transform (CWT), BoF feature generation, machine-learning classification using support vector machine (SVM), ensemble learning (EL), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification, and cross-validation. The time length of the spectrogram was set as 10 and 60 s to examine the required minimum spectrogram window time length to achieve satisfactory accuracy. Specific frequency bands of 0.1&ndash;50, 8&ndash;50, 0.8&ndash;10, and 0&ndash;0.8 Hz were also extracted to generate the BoF to determine the band frequency best suited for SA detection. Results: The five-fold cross-validation accuracy using the BoF derived from the ECG spectrogram with 10 and 60 s time windows were 90.5% and 91.4% for the 0.1&ndash;50 Hz and 8&ndash;50 Hz frequency bands, respectively. Conclusion: An SA-detection algorithm utilizing BoF and a machine-learning framework was successfully developed in this study with satisfactory classification accuracy and high temporal resolution.},

ABSTRACT = {Mediterranean countries are known worldwide for their significant contribution to olive oil production, which generates large amounts of olive mill wastewater (OMW) that degrades land and water environments near the disposal sites. OMW consists of organic substances with high concentrations of phenolic compounds along with inorganic particles. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of satellite image analysis techniques using multispectral satellite data with high (PlanetScope, 3 &times; 3 m) and medium (Sentinel-2, 10 &times; 10 m) spatial resolution to detect Olive Mill Wastewater (OMW) disposal sites, both in the SidiBouzid region (Tunisia) and in the broader Rethymno region on the island of Crete, (Greece). Documentation of the sites was carried out by collecting spectral signatures of OMW at temporal periods. The study integrates the application of a variety of spectral vegetation indices (VIs), such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), in order to evaluate their efficiency in detecting OMW disposal areas. Furthermore, a set of image-processing methods was applied on satellite images to improve the monitoring of OMW ponds including the false-color composites (FCC), the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and image fusion. Finally, different classification algorithms, such as the ISODATA, the maximum likelihood (ML), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied to both satellite images in order to assist in the overall approach to effectively detect the sites. The results obtained from different approaches were compared, evaluating the efficiency of Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images to detect and monitor OMW disposal areas under different morphological environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Fifth-generation (5G) technology will play a vital role in future wireless networks. The breakthrough 5G technology will unleash a massive Internet of Everything (IoE), where billions of connected devices, people, and processes will be simultaneously served. The services provided by 5G include several use cases enabled by the enhanced mobile broadband, massive machine-type communications, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication. Fifth-generation networks potentially merge multiple networks on a single platform, providing a landscape for seamless connectivity, particularly for high-mobility devices. With their enhanced speed, 5G networks are prone to various research challenges. In this context, we provide a comprehensive survey on 5G technologies that emphasize machine learning-based solutions to cope with existing and future challenges. First, we discuss 5G network architecture and outline the key performance indicators compared to the previous and upcoming network generations. Second, we discuss next-generation wireless networks and their characteristics, applications, and use cases for fast connectivity to billions of devices. Then, we confer physical layer services, functions, and issues that decrease the signal quality.

ABSTRACT = {In geospatial applications such as urban planning and land use management, automatic detection and classification of earth objects are essential and primary subjects. When the significant semantic segmentation algorithms are considered, DeepLabV3+ stands out as a state-of-the-art CNN. Although the DeepLabV3+ model is capable of extracting multi-scale contextual information, there is still a need for multi-stream architectural approaches and different training approaches of the model that can leverage multi-modal geographic datasets. In this study, a new end-to-end dual-stream architecture that considers geospatial imagery was developed based on the DeepLabV3+ architecture. As a result, the spectral datasets other than RGB provided increments in semantic segmentation accuracies when they were used as additional channels to height information. Furthermore, both the given data augmentation and Tversky loss function which is sensitive to imbalanced data accomplished better overall accuracies. Also, it has been shown that the new dual-stream architecture using Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets produced 88.87% and 87.39% overall semantic segmentation accuracies, respectively. Eventually, it was seen that enhancement of the traditional significant semantic segmentation networks has a great potential to provide higher model performances, whereas the contribution of geospatial data as the second stream to RGB to segmentation was explicitly shown.},

ABSTRACT = {Rockslides along a stepped failure surface have characteristics of stepped deformation characteristic and it is difficult to predict the failure time. In this study, the deformation characteristics and disaster prediction model of the Fengning granite rockslide were analyzed based on field surveys and monitoring data. To evaluate the stability, the shear strength parameters of the sliding surface were determined based on the back-propagation neural network and three-dimensional discrete element numerical method. Through the correlation analysis of deformation monitoring results with rainfall and blasting, it is shown that the landslide was triggered by excavation, rainfall, and blasting vibrations. The landslide displacement prediction model was established by using long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) based on the monitoring data, and the prediction results are compared with those using the BP model, SVM model and ARMA model. Results show that the LSTM model has strong advantages and good reliability for the stepped landslide deformation with short-term influence, and the predicted LSTM values were very consistent with the measured values, with a correlation coefficient of 0.977. Combined with the distribution characteristics of joints, the damage influence scope of the landslide was simulated by three-dimensional discrete element, which provides decision-making basis for disaster warning after slope instability. The method proposed in this paper can provide references for early warning and treatment of geological disasters.},

ABSTRACT = {Electric companies face flow control and inventory obstacles such as reliability, outlays, and time-consuming tasks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) combined with computational vision approaches can process image classification in warehouse management applications to tackle this problem. This study uses synthetic and real images applied to CNNs to deal with classification of inventory items. The results are compared to seek the neural networks that better suit this application. The methodology consists of fine-tuning several CNNs on Red&ndash;Green&ndash;Blue (RBG) and Red&ndash;Green&ndash;Blue-Depth (RGB-D) synthetic and real datasets, using the best architecture of each domain in a blended ensemble approach. The proposed blended ensemble approach was not yet explored in such an application, using RGB and RGB-D data, from synthetic and real domains. The use of a synthetic dataset improved accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score in comparison with models trained only on the real domain. Moreover, the use of a blend of DenseNet and Resnet pipelines for colored and depth images proved to outperform accuracy, precision and f1-score performance indicators over single CNNs, achieving an accuracy measurement of 95.23%. The classification task is a real logistics engineering problem handled by computer vision and artificial intelligence, making full use of RGB and RGB-D images of synthetic and real domains, applied in an approach of blended CNN pipelines.},

ABSTRACT = {Video object and human action detection are applied in many fields, such as video surveillance, face recognition, etc. Video object detection includes object classification and object location within the frame. Human action recognition is the detection of human actions. Usually, video detection is more challenging than image detection, since video frames are often more blurry than images. Moreover, video detection often has other difficulties, such as video defocus, motion blur, part occlusion, etc. Nowadays, the video detection technology is able to implement real-time detection, or high-accurate detection of blurry video frames. In this paper, various video object and human action detection approaches are reviewed and discussed, many of them have performed state-of-the-art results. We mainly review and discuss the classic video detection methods with supervised learning. In addition, the frequently-used video object detection and human action recognition datasets are reviewed. Finally, a summarization of the video detection is represented, e.g., the video object and human action detection methods could be classified into frame-by-frame (frame-based) detection, extracting-key-frame detection and using-temporal-information detection; the methods of utilizing temporal information of adjacent video frames are mainly the optical flow method, Long Short-Term Memory and convolution among adjacent frames.},

In the proposed solution, aimed at data engineers, the knowledge of the crowd serves as an oracle that is able to judge whether the given sample is informative or not. The proposed solution reduces the amount of work needed to annotate large sets of data. Furthermore, it allows a perpetual increase in the trained network quality by the inclusion of new samples, gathered after network deployment. The paper also discusses means of limiting network training times, especially in the post-deployment stage, where the size of the training set can increase dramatically. This is done by the introduction of the fourth set composed of samples gather during network actual usage.},

ABSTRACT = {Modelling fire behaviour in forest fires is based on meteorological, topographical, and vegetation data, including species&rsquo; type. To accurately parameterise these models, an inventory of the area of analysis with the maximum spatial and temporal resolution is required. This study investigated the use of UAV-based digital aerial photogrammetry (UAV-DAP) point clouds to classify tree and shrub species in Mediterranean forests, and this information is key for the correct generation of wildfire models. In July 2020, two test sites located in the Natural Park of Sierra Calderona (eastern Spain) were analysed, registering 1036 vegetation individuals as reference data, corresponding to 11 shrub and one tree species. Meanwhile, photogrammetric flights were carried out over the test sites, using a UAV DJI Inspire 2 equipped with a Micasense RedEdge multispectral camera. Geometrical, spectral, and neighbour-based features were obtained from the resulting point cloud generated. Using these features, points belonging to tree and shrub species were classified using several machine learning methods, i.e., Decision Trees, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and MultiLayer Perceptron. The best results were obtained using Gradient Boosting, with a mean cross-validation accuracy of 81.7% and 91.5% for test sites 1 and 2, respectively. Once the best classifier was selected, classified points were clustered based on their geometry and tested with evaluation data, and overall accuracies of 81.9% and 96.4% were obtained for test sites 1 and 2, respectively. Results showed that the use of UAV-DAP allows the classification of Mediterranean tree and shrub species. This technique opens a wide range of possibilities, including the identification of species as a first step for further extraction of structure and fuel variables as input for wildfire behaviour models.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid assessment of building damage in earthquake-stricken areas is of paramount importance for emergency response. The development of remote sensing technology has aided in deriving reliable and precise building damage assessments of extensive areas following disasters. It is well documented that convolutional neural network methods have superior performance in earthquake building damage assessment compared with traditional machine learning methods. However, deep learning models require a large number of samples, and sufficient numbers of samples are usually not available in the newly earthquake-stricken areas rapidly enough. At the same time, the historical samples inevitably differ from the new earthquake-affected areas due to the discrepancy of regional building characteristics. For this purpose, this study proposes a data transfer algorithm for evaluating the impact of a single historical training sample on the model performance. Then, beneficial samples are selected to transfer knowledge from the historical data for facilitating the calibration of the new model. Four models are designed with two earthquake damage building datasets and the performance of the models is compared and evaluated. The results show that the data transfer algorithm proposed in this work improves the reliability of the building damage assessment model significantly by filtering samples from the historical data that are suitable for the new task. The performance of the model built based on the data transfer method on the test set of new earthquakes task is approximately 8% higher in overall accuracy compared with the model trained directly with the new earthquake samples when the training data for the new task is only 10% of the historical data and is operating under the objective of four classes of building damage. The proposed data transfer algorithm has effectively enhanced the precision of the seismic building damage assessment in a data-limited context. Thus, it could be applicable to the building damage assessment of new disasters.},

ABSTRACT = {Selective logging can cause significant impacts on the residual stands, affecting biodiversity and leading to environmental changes. Proper monitoring and mapping of the impacts from logging activities, such as the stumps, felled logs, roads, skid trails, and forest canopy gaps, are crucial for sustainable forest management operations. The purpose of this study is to assess the indicators of selective logging impacts by detecting the individual stumps as the main indicators, evaluating the performance of classification methods to assess the impacts and identifying forest gaps from selective logging activities. The combination of forest inventory field plots and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB and overlapped imaged were used in this study to assess these impacts. The study area is located in Ulu Jelai Forest Reserve in the central part of Peninsular Malaysia, covering an experimental study area of 48 ha. The study involved the integration of template matching (TM), object-based image analysis (OBIA), and machine learning classification&mdash;support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). Forest features and tree stumps were classified, and the canopy height model was used for detecting forest canopy gaps in the post selective logging region. Stump detection using the integration of TM and OBIA produced an accuracy of 75.8% when compared with the ground data. Forest classification using SVM and ANN methods were adopted to extract other impacts from logging activities such as skid trails, felled logs, roads and forest canopy gaps. These methods provided an overall accuracy of 85% and kappa coefficient value of 0.74 when compared with conventional classifier. The logging operation also caused an 18.6% loss of canopy cover. The result derived from this study highlights the potential use of UAVs for efficient post logging impact analysis and can be used to complement conventional forest inventory practices.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper brings forward a Deep Learning (DL)-based Chaos Shift Keying (DLCSK) demodulation scheme to promote the capabilities of existing chaos-based wireless communication systems. In coherent Chaos Shift Keying (CSK) schemes, we need synchronization of chaotic sequences, which is still practically impossible in a disturbing environment. Moreover, the conventional Differential Chaos Shift Keying (DCSK) scheme has a drawback, that for each bit, half of the bit duration is spent sending non-information bearing reference samples. To deal with this drawback, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based receiver is trained offline, using chaotic maps through a finite number of channel realizations, and then used for classifying online modulated signals. We presented that the proposed receiver can learn different chaotic maps and estimate channels implicitly, and then retrieves the transmitted messages without any need for chaos synchronization or reference signal transmissions. Simulation results for both the AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels show a remarkable BER performance improvement compared to the conventional DCSK scheme. The proposed DLCSK system will provide opportunities for a new class of receivers by leveraging the advantages of DL, such as effective serial and parallel connectivity. A Single Input Multiple Output (SIMO) architecture of the DLCSK receiver with excellent reliability is introduced to show its capabilities. The SIMO DLCSK benefits from a DL-based channel estimation approach, which makes this architecture simpler and more efficient for applications where channel estimation is problematic, such as massive MIMO, mmWave, and cloud-based communication systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Around the cooperative path-following control for the underactuated surface vessel (USV) and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a logic virtual ship-logic virtual aircraft (LVS-LVA) guidance principle is developed to generate the reference heading signals for the USV-UAV system by using the &ldquo;virtual ship&rdquo; and the &ldquo;virtual aircraft&rdquo;, which is critical to establish an effective correlation between the USV and the UAV. Taking the steerable variables (the main engine speed and the rudder angle of the USV, and the rotor angular velocities of the UAV) as the control input, a robust adaptive neural cooperative control algorithm was designed by employing the dynamic surface control (DSC), radial basic function neural networks (RBF-NNs) and the event-triggered technique. In the proposed algorithm, the reference roll angle and pitch angle for the UAV can be calculated from the position control loop by virtue of the nonlinear decouple technique. In addition, the system uncertainties were approximated through the RBF-NNs and the transmission burden from the controller to the actuators was reduced for merits of the event-triggered technique. Thus, the derived control law is superior in terms of the concise form, low transmission burden and robustness. Furthermore, the tracking errors of the USV-UAV cooperative control system can converge to a small compact set through adjusting the designed control parameters appropriately, and it can be also guaranteed that all the signals are the semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been verified via numerical simulations in the presence of the time-varying disturbances.},

ABSTRACT = {High-resolution remote sensing images have been put into the application in remote sensing parsing. General remote sensing parsing methods based on semantic segmentation still have limitations, which include frequent neglect of tiny objects, high complexity in image understanding and sample imbalance. Therefore, a controllable fusion module (CFM) is proposed to alleviate the problem of implicit understanding of complicated categories. Moreover, an adaptive edge loss function (AEL) was proposed to alleviate the problem of the recognition of tiny objects and sample imbalance. Our proposed method combining CFM and AEL optimizes edge features and body features in a coupled mode. The verification on Potsdam and Vaihingen datasets shows that our method can significantly improve the parsing effect of satellite images in terms of mIoU and MPA.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last few decades, the increase in the world&rsquo;s population has created a need to produce more food, generating, consequently, greater pressure on agricultural production. In addition, problems related to climate change, water scarcity or decreasing amounts of arable land have serious implications for farming sustainability. Weeds can affect food production in agricultural systems, decreasing the product quality and productivity due to the competition for natural resources. On the other hand, weeds can also be considered to be valuable indicators of biodiversity because of their role in providing ecosystem services. In this sense, there is a need to carry out an effective and sustainable weed management process, integrating the various control methods (i.e., cultural, mechanical and chemical) in a harmonious way, without harming the entire agrarian ecosystem. Thus, intensive mechanization and herbicide use should be avoided. Herbicide resistance in some weed biotypes is a major concern today and must be tackled. On the other hand, the recent development of weed control technologies can promote higher levels of food production, lower the amount of inputs needed and reduce environmental damage, invariably bringing us closer to more sustainable agricultural systems. In this paper, we review the most common conventional and non-conventional weed control strategies from a sustainability perspective, highlighting the application of the precision and automated weed control technologies associated with precision weed management (PWM).},

ABSTRACT = {Computer vision-based automation has become popular in detecting and monitoring plants&rsquo; nutrient deficiencies in recent times. The predictive model developed by various researchers were so designed that it can be used in an embedded system, keeping in mind the availability of computational resources. Nevertheless, the enormous popularity of smart phone technology has opened the door of opportunity to common farmers to have access to high computing resources. To facilitate smart phone users, this study proposes a framework of hosting high end systems in the cloud where processing can be done, and farmers can interact with the cloud-based system. With the availability of high computational power, many studies have been focused on applying convolutional Neural Networks-based Deep Learning (CNN-based DL) architectures, including Transfer learning (TL) models on agricultural research. Ensembling of various TL architectures has the potential to improve the performance of predictive models by a great extent. In this work, six TL architectures viz. InceptionV3, ResNet152V2, Xception, DenseNet201, InceptionResNetV2, and VGG19 are considered, and their various ensemble models are used to carry out the task of deficiency diagnosis in rice plants. Two publicly available datasets from Mendeley and Kaggle are used in this study. The ensemble-based architecture enhanced the highest classification accuracy to 100% from 99.17% in the Mendeley dataset, while for the Kaggle dataset; it was enhanced to 92% from 90%.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate and robust scale estimation in visual object tracking is a challenging task. To obtain a scale estimation of the target object, most methods rely either on a multi-scale searching scheme or on refining a set of predefined anchor boxes. These methods require heuristically selected parameters, such as scale factors of the multi-scale searching scheme, or sizes and aspect ratios of the predefined candidate anchor boxes. On the contrary, a centerness-aware anchor-free tracker (CAT) is designed in this work. First, the location and scale of the target object are predicted in an anchor-free fashion by decomposing tracking into parallel classification and regression problems. The proposed anchor-free design obviates the need for hyperparameters related to the anchor boxes, making CAT more generic and flexible. Second, the proposed centerness-aware classification branch can identify the foreground from the background while predicting the normalized distance from the location within the foreground to the target center, i.e., the centerness. The proposed centerness-aware classification branch improves the tracking accuracy and robustness significantly by suppressing low-quality state estimates. The experiments show that our centerness-aware anchor-free tracker, with its appealing features, achieves salient performance in a wide variety of tracking scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {With the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in different contexts and application areas, efforts are being made to endow these devices with enough intelligence so as to allow them to perform complex tasks with full autonomy. In particular, covering scenarios such as disaster areas may become particularly difficult due to infrastructure shortage in some areas, often impeding a cloud-based analysis of the data in near-real time. Enabling AI techniques at the edge is therefore fundamental so that UAVs themselves can both capture and process information to gain an understanding of their context, and determine the appropriate course of action in an independent manner. Towards this goal, in this paper, we take determined steps towards UAV autonomy in a disaster scenario such as a flood. In particular, we use a dataset of UAV images relative to different floods taking place in Spain, and then use an AI-based approach that relies on three widely used deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic segmentation of images, to automatically determine the regions more affected by rains (flooded areas). The targeted algorithms are optimized for GPU-based edge computing platforms, so that the classification can be carried out on the UAVs themselves, and only the algorithm output is uploaded to the cloud for real-time tracking of the flooded areas. This way, we are able to reduce dependency on infrastructure, and to reduce network resource consumption, making the overall process greener and more robust to connection disruptions. Experimental results using different types of hardware and different architectures show that it is feasible to perform advanced real-time processing of UAV images using sophisticated DNN-based solutions.},

ABSTRACT = {To ensure the hybrid oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus) seed production, two important things are necessary, the stamen sterility on the female OSR plants and the effective pollen spread onto the pistil from the OSR male plants to the OSR female plants. The unmanned agricultural aerial system (UAAS) has developed rapidly in China. It has been used on supplementary pollination and aerial spraying during the hybrid OSR seed production. This study developed a new method to rapidly recognize the male OSR plants and extract the row center line for supporting the UAAS navigation. A male OSR plant recognition model was constructed based on the convolutional neural network (CNN). The sequence images of male OSR plants were extracted, the feature regions and points were obtained from the images through morphological and boundary process methods and horizontal segmentation, respectively. The male OSR plant image recognition accuracies of different CNN structures and segmentation sizes were discussed. The male OSR plant row center lines were fitted using the least-squares method (LSM) and Hough transform. The results showed that the segmentation algorithm could segment the male OSR plants from the complex background. The highest average recognition accuracy was 93.54%, and the minimum loss function value was 0.2059 with three convolutional layers, one fully connected layer, and a segmentation size of 40 pix &times; 40 pix. The LSM is better for center line fitting. The average recognition model accuracies of original input images were 98% and 94%, and the average root mean square errors (RMSE) of angle were 3.22&deg; and 1.36&deg; under cloudy day and sunny day lighting conditions, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of using digital imaging technology to recognize the male OSR plant row for UAAS visual navigation on the applications of hybrid OSR supplementary pollination and aerial spraying, which would be a meaningful supplement in precision agriculture.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban vegetation growth is vital for developing sustainable and liveable cities in the contemporary era since it directly helps people&rsquo;s health and well-being. Estimating vegetation cover and biomass is commonly done by calculating various vegetation indices for automated urban vegetation management and monitoring. However, most of these indices fail to capture robust estimation of vegetation cover due to their inherent focus on colour attributes with limited viewpoint and ignore seasonal changes. To solve this limitation, this article proposed a novel vegetation index called the Multiview Semantic Vegetation Index (MSVI), which is robust to color, viewpoint, and seasonal variations. Moreover, it can be applied directly to RGB images. This Multiview Semantic Vegetation Index (MSVI) is based on deep semantic segmentation and multiview field coverage and can be integrated into any vegetation management platform. This index has been tested on Google Street View (GSV) imagery of Wyndham City Council, Melbourne, Australia. The experiments and training achieved an overall pixel accuracy of 89.4% and 92.4% for FCN and U-Net, respectively. Thus, the MSVI can be a helpful instrument for analysing urban forestry and vegetation biomass since it provides an accurate and reliable objective method for assessing the plant cover at street level.},

ABSTRACT = {In the area of synthetic sensors for flow angle estimation, the present work aims to describe the verification in a relevant environment of a physics-based approach using a dedicated technological demonstrator. The flow angle synthetic solution is based on a model-free, or physics-based, scheme and, therefore, it is applicable to any flying body. The demonstrator also encompasses physical sensors that provide all the necessary inputs to the synthetic sensors to estimate the angle-of-attack and the angle-of-sideslip. The uncertainty budgets of the physical sensors are evaluated to corrupt the flight simulator data with the aim of reproducing a realistic scenario to verify the synthetic sensors. The proposed approach for the flow angle estimation is suitable for modern and future aircraft, such as drones and urban mobility air vehicles. The results presented in this work show that the proposed approach can be effective in relevant scenarios even though some limitations can arise.},

ABSTRACT = {Low-cost sensors (LCS) are becoming popular for air quality monitoring (AQM). They promise high spatial and temporal resolutions at low-cost. In addition, citizen science applications such as personal exposure monitoring can be implemented effortlessly. However, the reliability of the data is questionable due to various error sources involved in the LCS measurement. Furthermore, sensor performance drift over time is another issue. Hence, the adoption of LCS by regulatory agencies is still evolving. Several studies have been conducted to improve the performance of low-cost sensors. This article summarizes the existing studies on the state-of-the-art of LCS for AQM. We conceptualize a step by step procedure to establish a sustainable AQM setup with LCS that can produce reliable data. The selection of sensors, calibration and evaluation, hardware setup, evaluation metrics and inferences, and end user-specific applications are various stages in the LCS-based AQM setup we propose. We present a critical analysis at every step of the AQM setup to obtain reliable data from the low-cost measurement. Finally, we conclude this study with future scope to improve the availability of air quality data.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents the study of the stability of single-input and multiple-input systems with point or distributed state delay and input delay and input saturation. By a linear transformation applied to the initial system with delay, a system is obtained without delay, but which is equivalent from the point of view of stability. Next, using sufficient conditions for the global asymptotic stability of linear systems with bounded control, new sufficient conditions are obtained for global asymptotic stability of the initial system with state delay and input delay and input saturation. In addition, the article presents the results on the instability and estimation of the stability region of the delay and input saturation system. The numerical simulations confirming the results obtained on stability were performed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. A method is also presented for solving a transcendental matrix equation that results from the process of equating the stability of the systems with and without delay, a method which is based on the computational intelligence, namely, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method.},

ABSTRACT = {A Multi-Agent Motion Prediction and Tracking method based on non-cooperative equilibrium (MPT-NCE) is proposed according to the fact that some multi-agent intelligent evolution methods, like the MADDPG, lack adaptability facing unfamiliar environments, and are unable to achieve multi-agent motion prediction and tracking, although they own advantages in multi-agent intelligence. Featured by a performance discrimination module using the time difference function together with a random mutation module applying predictive learning, the MPT-NCE is capable of improving the prediction and tracking ability of the agents in the intelligent game confrontation. Two groups of multi-agent prediction and tracking experiments are conducted and the results show that compared with the MADDPG method, in the aspect of prediction ability, the MPT-NCE achieves a prediction rate at more than 90%, which is 23.52% higher and increases the whole evolution efficiency by 16.89%; in the aspect of tracking ability, the MPT-NCE promotes the convergent speed by 11.76% while facilitating the target tracking by 25.85%. The proposed MPT-NCE method shows impressive environmental adaptability and prediction and tracking ability.},

ABSTRACT = {The degrading of input images due to the engineering environment decreases the performance of helmet detection models so as to prevent their application in practice. To overcome this problem, we propose an end-to-end helmet monitoring system, which implements a super-resolution (SR) reconstruction driven helmet detection workflow to detect helmets for monitoring tasks. The monitoring system consists of two modules, the super-resolution reconstruction module and the detection module. The former implements the SR algorithm to produce high-resolution images, the latter performs the helmet detection. Validations are performed on both a public dataset as well as the realistic dataset obtained from a practical construction site. The results show that the proposed system achieves a promising performance and surpasses the competing methods. It will be a promising tool for construction monitoring and is easy to be extended to corresponding tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {In low-resolution wide-area aerial imagery, object detection algorithms are categorized as feature extraction and machine learning approaches, where the former often requires a post-processing scheme to reduce false detections and the latter demands multi-stage learning followed by post-processing. In this paper, we present an approach on how to select post-processing schemes for aerial object detection. We evaluated combinations of each of ten vehicle detection algorithms with any of seven post-processing schemes, where the best three schemes for each algorithm were determined using average F-score metric. The performance improvement is quantified using basic information retrieval metrics as well as the classification of events, activities and relationships (CLEAR) metrics. We also implemented a two-stage learning algorithm using a hundred-layer densely connected convolutional neural network for small object detection and evaluated its degree of improvement when combined with the various post-processing schemes. The highest average F-scores after post-processing are 0.902, 0.704 and 0.891 for the Tucson, Phoenix and online VEDAI datasets, respectively. The combined results prove that our enhanced three-stage post-processing scheme achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 63.9% for feature extraction methods and 82.8% for the machine learning approach.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper puts forward a new method of landscape recognition and evaluation by using aerial video and EEG technology. In this study, seven typical landscape types (forest, wetland, grassland, desert, water, farmland, and city) were selected. Different electroencephalogram (EEG) signals were generated through different inner experiences and feelings felt by people watching video stimuli of the different landscape types. The electroencephalogram (EEG) features were extracted to obtain the mean amplitude spectrum (MAS), power spectrum density (PSD), differential entropy (DE), differential asymmetry (DASM), rational asymmetry (RASM), and differential caudality (DCAU) in the five frequency bands of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma. According to electroencephalogram (EEG) features, four classifiers including the back propagation (BP) neural network, k-nearest neighbor classification (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to classify the landscape types. The results showed that the support vector machine (SVM) classifier and the random forest (RF) classifier had the highest accuracy of landscape recognition, which reached 98.24% and 96.72%, respectively. Among the six classification features selected, the classification accuracy of MAS, PSD, and DE with frequency domain features were higher than those of the spatial domain features of DASM, RASM and DCAU. In different wave bands, the average classification accuracy of all subjects was 98.24% in the gamma band, 94.62% in the beta band, and 97.29% in the total band. This study identifies and classifies landscape perception based on multi-channel EEG signals, which provides a new idea and method for the quantification of human perception.},

ABSTRACT = {The search for dents is a consistent part of the aircraft inspection workload. The engineer is required to find, measure, and report each dent over the aircraft skin. This process is not only hazardous, but also extremely subject to human factors and environmental conditions. This study discusses the feasibility of automated dent scanning via a single-shot triangular stereo Fourier transform algorithm, designed to be compatible with the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle. The original algorithm is modified introducing two main contributions. First, the automatic estimation of the pass-band filter removes the user interaction in the phase filtering process. Secondly, the employment of a virtual reference plane reduces unwrapping errors, leading to improved accuracy independently of the chosen unwrapping algorithm. Static experiments reached a mean absolute error of &sim;0.1&nbsp;mm at a distance of 60&nbsp;cm, while dynamic experiments showed &sim;0.3&nbsp;mm at a distance of 120&nbsp;cm. On average, the mean absolute error decreased by &sim;34%, proving the validity of the proposed single-shot 3D reconstruction algorithm and suggesting its applicability for future automated dent inspections.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate roof information of buildings can be obtained from UAV high-resolution images. The large-scale accurate recognition of roof types (such as gabled, flat, hipped, complex and mono-pitched roofs) of rural buildings is crucial for rural planning and construction. At present, most UAV high-resolution optical images only have red, green and blue (RGB) band information, which aggravates the problems of inter-class similarity and intra-class variability of image features. Furthermore, the different roof types of rural buildings are complex, spatially scattered, and easily covered by vegetation, which in turn leads to the low accuracy of roof type identification by existing methods. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a method for identifying roof types of complex rural buildings based on visible high-resolution remote sensing images from UAVs. First, the fusion of deep learning networks with different visual features is investigated to analyze the effect of the different feature combinations of the visible difference vegetation index (VDVI) and Sobel edge detection features and UAV visible images on model recognition of rural building roof types. Secondly, an improved Mask R-CNN model is proposed to learn more complex features of different types of images of building roofs by using the ResNet152 feature extraction network with migration learning. After we obtained roof type recognition results in two test areas, we evaluated the accuracy of the results using the confusion matrix and obtained the following conclusions: (1) the model with RGB images incorporating Sobel edge detection features has the highest accuracy and enables the model to recognize more and more accurately the roof types of different morphological rural buildings, and the model recognition accuracy (Kappa coefficient (KC)) compared to that of RGB images is on average improved by 0.115; (2) compared with the original Mask R-CNN, U-Net, DeeplabV3 and PSPNet deep learning models, the improved Mask R-CNN model has the highest accuracy in recognizing the roof types of rural buildings, with F1-score, KC and OA averaging 0.777, 0.821 and 0.905, respectively. The method can obtain clear and accurate profiles and types of rural building roofs, and can be extended for green roof suitability evaluation, rooftop solar potential assessment, and other building roof surveys, management and planning.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning (DL) shows remarkable performance in extracting buildings from high resolution remote sensing images. However, how to improve the performance of DL based methods, especially the perception of spatial information, is worth further study. For this purpose, we proposed a building extraction network with feature highlighting, global awareness, and cross level information fusion (B-FGC-Net). The residual learning and spatial attention unit are introduced in the encoder of the B-FGC-Net, which simplifies the training of deep convolutional neural networks and highlights the spatial information representation of features. The global feature information awareness module is added to capture multiscale contextual information and integrate the global semantic information. The cross level feature recalibration module is used to bridge the semantic gap between low and high level features to complete the effective fusion of cross level information. The performance of the proposed method was tested on two public building datasets and compared with classical methods, such as UNet, LinkNet, and SegNet. Experimental results demonstrate that B-FGC-Net exhibits improved profitability of accurate extraction and information integration for both small and large scale buildings. The IoU scores of B-FGC-Net on WHU and INRIA Building datasets are 90.04% and 79.31%, respectively. B-FGC-Net is an effective and recommended method for extracting buildings from high resolution remote sensing images.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the scale of rural land transfer has gradually expanded, and the phenomenon of non-grain-oriented cultivated land has emerged. Obtaining crop planting information is of the utmost importance to guaranteeing national food security; however, the acquisition of the spatial distribution of crops in large-scale areas often has the disadvantages of excessive calculation and low accuracy. Therefore, the IO-Growth method, which takes the growth stage every 10 days as the index and combines the spectral features of crops to refine the effective interval of conventional wavebands for object-oriented classification, was proposed. The results were as follows: (1) the IO-Growth method obtained classification results with an overall accuracy and F1 score of 0.92, and both values increased by 6.98% compared to the method applied without growth stages; (2) the IO-Growth method reduced 288 features to only 5 features, namely Sentinel-2: Red Edge1, normalized difference vegetation index, Red, short-wave infrared2, and Aerosols, on the 261st to 270th days, which greatly improved the utilization rate of the wavebands; (3) the rise of geographic data processing platforms makes it simple to complete computations with massive data in a short time. The results showed that the IO-Growth method is suitable for large-scale vegetation mapping.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years complex food security issues caused by climatic changes, limitations in human labour, and increasing production costs require a strategic approach in addressing problems. The emergence of artificial intelligence due to the capability of recent advances in computing architectures could become a new alternative to existing solutions. Deep learning algorithms in computer vision for image classification and object detection can facilitate the agriculture industry, especially in paddy cultivation, to alleviate human efforts in laborious, burdensome, and repetitive tasks. Optimal planting density is a crucial factor for paddy cultivation as it will influence the quality and quantity of production. There have been several studies involving planting density using computer vision and remote sensing approaches. While most of the studies have shown promising results, they have disadvantages and show room for improvement. One of the disadvantages is that the studies aim to detect and count all the paddy seedlings to determine planting density. The defective paddy seedlings&rsquo; locations are not pointed out to help farmers during the sowing process. In this work we aimed to explore several deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) models to determine which one performs the best for defective paddy seedling detection using aerial imagery. Thus, we evaluated the accuracy, robustness, and inference latency of one- and two-stage pretrained object detectors combined with state-of-the-art feature extractors such as EfficientNet, ResNet50, and MobilenetV2 as a backbone. We also investigated the effect of transfer learning with fine-tuning on the performance of the aforementioned pretrained models. Experimental results showed that our proposed methods were capable of detecting the defective paddy rice seedlings with the highest precision and an F1-Score of 0.83 and 0.77, respectively, using a one-stage pretrained object detector called EfficientDet-D1 EficientNet.},

ABSTRACT = {Edge Computing (EC) is a new architecture that extends Cloud Computing (CC) services closer to data sources. EC combined with Deep Learning (DL) is a promising technology and is widely used in several applications. However, in conventional DL architectures with EC enabled, data producers must frequently send and share data with third parties, edge or cloud servers, to train their models. This architecture is often impractical due to the high bandwidth requirements, legalization, and privacy vulnerabilities. The Federated Learning (FL) concept has recently emerged as a promising solution for mitigating the problems of unwanted bandwidth loss, data privacy, and legalization. FL can co-train models across distributed clients, such as mobile phones, automobiles, hospitals, and more, through a centralized server, while maintaining data localization. FL can therefore be viewed as a stimulating factor in the EC paradigm as it enables collaborative learning and model optimization. Although the existing surveys have taken into account applications of FL in EC environments, there has not been any systematic survey discussing FL implementation and challenges in the EC paradigm. This paper aims to provide a systematic survey of the literature on the implementation of FL in EC environments with a taxonomy to identify advanced solutions and other open problems. In this survey, we review the fundamentals of EC and FL, then we review the existing related works in FL in EC. Furthermore, we describe the protocols, architecture, framework, and hardware requirements for FL implementation in the EC environment. Moreover, we discuss the applications, challenges, and related existing solutions in the edge FL. Finally, we detail two relevant case studies of applying FL in EC, and we identify open issues and potential directions for future research. We believe this survey will help researchers better understand the connection between FL and EC enabling technologies and concepts.},

ABSTRACT = {Natural hazards have caused damages to structures and economic losses worldwide. Post-hazard responses require accurate and fast damage detection and assessment. In many studies, the development of data-driven damage detection within the research community of structural health monitoring has emerged due to the advances in deep learning models. Most data-driven models for damage detection focus on classifying different damage states and hence damage states cannot be effectively quantified. To address such a deficiency in data-driven damage detection, we propose a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model to quantify a probability of damage. The model was trained to learn damage representations with only undamaged signals and then quantify the probability of damage by feeding damaged signals into models. We tested the validity of our proposed Seq2Seq model with a signal dataset which was collected from a two-story timber building subjected to shake table tests. Our results show that our Seq2Seq model has a strong capability of distinguishing damage representations and quantifying the probability of damage in terms of highlighting the regions of interest.},

ABSTRACT = {In-flight system failure is one of the major safety concerns in the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in urban environments. To address this concern, a safety framework consisting of following three main tasks can be utilized: (1) Monitoring health of the UAV and detecting failures, (2) Finding potential safe landing spots in case a critical failure is detected in step 1, and (3) Steering the UAV to a safe landing spot found in step 2. In this paper, we specifically look at the second task, where we investigate the feasibility of utilizing object detection methods to spot safe landing spots in case the UAV suffers an in-flight failure. Particularly, we investigate different versions of the YOLO objection detection method and compare their performances for the specific application of detecting a safe landing location for a UAV that has suffered an in-flight failure. We compare the performance of YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5l while training them by a large aerial image dataset called DOTA in a Personal Computer (PC) and also a Companion Computer (CC). We plan to use the chosen algorithm on a CC that can be attached to a UAV, and the PC is used to verify the trends that we see between the algorithms on the CC. We confirm the feasibility of utilizing these algorithms for effective emergency landing spot detection and report their accuracy and speed for that specific application. Our investigation also shows that the YOLOv5l algorithm outperforms YOLOv4 and YOLOv3 in terms of accuracy of detection while maintaining a slightly slower inference speed.},

ABSTRACT = {To analyze the hyperspectral reflectance characteristics of rice canopies under changes in diffuse radiation fraction, experiments using different cover materials were performed in Nanjing, China, during 2016 and 2017. Each year, two treatments with different reduction ratios of diffuse radiation fraction but with similar shading rates were set in the field experiment: In T1, total solar radiation shading rate was 14.10%, and diffuse radiation fraction was 31.09%; in T2, total solar radiation shading rate was 14.42%, and diffuse radiation fraction was 39.98%, respectively. A non-shading treatment was included as a control (CK). Canopy hyperspectral reflectance, soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD), and leaf area index (LAI) were measured under shading treatments on different days after heading. The red-edge parameters (position, &lambda;0; maximum amplitude, D&lambda;; area, &alpha;0; width, &sigma;) were calculated, as well as the area, depth, and width of three absorption bands. The location of the first absorption band appeared in the range of 553&ndash;788 nm, and the second and third absorption bands appeared in the range of 874&ndash;1257 nm. The results show that the shading treatment had a significant effect on the rice canopy&rsquo;s hyperspectral reflectance. Compared with CK, the canopy reflectance of T1 (the diffuse radiation fraction was 31.09%) and T2 (the diffuse radiation fraction was 39.98%) decreased in the visible light range (350&ndash;760 nm) and increased in the near-infrared range (800&ndash;1350 nm), while the red-edge parameters (&lambda;0, D&lambda;, &alpha;0), SPAD, and LAI increased. On the other hand, under shading treatment, the increase in diffuse radiation fraction also had a significant impact on the hyperspectral spectra of the rice canopy, especially at 14 days after heading. Compared with T1, the green peak (550 nm) of T2 reduced by 16.12%, and the average reflectance at 800&ndash;900 nm increased by 10%. Based on correlation analysis, it was found that these hyperspectral reflectance characteristics were mainly due to the increase in SPAD (2.31%) and LAI (7.62%), which also led to the increase in D&lambda; (8.70%) and &alpha;0 (13.89%). Then, the second and third absorption features of T2 were significantly different from that of T1, which suggests that the change in diffuse radiation fraction could affect the process of water vapor absorption by rice.},

ABSTRACT = {Increased frequencies and windspeeds of storms may cause disproportionately high increases in windthrow damage. Storm-felled trees provide a surplus of breeding material for bark beetles, often resulting in calamities in the subsequent years. Thus, the timely removal of fallen trees is regarded as a good management practice that requires strategic planning of salvage harvesting. Precise information on the number of stems and their location and orientation are needed for the efficient planning of strip roads and/or cable yarding lines. An accurate assessment of these data using conventional field-based methods is very difficult and time-consuming; remote sensing techniques may be a cost-efficient alternative. In this research, a methodology for the automatic detection of fallen stems from aerial RGB images is presented. The presented methodology was based on a line segment detection algorithm and proved to be robust regarding image quality. It was shown that the method can detect frequency, position, spatial distribution and orientation of fallen stems with high accuracy, while stem lengths were systematically underestimated. The methodology can be used for the optimized planning of salvage harvesting in the future and may thus help to reduce consequential bark beetle calamities after storm events.},

ABSTRACT = {Safety is the primary concern when it comes to air traffic. In-flight safety between Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) is ensured through pairwise separation minima, utilizing conflict detection and resolution methods. Existing methods mainly deal with pairwise conflicts, however, due to an expected increase in traffic density, encounters with more than two UAVs are likely to happen. In this paper, we model multi-UAV conflict resolution as a multiagent reinforcement learning problem. We implement an algorithm based on graph neural networks where cooperative agents can communicate to jointly generate resolution maneuvers. The model is evaluated in scenarios with 3 and 4 present agents. Results show that agents are able to successfully solve the multi-UAV conflicts through a cooperative strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {The road surface area extraction task is generally carried out via semantic segmentation over remotely-sensed imagery. However, this supervised learning task is often costly as it requires remote sensing images labelled at the pixel level, and the results are not always satisfactory (presence of discontinuities, overlooked connection points, or isolated road segments). On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require labelled data and can be employed for post-processing the geometries of geospatial objects extracted via semantic segmentation. In this work, we implement a conditional Generative Adversarial Network to reconstruct road geometries via deep inpainting procedures on a new dataset containing unlabelled road samples from challenging areas present in official cartographic support from Spain. The goal is to improve the initial road representations obtained with semantic segmentation models via generative learning. The performance of the model was evaluated on unseen data by conducting a metrical comparison where a maximum Intersection over Union (IoU) score improvement of 1.3% was observed when compared to the initial semantic segmentation result. Next, we evaluated the appropriateness of applying unsupervised generative learning using a qualitative perceptual validation to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method in very complex scenarios and gain a better intuition of the model&rsquo;s behaviour when performing large-scale post-processing with generative learning and deep inpainting procedures and observed important improvements in the generated data.},

ABSTRACT = {Aerial surveillance could be a useful tool for early detection and quantification of plant diseases, however, there are often confounding effects of other types of plant stress. Stemphylium leaf blight (SLB), caused by the fungus Stemphylium vesicarium, is a damaging foliar disease of onion. Studies were conducted to determine if near-infrared photographic images could be used to accurately assess SLB severity in onion research trials in the Holland Marsh in Ontario, Canada. The site was selected for its uniform soil and level topography. Aerial photographs were taken in 2015 and 2016 using an Xnite-Canon SX230NDVI with a near-infrared filter, mounted on a modified Cine Star&mdash;8 MK Heavy Lift RTF octocopter UAV. Images were taken at 15&ndash;20 m above the ground, providing an average of 0.5 cm/pixel and a field of view of 15 &times; 20 m. Photography and ground assessments of disease were carried out on the same day. NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), green NDVI, chlorophyll index and plant senescence reflective index (PSRI) were calculated from the images. There were differences in SLB incidence and severity in the field plots and differences in the vegetative indices among the treatments, but there were no correlations between disease assessments and any of the indices.},

ABSTRACT = {The emergence of deep learning techniques has revolutionized the use of machine learning algorithms to classify complicated environments, notably in remote sensing. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown considerable promise in classifying challenging high-dimensional remote sensing data, particularly in the classification of wetlands. State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms, on the other hand, are transformers. Despite the fact that transformers have been utilized for a few remote sensing applications, they have not been compared to other well-known CNN networks in complex wetland classification. As such, for the classification of complex coastal wetlands in the study area of Saint John city, located in New Brunswick, Canada, we modified and employed the Swin Transformer algorithm. Moreover, the developed transformer classifier results were compared with two well-known deep CNNs of AlexNet and VGG-16. In terms of average accuracy, the proposed Swin Transformer algorithm outperformed the AlexNet and VGG-16 techniques by 14.3% and 44.28%, respectively. The proposed Swin Transformer classifier obtained F-1 scores of 0.65, 0.71, 0.73, 0.78, 0.82, 0.84, and 0.84 for the recognition of coastal marsh, shrub, bog, fen, aquatic bed, forested wetland, and freshwater marsh, respectively. The results achieved in this study suggest the high capability of transformers over very deep CNN networks for the classification of complex landscapes in remote sensing.},

ABSTRACT = {Drones are becoming increasingly popular not only for recreational purposes but also in a variety of applications in engineering, disaster management, logistics, securing airports, and others. In addition to their useful applications, an alarming concern regarding physical infrastructure security, safety, and surveillance at airports has arisen due to the potential of their use in malicious activities. In recent years, there have been many reports of the unauthorized use of various types of drones at airports and the disruption of airline operations. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based method for the efficient detection and recognition of two types of drones and birds. Evaluation of the proposed approach with the prepared image dataset demonstrates better efficiency compared to existing detection systems in the literature. Furthermore, drones are often confused with birds because of their physical and behavioral similarity. The proposed method is not only able to detect the presence or absence of drones in an area but also to recognize and distinguish between two types of drones, as well as distinguish them from birds. The dataset used in this work to train the network consists of 10,000 visible images containing two types of drones as multirotors, helicopters, and also birds. The proposed deep learning method can directly detect and recognize two types of drones and distinguish them from birds with an accuracy of 83%, mAP of 84%, and IoU of 81%. The values of average recall, average accuracy, and average F1-score were also reported as 84%, 83%, and 83%, respectively, in three classes.},

ABSTRACT = {Effective feature extraction (FE) has always been the focus of hyperspectral images (HSIs). For aerial remote-sensing HSIs processing and its land cover classification, in this article, an efficient two-staged hyperspectral FE method based on total variation (TV) is proposed. In the first stage, the average fusion method was used to reduce the spectral dimension. Then, the anisotropic TV model with different regularization parameters was utilized to obtain featured blocks of different smoothness, each containing multi-scale structure information, and we stacked them as the next stage&rsquo;s input. In the second stage, equipped with singular value transformation to reduce the dimension again, we followed an isotropic TV model based on split Bregman algorithm for further detail smoothing. Finally, the feature-extracted block was fed to the support vector machine for classification experiments. The results, with three hyperspectral datasets, demonstrate that our proposed method can competitively outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of its classification accuracy and computing time. Also, our proposed method delivers robustness and stability by comprehensive parameter analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a real-time collision avoidance algorithm was presented for autonomous navigation in the presence of fixed and moving obstacles in building environments. The current implementation is designed for autonomous navigation between waypoints of a predefined flight trajectory that would be performed by an UAV during tasks such as inspections or construction progress monitoring. It uses a simplified geometry generated from a point cloud of the scenario. In addition, it also employs information from 3D sensors to detect and position obstacles such as people or other UAVs, which are not registered in the original cloud. If an obstacle is detected, the algorithm estimates its motion and computes an evasion path considering the geometry of the environment. The method has been successfully tested in different scenarios, offering robust results in all avoidance maneuvers. Execution times were measured, demonstrating that the algorithm is computationally feasible to be implemented onboard an UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {Augmented humanity (AH) is a term that has been mentioned in several research papers. However, these papers differ in their definitions of AH. The number of publications dealing with the topic of AH is represented by a growing number of publications that increase over time, being high impact factor scientific contributions. However, this terminology is used without being formally defined. The aim of this paper is to carry out a systematic mapping review of the different existing definitions of AH and its possible application areas. Publications from 2009 to 2020 were searched in Scopus, IEEE and ACM databases, using search terms &ldquo;augmented human&rdquo;, &rdquo;human augmentation&rdquo; and &ldquo;human 2.0&rdquo;. Of the 16,914 initially obtained publications, a final number of 133 was finally selected. The mapping results show a growing focus on works based on AH, with computer vision being the index term with the highest number of published articles. Other index terms are wearable computing, augmented reality, human&ndash;robot interaction, smart devices and mixed reality. In the different domains where AH is present, there are works in computer science, engineering, robotics, automation and control systems and telecommunications. This review demonstrates that it is necessary to formalize the definition of AH and also the areas of work with greater openness to the use of such concept. This is why the following definition is proposed: &ldquo;Augmented humanity is a human&ndash;computer integration technology that proposes to improve capacity and productivity by changing or increasing the normal ranges of human function through the restoration or extension of human physical, intellectual and social capabilities&rdquo;.},

ABSTRACT = {Detecting and mapping individual trees accurately and automatically from remote sensing images is of great significance for precision forest management. Many algorithms, including classical methods and deep learning techniques, have been developed and applied for tree crown detection from remote sensing images. However, few studies have evaluated the accuracy of different individual tree detection (ITD) algorithms and their data and processing requirements. This study explored the accuracy of ITD using local maxima (LM) algorithm, marker-controlled watershed segmentation (MCWS), and Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask R-CNN) in a young plantation forest with different test images. Manually delineated tree crowns from UAV imagery were used for accuracy assessment of the three methods, followed by an evaluation of the data processing and application requirements for three methods to detect individual trees. Overall, Mask R-CNN can best use the information in multi-band input images for detecting individual trees. The results showed that the Mask R-CNN model with the multi-band combination produced higher accuracy than the model with a single-band image, and the RGB band combination achieved the highest accuracy for ITD (F1 score = 94.68%). Moreover, the Mask R-CNN models with multi-band images are capable of providing higher accuracies for ITD than the LM and MCWS algorithms. The LM algorithm and MCWS algorithm also achieved promising accuracies for ITD when the canopy height model (CHM) was used as the test image (F1 score = 87.86% for LM algorithm, F1 score = 85.92% for MCWS algorithm). The LM and MCWS algorithms are easy to use and lower computer computational requirements, but they are unable to identify tree species and are limited by algorithm parameters, which need to be adjusted for each classification. It is highlighted that the application of deep learning with its end-to-end-learning approach is very efficient and capable of deriving the information from multi-layer images, but an additional training set is needed for model training, robust computer resources are required, and a large number of accurate training samples are necessary. This study provides valuable information for forestry practitioners to select an optimal approach for detecting individual trees.},

ABSTRACT = {Federated learning (FL) allows UAVs to collaboratively train a globally shared machine learning model while locally preserving their private data. Recently, the FL in edge-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks has drawn an upsurge of research interest due to a bursting increase in heterogeneous data acquired by UAVs and the need to build the global model with privacy; however, a critical issue is how to deal with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) nature of heterogeneous data while ensuring the convergence of learning. To effectively address this challenging issue, this paper proposes a novel and high-performing FL scheme, namely, the hierarchical FL algorithm, for the edge-aided UAV network, which exploits the edge servers located in base stations as intermediate aggregators with employing commonly shared data. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical FL algorithm outperforms several baseline FL algorithms and exhibits better convergence behavior.},

ABSTRACT = {Ensemble learning of swarm intelligence evolutionary algorithm of artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the core research directions in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). As a representative member of swarm intelligence evolutionary algorithm, shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) has the advantages of simple structure, easy implementation, short operation time, and strong global optimization ability. However, SFLA is susceptible to fall into local optimas in the face of complex and multi-dimensional symmetric function optimization, which leads to the decline of convergence accuracy. This paper proposes an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm of threshold oscillation based on simulated annealing (SA-TO-SFLA). In this algorithm, the threshold oscillation strategy and simulated annealing strategy are introduced into the SFLA, which makes the local search behavior more diversified and the ability to escape from the local optimas stronger. By using multi-dimensional symmetric function such as drop-wave function, Schaffer function N.2, Rastrigin function, and Griewank function, two groups (i: SFLA, SA-SFLA, TO-SFLA, and SA-TO-SFLA; ii: SFLA, ISFLA, MSFLA, DSFLA, and SA-TO-SFLA) of comparative experiments are designed to analyze the convergence accuracy and convergence time. The results show that the threshold oscillation strategy has strong robustness. Moreover, compared with SFLA, the convergence accuracy of SA-TO-SFLA algorithm is significantly improved, and the median of convergence time is greatly reduced as a whole. The convergence accuracy of SFLA algorithm on these four test functions are 90%, 100%, 78%, and 92.5%, respectively, and the median of convergence time is 63.67 s, 59.71 s, 12.93 s, and 8.74 s, respectively; The convergence accuracy of SA-TO-SFLA algorithm on these four test functions is 99%, 100%, 100%, and 97.5%, respectively, and the median of convergence time is 48.64 s, 32.07 s, 24.06 s, and 3.04 s, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Manual visual inspection of civil infrastructure is high-risk, subjective, and time-consuming. The success of deep learning and the proliferation of low-cost consumer robots has spurred rapid growth in research and application of autonomous inspections. The major components of autonomous inspection include data acquisition, data processing, and decision making, which are usually studied independently. However, for robust real-world applicability, these three aspects of the overall process need to be addressed concurrently with end-to-end testing, incorporating scenarios such as variations in structure type, color, damage level, camera distance, view angle, lighting, etc. Developing real-world datasets that span all these scenarios is nearly impossible. In this paper, we propose a framework to create a virtual visual inspection testbed using 3D synthetic environments that can enable end-to-end testing of autonomous inspection strategies. To populate the 3D synthetic environment with virtual damaged buildings, we propose the use of a non-linear finite element model to inform the realistic and automated visual rendering of different damage types, the damage state, and the material textures of what are termed herein physics-based graphics models (PBGMs). To demonstrate the benefits of the autonomous inspection testbed, three experiments are conducted with models of earthquake damaged reinforced concrete buildings. First, we implement the proposed framework to generate a new large-scale annotated benchmark dataset for post-earthquake inspections of buildings termed QuakeCity. Second, we demonstrate the improved performance of deep learning models trained using the QuakeCity dataset for inference on real data. Finally, a comparison of deep learning-based damage state estimation for different data acquisition strategies is carried out. The results demonstrate the use of PBGMs as an effective testbed for the development and validation of strategies for autonomous vision-based inspections of civil infrastructure.},

ABSTRACT = {Drones have the potential to revolutionize malaria vector control initiatives through rapid and accurate mapping of potential malarial mosquito larval habitats to help direct field Larval Source Management (LSM) efforts. However, there are no clear recommendations on how these habitats can be extracted from drone imagery in an operational context. This paper compares the results of two mapping approaches: supervised image classification using machine learning and Technology-Assisted Digitising (TAD) mapping that employs a new region growing tool suitable for non-experts. These approaches were applied concurrently to drone imagery acquired at seven sites in Zanzibar, United Republic of Tanzania. Whilst the two approaches were similar in processing time, the TAD approach significantly outperformed the supervised classification approach at all sites (t = 5.1, p &lt; 0.01). Overall accuracy scores (mean overall accuracy 62%) suggest that a supervised classification approach is unsuitable for mapping potential malarial mosquito larval habitats in Zanzibar, whereas the TAD approach offers a simple and accurate (mean overall accuracy 96%) means of mapping these complex features. We recommend that this approach be used alongside targeted ground-based surveying (i.e., in areas inappropriate for drone surveying) for generating precise and accurate spatial intelligence to support operational LSM programmes.},

ABSTRACT = {Tracking control of Small Unmanned Ground Vehicles (SUGVs) is easily affected by the nonlinearity and time-varying characteristics. An improved predictive control scheme based on the multi-dimensional Taylor network (MTN) is proposed for tracking control of SUGVs. First, a MTN model is used as a predictive model to construct a SUGV model and back propagation (BP) is taken as its learning algorithm. Second, the predictive control law is designed and the traditional objective function is improved to obtain a predictive objective function with a differential term. The optimal control quantity is given in real time through iterative optimization. Meanwhile, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved by the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, a tracking control experiment on the SUGV model is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. For comparison, traditional MTN and Radial Basis Function (RBF) predictive control schemes are introduced. Moreover, a noise disturbance is considered. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is effective, which ensures that the vehicle can quickly and accurately track the desired yaw velocity signal with good real-time, robustness, and convergence performance, and is superior to other comparison schemes.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring salinity information of salinized soil efficiently and precisely using the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is critical for the rational use and sustainable development of arable land resources. The sensitive parameter and a precise retrieval method of soil salinity, however, remain unknown. This study strived to explore the sensitive parameter and construct an optimal method for retrieving soil salinity. The UAV-borne multispectral image in China&rsquo;s Yellow River Delta was acquired to extract band reflectance, compute vegetation indexes and soil salinity indexes. Soil samples collected from 120 different study sites were used for laboratory salt content measurements. Grey correlation analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient methods were employed to screen sensitive band reflectance and indexes. A new soil salinity retrieval index (SSRI) was then proposed based on the screened sensitive reflectance. The Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR), Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) methods were employed to construct retrieval models based on the sensitive indexes. The results found that green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands were sensitive to soil salinity, which can be used to build SSRI. The SSRI-based RF method was the optimal method for accurately retrieving the soil salinity. Its modeling determination coefficient (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were 0.724 and 1.764, respectively; and the validation R2, RMSE, and Residual Predictive Deviation (RPD) were 0.745, 1.879, and 2.211.},

ABSTRACT = {The airfoil is the prime component of flying vehicles. For low-speed flights, low Reynolds number airfoils are used. The characteristic of low Reynolds number airfoils is a laminar separation bubble and an associated drag rise. This paper presents a framework for the design of a low Reynolds number airfoil. The contributions of the proposed research are twofold. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed for the aerodynamic coefficient prediction of low Reynolds number airfoils. Data generation is discussed in detail and XFOIL is selected to obtain aerodynamic coefficients. The performance of the CNN is evaluated using different learning rate schedulers and adaptive learning rate optimizers. The trained model can predict the aerodynamic coefficients with high accuracy. Second, the trained model is used with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for multi-objective optimization of the low Reynolds number airfoil at a specific angle of attack. A similar optimization is performed using NSGA-II directly calling XFOIL, to obtain the aerodynamic coefficients. The Pareto fronts of both optimizations are compared, and it is concluded that the proposed CNN can replicate the actual Pareto in considerably less time.},

ABSTRACT = {As a classic framework for visual object tracking, the Siamese convolutional neural network has received widespread attention from the research community. This method uses a convolutional neural network to obtain the object features and to match them with the search area features to achieve object tracking. In this work, we observe that the contribution of each convolution kernel in the convolutional neural network for object tracking tasks is different. We propose an object-aware convolution kernel attention mechanism. Based on the characteristics of each object, the convolution kernel features are dynamically weighted to improve the expression ability of object features. The experiments performed using OTB and VOT benchmark datasets show that the performance of the tracking method fused with the convolution kernel attention mechanism is significantly better compared with the original method. Moreover, the attention mechanism can also be integrated with other tracking frameworks as an independent module to improve the performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Training on simulation data has proven invaluable in applying machine learning in robotics. However, when looking at robot vision in particular, simulated images cannot be directly used no matter how realistic the image rendering is, as many physical parameters (temperature, humidity, wear-and-tear in time) vary and affect texture and lighting in ways that cannot be encoded in the simulation. In this article we propose a different approach for extracting value from simulated environments: although neither of the trained models can be used nor are any evaluation scores expected to be the same on simulated and physical data, the conclusions drawn from simulated experiments might be valid. If this is the case, then simulated environments can be used in early-stage experimentation with different network architectures and features. This will expedite the early development phase before moving to (harder to conduct) physical experiments in order to evaluate the most promising approaches. In order to test this idea we created two simulated environments for the Unity engine, acquired simulated visual datasets, and used them to reproduce experiments originally carried out in a physical environment. The comparison of the conclusions drawn in the physical and the simulated experiments is promising regarding the validity of our approach.},

ABSTRACT = {A majority of the population of developing countries is associated with agriculture directly or indirectly. The liaison of engineering technology and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can build a bridge for farmers to enhance their skills regarding advancements through future generation agriculture trends. The next-generation trends include better soil preparation, intelligent irrigation systems, advanced methods of crop nutrient inspection, smart fertilizers applications, and multi-cropping practices. This work proposes a smart Decision Support System (DSS) that acquires the input parameters based on real-time monitoring to optimize the yield that realizes sustainability by improving per hectare production and lessening water seepage wastage in agribusiness. The proposed model comprises three basic units including an intelligent sensor module, smart irrigation system and controlled fertilizer module. The system has integrated sensors, cloud employing decision support layers, and networking based DSS to recommend cautions for optimum sustainable yield. The intelligent sensors module contains a temperature and humidity sensor, NPK sensor, soil moisture sensor, soil conductivity sensor, and pH sensor to transmit the statistics to the cloud over the internet via Long Range (LoRa) using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication protocol. Moreover, an android application has been developed for real-time data monitoring according to GPS location and node information (accessed remotely). Furthermore, the DSS contemplates the accessible information from sensors, past patterns, monitoring climate trends and creating cautions required for sustainable fertilizer consumption. The presented results and comparison validate the novelty of the design as it embraces smart irrigation with smart control and smart decision-making based on accurate real-time field data. It is better than existing systems as it transmits the data over the LoRa that is an open-source communication with long-range transmission ability up to several kilometres. The sensor nodes helped in advancing the yield of crops, which resulted in achieving inclusive and sustainable economic goals.},

ABSTRACT = {Proximal soil sensors are receiving strong attention from several disciplinary fields, and this has led to a rise in their availability in the market in the last two decades. The aim of this work was to validate agronomically a zone management delineation procedure from electromagnetic induction (EMI) maps applied to two different rainfed durum wheat fields. The k-means algorithm was applied based on the gap statistic index for the identification of the optimal number of management zones and their positions. Traditional statistical analysis was performed to detect significant differences in soil characteristics and crop response of each management zones. The procedure showed the presence of two management zones at both two sites under analysis, and it was agronomically validated by the significant difference in soil texture (+24.17%), bulk density (+6.46%), organic matter (+39.29%), organic carbon (+39.4%), total carbonates (+25.34%), total nitrogen (+30.14%), protein (+1.50%) and yield data (+1.07 t ha&minus;1). Moreover, six unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight missions were performed to investigate the relationship between five vegetation indexes and the EMI maps. The results suggest performing the multispectral images acquisition during the flowering phenological stages to attribute the crop spatial variability to different soil proprieties.},

ABSTRACT = {Coastal areas host highly valuable ecosystems that are increasingly exposed to the threats of global and local changes. Monitoring their evolution at a high temporal and spatial scale is therefore crucial and mostly possible through remote sensing. This article demonstrates the relevance of topobathymetric lidar data for coastal and estuarine habitat mapping by classifying bispectral data to produce 3D maps of 21 land and sea covers at very high resolution. Green lidar full waveforms are processed to retrieve tailored features corresponding to the signature of those habitats. These features, along with infrared intensities and elevations, are used as predictors for random forest classifications, and their respective contribution to the accuracy of the results is assessed. We find that green waveform features, infrared intensities, and elevations are complimentary and yield the best classification results when used in combination. With this configuration, a classification accuracy of 90.5% is achieved for the segmentation of our dual-wavelength lidar dataset. Eventually, we produce an original mapping of a coastal site under the form of a point cloud, paving the way for 3D classification and management of land and sea covers.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, together with mobile network technology, has created a never-before-seen world of interconnection, evoking research on how to make it vaster, faster, and safer. To support the ongoing fight against the malicious misuse of networks, in this paper we propose a novel algorithm called AMDES (unmanned aerial system multifractal analysis intrusion detection system) for spoofing attack detection. This novel algorithm is based on both wavelet leader multifractal analysis (WLM) and machine learning (ML) principles. In earlier research on unmanned aerial systems (UAS), intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on multifractal (MF) spectral analysis have been used to provide accurate MF spectrum estimations of network traffic. Such an estimation is then used to detect and characterize flooding anomalies that can be observed in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network. However, the previous contributions have lacked the consideration of other types of network intrusions commonly observed in UAS networks, such as the man in the middle attack (MITM). In this work, this promising methodology has been accommodated to detect a spoofing attack within a UAS. This methodology highlights a robust approach in terms of false positive performance in detecting intrusions in a UAS location reporting system.},

ABSTRACT = {Logging trails are one of the main components of modern forestry. However, spotting the accurate locations of old logging trails through common approaches is challenging and time consuming. This study was established to develop an approach, using cutting-edge deep-learning convolutional neural networks and high-density laser scanning data, to detect logging trails in different stages of commercial thinning, in Southern Finland. We constructed a U-Net architecture, consisting of encoder and decoder paths with several convolutional layers, pooling and non-linear operations. The canopy height model (CHM), digital surface model (DSM), and digital elevation models (DEMs) were derived from the laser scanning data and were used as image datasets for training the model. The labeled dataset for the logging trails was generated from different references as well. Three forest areas were selected to test the efficiency of the algorithm that was developed for detecting logging trails. We designed 21 routes, including 390 samples of the logging trails and non-logging trails, covering all logging trails inside the stands. The results indicated that the trained U-Net using DSM (k = 0.846 and IoU = 0.867) shows superior performance over the trained model using CHM (k = 0.734 and IoU = 0.782), DEMavg (k = 0.542 and IoU = 0.667), and DEMmin (k = 0.136 and IoU = 0.155) in distinguishing logging trails from non-logging trails. Although the efficiency of the developed approach in young and mature stands that had undergone the commercial thinning is approximately perfect, it needs to be improved in old stands that have not received the second or third commercial thinning.},

ABSTRACT = {Conventional dynamic vibration absorbers are physical control devices designed to be coupled to flexible mechanical structures to be protected against undesirable forced vibrations. In this article, an approach to extend the capabilities of forced vibration suppression of the dynamic vibration absorbers into desired motion trajectory tracking control algorithms for a four-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is introduced. Nevertheless, additional physical control devices for mechanical vibration absorption are unnecessary in the proposed motion profile reference tracking control design perspective. A new dynamic control design approach for efficient tracking of desired motion profiles as well as for simultaneous active harmonic vibration absorption for a quadrotor helicopter is then proposed. In contrast to other control design methods, the presented motion tracking control scheme is based on the synthesis of multiple virtual (nonphysical) dynamic vibration absorbers. The mathematical structure of these physical mechanical devices, known as dynamic vibration absorbers, is properly exploited and extended for control synthesis for underactuated multiple-input multiple-output four-rotor nonlinear aerial dynamic systems. In this fashion, additional capabilities of active suppression of vibrating forces and torques can be achieved in specified motion directions on four-rotor helicopters. Moreover, since the dynamic vibration absorbers are designed to be virtual, these can be directly tuned for diverse operating conditions. In the present study, it is thus demonstrated that the mathematical structure of physical mechanical vibration absorbers can be extended for the design of active vibration control schemes for desired motion trajectory tracking tasks on four-rotor aerial vehicles subjected to adverse harmonic disturbances. The effectiveness of the presented novel design perspective of virtual dynamic vibration absorption schemes is proved by analytical and numerical results. Several operating case studies to stress the advantages to extend the undesirable vibration attenuation capabilities of the dynamic vibration absorbers into trajectory tracking control algorithms for nonlinear four-rotor helicopter systems are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Current strategies for phenotyping above-ground biomass in field breeding nurseries demand significant investment in both time and labor. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can be used to derive vegetation indices (VIs) with high throughput and could provide an efficient way to predict forage yield with high accuracy. The main objective of the study is to investigate the potential of UAV-based multispectral data and machine learning approaches in the estimation of oat biomass. UAV equipped with a multispectral sensor was flown over three experimental oat fields in Volga, South Shore, and Beresford, South Dakota, USA, throughout the pre- and post-heading growth phases of oats in 2019. A variety of vegetation indices (VIs) derived from UAV-based multispectral imagery were employed to build oat biomass estimation models using four machine-learning algorithms: partial least squares (PLS), support vector machine (SVM), Artificial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF). The results showed that several VIs derived from the UAV collected images were significantly positively correlated with dry biomass for Volga and Beresford (r = 0.2&ndash;0.65), however, in South Shore, VIs were either not significantly or weakly correlated with biomass. For Beresford, approximately 70% of the variance was explained by PLS, RF, and SVM validation models using data collected during the post-heading phase. Likewise for Volga, validation models had lower coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.20&ndash;0.25) and higher error (RMSE = 700&ndash;800 kg/ha) than training models (R2 = 0.50&ndash;0.60; RMSE = 500&ndash;690 kg/ha). In South Shore, validation models were only able to explain approx. 15&ndash;20% of the variation in biomass, which is possibly due to the insignificant correlation values between VIs and biomass. Overall, this study indicates that airborne remote sensing with machine learning has potential for above-ground biomass estimation in oat breeding nurseries. The main limitation was inconsistent accuracy in model prediction across locations. Multiple-year spectral data, along with the inclusion of textural features like crop surface model (CSM) derived height and volumetric indicators, should be considered in future studies while estimating biophysical parameters like biomass.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of traditional point-line feature visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system, which has weak performance in accuracy so that it cannot be processed in real time under the condition of weak indoor texture and light and shade change, this paper proposes an inertial SLAM method based on point-line vision for indoor weak texture and illumination. Firstly, based on Bilateral Filtering, we apply the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) point feature extraction and Fast Nearest neighbor (FLANN) algorithms to improve the robustness of point feature extraction result. Secondly, we establish a minimum density threshold and length suppression parameter selection strategy of line feature, and take the geometric constraint line feature matching into consideration to improve the efficiency of processing line feature. And the parameters and biases of visual inertia are initialized based on maximum posterior estimation method. Finally, the simulation experiments are compared with the traditional tightly-coupled monocular visual&ndash;inertial odometry using point and line features (PL-VIO) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed an inertial SLAM method based on point-line vision for indoor weak texture and illumination can be effectively operated in real time, and its positioning accuracy is 22% higher on average and 40% higher in the scenario that illumination changes and blurred image.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper we post-process and evaluate the position estimation of pairs of template windows and geo-referenced images generated from LiDAR cloud point data using the Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) method. We created intensity, surface and terrain pairs of images for use with template matching, with 5 m pixel spacing, through binning. We evaluated square and circular binning approaches, without filtering the original data. Template matching achieved approximately 7 m root mean square error (RMSE) on intensity and surface templates on the respective geo-referenced images, while on terrain templates it had many mismatches due to insufficient terrain features over the assumed flight transect. Analysis of NCC showed the possibility of rejecting bad matches of intensity and surface templates, but terrain templates required an additional criteria of flatness for rejection. The combined NCC of intensity, surface and terrain proved stable for rejection of bad matches and had the lowest RMSE. Filtering outliers from surface images changed very little the accuracy of the matches, but greatly improved correlation values, indicating that the forest canopy might have the best features for geo-localization with template matching. Position estimation is essential for autonomous navigation of aerial vehicles and the these experiments with LiDAR data show potential for localization over densely forested regions where methods using optical camera data may fail to acquire distinguishable features.},

ABSTRACT = {Optical image sensors are the most common remote sensing data acquisition devices present in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS). In this context, assigning a location in a geographic frame of reference to the acquired image is a necessary task in the majority of the applications. This process is denominated direct georeferencing when ground control points are not used. Despite it applies simple mathematical fundamentals, the complete direct georeferencing process involves much information, such as camera sensor characteristics, mounting measurements, attitude and position of the UAS, among others. In addition, there are many rotations and translations between the different reference frames, among many other details, which makes the whole process a considerable complex operation. Another problem is that manufacturers and software tools may use different reference frames posing additional difficulty when implementing the direct georeferencing. As this information is spread among many sources, researchers may face difficulties on having a complete vision of the method. In fact, there is absolutely no paper in the literature that explain this process in a comprehensive way. In order to supply this implicit demand, this paper presents a comprehensive method for direct georeferencing of aerial images acquired by cameras mounted on UAS, where all required information, mathematical operations and implementation steps are explained in detail. Finally, in order to show the practical use of the method and to prove its accuracy, both simulated and real flights were performed, where objects of the acquired images were georeferenced.},

ABSTRACT = {Efficiently and automatically acquiring information on earthquake damage through remote sensing has posed great challenges because the classical methods of detecting houses damaged by destructive earthquakes are often both time consuming and low in accuracy. A series of deep-learning-based techniques have been developed and recent studies have demonstrated their high intelligence for automatic target extraction for natural and remote sensing images. For the detection of small artificial targets, current studies show that You Only Look Once (YOLO) has a good performance in aerial and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. However, less work has been conducted on the extraction of damaged houses. In this study, we propose a YOLOv5s-ViT-BiFPN-based neural network for the detection of rural houses. Specifically, to enhance the feature information of damaged houses from the global information of the feature map, we introduce the Vision Transformer into the feature extraction network. Furthermore, regarding the scale differences for damaged houses in UAV images due to the changes in flying height, we apply the Bi-Directional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) for multi-scale feature fusion to aggregate features with different resolutions and test the model. We took the 2021 Yangbi earthquake with a surface wave magnitude (Ms) of 6.4 in Yunan, China, as an example; the results show that the proposed model presents a better performance, with the average precision (AP) being increased by 9.31% and 1.23% compared to YOLOv3 and YOLOv5s, respectively, and a detection speed of 80 FPS, which is 2.96 times faster than YOLOv3. In addition, the transferability test for five other areas showed that the average accuracy was 91.23% and the total processing time was 4 min, while 100 min were needed for professional visual interpreters. The experimental results demonstrate that the YOLOv5s-ViT-BiFPN model can automatically detect damaged rural houses due to destructive earthquakes in UAV images with a good performance in terms of accuracy and timeliness, as well as being robust and transferable.},

ABSTRACT = {Winter wheat is a widely-grown cereal crop worldwide. Using growth-stage information to estimate winter wheat yields in a timely manner is essential for accurate crop management and rapid decision-making in sustainable agriculture, and to increase productivity while reducing environmental impact. UAV remote sensing is widely used in precision agriculture due to its flexibility and increased spatial and spectral resolution. Hyperspectral data are used to model crop traits because of their ability to provide continuous rich spectral information and higher spectral fidelity. In this study, hyperspectral image data of the winter wheat crop canopy at the flowering and grain-filling stages was acquired by a low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and machine learning was used to predict winter wheat yields. Specifically, a large number of spectral indices were extracted from the spectral data, and three feature selection methods, recursive feature elimination (RFE), Boruta feature selection, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), were used to filter high spectral indices in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Four major basic learner models, (1) support vector machine (SVM), (2) Gaussian process (GP), (3) linear ridge regression (LRR), and (4) random forest (RF), were also constructed, and an ensemble machine learning model was developed by combining the four base learner models. The results showed that the SVM yield prediction model, constructed on the basis of the preferred features, performed the best among the base learner models, with an R2 between 0.62 and 0.73. The accuracy of the proposed ensemble learner model was higher than that of each base learner model; moreover, the R2 (0.78) for the yield prediction model based on Boruta&rsquo;s preferred characteristics was the highest at the grain-filling stage.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles are prone to several cyber-attacks, including Global Positioning System spoofing. Several techniques have been proposed for detecting such attacks. However, the recurrence and frequent Global Positioning System spoofing incidents show a need for effective security solutions to protect unmanned aerial vehicles. In this paper, we propose two dynamic selection techniques, Metric Optimized Dynamic selector and Weighted Metric Optimized Dynamic selector, which identify the most effective classifier for the detection of such attacks. We develop a one-stage ensemble feature selection method to identify and discard the correlated and low importance features from the dataset. We implement the proposed techniques using ten machine-learning models and compare their performance in terms of four evaluation metrics: accuracy, probability of detection, probability of false alarm, probability of misdetection, and processing time. The proposed techniques dynamically choose the classifier with the best results for detecting attacks. The results indicate that the proposed dynamic techniques outperform the existing ensemble models with an accuracy of 99.6%, a probability of detection of 98.9%, a probability of false alarm of 1.56%, a probability of misdetection of 1.09%, and a processing time of 1.24 s.},

ABSTRACT = {The accurate and automated diagnosis of potato late blight disease, one of the most destructive potato diseases, is critical for precision agricultural control and management. Recent advances in remote sensing and deep learning offer the opportunity to address this challenge. This study proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning model (CropdocNet) for accurate and automated late blight disease diagnosis from UAV-based hyperspectral imagery. The proposed method considers the potential disease-specific reflectance radiation variance caused by the canopy&rsquo;s structural diversity and introduces multiple capsule layers to model the part-to-whole relationship between spectral&ndash;spatial features and the target classes to represent the rotation invariance of the target classes in the feature space. We evaluate the proposed method with real UAV-based HSI data under controlled and natural field conditions. The effectiveness of the hierarchical features is quantitatively assessed and compared with the existing representative machine learning/deep learning methods on both testing and independent datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed model significantly improves accuracy when considering the hierarchical structure of spectral&ndash;spatial features, with average accuracies of 98.09% for the testing dataset and 95.75% for the independent dataset, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote sensing of land surface mostly obtains a mixture of spectral information of soil and vegetation. It is thus of great value if soil and vegetation information can be acquired simultaneously from one model. In this study, we designed a laboratory experiment to simulate land surface compositions, including various soil types with varying soil moisture and vegetation coverage. A model of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) was established to simultaneously estimate soil properties (organic matter, soil moisture, clay, and sand) and vegetation coverage based on the hyperspectral data measured in the experiment. The results showed that the model achieved excellent predictions for soil properties (R2 = 0.88&ndash;0.91, RPIQ = 4.01&ndash;5.78) and vegetation coverage (R2 = 0.95, RPIQ = 7.75). Compared with the partial least-squares regression (PLSR), the prediction accuracy of 1DCNN improved 42.20%, 45.82%, 43.32%, and 36.46% in terms of the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) for predicting soil organic matter, sand, clay, and soil moisture, respectively. The improvement might be caused by the fact that the spectral preprocessing and spectral features useful for predicting soil properties were successfully identified in the 1DCNN model. For the prediction of vegetation coverage, although the prediction accuracy by 1DCNN was excellent, its performance (R2 = 0.95, RPIQ = 7.75, RMSE = 3.92%) was lower than the PLSR model (R2 = 0.98, RPIQ = 12.57, RMSE = 2.41%). These results indicate that 1DCNN can simultaneously predict soil properties and vegetation coverage. However, the factors such as surface roughness and vegetation type that could affect the prediction accuracy should be investigated in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Transmission towers are easily affected by various meteorological and geological disasters. In this paper, a transmission tower tilt state assessment approach&mdash;based on high precision and dense point cloud from UAV LiDAR&mdash;was proposed. First, the transmission tower point cloud was rapidly located and extracted from the 3D point cloud obtained by UAV-LiDAR line patrol. A robust histogram local extremum extraction method with additional constraints was proposed to achieve adaptive segmentation of the tower head and tower body point cloud. Second, an accurate and efficient extraction and simplification strategy of the contour of the feature plane point cloud was proposed. The central axis of the tower was constrained by the contour of the feature plane through the four-prism structure to calculate the tilt angle of the tower and evaluate the state of the tower. Finally, the point cloud of tower head from UAV-based LiDAR was accurately matched with the designed tower head model from database, and a tower head state evaluation model based on matching offset parameters was proposed to evaluate tower head tilt state. The experimental results of simulation and measured data showed that the calculation accuracy of the tilt parameters of transmission tower body was better than 0.5 degrees, that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the risk of tower head with complex structure, and improve the rapid and mass intelligent perception level of the risk state of the transmission line tower, which has a wide prospects for application.},

ABSTRACT = {According to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), the driving collision rate of using only the reversing camera system is lower than that of using both the reversing camera system and the reversing radar. In this article, we implemented a reversing camera system with artificial intelligence object detection to increase the information of the reversing image. Our system consists of an image processing chip (IPC) with wide-angle image distortion correction and an image buffer controller, a low-power KL520 chip and an optimized artificial intelligence model MobileNetV2-YOLOV3-Optimized (MNYLO). The results of the experiment show the three advantages of our system. Firstly, through the image distortion correction of IPC, we can restore the distorted reversing image. Secondly, by using a public dataset and collected images of various weathers for artificial intelligence model training, our system does not need to use image algorithms that eliminate bad weathers such as rain, fog, and snow to restore polluted images. Objects can still be detected by our system in images contaminated by weather. Thirdly, compared with the AI model Tiny_YOLOV3, not only the parameters of our MNYLO have been reduced by 72.3%, the amount of calculation has been reduced by 86.4%, but the object detection rate has also been maintained and avoided sharp drops.},

ABSTRACT = {The target recognition algorithm is one of the core technologies of Zanthoxylum pepper-picking robots. However, most existing detection algorithms cannot effectively detect Zanthoxylum fruit covered by branches, leaves and other fruits in natural scenes. To improve the work efficiency and adaptability of the Zanthoxylum-picking robot in natural environments, and to recognize and detect fruits in complex environments under different lighting conditions, this paper presents a Zanthoxylum-picking-robot target detection method based on improved YOLOv5s. Firstly, an improved CBF module based on the CBH module in the backbone is raised to improve the detection accuracy. Secondly, the Specter module based on CBF is presented to replace the bottleneck CSP module, which improves the speed of detection with a lightweight structure. Finally, the Zanthoxylum fruit algorithm is checked by the improved YOLOv5 framework, and the differences in detection between YOLOv3, YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 are analyzed and evaluated. Through these improvements, the recall rate, recognition accuracy and mAP of the YOLOv5s are 4.19%, 28.7% and 14.8% higher than those of the original YOLOv5s, YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 models, respectively. Furthermore, the model is transferred to the computing platform of the robot with the cutting-edge NVIDIA Jetson TX2 device. Several experiments are implemented on the TX2, yielding an average time of inference of 0.072, with an average GPU load in 30 s of 20.11%. This method can provide technical support for pepper-picking robots to detect multiple pepper fruits in real time.},

ABSTRACT = {There is currently a strong societal demand for sustainability, quality, and safety in bread wheat production. To address these challenges, new and innovative knowledge, resources, tools, and methods to facilitate breeding are needed. This starts with the development of high throughput genomic tools including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, high density molecular marker maps, and full genome sequences. Such powerful tools are essential to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to implement genomic and phenomic selection, and to characterize the worldwide diversity. This is also useful to breeders to broaden the genetic basis of elite varieties through the introduction of novel sources of genetic diversity. Improvement in varieties particularly relies on the detection of genomic regions involved in agronomical traits including tolerance to biotic (diseases and pests) and abiotic (drought, nutrient deficiency, high temperature) stresses. When enough resolution is achieved, this can result in the identification of candidate genes that could further be characterized to identify relevant alleles. Breeding must also now be approached through in silico modeling to simulate plant development, investigate genotype &times; environment interactions, and introduce marker&ndash;trait linkage information in the models to better implement genomic selection. Breeders must be aware of new developments and the information must be made available to the world wheat community to develop new high-yielding varieties that can meet the challenge of higher wheat production in a sustainable and fluctuating agricultural context. In this review, we compiled all knowledge and tools produced during the BREEDWHEAT project to show how they may contribute to face this challenge in the coming years.},

ABSTRACT = {As one type of object detection, small object detection has been widely used in daily-life-related applications with many real-time requirements, such as autopilot and navigation. Although deep-learning-based object detection methods have achieved great success in recent years, they are not effective in small object detection and most of them cannot achieve real-time processing. Therefore, this paper proposes a single-stage small object detection network (SODNet) that integrates the specialized feature extraction and information fusion techniques. An adaptively spatial parallel convolution module (ASPConv) is proposed to alleviate the lack of spatial information for target objects and adaptively obtain the corresponding spatial information through multi-scale receptive fields, thereby improving the feature extraction ability. Additionally, a split-fusion sub-module (SF) is proposed to effectively reduce the time complexity of ASPConv. A fast multi-scale fusion module (FMF) is proposed to alleviate the insufficient fusion of both semantic and spatial information. FMF uses two fast upsampling operators to first unify the resolution of the multi-scale feature maps extracted by the network and then fuse them, thereby effectively improving the small object detection ability. Comparative experimental results prove that the proposed method considerably improves the accuracy of small object detection on multiple benchmark datasets and achieves a high real-time performance.},

ABSTRACT = {During the charging process of electric vehicles (EV), the circuit inside the charger plug is connected in series, the charger input voltage does not match the rated input voltage, the temperature caused by the severe heating of the charging time is too high for too long, and other factors are very likely to trigger a fire in the vehicle charging pile. In this paper, an improved You Only Look Once v4 (YOLOv4) real-time target detection algorithm based on machine vision is proposed to monitor the site based on existing monitoring equipment, transmit live video information in real-time, expand the monitoring range, and significantly reduce the cost of use. During the experiment, the improved neural network model was trained by a homemade fire video image dataset, and a K-means clustering algorithm iwasintroduced to recalculate the anchor frame size for the specific object of flame; the existing dataset was used to perform multiple divisions by using a tenfold cross-validation algorithm, thus avoiding the selection of chance hyperparameters and models that do not have generalization ability because of special divisions. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm is fast and accurate in detecting large-size flames in real-time and small-size flames at the beginning of a fire, with a detection speed of 43 fps/s, mAP value of 91.53%, and F1 value of 0.91. Compared with YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 models, the improved model is sensitive to detecting different sizes of flames. It can suppress false alarms well in a variety of complex lighting environments. The prediction frame size fits the area where the target is located, the detection accuracy remains stable, and the comprehensive performance of the network model is significantly improved to meet the demand of real-time monitoring. It is significant for developing the EV industry and enhancing emergency response capability.},

ABSTRACT = {To find an economical solution to infer the depth of the surrounding environment of unmanned agricultural vehicles (UAV), a lightweight depth estimation model called MonoDA based on a convolutional neural network is proposed. A series of sequential frames from monocular videos are used to train the model. The model is composed of two subnetworks&mdash;the depth estimation subnetwork and the pose estimation subnetwork. The former is a modified version of U-Net that reduces the number of bridges, while the latter takes EfficientNet-B0 as its backbone network to extract the features of sequential frames and predict the pose transformation relations between the frames. The self-supervised strategy is adopted during the training, which means the depth information labels of frames are not needed. Instead, the adjacent frames in the image sequence and the reprojection relation of the pose are used to train the model. Subnetworks&rsquo; outputs (depth map and pose relation) are used to reconstruct the input frame, then a self-supervised loss between the reconstructed input and the original input is calculated. Finally, the loss is employed to update the parameters of the two subnetworks through the backward pass. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the model&rsquo;s performance, and the results show that MonoDA has competitive accuracy over the KITTI raw dataset as well as our vineyard dataset. Besides, our method also possessed the advantage of non-sensitivity to color. On the computing platform of our UAV&rsquo;s environment perceptual system NVIDIA JETSON TX2, the model could run at 18.92 FPS. To sum up, our approach provides an economical solution for depth estimation by using monocular cameras, which achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and speed and can be used as a novel auxiliary depth detection paradigm for UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {Wheat accounts for more than 50% of Australia&rsquo;s total grain production. The capability to generate accurate in-season yield predictions is important across all components of the agricultural value chain. The literature on wheat yield prediction has motivated the need for more novel works evaluating machine learning techniques such as random forests (RF) at multiple scales. This research applied a Random Forest Regression (RFR) technique to build regional and local-scale yield prediction models at the pixel level for three southeast Australian wheat-growing paddocks, each located in Victoria (VIC), New South Wales (NSW) and South Australia (SA) using 2018 yield maps from data supplied by collaborating farmers. Time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from Planet&rsquo;s high spatio-temporal resolution imagery, meteorological variables and yield data were used to train, test and validate the models at pixel level using Python libraries for (a) regional-scale three-paddock composite and (b) individual paddocks. The composite region-wide RF model prediction for the three paddocks performed well (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.18 t ha&minus;1). RF models for individual paddocks in VIC (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.15 t ha&minus;1) and NSW (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.07 t ha&minus;1) performed well, but moderate performance was seen for SA (R2 = 0.45, RMSE = 0.25 t ha&minus;1). Generally, high values were underpredicted and low values overpredicted. This study demonstrated the feasibility of applying RF modeling on satellite imagery and yielded &lsquo;big data&rsquo; for regional as well as local-scale yield prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {The continuous development of technical innovations provides the opportunity to create new economic markets and a wealth of new services. However, these innovations sometimes raise concerns, notably in terms of societal, safety, and environmental impacts. This is the case for services related to the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which are emerging rapidly. Unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones, date back to the first third of the twentieth century in aviation industry, when they were mostly used for military purposes. Nowadays, drones of various types and sizes are used for many purposes, such as precision agriculture, search and rescue missions, aerial photography, shipping and delivery, etc. Starting to operate in areas with low population density, drones are now looking for business in urban and suburban areas, in what is called urban air mobility (UAM). However, this rapid growth of the drone industry creates psychological fear of the unknown in some parts of society. Reducing this fear will play an important role in public acceptance of drone operations in urban areas. This paper presents the main concerns of society with regard to drone operations, as already captured in some public surveys, and proposes a list of mitigation measures to reduce these concerns. The proposed list is then analyzed, and its applicability to individual, urban, very large demonstration flights is explained, using the feedback from the CORUS-XUAM project. CORUS-XUAM will organize a set of very large drone flight demonstrations across seven European countries to investigate how to safely integrate drone operations into airspace with the support of the U-space.},

ABSTRACT = {Analysis of the spectral response of vegetation using optical sensors for non-destructive remote monitoring represents a key element for crop monitoring. Considering the wide presence on the market of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs) based commercial solutions, the need emerges for clear information on the performance of these products to guide the end-user in their choice and utilization for precision agriculture applications. This work aims to compare two UAV based commercial products, represented by DJI P4M and SENOP HSC-2 for the acquisition of multispectral and hyperspectral images, respectively, in vineyards. The accuracy of both cameras was evaluated on 6 different targets commonly found in vineyards, represented by bare soil, bare-stony soil, stony soil, soil with dry grass, partially grass covered soil and canopy. Given the importance of the radiometric calibration, four methods for multispectral images correction were evaluated, taking in account the irradiance sensor equipped on the camera (M1&ndash;M2) and the use of an empirical line model (ELM) based on reference reflectance panels (M3&ndash;M4). In addition, different DJI P4M exposure setups were evaluated. The performance of the cameras was evaluated by means of the calculation of three widely used vegetation indices (VIs), as percentage error (PE) with respect to ground truth spectroradiometer measurements. The results highlighted the importance of reference panels for the radiometric calibration of multispectral images (M1&ndash;M2 average PE = 21.8&ndash;100.0%; M3&ndash;M4 average PE = 11.9&ndash;29.5%). Generally, the hyperspectral camera provided the best accuracy with a PE ranging between 1.0% and 13.6%. Both cameras showed higher performance on the pure canopy pixel target, compared to mixed targets. However, this issue can be easily solved by applying widespread segmentation techniques for the row extraction. This work provides insights to assist end-users in the UAV spectral monitoring to obtain reliable information for the analysis of spatio-temporal variability within vineyards.},

ABSTRACT = {Degradation of forest roads in Canada has strong negative effects on access to forestlands, together with economic (e.g., increased maintenance costs), environmental (e.g., erosion of materials and subsequent habitat contamination), and social (e.g., use risks) impacts. Maintaining sustainable and safe access to forestland requires a better understanding and knowledge of forest road degradation over time and space. Our study aimed to identify relevant spatiotemporal variables regarding the state of eastern Canadian forest road networks by (1) building predictive models of gravel forest road degradation and assessing effects of the slope, time, loss of the road surface, and road width (field approach), and (2) evaluating the potential of topography, roughness and vegetation indices obtained from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data and Sentinel-2 optical images to estimate degradation rates (remote sensing approach). The field approach (n = 207 sample plots) confirmed that only four variables were efficient to estimate degradation rates (pseudo-R2 = 0.43 with &plusmn;8% error). Simulations that were conducted showed that after about five years without maintenance, the rate of degradation on a road, regardless of its width, increased exponentially, exacerbated by a high slope gradient and loss of road surface. The narrowest roads tended to degrade more rapidly over time. The remote sensing approach performed quite well (pseudo-R2 = 0.34 with &plusmn;9% error) in terms of predicting road degradation, giving us the valuable tools to spatialise the state of gravel forest road degradation in eastern Canadian forest. This study provided new knowledge and tools that are critical for maintaining and sustaining access to Canada&rsquo;s boreal forest territory in both the short- and the long-term.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper assumes that considering the unknown and time-varying nature of different strong and weak wind field disturbances and considering the nonlinear, under-driven, strongly coupled quadrotor carrying, a load is disturbed by the complex and variable wind field and unmodeled parts when flying in the real external environment, which will reduce the control effect of the nonlinear controller and make the vehicle fail to affect the flight effect. In order to ensure that the quadrotor carrying a load can carry supplies in the harsh environment for stable trajectory tracking, a neural network adaptive control algorithm is introduced in the article. The neural network algorithm has the role of online dynamic approximation, the compensation of arbitrary external disturbance and the compensation of external disturbance. Its structure is simple and low computation. In the article, the Lyapunov method is used to design the adaptive weight and estimate the weight of the online neural network, and the stability of the system is proved. Finally, the comparison of three algorithms verified by simulation proves that the above interference problem can be solved effectively by the proposed algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of trees and their spatial distribution are key information for forest management. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have been proposed and shown promising results in lowering the expensive labor cost of a forest inventory. In this paper, we propose a new efficient deep learning model called density transformer or DENT for automatic tree counting from aerial images. The architecture of DENT contains a multi-receptive field convolutional neural network to extract visual feature representation from local patches and their wide context, a transformer encoder to transfer contextual information across correlated positions, a density map generator to generate spatial distribution map of trees, and a fast tree counter to estimate the number of trees in each input image. We compare DENT with a variety of state-of-art methods, including one-stage and two-stage, anchor-based and anchor-free deep neural detectors, and different types of fully convolutional regressors for density estimation. The methods are evaluated on a new large dataset we built and an existing cross-site dataset. DENT achieves top accuracy on both datasets, significantly outperforming most of the other methods. We have released our new dataset, called Yosemite Tree Dataset, containing a 10 km2 rectangular study area with around 100k trees annotated, as a benchmark for public access.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing world population makes it necessary to fight challenges such as climate change and to realize production efficiently and quickly. However, the minimum cost, maximum income, environmental pollution protection and the ability to save water and energy are all factors that should be taken into account in this process. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agriculture to meet all of these criteria serves the purpose of precision agriculture. As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can easily obtain real-time data, they have a great potential to address and optimize solutions to the problems faced by agriculture. Despite some limitations, such as the battery, load, weather conditions, etc., UAVs will be used frequently in agriculture in the future because of the valuable data that they obtain and their efficient applications. According to the known literature, UAVs have been carrying out tasks such as spraying, monitoring, yield estimation, weed detection, etc. In recent years, articles related to agricultural UAVs have been presented in journals with high impact factors. Most precision agriculture applications with UAVs occur in outdoor environments where GPS access is available, which provides more reliable control of the UAV in both manual and autonomous flights. On the other hand, there are almost no UAV-based applications in greenhouses where all-season crop production is available. This paper emphasizes this deficiency and provides a comprehensive review of the use of UAVs for agricultural tasks and highlights the importance of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a UAV solution in the greenhouse.},

ABSTRACT = {Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) focuses on tracking all the objects in a video. Most MOT solutions follow a tracking-by-detection or a joint detection tracking paradigm to generate the object trajectories by exploiting the correlations between the detected objects in consecutive frames. However, according to our observations, considering only the correlations between the objects in the current frame and the objects in the previous frame will lead to an exponential information decay over time, thus resulting in a misidentification of the object, especially in scenes with dense crowds and occlusions. To address this problem, we propose an effectively finite-tailed updating (FTU) strategy to generate the appearance template of the object in the current frame by exploiting its local temporal context in videos. To be specific, we model the appearance template for the object in the current frame on the appearance templates of the objects in multiple earlier frames and dynamically combine them to obtain a more effective representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the experimental results show that our tracker outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on MOT Challenge Benchmark. We have achieved 73.7% and 73.0% IDF1, and 46.1% and 45.0% MT on the MOT16 and MOT17 datasets, which are 0.9% and 0.7% IDFI higher, and 1.4% and 1.8% MT higher than FairMOT repsectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate and timely mapping of crop types and having reliable information about the cultivation pattern/area play a key role in various applications, including food security and sustainable agriculture management. Remote sensing (RS) has extensively been employed for crop type classification. However, accurate mapping of crop types and extents is still a challenge, especially using traditional machine learning methods. Therefore, in this study, a novel framework based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and a dual attention module (DAM) and using Sentinel-2 time-series datasets was proposed to classify crops. A new DAM was implemented to extract informative deep features by taking advantage of both spectral and spatial characteristics of Sentinel-2 datasets. The spectral and spatial attention modules (AMs) were respectively applied to investigate the behavior of crops during the growing season and their neighborhood properties (e.g., textural characteristics and spatial relation to surrounding crops). The proposed network contained two streams: (1) convolution blocks for deep feature extraction and (2) several DAMs, which were employed after each convolution block. The first stream included three multi-scale residual convolution blocks, where the spectral attention blocks were mainly applied to extract deep spectral features. The second stream was built using four multi-scale convolution blocks with a spatial AM. In this study, over 200,000 samples from six different crop types (i.e., alfalfa, broad bean, wheat, barley, canola, and garden) and three non-crop classes (i.e., built-up, barren, and water) were collected to train and validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved high overall accuracy and a Kappa coefficient of 98.54% and 0.981, respectively. It also outperformed other state-of-the-art classification methods, including RF, XGBOOST, R-CNN, 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN, and CBAM, indicating its high potential to discriminate different crop types.},

ABSTRACT = {Smallholder farmers depend on healthy and productive crop yields to sustain their socio-economic status and ensure livelihood security. Advances in South African precision agriculture in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide spatially explicit near-real-time information that can be used to assess crop dynamics and inform smallholder farmers. The use of UAVs with remote-sensing techniques allows for the acquisition of high spatial resolution data at various spatio-temporal planes, which is particularly useful at the scale of fields and farms. Specifically, crop chlorophyll content is assessed as it is one of the best known and reliable indicators of crop health, due to its biophysical pigment and biochemical processes that indicate plant productivity. In this regard, the study evaluated the utility of multispectral UAV imagery using the random forest machine learning algorithm to estimate the chlorophyll content of maize through the various growth stages. The results showed that the near-infrared and red-edge wavelength bands and vegetation indices derived from these wavelengths were essential for estimating chlorophyll content during the phenotyping of maize. Furthermore, the random forest model optimally estimated the chlorophyll content of maize over the various phenological stages. Particularly, maize chlorophyll was best predicted during the early reproductive, late vegetative, and early vegetative growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 40.4 &micro;mol/m&minus;2, 39 &micro;mol/m&minus;2, and 61.6 &micro;mol/m&minus;2, respectively. The least accurate chlorophyll content results were predicted during the mid-reproductive and late reproductive growth stages to RMSE accuracies of 66.6 &micro;mol/m&minus;2 and 69.6 &micro;mol/m&minus;2, respectively, as a consequence of a hailstorm. A resultant chlorophyll variation map of the maize growth stages captured the spatial heterogeneity of chlorophyll within the maize field. Therefore, the study&rsquo;s findings demonstrate that the use of remotely sensed UAV imagery with a robust machine algorithm is a critical tool to support the decision-making and management in smallholder farms.},

ABSTRACT = {Fast and accurate acquisition of the outline of rural buildings on remote sensing images is an efficient method to monitor illegal rural buildings. The traditional object detection method produces useless background information when detecting rural buildings; the semantic segmentation method cannot accurately segment the contours between buildings; the instance segmentation method cannot obtain regular building contours. The rotated object detection methods can effectively solve the problem that the traditional artificial intelligence method cannot accurately extract the outline of buildings. However, the rotated object detection methods are easy to lose location information of small objects in advanced feature maps and are sensitive to noise. To resolve these problems, this paper proposes a two-stage rotated object detection network for rural buildings (TRDet) by using a deep feature fusion network (DFF-Net) and a pixel attention module (PAM). Specifically, TRDet first fuses low-level location and high-level semantic information through the DFF-Net and then reduces the interference of noise information to the network through the PAM. The experimental results show that the mean average precession (mAP), precision, recall rate, and F1 score of the proposed TRDet are 83.57%, 91.11%, 86.5%, and 88.74%, respectively, which outperform the R2CNN model by 15%, 15.54%, 4.01%, and 9.87%. The results demonstrate that the TRDet can achieve better detection in small rural buildings and dense rural buildings.},

ABSTRACT = {Using reinforcement learning (RL) for torque distribution of skid steering vehicles has attracted increasing attention recently. Various RL-based torque distribution methods have been proposed to deal with this classical vehicle control problem, achieving a better performance than traditional control methods. However, most RL-based methods focus only on improving the performance of skid steering vehicles, while actuator faults that may lead to unsafe conditions or catastrophic events are frequently omitted in existing control schemes. This study proposes a meta-RL-based fault-tolerant control (FTC) method to improve the tracking performance of vehicles in the case of actuator faults. Based on meta deep deterministic policy gradient (meta-DDPG), the proposed FTC method has a representative gradient-based metalearning algorithm workflow, which includes an offline stage and an online stage. In the offline stage, an experience replay buffer with various actuator faults is constructed to provide data for training the metatraining model; then, the metatrained model is used to develop an online meta-RL update method to quickly adapt its control policy to actuator fault conditions. Simulations of four scenarios demonstrate that the proposed FTC method can achieve a high performance and adapt to actuator fault conditions stably.},
