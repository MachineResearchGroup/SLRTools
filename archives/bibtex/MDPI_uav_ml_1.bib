ABSTRACT = {The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), formerly known as the Millennium Dam, is currently under construction and has been filling at a fast rate without sufficient known analysis on possible impacts on the body of the structure. The filling of GERD not only has an impact on the Blue Nile Basin hydrology, water storage and flow but also poses massive risks in case of collapse. Rosaries Dam located in Sudan at only 116 km downstream of GERD, along with the 20 million Sudanese benefiting from that dam, would be seriously threatened in case of the collapse of GERD. In this study, through the analysis of Sentinal-1 satellite imagery, we show concerning deformation patterns associated with different sections of the GERD’s Main Dam (structure RCC Dam type) and the Saddle Dam (Embankment Dam type). We processed 109 descending mode scenes from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, from December 2016 to July 2021, using the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry technique to demonstrate the deformation trends of both—the GERD’s Main and Saddle Dams. The time series generated from the analysis clearly indicates different displacement trends at various sections of the GERD as well as the Saddle Dam. Results of the multi-temporal data analysis on and around the project area show inconsistent subsidence at the extremities of the GERD Main Dam, especially the west side of the dam where we recorded varying displacements in the range of 10 mm to 90 mm at the crest of the dam. We conducted the current analysis after masking the images with a coherence value of 0.9 and hence, the subsequent results are extremely reliable and accurate. Further decomposition of the subsiding rate has revealed higher vertical displacement over the west side of the GERD’s Main Dam as compared to the east side. The local geological structures consisting of weak zones under the GERD’s accompanying Saddle Dam adds further instability to its structure. We identified seven critical nodes on the Saddle Dam that match the tectonic faults lying underneath it, and which display a varying degree of vertical displacements. In fact, the nodes located next to each other displayed varying displacement trends: one or more nodes displayed subsidence since 2017 while the other node in the same section displayed uplift. The geological weak zones underneath and the weight of the Saddle Dam itself may somewhat explain this inconsistency and the non-uniform vertical displacements. For the most affected cells, we observed a total displacement value of ~90 mm during the whole study period (~20 mm/year) for the Main Dam while the value of the total displacement for the Saddle dam is ~380 mm during the same period (~85 mm/year). Analysis through CoastSat tool also suggested a non-uniformity in trends of surface water-edge at the two extremities of the Main Dam.},

ABSTRACT = {Typhoon Goni crossed several provinces in the Philippines where agriculture has high socioeconomic importance, including the top-3 provinces in terms of planted coconut trees. We have used a computational model to infer coconut tree density from satellite images before and after the typhoon’s passage, and in this way estimate the number of damaged trees. Our area of study around the typhoon’s path covers 15.7 Mha, and includes 47 of the 87 provinces in the Philippines. In validation areas our model predicts coconut tree density with a Mean Absolute Error of 5.9 Trees/ha. In Camarines Sur we estimated that 3.5 M of the 4.6 M existing coconut trees were damaged by the typhoon. Overall we estimated that 14.1 M coconut trees were affected by the typhoon inside our area of study. Our validation images confirm that trees are rarely uprooted and damages are largely due to reduced canopy cover of standing trees. On validation areas, our model was able to detect affected coconut trees with 88.6% accuracy, 75% precision and 90% recall. Our method delivers spatially fine-grained change maps for coconut plantations in the area of study, including unchanged, damaged and new trees. Beyond immediate damage assessment, gradual changes in coconut density may serve as a proxy for future changes in yield.},

ABSTRACT = {Point cloud classification plays a significant role in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) applications. However, most available multi-scale feature learning networks for large-scale 3D LiDAR point cloud classification tasks are time-consuming. In this paper, an efficient deep neural architecture denoted as Point Expanded Multi-scale Convolutional Network (PEMCNet) is developed to accurately classify the 3D LiDAR point cloud. Different from traditional networks for point cloud processing, PEMCNet includes successive Point Expanded Grouping (PEG) units and Absolute and Relative Spatial Embedding (ARSE) units for representative point feature learning. The PEG unit enables us to progressively increase the receptive field for each observed point and aggregate the feature of a point cloud at different scales but without increasing computation. The ARSE unit following the PEG unit furthermore realizes representative encoding of points relationship, which effectively preserves the geometric details between points. We evaluate our method on both public datasets (the Urban Semantic 3D (US3D) dataset and Semantic3D benchmark dataset) and our new collected Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based LiDAR point cloud data of the campus of Guangdong University of Technology. In comparison with four available state-of-the-art methods, our methods ranked first place regarding both efficiency and accuracy. It was observed on the public datasets that with a 2% increase in classification accuracy, over 26% improvement of efficiency was achieved at the same time compared to the second efficient method. Its potential value is also tested on the newly collected point cloud data with over 91% of classification accuracy and 154 ms of processing time.},

ABSTRACT = {In the Alps, understanding how climate change is affecting evapotranspiration (ET) is relevant due to possible implications on water availability for large lowland areas of Europe. Here, changes in ET were studied based on 20 years of MODIS data. MOD16 and operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) products were compared with eddy-covariance data and analyzed for trend detection. The two products showed a similar relationship with ground observations, with RMSE between 0.69 and 2 mm day−1, and a correlation coefficient between 0.6 and 0.83. A regression with the potential drivers of ET showed that, for climate variables, ground data were coherent with MOD16 at grassland sites, where r2 was 0.12 for potential ET, 0.17 for precipitation, and 0.57 for air temperature, whereas ground data agreed with SSEBop at forest sites, with an r2 of 0.46 for precipitation, no correlation with temperature, and negative correlation with potential ET. Interestingly, ground-based correlation corresponded to SSEBop for leaf area index (LAI), while it matched with MOD16 for land surface temperature (LST). Through the trend analysis, both MOD16 and SSEBop revealed positive trends in the south-west, and negative trends in the south and north-east. Moreover, in summer, positive trends prevailed at high elevations for grasslands and forests, while negative trends dominated at low elevations for croplands and grasslands. However, the Alpine area share with positive ET trends was 16.6% for MOD16 and 3.9% for SSEBop, while the share with negative trends was 1.2% for MOD16 and 15.3% for SSEBop. A regression between trends in ET and in climate variables, LST, and LAI indicated consistency, especially between ET, temperature, and LAI increase, but low correlation. Overall, the discrepancies in the trends, and the fact that none of the two products outperformed the other when compared to ground data, suggest that, in the Alps, SSEBop and MOD16 might not be accurate enough to be a robust basis to study ET changes.},

ABSTRACT = {As wireless sensor networks have become more prevalent, data from sensors in daily life are constantly being recorded. Due to cost or energy consumption considerations, optimization-based approaches are proposed to reduce deployed sensors and yield results within the error tolerance. The correlation-aware method is also designed in a mathematical model that combines theoretical and practical perspectives. The sensor deployment strategies, including XGBoost, Pearson correlation, and Lagrangian Relaxation (LR), are determined to minimize deployment costs while maintaining estimation errors below a given threshold. Moreover, the results significantly ensure the accuracy of the gathered information while minimizing the cost of deployment and maximizing the lifetime of the WSN. Furthermore, the proposed solution can be readily applied to sensor distribution problems in various fields.},

ABSTRACT = {Aquaculture has grown rapidly in the field of food industry in recent years; however, it brought many environmental problems, such as water pollution and reclamations of lakes and coastal wetland areas. Thus, the evaluation and management of aquaculture industry are needed, in which accurate aquaculture mapping is an essential prerequisite. Due to the difference between inland and marine aquaculture areas and the difficulty in processing large amounts of remote sensing images, the accurate mapping of different aquaculture types is still challenging. In this study, a novel approach based on multi-source spectral and texture features was proposed to map simultaneously inland and marine aquaculture areas. Time series optical Sentinel-2 images were first employed to derive spectral indices for obtaining texture features. The backscattering and texture features derived from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of Sentinel-1A were then used to distinguish aquaculture areas from other geographical entities. Finally, a supervised Random Forest classifier was applied for large scale aquaculture area mapping. To address the low efficiency in processing large amounts of remote sensing images, the proposed approach was implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. A case study in the Pearl River Basin (Guangdong Province) of China showed that the proposed approach obtained aquaculture map with an overall accuracy of 89.5%, and the implementation of proposed approach on GEE platform greatly improved the efficiency for large scale aquaculture area mapping. The derived aquaculture map may support decision-making services for the sustainable development of aquaculture areas and ecological protection in the study area, and the proposed approach holds great potential for mapping aquacultures on both national and global scales.},

ABSTRACT = {The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has subverted people’s lives, causing the rapid development of sensor technologies. However, traditional sensor energy sources, like batteries, suffer from the pollution problem and the limited lifetime for powering widely implemented electronics or sensors. Therefore, it is essential to obtain self-powered sensors integrated with renewable energy harvesters. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which can convert the surrounding mechanical energy into electrical energy based on the surface triboelectrification effect, was born of this background. This paper systematically introduces the working principle of the TENG-based self-powered sensor, including the triboelectrification effect, Maxwell’s displacement current, and quantitative analysis method. Meanwhile, this paper also reviews the recent application of TENG in different fields and summarizes the future development and current problems of TENG. We believe that there will be a rise of TENG-based self-powered sensors in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {There is tremendous demand for marine environmental observation, which requires the development of a multi-agent cooperative observation algorithm to guide Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to observe isotherm data of the mesoscale vortex. The task include two steps: firstly, USVs search out the isotherm, navigate independently along the isotherm, and collect marine data; secondly, a UAV takes off, and in its one round trip, the UAV and USVs jointly perform the task of the UAV reading the observation data from USVs. In this paper, aiming at the first problem of the USV following the isotherm in an unknown environment, a data-driven Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) control algorithm is designed that allows USVs to navigate independently along isotherms in unknown environments. In addition, a hybrid cooperative control algorithm based on a multi-agent DDPG is adopted to solve the second problem, which enables USVs and a UAV to complete data reading tasks with the shortest flight distance of the UAV. The experimental simulation results show that the trained system can complete this tas, with good stability and accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {The assessment of rice panicle initiation is crucial for the management of nitrogen fertilizer application that affects yield and quality of grain. The occurrence of panicle initiation could be determined via either green ring, internode-elongation, or a 1–2 mm panicle, and was observed through manual dissection. The quadratic polynomial regression model was used to construct the model of the trend of normalized difference vegetation index-based vegetation indexes (NDVI-based VIs) between pre-tillering and panicle differentiation stages. The slope of the quadratic polynomial regression model tended to be alleviated in the period in which the panicle initiation stage should occur. The results indicated that the trend of the NDVI-based VIs was correlated with panicle initiation. NDVI-based VIs could be a useful indicator to remotely assess panicle initiation.},

ABSTRACT = {Modeling forest fire spread is a very complex problem, and the existing models usually need some input parameters which are hard to get. How to predict the time series of forest fire spread rate based on passed series may be a key problem to break through the current technical bottleneck. In the process of forest fire spreading, spread rate and wind speed would affect each other. In this paper, three kinds of network models based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are designed to predict fire spread rate, exploring the interaction between fire and wind. In order to train these LSTM-based models and validate their effectiveness of prediction, several outdoor combustion experiments are designed and carried out. Process data sets of forest fire spreading are collected with an infrared camera mounted on a UAV, and wind data sets are recorded using a anemometer simultaneously. According to the close relationship between wind and fire, three progressive LSTM based models are constructed, which are called CSG-LSTM, MDG-LSTM and FNU-LSTM, respectively. A Cross-Entropy Loss equation is employed to measure the model training quality, and then prediction accuracy is computed and analyzed by comparing with the true fire spread rate and wind speed. According to the performance of training and prediction stage, FNU-LSTM is determined as the best model for the general case. The advantage of FNU-LSTM is further demonstrated by doing comparison experiments with the normal LSTM and other LSTM based models which predict both fire spread rate and wind speed separately. The experiment has also demonstrated the ability of the model to the real fire prediction on the basis of two historical wildland fires.},

ABSTRACT = {Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) or drones’ technologies have gained much attraction in the last few years due to their critical applications. Therefore, various studies have been conducted on facilitating FANET applications in different fields. In fact, civil airspaces have gradually adopted FANET technology in their systems. However, FANET’s special roles made it complex to support emerging security threats, especially intrusion detection. This paper is a step forward towards the advances in FANET intrusion detection techniques. It investigates FANET intrusion detection threats by introducing a real-time data analytics framework based on deep learning. The framework consists of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) as a base. It also involves collecting data from the network and analyzing it using big data analytics for anomaly detection. The data collection is performed through an agent working inside each FANET. The agent is assumed to log the FANET real-time information. In addition, it involves a stream processing module that collects the drones’ communication information, including intrusion detection-related information. This information is fed into two RNN modules for data analysis, trained for this purpose. One of the RNN modules resides inside the FANET itself, and the second module resides at the base station. An extensive set of experiments were conducted based on various datasets to examine the efficiency of the proposed framework. The results showed that the proposed framework is superior to other recent approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {The two-part series of papers provides a survey on recent advances in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an approach to simulate the human’s natural learning process, whose key is to let the agent learn by interacting with the stochastic environment. The fact that the agent has limited access to the information of the environment enables AI to be applied efficiently in most fields that require self-learning. It’s essential to have an organized investigation—we can make good comparisons and choose the best structures or algorithms when applying DRL in various applications. The first part of the overview introduces Markov Decision Processes (MDP) problems and Reinforcement Learning and applications of DRL for solving POMDP problems in games, robotics, and natural language processing. In part two, we continue to introduce applications in transportation, industries, communications and networking, etc. and discuss the limitations of DRL.},

ABSTRACT = {A census of endangered plant populations is critical to determining their size, spatial distribution, and geographical extent. Traditional, on-the-ground methods for collecting census data are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Use of drone imagery coupled with application of rapidly advancing deep learning technology could greatly reduce the effort and cost of collecting and analyzing population-level data across relatively large areas. We used a customization of the YOLOv5 object detection model to identify and count individual dwarf bear poppy (Arctomecon humilis) plants in drone imagery obtained at 40 m altitude. We compared human-based and model-based detection at 40 m on n = 11 test plots for two areas that differed in image quality. The model out-performed human visual poppy detection for precision and recall, and was 1100× faster at inference/evaluation on the test plots. Model inference precision was 0.83, and recall was 0.74, while human evaluation resulted in precision of 0.67, and recall of 0.71. Both model and human performance were better in the area with higher-quality imagery, suggesting that image quality is a primary factor limiting model performance. Evaluation of drone-based census imagery from the 255 ha Webb Hill population with our customized YOLOv5 model was completed in &lt;3 h and provided a reasonable estimate of population size (7414 poppies) with minimal investment of on-the-ground resources.},

ABSTRACT = {Semi-natural grasslands contribute highly to biodiversity and other ecosystem services, but they are at risk by the spread of invasive plant species, which alter their habitat structure. Large area grassland monitoring can be a powerful tool to manage invaded ecosystems. Therefore, WorldView-3 multispectral sensor data was utilized to train multiple machine learning algorithms in an automatic machine learning workflow called ‘H2O AutoML’ to detect L. polyphyllus in a nature protection grassland ecosystem. Different degree of L. polyphyllus cover was collected on 3 × 3 m2 reference plots, and multispectral bands, indices, and texture features were used in a feature selection process to identify the most promising classification model and machine learning algorithm based on mean per class error, log loss, and AUC metrics. The best performance was achieved with a binary classification of lupin-free vs. fully invaded 3 × 3 m2 plot classification with a set of 7 features out of 763. The findings reveal that L. polyphyllus detection from WorldView-3 sensor data is limited to large dominant spots and not recommendable for lower plant coverage, especially single plant detection. Further research is needed to clarify if different phenological stages of L. polyphyllus as well as time series increase classification performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Algae serves as a food source for a wide range of aquatic species; however, a high concentration of inorganic nutrients under favorable conditions can result in the development of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Many studies have addressed HAB detection and monitoring; however, no global scale meta-analysis has specifically explored remote sensing-based HAB monitoring. Therefore, this manuscript elucidates and visualizes spatiotemporal trends in HAB detection and monitoring using remote sensing methods and discusses future insights through a meta-analysis of 420 journal articles. The results indicate an increase in the quantity of published articles which have facilitated the analysis of sensors, software, and HAB proxy estimation methods. The comparison across multiple studies highlighted the need for a standardized reporting method for HAB proxy estimation. Research gaps include: (1) atmospheric correction methods, particularly for turbid waters, (2) the use of analytical-based models, (3) the application of machine learning algorithms, (4) the generation of harmonized virtual constellation and data fusion for increased spatial and temporal resolutions, and (5) the use of cloud-computing platforms for large scale HAB detection and monitoring. The planned hyperspectral satellites will aid in filling these gaps to some extent. Overall, this review provides a snapshot of spatiotemporal trends in HAB monitoring to assist in decision making for future studies.},

ABSTRACT = {Most of the allometric models used to estimate tree aboveground biomass rely on tree diameter at breast height (DBH). However, it is difficult to measure DBH from airborne remote sensors, and is common to draw upon traditional least squares linear regression models to relate DBH with dendrometric variables measured from airborne sensors, such as tree height (H) and crown diameter (CD). This study explores the usefulness of ensemble-type supervised machine learning regression algorithms, such as random forest regression (RFR), categorical boosting (CatBoost), gradient boosting (GBoost), or AdaBoost regression (AdaBoost), as an alternative to linear regression (LR) for modelling the allometric relationships DBH = Φ(H) and DBH = Ψ(H, CD). The original dataset was made up of 2272 teak trees (Tectona grandis Linn. F.) belonging to three different plantations located in Ecuador. All teak trees were digitally reconstructed from terrestrial laser scanning point clouds. The results showed that allometric models involving both H and CD to estimate DBH performed better than those based solely on H. Furthermore, boosting machine learning regression algorithms (CatBoost and GBoost) outperformed RFR (bagging) and LR (traditional linear regression) models, both in terms of goodness-of-fit (R2) and stability (variations in training and testing samples).},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased dramatically. UAVs can accomplish complex or dangerous tasks in a reliable and cost-effective way but are still limited by power consumption problems, which pose serious constraints on the flight duration and completion of energy-demanding tasks. The possibility of providing UAVs with advanced decision-making capabilities in an energy-effective way would be extremely beneficial. In this paper, we propose a practical solution to this problem that exploits deep learning on the edge. The developed system integrates an OpenMV microcontroller into a DJI Tello Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). The microcontroller hosts a set of machine learning-enabled inference tools that cooperate to control the navigation of the drone and complete a given mission objective. The goal of this approach is to leverage the new opportunistic features of TinyML through OpenMV including offline inference, low latency, energy efficiency, and data security. The approach is successfully validated on a practical application consisting of the onboard detection of people wearing protection masks in a crowded environment.},

ABSTRACT = {The fundamental issue for Beyond fifth Generation (B5G) is providing a pervasive connection to heterogeneous and various devices in smart environments. Therefore, Drones play a vital role in the B5G, allowing for wireless broadcast and high-speed communications. In addition, the drone offers several advantages compared to fixed terrestrial communications, including flexible deployment, robust Line of Sight (LoS) connections, and more design degrees of freedom due to controlled mobility. Drones can provide reliable and high data rate connectivity to users irrespective of their location. However, atmospheric disturbances impact the signal quality between drones and users and degrade the system performance. Considering practical implementation, the location of drones makes the drone–user communication susceptible to several environmental disturbances. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of drone-user connectivity during atmospheric disturbances. Further, a Machine Learning (ML)-assisted algorithm is proposed to adapt to a modulation technique that offers optimal performance during atmospheric disturbances. The results show that, with the algorithm, the system switches to a lower order modulation scheme during higher rain rate and provides reliable communication with optimized data rate and error performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L. ssp. monococcum) plays an increasingly important role in agriculture, promoted by organic farming. Although the number of comparative studies about modern and ancient types of wheats is increasing, there are still some knowledge gaps about the nutritional and health benefit differences between ancient and modern bread wheats. The aim of the present study was to compare ancient, traditional and modern wheat cultivars—including a field study and a laboratory stress experiment using vision-based digital image analysis—and to assess the feasibility of imaging techniques. Our study shows that modern winter wheat had better yield and grain quality compared to einkorn wheats, but the latter were not far behind; thus the cultivation of various species could provide a diverse and sustainable agriculture which contributes to higher agrobiodiversity. The results also demonstrate that digital image analysis could be a viable alternate method for the real-time estimation of aboveground biomass and for predicting yield and grain quality parameters. Digital area outperformed other digital variables in biomass prediction in relation to drought stress, but height and Feret’s diameter better correlated with yield and grain quality parameters. Based on these results we suggest that the combination of various vision-based methods could improve the performance estimation of modern and ancient types of wheat in a non-destructive and real-time manner.},

ABSTRACT = {Real-time analysis of UAV low-altitude remote sensing images at airborne terminals facilitates the timely monitoring of weeds in the farmland. Aiming at the real-time identification of rice weeds by UAV low-altitude remote sensing, two improved identification models, MobileNetV2-UNet and FFB-BiSeNetV2, were proposed based on the semantic segmentation models U-Net and BiSeNetV2, respectively. The MobileNetV2-UNet model focuses on reducing the amount of calculation of the original model parameters, and the FFB-BiSeNetV2 model focuses on improving the segmentation accuracy of the original model. In this study, we first tested and compared the segmentation accuracy and operating efficiency of the models before and after the improvement on the computer platform, and then transplanted the improved models to the embedded hardware platform Jetson AGX Xavier, and used TensorRT to optimize the model structure to improve the inference speed. Finally, the real-time segmentation effect of the two improved models on rice weeds was further verified through the collected low-altitude remote sensing video data. The results show that on the computer platform, the MobileNetV2-UNet model reduced the amount of network parameters, model size, and floating point calculations by 89.12%, 86.16%, and 92.6%, and the inference speed also increased by 2.77 times, when compared with the U-Net model. The FFB-BiSeNetV2 model improved the segmentation accuracy compared with the BiSeNetV2 model and achieved the highest pixel accuracy and mean Intersection over Union ratio of 93.09% and 80.28%. On the embedded hardware platform, the optimized MobileNetV2-UNet model and FFB-BiSeNetV2 model inferred 45.05 FPS and 40.16 FPS for a single image under the weight accuracy of FP16, respectively, both meeting the performance requirements of real-time identification. The two methods proposed in this study realize the real-time identification of rice weeds under low-altitude remote sensing by UAV, which provide a reference for the subsequent integrated operation of plant protection drones in real-time rice weed identification and precision spraying.},

ABSTRACT = {Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) have been used to build models for predicting Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) yields at regional scales, but evidence of extension of such models to local field scale for practical use in precision agriculture is lacking. In this study, multispectral data from the Sentinel-2 satellite were used to interpolate continuous spectral signatures of potato canopies and generate vegetation indices and the red edge inflection point (REIP) to relate to marketable yield and stem density. The SITS data were collected from 94 sampling locations across five potato fields in England, United Kingdom. The sampling locations were georeferenced and the number of stems per square meter, as well as marketable yield, were determined at harvest. The first principal components of the temporal variation of each SITS wavelength were extracted and used to generate 54 vegetation indices to relate to the response variables. Marketable yield was negatively related to the overall seasonal reflectance (first principal component) at 559 nm with a beta coefficient of −0.53 (±0.18 at p = 0.05). Seasonal reflectance at 703 nm had a positive significant relationship with Marketable yield. Marketable yield was modeled with a normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of 0.16 and R2 of 0.65. On the other hand, Stem density was significantly related to the Specific Leaf Area Vegetation Index (β = 1.66 ± 1.59) but the REIP’s farthest position during the season was reached later in dense canopies (β = 1.18 ± 0.79) with a higher reflectance (β = 3.43 ± 1.9). This suggested that denser canopies took longer to reach their maximum chlorophyll intensity and the intensity was lower than in sparse canopies. Potato stem density was modeled with an nRMSE of 0.24 and R2 of 0.51. These results reinforce the importance of SITS analysis as opposed to the use of single-instance intrinsic indices.},

ABSTRACT = {Timely and accurate regional crop-yield estimates are crucial for guiding agronomic practices and policies to improve food security. In this study, a crop-growth model was integrated with time series of remotely sensed data through deep learning (DL) methods to improve the accuracy of regional wheat-yield estimations in Henan Province, China. Firstly, the time series of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were input into the long short-term memory network (LSTM) model to identify the wheat-growing region, which was further used to estimate wheat areas at the municipal and county levels. Then, the leaf area index (LAI) and grain-yield time series simulated by the Crop Environment REsource Synthesis for Wheat (CERES-Wheat) model were used to train and evaluate the LSTM, one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) and random forest (RF) models, respectively. Finally, an exponential model of the relationship between the field-measured LAI and MODIS NDVI was applied to obtain the regional LAI, which was input into the trained LSTM, 1-D CNN and RF models to estimate wheat yields within the wheat-growing region. The results showed that the linear correlations between the estimated wheat areas and the statistical areas were significant at both the municipal and county levels. The LSTM model provided more accurate estimates of wheat yields, with higher R2 values and lower root mean square error (RMSE) and mean relative error (MRE) values than the 1-D CNN and RF models. The LSTM model has an inherent advantage in capturing phenological information contained in the time series of the MODIS-derived LAI, which is important for satellite-based crop-yield estimates.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we estimate the forest stock volume by multiplying the number of trees detected remotely by the estimated mean individual volume of the population (individual approach). A comparison was made with the conventional inventory method (area approach), which included 100 simulations of a simple random sampling process and a Bootstrap resampling. The study area included three stands: stand 1, 16-year-old pine; stand 2, 7-year-old pine; and stand 3, 5-year-old eucalyptus. A census was carried out in each stand for the variables diameter and total height. Individual volume was estimated by a ratio estimator, and the sum of all volumes was considered as the total parametric volume. The area approach presented parametric values within the confidence interval for 91%, 94%, and 98% of the simulations for the three stands, respectively. The mean relative errors for the area approach were −3.5% for stand 1, 0.3% for stand 2, and −0.9% for stand 3. The errors in stands 1 and 3 were associated with the spatial distribution of the volume. The individual approach proved to be efficient for all stands, and their respective parametric values were within the confidence interval. The relative errors were 1% for stand 1, −0.7% for stand 2, and 1.8% for stand 3. For stand 1 and 3, this approach yielded better results than the mean values obtained by the area approach simulations (Bootstrap resampling). Future research should evaluate other remote sources of data and other forest conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Wheat stripe rust has a severe impact on wheat yield and quality. An effective prediction method is necessary for food security. In this study, we extract the optimal vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to stripe rust at different time-periods, and develop a wheat stripe rust prediction model with satellite images to realize the multi-temporal prediction. First, VIs related to stripe rust stress are extracted as candidate features for disease prediction from time series Sentinel-2 images. Then, the optimal VI combinations are selected using sequential forward selection (SFS). Finally, the occurrence of wheat stripe rust in different time-periods is predicted using the support vector machine (SVM) method. The results of the features selected demonstrate that, before the jointing period, the optimal VIs are related to the biomass, pigment, and moisture of wheat. After the jointing period, the red-edge VIs related to the crop health status play important roles. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the prediction model, which is based on SVM, is generally higher than those of the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) methods. The SVM method is more suitable for time series predictions of wheat stripe rust. The model obtained accuracy based on the optimal VI combinations and the SVM increased over time; the highest accuracy was 86.2%. These results indicate that the prediction model can provide guidance and suggestions for early disease prevention of the study site, and the method combines time series Sentinel-2 images and the SVM, which can be used to predict wheat stripe rust.},

ABSTRACT = {As part of the recent electrification of the transportation industry, internal combustion engines are being coupled with or replaced by electric motors. This movement towards an electrified drivetrain poses new noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) challenges related to electric motors. In this paper, the acoustic signature of an electric motor was analyzed to obtain a better understanding of the sound generated by these motors. This work provides an insight into an acoustic measurement technique that can be used to identify certain frequency bands that significantly contribute to the perceived sound. In the first part, the structural response of the motor was correlated with its acoustic spectra. Furthermore, data from acoustic and structural measurements were used to analyze the order content of the signal and identify critical contributors to the overall perceived sound. The differences between data captured by microphones in different positions around the motor helped to localize components of the overall sound. The results provide some discussion about techniques to decrease the overall sound. The technique described in this paper can be extended to fan-cooled motors that are used in vehicles such as golf carts or as auxiliary motors in electric/hybrid vehicles, as well as across a wide range of industrial applications.},

ABSTRACT = {For agricultural production and food safety, it is important to accurately and extensively estimate the heavy metal(loid) pollution contents in farmland soil. Remote sensing technology provides a feasible method for the rapid determination of heavy metal(loid) contents. In this study, the contents of Ni, Hg, Cr, Cu, and As in the agricultural soil of the Suzi River Basin in Liaoning Province were taken as an example. The spectral data, with Savitzky–Golay smoothing, were taken as the original spectra (OR), and the spectral transformation was achieved by continuum removal (CR), reciprocal (1/R), root means square (R), first-order differential (FDR), and second-order differential (SDR) methods. Then the spectral indices were calculated by the optimal band combination algorithm. The correlation between Ni, Hg, Cr, Cu, and As contents and spectral indices was analyzed, and the optimal spectral indices were selected. Then, multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), random forest regression (RFR), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy reasoning system (ANFIS) were used to establish the estimation model based on the combined optimal spectral indices method. The results show that the combined optimal spectral indices method improves the correlation between spectra and heavy metal(loid), the MLR model produces the best estimation effect for Ni and Cu (R2=0.713&nbsp;and&nbsp;0.855, RMSE = 5.053 and 8.113, RPD = 1.908 and 2.688, respectively), and the PLSR model produces the best effect for Hg, Cr, and As (R2= 0.653, 0.603, and 0.775, RMSE = 0.074, 23.777, and 1.923, RPD = 1.733, 1.621, and 2.154, respectively). Therefore, the combined optimal spectral indices method is feasible for heavy metal(loid) estimation in soils and could provide technical support for large-scale soil heavy metal(loid) content estimation and pollution assessment.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent times, security and safety are, at least, conducted in safety-sensitive or critical sectors. Nevertheless, both processes do not commonly analyze the impact of security risks on safety. Several scholars are focused on integrating safety and security risk assessments, using different methodologies and tools in critical infrastructures (CIs). Bayesian networks (BN) and graph theory (GT) have received much attention from academia and industries to incorporate security and safety features for different CI applications. Hence, this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) for co-engineering safety and security using BN or GT. In this SLR, the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses recommendations (PRISMA) are followed. Initially, 2295 records (acquired between 2011 and 2020) were identified for screening purposes. Later on, 240 articles were processed to check eligibility criteria. Overall, this study includes 64 papers, after examining the pre-defined criteria and guidelines. Further, the included studies were compared, regarding the number of required nodes for system development, applied data sources, research outcomes, threat actors, performance verification mechanisms, implementation scenarios, applicability and functionality, application sectors, advantages, and disadvantages for combining safety, and security measures, based on GT and BN. The findings of this SLR suggest that BN and GT are used widely for risk and failure management in several domains. The highly focused sectors include studies of the maritime industry (14%), vehicle transportation (13%), railway (13%), nuclear (6%), chemical industry (6%), gas and pipelines (5%), smart grid (5%), network security (5%), air transportation (3%), public sector (3%), and cyber-physical systems (3%). It is also observed that 80% of the included studies use BN models to incorporate safety and security concerns, whereas 15% and 5% for GT approaches and joint GT and BN methodologies, respectively. Additionally, 31% of identified studies verified that the developed approaches used real-time implementation, whereas simulation or preliminary analysis were presented for the remaining methods. Finally, the main research limitations, concluding remarks and future research directions, are presented},

ABSTRACT = {New tools and technology are needed to track hazardous agents such as oil and red tides in our oceans. Rhodamine dye (a surrogate hazardous agent) was released into the Atlantic ocean in August 2018, and experiments were conducted to track the movement of the dye near the water surface within three hours following the release. A DrOne Water Sampling SystEm (DOWSE), consisting of a 3D-printed sampling device tethered to a drone, was used to collect 26 water samples at different locations around the dye plume. Rhodamine concentrations were measured from the drone water samples using a fluorometer and ranged from 1 to 93 ppb. Dye images were taken during the drone-sampling of surface water containing dye and at about 10 m above the sampling point. These images were post-processed to estimate dye concentrations across the sampling domain. A comparison of calibrated heat maps showed that the altitude images yielded dye distributions that were qualitatively similar to those from images taken near the ocean surface. Moreover, the association between red ratios and dye concentrations yielded trendlines explaining up to 67% of the variation. Drones may be used to detect, track and assist in mitigating hazardous agents in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, the application of the BIM technique to infrastructure lifecycle management has increased rapidly to improve the efficiency of infrastructure management systems. Research on the lifecycle management of infrastructure, from planning and design to construction and management, has been carried out. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature on recent research is performed to analyze the current state of the BIM technique. State-of-the-art techniques for infrastructure lifecycle management, such as unmanned robots, sensors and processing techniques, artificial intelligence, etc., are also reviewed. An infrastructure BIM platform framework composed of BIM and state-of-the-art techniques is then proposed. The proposed platform is a web-based platform that contains quantity, schedule (4D), and cost (5D) construction management, and the monitoring systems enable collaboration with stakeholders in a Common Data Environment (CDE). The lifecycle management methodology, after infrastructure construction, is then completed and is developed using state-of-the-art techniques using unmanned robots, scan-to-BIM, and deep learning networks, etc. It is confirmed that collaboration with stakeholders in the CDE in construction management is possible using an infrastructure BIM platform. Moreover, lifecycle management of infrastructure is possible by systematic management, such as time history analysis, damage growth prediction, decision of repair and demolition, etc., using a regular inspection database based on an infrastructure BIM platform.},

ABSTRACT = {Berry cell death assessment can become one of the most objective parameters to assess important berry quality traits, such as aroma profiles that can be passed to the wine in the winemaking process. At the moment, the only practical tool to assess berry cell death in the field is using portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and machine learning (ML) models. This research tested the NIR and ML approach and developed supervised regression ML models using Shiraz and Chardonnay berries and wines from a vineyard located in Yarra Valley, Victoria, Australia. An ML model was developed using NIR measurements from intact berries as inputs to estimate berry cell death (BCD), living tissue (LT) (Model 1). Furthermore, canopy architecture parameters obtained from cover photography of grapevine canopies and computer vision analysis were also tested as inputs to develop ML models to assess BCD and LT (Model 2) and the intensity of sensory descriptors based on visual and aroma profiles of wines for Chardonnay (Model 3) and Shiraz (Model 4). The results showed high accuracy and performance of models developed based on correlation coefficient (R) and slope (b) (M1: R = 0.87; b = 0.82; M2: R = 0.98; b = 0.93; M3: R = 0.99; b = 0.99; M4: R = 0.99; b = 1.00). Models developed based on canopy architecture, and computer vision can be used to automatically estimate the vigor and berry and wine quality traits using proximal remote sensing and with visible cameras as the payload of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).},

ABSTRACT = {The envelope removal method has the advantage of suppressing the background spectrum and expanding the weak absorption characteristic information. However, for second-class water bodies with a relatively complex water quality, there are few studies on the inversion of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration in water bodies that consider the spectral absorption characteristics. In addition, the current research on the inversion of the Chl-a concentration was carried out under the condition of sample concentration equilibrium. For areas with a highly variable Chl-a concentration, it is still challenging to establish a highly applicable and accurate Chl-a concentration inversion model. Taking Dongting Lake in China as an example, this study used high-concentration samples and spectral absorption characteristics to invert the Chl-a concentration. The decap method was used to preprocess the high-concentration samples with large deviations, and the envelope removal method was used to extract the spectral absorption characteristic parameters of the water body. On the basis of the correlation analysis between the water Chl-a concentration and the spectral absorption characteristics, the water Chl-a concentration was inverted. The results showed the following: (1) The bands that were significantly related to the Chl-a concentration and had a large correlation coefficient were mainly located in the three absorption valleys (400–580, 580–650, and 650–710 nm) of the envelope removal curve. Moreover, the correlation between the Chl-a concentration and the absorption characteristic parameters at 650–710 nm was better than that at 400–580 nm and 580–650 nm. (2) Compared with the conventional inversion model, the uncapped inversion model had a higher RP2 and a lower RMSEP, and was closer to the predicted value of the 1:1 line. Moreover, the performance of the uncapped inversion model was better than that of the conventional inversion model, indicating that the uncapped method is an effective preprocessing method for high-concentration samples with large deviations. (3) The predictive capabilities of the ER_New model were significantly better than those of the R_New model. This shows that the envelope removal method can significantly amplify the absorption characteristics of the original spectrum, which can significantly improve the performance of the prediction model. (4) From the inversion models for the absorption characteristic parameters, the prediction models of A650–710 nm_New and D650–710 nm_New exhibited the best performance. The three combined models (A650–710 nm&amp;D650–710 nm_New, A650–710 nm&amp;NI_New, A650–710 nm&amp;DI_New) also demonstrated good predictive capabilities. This demonstrates the feasibility of using the spectral absorption feature to retrieve the chlorophyll concentration.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper aims to automatically reconstruct 3D building models on a large scale using a new approach on the basis of half-spaces, while making no assumptions about the building layout and keeping the number of input parameters to a minimum. The proposed algorithm is performed in two stages. First, the airborne LiDAR data and buildings’ outlines are preprocessed to generate buildings’ base models and the corresponding half-spaces. In the second stage, the half-spaces are analysed and used for shaping the final 3D building model using 3D Boolean operations. In experiments, the proposed algorithm was applied on a large scale, and its’ performance was inspected on a city level and on a single building level. Accurate reconstruction of buildings with various layouts were demonstrated and limitations were identified for large-scale applications. Finally, the proposed algorithm was validated on an ISPRS benchmark dataset, where a RMSE of 1.31 m and completeness of 98.9% were obtained.},

ABSTRACT = {Research Highlights: This study advances the effort to accurately estimate the biomass of trees in peatlands, which cover 13% of Canada&rsquo;s land surface. Background and Objectives: Trees remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it as biomass. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has become a useful tool for modelling forest structure and estimating the above ground biomass (AGB) of trees. Allometric equations are often used to estimate individual tree AGB as a function of height and diameter at breast height (DBH), but these variables can often be laborious to measure using traditional methods. The main objective of this study was to develop allometric equations using TLS-measured variables and compare their accuracy with that of other widely used equations that rely on DBH. Materials and Methods: The study focusses on small black spruce trees (&lt;5 m) located in peatland ecosystems of the Taiga Plains Ecozone in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Black spruce growing in peatlands are often stunted when compared to upland black spruce and having models specific to them would allow for more precise biomass estimates. One hundred small trees were destructively sampled from 10 plots and the dry weight of each tree was measured in the lab. With this reference data, we fitted biomass models specific to peatland black spruce using DBH, crown diameter, crown area, height, tree volume, and bounding box volume as predictors. Results: Our best models had crown size and height as predictors and outperformed established AGB equations that rely on DBH. Conclusions: Our equations are based on predictors that can be measured from above, and therefore they may enable the plotless creation of accurate biomass reference data for a prominent tree species in a common ecosystem (treed peatlands) in North America&rsquo;s boreal.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces a genetic algorithm (GA) and a beam tracing algorithm incorporated within a dual parallel computing framework to optimize urban aerial laser scanning (ALS) missions to maximize vertical façade data capture, as needed for many three-dimensional reconstruction and modeling workflows. The optimization employs a low-density point cloud from the site of interest as a spatial representation of the urban scene. The GA is suitable for LiDAR flight path optimization due to its capability of handling open-ended problems that have many solutions. However, GAs require evaluating a very large number of candidates. The use of an initial point cloud allows realistic modeling of the urban environment in the optimization at the cost of high data input volumes. To cope with the computational and data demands, a dual parallel computing framework was devised. The parallel computing framework consists of two layers of parallelization. In the upper layer, multiple evaluators work in parallel and in conjunction with a main multi-threading GA optimizer to perform GA operations and evaluate the flight paths. In the lower layer, to evaluate assigned flight paths, each evaluator distributes its data and computation to multiple executors, which can reside on multiple physical nodes of a distributed-memory computing cluster. In addition to parallelism, the data partitioning on the lower layer allows out-of-core computation. Namely, data partitions are efficiently transferred between disks and memory so that only relevant subsets of data are kept in the main memory. The objective of the proposed method is threefold: (1) search for flight paths that yield the highest numbers of vertical points, (2) create a means to explicitly consider the detailed spatial configuration of urban environments, and (3) assure that the proposed optimization strategy is fast and can scale to large problem sizes. Multiple experiments were conducted and demonstrated the success of the proposed method. Converged results were achieved after dozens of generations within two hours. Two flight paths identified by the GA as the most and the least optimal candidates were deployed in real flight missions. The optimal flight path captured 16% more vertical points than the least optimal one, slightly higher than the 13% predicted. Both layers of parallelization were efficient: 13.1/16 for the lower layer and 3.2/4 for the upper layer. The two complementary layers of parallelization allowed flexible and efficient use of distributed computing resources to reduce the runtime. The scalability of the proposed approach was successfully demonstrated up to a data size of 460 million points. The optimization results were realistic and aligned well with the test flight results.},

ABSTRACT = {Detecting effective parameters in flood occurrence is one of the most important issues that has drawn more attention in recent years. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) are two efficient ways to spatially predict Flood Risk Mapping (FRM). In this study, a web-based platform called the Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Google Company, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to obtain flood risk indices for the Galikesh River basin, Northern Iran. With the aid of Landsat 8 satellite imagery and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), 11 risk indices (Elevation (El), Slope (Sl), Slope Aspect (SA), Land Use (LU), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), River Distance (RD), Waterway and River Density (WRD), Soil Texture (ST]), and Maximum One-Day Precipitation (M1DP)) were provided. In the next step, all of these indices were imported into ArcMap 10.8 (Esri, West Redlands, CA, USA) software for index normalization and to better visualize the graphical output. Afterward, an intelligent learning machine (Random Forest (RF)), which is a robust data mining technique, was used to compute the importance degree of each index and to obtain the flood hazard map. According to the results, the indices of WRD, RD, M1DP, and El accounted for about 68.27 percent of the total flood risk. Among these indices, the WRD index containing about 23.8 percent of the total risk has the greatest impact on floods. According to FRM mapping, about 21 and 18 percent of the total areas stood at the higher and highest risk areas, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring the progress on a construction site during the construction phase is crucial. An inadequate understanding of the project status can lead to mistakes and inappropriate actions, causing delays and increased costs. Monitoring and controlling projects via digital tools would reduce the risk of error and enable timely corrective actions. Although there is currently a wide range of technologies for these purposes, these technologies and interoperability between them are still limited. Because of this, it is important to know the possibilities of integration and interoperability regarding their implementation. This article presents a bibliographic synthesis and interpretation of 30 nonconventional digital tools for monitoring progress in terms of field data capture technologies (FDCT) and communication and collaborative technologies (CT) that are responsible for information processing and management. This research aims to perform an integration and interoperability analysis of technologies to demonstrate their potential for monitoring and controlling construction projects during the execution phase. A network analysis was conducted, and the results suggest that the triad formed by building information modeling (BIM), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and photogrammetry is an effective tool; the use of this set extends not only to monitoring and control, but also to all phases of a project.},

ABSTRACT = {There are generally many redundant and irrelevant features in high-dimensional datasets, which leads to the decline of classification performance and the extension of execution time. To tackle this problem, feature selection techniques are used to screen out redundant and irrelevant features. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a popular meta-heuristic algorithm with high exploration and low exploitation capacities. To balance between both capacities of the ABC algorithm, a novel ABC framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the solutions are first updated by the process of employing bees to retain the original exploration ability, so that the algorithm can explore the solution space extensively. Then, the solutions are modified by the updating mechanism of an algorithm with strong exploitation ability in the onlooker bee phase. Finally, we remove the scout bee phase from the framework, which can not only reduce the exploration ability but also speed up the algorithm. In order to verify our idea, the operators of the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) are introduced into the framework to enhance the exploitation capability of onlooker bees, named BABCGWO and BABCWOA, respectively. It has been found that these two algorithms are superior to four state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms using 12 high-dimensional datasets, in terms of the classification error rate, size of feature subset and execution speed.},

ABSTRACT = {High-resolution point cloud data acquired with a laser scanner from any platform contain random noise and outliers. Therefore, outlier detection in LiDAR data is often necessary prior to analysis. Applications in agriculture are particularly challenging, as there is typically no prior knowledge of the statistical distribution of points, plant complexity, and local point densities, which are crop-dependent. The goals of this study were first to investigate approaches to minimize the impact of outliers on LiDAR acquired over agricultural row crops, and specifically for sorghum and maize breeding experiments, by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a wheel-based ground platform; second, to evaluate the impact of existing outliers in the datasets on leaf area index (LAI) prediction using LiDAR data. Two methods were investigated to detect and remove the outliers from the plant datasets. The first was based on surface fitting to noisy point cloud data via normal and curvature estimation in a local neighborhood. The second utilized the PointCleanNet deep learning framework. Both methods were applied to individual plants and field-based datasets. To evaluate the method, an F-score was calculated for synthetic data in the controlled conditions, and LAI, the variable being predicted, was computed both before and after outlier removal for both scenarios. Results indicate that the deep learning method for outlier detection is more robust than the geometric approach to changes in point densities, level of noise, and shapes. The prediction of LAI was also improved for the wheel-based vehicle data based on the coefficient of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the residuals before and after the removal of outliers.},

To investigate this concept, a Proof of Concept (PoC) of PEBB-based power converter integrated with a 5G network, was designed and tested. Study confirmed that power converter assembled from PEBB modules can compete with state-of-the-art devices. Moreover, test results indicates that several challenges related to PEBB and integration of power electronic equipment with 5G network has to be resolved, to enable growth of augmented power electronic converters, especially if wireless data transfer is meant for communication between PEBB modules.},

ABSTRACT = {Enhancing digital and precision agriculture is currently inevitable to overcome the economic and environmental challenges of the agriculture in the 21st century. The purpose of this study was to generate and compare management zones (MZ) based on the Sentinel-2 satellite data for variable rate application of mineral nitrogen in wheat production, calculated using different remote sensing (RS)-based models under varied soil, yield and crop data availability. Three models were applied, including (1) a modified “RS- and threshold-based clustering”, (2) a “hybrid-based, unsupervised clustering”, in which data from different sources were combined for MZ delineation, and (3) a “RS-based, unsupervised clustering”. Various data processing methods including machine learning were used in the model development. Statistical tests such as the Paired Sample T-test, Kruskal–Wallis H-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were applied to evaluate the final delineated MZ maps. Additionally, a procedure for improving models based on information about phenological phases and the occurrence of agricultural drought was implemented. The results showed that information on agronomy and climate enables improving and optimizing MZ delineation. The integration of prior knowledge on new climate conditions (drought) in image selection was tested for effective use of the models. Lack of this information led to the infeasibility of obtaining optimal results. Models that solely rely on remote sensing information are comparatively less expensive than hybrid models. Additionally, remote sensing-based models enable delineating MZ for fertilizer recommendations that are temporally closer to fertilization times.},

ABSTRACT = {The determination of crop water status has positive effects on the Chinese Brassica industry and irrigation decisions. Drought can decrease the production of Chinese Brassica, whereas over-irrigation can waste water. It is desirable to schedule irrigation when the crop suffers from water stress. In this study, a random forest model was developed using sample data derived from meteorological measurements including air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS), and photosynthetic active radiation (Par) to predict the lower baseline (Twet) and upper baseline (Tdry) canopy temperatures for Chinese Brassica from 27 November to 31 December 2020 (E1) and from 25 May to 20 June 2021 (E2). Crop water stress index (CWSI) values were determined based on the predicted canopy temperature and used to assess the crop water status. The study demonstrated the viability of using a random forest model to forecast Twet and Tdry. The coefficients of determination (R2) in E1 were 0.90 and 0.88 for development and 0.80 and 0.77 for validation, respectively. The R2 values in E2 were 0.91 and 0.89 for development and 0.83 and 0.80 for validation, respectively. Our results reveal that the measured and predicted CWSI values had similar R2 values related to stomatal conductance (~0.5 in E1, ~0.6 in E2), whereas the CWSI showed a poor correlation with transpiration rate (~0.25 in E1, ~0.2 in E2). Finally, the methodology used to calculate the daily CWSI for Chinese Brassica in this study showed that both Twet and Tdry, which require frequent measuring and design experiment due to the trial site and condition changes, have the potential to simulate environmental parameters and can therefore be applied to conveniently calculate the CWSI.},

ABSTRACT = {Spatial information on benthic habitats in Wangiwangi island waters, Wakatobi District, Indonesia was very limited in recent years. However, this area is one of the marine tourism destinations and one of the Indonesia’s triangle coral reef regions with a very complex coral reef ecosystem. The drone technology that has rapidly developed in this decade, can be used to map benthic habitats in this area. This study aimed to map shallow-water benthic habitats using drone technology in the region of Wangiwangi island waters, Wakatobi District, Indonesia. The field data were collected using a 50 × 50 cm squared transect of 434 observation points in March–April 2017. The DJI Phantom 3 Pro drone with a spatial resolution of 5.2 × 5.2 cm was used to acquire aerial photographs. Image classifications were processed using object-based image analysis (OBIA) method with contextual editing classification at level 1 (reef level) with 200 segmentation scale and several segmentation scales at level 2 (benthic habitat). For level 2 classification, we found that the best algorithm to map benthic habitat was the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with a segmentation scale of 50. Based on field observations, we produced 12 and 9 benthic habitat classes. Using the OBIA method with a segmentation value of 50 and the SVM algorithm, we obtained the overall accuracy of 77.4% and 81.1% for 12 and 9 object classes, respectively. This result improved overall accuracy up to 17% in mapping benthic habitats using Sentinel-2 satellite data within the similar region, similar classes, and similar method of classification analyses.},

ABSTRACT = {The Arctic is under great pressure due to climate change. Drones are increasingly used as a tool in ecology and may be especially valuable in rapidly changing and remote landscapes, as can be found in the Arctic. For effective applications of drones, decisions of both ecological and technical character are needed. Here, we provide our method planning workflow for generating ground-cover maps with drones for ecological monitoring purposes. The workflow includes the selection of variables, layer resolutions, ground-cover classes and the development and validation of models. We implemented this workflow in a case study of the Arctic tundra to develop vegetation maps, including disturbed vegetation, at three study sites in Svalbard. For each site, we generated a high-resolution map of tundra vegetation using supervised random forest (RF) classifiers based on four spectral bands, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and three types of terrain variables—all derived from drone imagery. Our classifiers distinguished up to 15 different ground-cover classes, including two classes that identify vegetation state changes due to disturbance caused by herbivory (i.e., goose grubbing) and winter damage (i.e., ‘rain-on-snow’ and thaw-freeze). Areas classified as goose grubbing or winter damage had lower NDVI values than their undisturbed counterparts. The predictive ability of site-specific RF models was good (macro-F1 scores between 83% and 85%), but the area of the grubbing class was overestimated in parts of the moss tundra. A direct transfer of the models between study sites was not possible (macro-F1 scores under 50%). We show that drone image analysis can be an asset for studying future vegetation state changes on local scales in Arctic tundra ecosystems and encourage ecologists to use our tailored workflow to integrate drone mapping into long-term monitoring programs.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid and accurate extraction of water bodies from high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images is of great value for water resource management, water quality monitoring and natural disaster emergency response. For traditional water body extraction methods, it is difficult to select image texture and features, the shadows of buildings and other ground objects are in the same spectrum as water bodies, the existing deep convolutional neural network is difficult to train, the consumption of computing resources is large, and the methods cannot meet real-time requirements. In this paper, a water body extraction method based on lightweight MobileNetV2 is proposed and applied to multisensor high-resolution remote sensing images, such as GF-2, WorldView-2 and UAV orthoimages. This method was validated in two typical complex geographical scenes: water bodies for farmland irrigation, which have a broken shape and long and narrow area and are surrounded by many buildings in towns and villages; and water bodies in mountainous areas, which have undulating topography, vegetation coverage and mountain shadows all over. The results were compared with those of the support vector machine, random forest and U-Net models and also verified by generalization tests and the influence of spatial resolution changes. First, the results show that the F1-score and Kappa coefficients of the MobileNetV2 model extracting water bodies from three different high-resolution images were 0.75 and 0.72 for GF-2, 0.86 and 0.85 for Worldview-2 and 0.98 and 0.98 for UAV, respectively, which are higher than those of traditional machine learning models and U-Net. Second, the training time, number of parameters and calculation amount of the MobileNetV2 model were much lower than those of the U-Net model, which greatly improves the water body extraction efficiency. Third, in other more complex surface areas, the MobileNetV2 model still maintained relatively high accuracy of water body extraction. Finally, we tested the effects of multisensor models and found that training with lower and higher spatial resolution images combined can be beneficial, but that using just lower resolution imagery is ineffective. This study provides a reference for the efficient automation of water body classification and extraction under complex geographical environment conditions and can be extended to water resource investigation, management and planning.},

ABSTRACT = {With the growing demand for structural health monitoring system applications, data imaging is an ideal method for performing regular routine maintenance inspections. Image analysis can provide invaluable information about the health conditions of a structure’s existing infrastructure by recording and analyzing exterior damages. Therefore, it is desirable to have an automated approach that reports defects on images reliably and robustly. This paper presents a multivariate analysis approach for images, specifically for assessing substantial damage (such as cracks). The image analysis provides graph representations that are related to the image, such as the histogram. In addition, image-processing techniques such as grayscale are also implemented, which enhance the object’s information present in the image. In addition, this study uses image segmentation and a neural network, for transforming an image to analyze it more easily and as a classifier, respectively. Initially, each concrete structure image is preprocessed to highlight the crack. A neural network is used to calculate and categorize the visual characteristics of each region, and it shows an accuracy for classification of 98%.

ABSTRACT = {Ensemble learning was adopted to design risk prediction models with the aim of improving border inspection methods for food imported into Taiwan. Specifically, we constructed a set of prediction models to enhance the hit rate of non-conforming products, thus strengthening the border control of food products to safeguard public health. Using five algorithms, we developed models to provide recommendations for the risk assessment of each imported food batch. The models were evaluated by constructing a confusion matrix to calculate predictive performance indicators, including the positive prediction value (PPV), recall, harmonic mean of PPV and recall (F1 score), and area under the curve. Our results showed that ensemble learning achieved better and more stable prediction results than any single algorithm. When the results of comparable data periods were examined, the non-conformity hit rate was found to increase significantly after online implementation of the ensemble learning models, indicating that ensemble learning was effective at risk prediction. In addition to enhancing the inspection hit rate of non-conforming food, the results of this study can serve as a reference for the improvement of existing random inspection methods, thus strengthening capabilities in food risk management.},

ABSTRACT = {In semi-arid ecoregions of temperate zones, focused snowmelt water infiltration in topographic depressions is a key, but imperfectly understood, groundwater recharge mechanism. Routine monitoring is precluded by the abundance of depressions. We have used remote-sensing data to construct mass balances and estimate volumes of temporary ponds in the Tambov area of Russia. First, small water bodies were automatically recognized in each of a time series of high-resolution Planet Labs images taken in April and May 2021 by object-oriented supervised classification. A training set of water pixels defined in one of the latest images using a small unmanned aerial vehicle enabled high-confidence predictions of water pixels in the earlier images (Cohen’s Κ = 0.99). A digital elevation model was used to estimate the ponds’ water volumes, which decreased with time following a negative exponential equation. The power of the exponent did not systematically depend on the pond size. With adjustment for estimates of daily Penman evaporation, function-based interpolation of the water bodies’ areas and volumes allowed calculation of daily infiltration into the depression beds. The infiltration was maximal (5–40 mm/day) at onset of spring and decreased with time during the study period. Use of the spatially variable infiltration rates improved steady-state shallow groundwater simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in hyperspectral image classification in recent years. The training of CNNs relies on a large amount of labeled sample data. However, the number of labeled samples of hyperspectral data is relatively small. Moreover, for hyperspectral images, fully extracting spectral and spatial feature information is the key to achieve high classification performance. To solve the above issues, a deep spectral spatial inverted residuals network (DSSIRNet) is proposed. In this network, a data block random erasing strategy is introduced to alleviate the problem of limited labeled samples by data augmentation of small spatial blocks. In addition, a deep inverted residuals (DIR) module for spectral spatial feature extraction is proposed, which locks the effective features of each layer while avoiding network degradation. Furthermore, a global 3D attention module is proposed, which can realize the fine extraction of spectral and spatial global context information under the condition of the same number of input and output feature maps. Experiments are carried out on four commonly used hyperspectral datasets. A large number of experimental results show that compared with some state-of-the-art classification methods, the proposed method can provide higher classification accuracy for hyperspectral images.},

ABSTRACT = {The equivalent water thickness (EWT) is an important biophysical indicator of water status in crops. The effective monitoring of EWT in wheat under different nitrogen and water treatments is important for irrigation management in precision agriculture. This study aimed to investigate the performances of machine learning (ML) algorithms in retrieving wheat EWT. For this purpose, a rain shelter experiment (Exp. 1) with four irrigation quantities (0, 120, 240, 360 mm) and two nitrogen levels (75 and 255 kg N/ha), and field experiments (Exps. 2–3) with the same irrigation and rainfall water levels (360 mm) but different nitrogen levels (varying from 75 to 255 kg N/ha) were conducted in the North China Plain. The canopy reflectance was measured for all plots at 30 m using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted multispectral camera. Destructive sampling was conducted immediately after the UAV flights to measure total fresh and dry weight. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a special type of neural network, which has shown performance in regression analysis is compared with other machine learning (ML) models. A feature selection (FS) algorithm named the decision tree (DT) was used as the automatic relevance determination method to obtain the relative relevance of 5 out of 67 vegetation indices (Vis), which were used for estimating EWT. The selected VIs were used to estimate EWT using multiple linear regression (MLR), deep neural network multilayer perceptron (DNN-MLP), artificial neural networks multilayer perceptron (ANN-MLP), boosted tree regression (BRT), and support vector machines (SVMs). The results show that the DNN-MLP with R2 = 0.934, NSE = 0.933, RMSE = 0.028 g/cm2, and MAE of 0.017 g/cm2 outperformed other ML algorithms (ANN-MPL, BRT, and SVM- Polynomial) owing to its high capacity for estimating EWT as compared to other ML methods. Our findings support the conclusion that ML can potentially be applied in combination with VIs for retrieving EWT. Despite the complexity of the ML models, the EWT map should help farmers by improving the real-time irrigation efficiency of wheat by quantifying field water content and addressing variability.},

ABSTRACT = {Automation, including machine learning technologies, are becoming increasingly crucial in agriculture to increase productivity. Machine vision is one of the most popular parts of machine learning and has been widely used where advanced automation and control have been required. The trend has shifted from classical image processing and machine learning techniques to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) methods. Based on large training datasets and pre-trained models, DL-based methods have proven to be more accurate than previous traditional techniques. Machine vision has wide applications in agriculture, including the detection of weeds and pests in crops. Variation in lighting conditions, failures to transfer learning, and object occlusion constitute key challenges in this domain. Recently, DL has gained much attention due to its advantages in object detection, classification, and feature extraction. DL algorithms can automatically extract information from large amounts of data used to model complex problems and is, therefore, suitable for detecting and classifying weeds and crops. We present a systematic review of AI-based systems to detect weeds, emphasizing recent trends in DL. Various DL methods are discussed to clarify their overall potential, usefulness, and performance. This study indicates that several limitations obstruct the widespread adoption of AI/DL in commercial applications. Recommendations for overcoming these challenges are summarized.},

ABSTRACT = {This study aimed to identify the optimal sets of spectral bands for monitoring multiple grapevine nutrients in vineyards. We used spectral data spanning 400–2500 nm and leaf samples from 100 Concord grapevine canopies, lab-analyzed for six key nutrient values, to select the optimal bands for the nutrient regression models. The canopy spectral data were obtained with unmanned aerial systems (UAS), using push-broom imaging spectrometers (hyperspectral sensors). The novel use of UAS-based hyperspectral imagery to assess the grapevine nutrient status fills the gap between in situ spectral sampling and UAS-based multispectral imaging, avoiding their inherent trade-offs between spatial and spectral resolution. We found that an ensemble feature ranking method, utilizing six different machine learning feature selection methods, produced similar regression results as the standard PLSR feature selection and regression while generally selecting fewer wavelengths. We identified a set of biochemically consistent bands (606, 641, and 1494 nm) to predict the nitrogen content with an RMSE of 0.17% (using leave-one-out cross-validation) in samples with nitrogen contents ranging between 2.4 and 3.6%. Further studying is needed to confirm the relevance and consistency of the wavelengths selected for each nutrient model, but ensemble feature selection showed promise in identifying stable sets of wavelengths for assessing grapevine nutrient contents from canopy spectra.},

ABSTRACT = {The rising human activities and resource exploitation have increased pressure in the coastal zone and the marine environment, risking the very existence of Marine Priority Habitats (MPH) and Underwater Cultural Heritage (UCH). The delimitation of these two priority areas in a time- and cost-effective way is essential for the sustainable management and exploitation of sea resources and natural-cultural heritage preservation. We propose an Integrated Methodological Approach for the Detection and Mapping of MPH and UCH. To achieve this, we used a downscale methodological approach of increasing spatial resolution based on three main methodological axes: (i) desk-based research, (ii) marine geophysics/seafloor classification, and (iii) in-depth visual inspection/3D mapping. This methodological scheme was implemented at the Saronic Gulf and focused on Aegina island. The methodology proposed, which combines existing and new techniques, proved successful in detecting and mapping the MPH and UCH in detail, while it compiled the information necessary for the establishment of Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) maps. Finally, the MSP map constructed for the Saronic Gulf demonstrated the lack of holistic coastal zone management plans due to impacts on UCH linked to anthropogenic intervention and the sparsity of marine habitats owing to marine pollution.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advances have shown for the first time that it is possible to beat a human with an autonomous drone in a drone race. However, this solution relies heavily on external sensors, specifically on the use of a motion capture system. Thus, a truly autonomous solution demands performing computationally intensive tasks such as gate detection, drone localisation, and state estimation. To this end, other solutions rely on specialised hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) whose onboard hardware versions are not as powerful as those available for desktop and server computers. An alternative is to combine specialised hardware with smart sensors capable of processing specific tasks on the chip, alleviating the need for the onboard processor to perform these computations. Motivated by this, we present the initial results of adapting a novel smart camera, known as the OpenCV AI Kit or OAK-D, as part of a solution for the ADR running entirely on board. This smart camera performs neural inference on the chip that does not use a GPU. It can also perform depth estimation with a stereo rig and run neural network models using images from a 4K colour camera as the input. Additionally, seeking to limit the payload to 200 g, we present a new 3D-printed design of the camera’s back case, reducing the original weight 40%, thus enabling the drone to carry it in tandem with a host onboard computer, the Intel Stick compute, where we run a controller based on gate detection. The latter is performed with a neural model running on an OAK-D at an operation frequency of 40 Hz, enabling the drone to fly at a speed of 2 m/s. We deem these initial results promising toward the development of a truly autonomous solution that will run intensive computational tasks fully on board.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we investigate tags in anti-collision applications of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The integration of RFID technology in UAV-aided VANETs can provide reliable traffic-related services for vehicles. However, multiple tags’ simultaneous responses to a reader mounted on a UAV, denoted as tag collision, gravely affect the correct tag detection on each vehicle. Therefore, in order to decrease the collision probability and improve the throughput, we propose a multi-frequency tag identification method. In the proposed scheme, we devise a tag grouping method based on adaptive power control to make the reader dynamically match the optimal frame length. Based on the above matching results, we introduce a tag estimation method using the optimal weight to improve the accuracy of tag estimation. We theoretically analyze the closed-form expression of the security outage probability expression. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed tag anti-collision scheme achieved significant performance superiority in terms of the throughput and identification time slots.},

ABSTRACT = {Big Data, the Internet of Things, and robotic and augmented realities are just some of the technologies that belong to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions and increase productivity and the quality of industry production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. A new perspective is oriented towards social well-being and it is called Society 5.0. Industry 4.0 supports the transition to the new society, but other drivers are also needed. To guide the transition, it is necessary to identify the enabling factors that integrate Industry 4.0. A conceptual framework was developed in which these factors were identified through a literature review and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. Furthermore, the way in which they relate was evaluated with the help of the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) methodology. The proposed framework fills a research gap, which has not yet consolidated a strategy that includes all aspects of Society 5.0. As a result, the main driver, in addition to technology, is international politics.},

ABSTRACT = {The semantic segmentation of remote sensing images requires distinguishing local regions of different classes and exploiting a uniform global representation of the same-class instances. Such requirements make it necessary for the segmentation methods to extract discriminative local features between different classes and to explore representative features for all instances of a given class. While common deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) can effectively focus on local features, they are limited by their receptive field to obtain consistent global information. In this paper, we propose a memory-augmented transformer (MAT) to effectively model both the local and global information. The feature extraction pipeline of the MAT is split into a memory-based global relationship guidance module and a local feature extraction module. The local feature extraction module mainly consists of a transformer, which is used to extract features from the input images. The global relationship guidance module maintains a memory bank for the consistent encoding of the global information. Global guidance is performed by memory interaction. Bidirectional information flow between the global and local branches is conducted by a memory-query module, as well as a memory-update module, respectively. Experiment results on the ISPRS Potsdam and ISPRS Vaihingen datasets demonstrated that our method can perform competitively with state-of-the-art methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Symmetry-based channel digital twin is a great technology which can reproduce the communication channel of real scenes for performance evaluation of the wireless sensor network (WSN) inside tower buildings, based on the ray tracing (RT) method and machine learning (ML) theories, a cluster-based channel model is proposed in this paper. Meanwhile, an improved k-means method, which considers the weight of different dimensions in the multipath component distance (MCD) is presented for clustering, which has better clustering performance over the sparsity-based algorithm and traditional k-means algorithm. Moreover, the channel parameters such as cluster delay and cluster power are also investigated. On this basis, the communication performance of WSN, i.e., bit error rate (BER) and channel capacity are derived and analyzed. The simulation and analysis results show that the cluster model based on the RT method can get approximately equivalent channel impulse response (CIR), and the BER of proposed model is consistent with the simulated one. These results can provide reference for the node layout and optimization of WSN inside tower buildings.},

ABSTRACT = {Active tracking control is essential for UAVs to perform autonomous operations in GPS-denied environments. In the active tracking task, UAVs take high-dimensional raw images as input and execute motor actions to actively follow the dynamic target. Most research focuses on three-stage methods, which entail perception first, followed by high-level decision-making based on extracted spatial information of the dynamic target, and then UAV movement control, using a low-level dynamic controller. Perception methods based on deep neural networks are powerful but require considerable effort for manual ground truth labeling. Instead, we unify the perception and decision-making stages using a high-level controller and then leverage deep reinforcement learning to learn the mapping from raw images to the high-level action commands in the V-REP-based environment, where simulation data are infinite and inexpensive. This end-to-end method also has the advantages of a small parameter size and reduced effort requirements for parameter turning in the decision-making stage. The high-level controller, which has a novel architecture, explicitly encodes the spatial and temporal features of the dynamic target. Auxiliary segmentation and motion-in-depth losses are introduced to generate denser training signals for the high-level controller’s fast and stable training. The high-level controller and a conventional low-level PID controller constitute our hierarchical active tracking control framework for the UAVs’ active tracking task. Simulation experiments show that our controller trained with several augmentation techniques sufficiently generalizes dynamic targets with random appearances and velocities, and achieves significantly better performance, compared with three-stage methods.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the demand of location awareness in a special complex environment, for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multi base-station semi-passive positioning system, the hybrid positioning solutions and optimized site layout in the positioning system can effectively improve the positioning accuracy for a specific region.

Mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA) which is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is introduced, and a method to find the optimal station of the UAV airborne multiple base station’s semi-passive positioning system using MOA is proposed. The simulation and analysis of the optimization of the different number of base stations, compared with other station layout methods, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. MOA is less likely to fall into local optimum, and the error of regional target positioning is reduced. By simulating the deployment of four base stations and five base stations in various situations, MOA can achieve a better deployment effect. The dynamic station configuration capability of the multi-station semi-passive positioning system has been improved with the UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {The importance of ensuring the adequacy of urban ecosystem services and green infrastructure has been widely highlighted in multidisciplinary research. Meanwhile, the consolidation of cities has been a dominant trend in urban development and has led to the development and implementation of the green factor tool in cities such as Berlin, Melbourne, and Helsinki. In this study, elements of the green factor tool were monitored with laser-scanned and photogrammetrically derived point cloud datasets encompassing a yard in Espoo, Finland. The results show that with the support of 3D point clouds, it is possible to support the monitoring of the local green infrastructure, including elements of smaller size in green areas and yards. However, point clouds generated by distinct means have differing abilities in conveying information on green elements, and canopy covers, for example, might hinder these abilities. Additionally, some green factor elements are more promising for 3D measurement-based monitoring than others, such as those with clear geometrical form. The results encourage the involvement of 3D measuring technologies for monitoring local urban green infrastructure (UGI), also of small scale.},

ABSTRACT = {Site-specific weed management (SSWM) may reduce herbicide use by identifying weed patches and weed-free areas. However, one major constraint is robust weed detection algorithms that are able to predict weed infestations outside of the training data. This study investigates the predictive power of regression models trained on drone imagery that are used within fields to predict infestations of annual grass weeds in the late growth stages of cereals. The main objective was to identify the optimum sampling strategy for training regression models based on aerial RGB images. The study showed that training based on sampling from the whole range of weed infestations or the extreme values in the field provided better prediction accuracy than random sampling. Prediction models based on vegetation indices (VIs) offered a useful alternative to a more complex random forest machine-learning algorithm. For binary decision-making, linear regression utilizing weed density information resulted in higher accuracy than a logistic regression approach that only relied on information regarding the presence/absence of weeds. Across six fields, the average balanced accuracy based on linear regression was in the range of 75–83%, with the highest accuracy found when the sampling was from the extreme values in the field, and with the lowest accuracy found for random sampling. For future work on training weed prediction models, choosing training sets covering the entire sample space is recommended in favor of random sampling.},

ABSTRACT = {The spread of flammable invasive grasses, woody plant encroachment, and enhanced aridity have interacted in many grasslands globally to increase wildfire activity and risk to valued assets. Annual variation in the abundance and distribution of fine-fuel present challenges to land managers implementing prescribed burns and mitigating wildfire, although methods to produce high-resolution fuel estimates are still under development. To further understand how prescribed fire and wildfire influence fine-fuels in a semi-arid grassland invaded by non-native perennial grasses, we combined high-resolution Sentinel-2A imagery with in situ vegetation data and machine learning to estimate yearly fine-fuel loads from 2015 to 2020. The resulting model of fine-fuel corresponded to field-based validation measurements taken in the first (R2 = 0.52, RMSE = 218 kg/ha) and last year (R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 196 kg/ha) of this 6-year study. Serial prediction of the fine-fuel model allowed for an assessment of the effect of prescribed fire (average reduction of −80 kg/ha 1-year post fire) and wildfire (−260 kg/ha 1-year post fire) on fuel conditions. Post-fire fine-fuel loads were significantly lower than in unburned control areas sampled just outside fire perimeters from 2015 to 2020 across all fires (t = 1.67, p &lt; 0.0001); however, fine-fuel recovery occurred within 3–5 years, depending upon burn and climate conditions. When coupled with detailed fuels data from field measurements, Sentinel-2A imagery provided a means for evaluating grassland fine-fuels at yearly time steps and shows high potential for extended monitoring of dryland fuels. Our approach provides land managers with a systematic analysis of the effects of fire management treatments on fine-fuel conditions and provides an accurate, updateable, and expandable solution for mapping fine-fuels over yearly time steps across drylands throughout the world.},

ABSTRACT = {As an integral part of the electromagnetic system, antennas are becoming more advanced and versatile than ever before, thus making it necessary to adopt new techniques to enhance their performance. Machine Learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence, is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building with minimal human intervention. The potential for ML to solve unpredictable and non-linear complex challenges is attracting researchers in the field of electromagnetics (EM), especially in antenna and antenna-based systems. Numerous antenna simulations, synthesis, and pattern recognition of radiations as well as non-linear inverse scattering-based object identifications are now leveraging ML techniques. Although the accuracy of ML algorithms depends on the availability of sufficient data and expert handling of the model and hyperparameters, it is gradually becoming the desired solution when researchers are aiming for a cost-effective solution without excessive time consumption. In this context, this paper aims to present an overview of machine learning, and its applications in Electromagnetics, including communication, radar, and sensing. It extensively discusses recent research progress in the development and use of intelligent algorithms for antenna design, synthesis and analysis, electromagnetic inverse scattering, synthetic aperture radar target recognition, and fault detection systems. It also provides limitations of this emerging field of study. The unique aspect of this work is that it surveys the state-of the art and recent advances in ML techniques as applied to EM.},

ABSTRACT = {Relative to standard red/green/blue (RGB) imaging systems, hyperspectral imaging systems offer superior capabilities but tend to be expensive and complex, requiring either a mechanically complex push-broom line scanning method, a tunable filter, or a large set of light emitting diodes (LEDs) to collect images in multiple wavelengths. This paper proposes a new methodology to support the design of a hypothesized system that uses three imaging modes—fluorescence, visible/near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance, and shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance—to capture narrow-band spectral data at only three to seven narrow wavelengths. Simulated annealing is applied to identify the optimal wavelengths for sparse spectral measurement with a cost function based on the accuracy provided by a weighted k-nearest neighbors (WKNN) classifier, a common and relatively robust machine learning classifier. Two separate classification approaches are presented, the first using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network trained on sparse data from the three individual spectra and the second using a fusion of the data from all three spectra. The results are compared with those from four alternative classifiers based on common machine learning algorithms. To validate the proposed methodology, reflectance and fluorescence spectra in these three spectroscopic modes were collected from fish fillets and used to classify the fillets by species. Accuracies determined from the two classification approaches are compared with benchmark values derived by training the classifiers with the full resolution spectral data. The results of the single-layer classification study show accuracies ranging from ~68% for SWIR reflectance to ~90% for fluorescence with just seven wavelengths. The results of the fusion classification study show accuracies of about 95% with seven wavelengths and more than 90% even with just three wavelengths. Reducing the number of required wavelengths facilitates the creation of rapid and cost-effective spectral imaging systems that can be used for widespread analysis in food monitoring/food fraud, agricultural, and biomedical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Video super-resolution (VSR) aims at generating high-resolution (HR) video frames with plausible and temporally consistent details using their low-resolution (LR) counterparts, and neighboring frames. The key challenge for VSR lies in the effective exploitation of intra-frame spatial relation and temporal dependency between consecutive frames. Many existing techniques utilize spatial and temporal information separately and compensate motion via alignment. These methods cannot fully exploit the spatio-temporal information that significantly affects the quality of resultant HR videos. In this work, a novel deformable spatio-temporal convolutional residual network (DSTnet) is proposed to overcome the issues of separate motion estimation and compensation methods for VSR. The proposed framework consists of 3D convolutional residual blocks decomposed into spatial and temporal (2+1) D streams. This decomposition can simultaneously utilize input video’s spatial and temporal features without a separate motion estimation and compensation module. Furthermore, the deformable convolution layers have been used in the proposed model that enhances its motion-awareness capability. Our contribution is twofold; firstly, the proposed approach can overcome the challenges in modeling complex motions by efficiently using spatio-temporal information. Secondly, the proposed model has fewer parameters to learn than state-of-the-art methods, making it a computationally lean and efficient framework for VSR. Experiments are conducted on a benchmark Vid4 dataset to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior quantitative and qualitative performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents the Segmented Colour Feature Extreme Learning Machine (SCF-ELM). The SCF-ELM is inspired by the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which is known for its rapid training and inference times. The ELM is therefore an ideal candidate for an ensemble learning algorithm. The Colour Feature Extreme Learning Machine (CF-ELM) is used in this study due to its additional ability to extract colour image features. The SCF-ELM is an ensemble learner that utilizes feature mapping via k-means clustering, a decision matrix and majority voting. It has been evaluated on a range of challenging agricultural object classification scenarios including weed, livestock and machinery detection. SCF-ELM model performance results were excellent both in terms of detection, 90 to 99% accuracy, and also inference times, around 0.01(s) per image. The SCF-ELM was able to compete or improve upon established algorithms in its class, indicating its potential for remote computing applications in agriculture.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advancements in the field of machine learning (ML) provide opportunity to conduct research on autonomous devices for a variety of applications. Intelligent decision-making is a critical task for self-driving systems. An attempt is made in this study to use a deep learning (DL) approach for the early detection of road cracks, potholes, and the yellow lane. The accuracy is not sufficient after training with the default model. To enhance accuracy, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with 13 convolutional layers, a softmax layer as an output layer, and two fully connected layers (FCN) are constructed. In order to achieve the deeper propagation and to prevent saturation in the training phase, mish activation is employed in the first 12 layers with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function. The upgraded CNN model performs better than the default CNN model in terms of accuracy. For the varied situation, a revised and enriched dataset for road cracks, potholes, and the yellow lane is created. The yellow lane is detected and tracked in order to move the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomously by following yellow lane. After identifying a yellow lane, the UAV performs autonomous navigation while concurrently detecting road cracks and potholes using the robot operating system within the UAV. The performance model is benchmarked using performance measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity, F1-score, F2-score, and dice-coefficient, which demonstrate that the suggested technique produces better outcomes.},

ABSTRACT = {Anti-jamming games have become a popular research topic. However, there are not many publications devoted to such games in the case of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). We considered a VANET anti-jamming game on the road using a realistic driving model. Further, we assumed the quadratic power function in both vehicle and jammer utility functions instead of the standard linear term. This makes the game model more realistic. Using mathematical methods, we expressed the Nash equilibrium through the system parameters in single-channel and multi-channel cases. Since the network parameters are usually unknown, we also compared the performance of several reinforcement learning algorithms that iteratively converge to the Nash equilibrium predicted analytically without having any information about the environment in the static and dynamic scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous mobile robots are an important focus of current research due to the advantages they bring to the industry, such as performing dangerous tasks with greater precision than humans. An autonomous mobile robot must be able to generate a collision-free trajectory while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles from the specified start location to the target location. Machine learning, a sub-field of artificial intelligence, is applied to create a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network that is implemented and executed to allow a mobile robot to find the trajectory between two points and navigate while avoiding a dynamic obstacle. The input of the network is the distance between the mobile robot and the obstacles thrown by the LiDAR sensor, the desired target location, and the mobile robot’s location with respect to the odometry reference frame. Using the model to learn the mapping between input and output in the sample data, the linear and angular velocity of the mobile robot are obtained. The mobile robot and its dynamic environment are simulated in Gazebo, which is an open-source 3D robotics simulator. Gazebo can be synchronized with ROS (Robot Operating System). The computational experiments show that the network model can plan a safe navigation path in a dynamic environment. The best test accuracy obtained was 99.24%, where the model can generalize other trajectories for which it was not specifically trained within a 15&nbsp;cm radius of a trained destination position.},

ABSTRACT = {In the near future, it’s expected that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will become ubiquitous surrogates for human-crewed vehicles in the field of border patrol, package delivery, etc. Therefore, many three-dimensional (3D) navigation algorithms based on different techniques, e.g., model predictive control (MPC)-based, navigation potential field-based, sliding mode control-based, and reinforcement learning-based, have been extensively studied in recent years to help achieve collision-free navigation. The vast majority of the 3D navigation algorithms perform well when obstacles are sparsely spaced, but fail when facing crowd-spaced obstacles, which causes a potential threat to UAV operations. In this paper, a 3D vision cone-based reactive navigation algorithm is proposed to enable small quadcopter UAVs to seek a path through crowd-spaced 3D obstacles to the destination without collisions. The proposed algorithm is simulated in MATLAB with different 3D obstacles settings to demonstrate its feasibility and compared with the other two existing 3D navigation algorithms to exhibit its superiority. Furthermore, a modified version of the proposed algorithm is also introduced and compared with the initially proposed algorithm to lay the foundation for future work.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reviewed the weed problems in agriculture and how remote sensing techniques can detect weeds in rice fields. The comparison of weed detection between traditional practices and automated detection using remote sensing platforms is discussed. The ideal stage for controlling weeds in rice fields was highlighted, and the types of weeds usually found in paddy fields were listed. This paper will discuss weed detection using remote sensing techniques, and algorithms commonly used to differentiate them from crops are deliberated. However, weed detection in rice fields using remote sensing platforms is still in its early stages; weed detection in other crops is also discussed. Results show that machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) remote sensing techniques have successfully produced a high accuracy map for detecting weeds in crops using RS platforms. Therefore, this technology positively impacts weed management in many aspects, especially in terms of the economic perspective. The implementation of this technology into agricultural development could be extended further.},

ABSTRACT = {Prompt monitoring of maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) is critical for the prevention and control of disease and to ensure high crop yield and quality. Here, we first analyzed the spectral differences between MDMV-infected red leaves and healthy leaves and constructed a sensitive index (SI) for measurements. Next, based on the characteristic bands (Rλ) associated with leaf anthocyanins (Anth), we determined vegetation indices (VIs) commonly used in plant physiological and biochemical parameter inversion and established a vegetation index (VIc) by utilizing the combination of two arbitrary bands following the construction principles of NDVI, DVI, RVI, and SAVI. Furthermore, we developed classification models based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) in order to distinguish the red leaves from healthy leaves. Finally, we performed UR, MLR, PLSR, PCR, and SVM simulations on Anth based on Rλ, VIs, VIc, and Rλ + VIs + VIc and indirectly estimated the severity of MDMV infection based on the relationship between the reflection spectra and Anth. Distinct from those of the normal leaves, the spectra of red leaves showed strong reflectance characteristics at 640 nm, and SI increased with increasing Anth. Moreover, the accuracy of the two VIc-based classification models was 100%, which is significantly higher than that of the VIs and Rλ-based models. Among the Anth regression models, the accuracy of the MLR model based on Rλ + VIs + VIc was the highest (R2c = 0.85; R2v = 0.74). The developed models could accurately identify MDMV and estimate the severity of its infection, laying the theoretical foundation for large-scale remote sensing-based monitoring of this virus in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology can be used for fast and efficient monitoring of plant diseases and pests, but these techniques are qualitative expressions of plant diseases. However, the yellow leaf disease of arecanut in Hainan Province is similar to a plague, with an incidence rate of up to 90% in severely affected areas, and a qualitative expression is not conducive to the assessment of its severity and yield. Additionally, there exists a clear correlation between the damage caused by plant diseases and pests and the change in the living vegetation volume (LVV). However, the correlation between the severity of the yellow leaf disease of arecanut and LVV must be demonstrated through research. Therefore, this study aims to apply the multispectral data obtained by the UAV along with the high-resolution UAV remote sensing images to obtain five vegetation indexes such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), leaf chlorophyll index (LCI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and normalized difference red edge (NDRE) index, and establish five algorithm models such as the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), decision tree, naïve Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest-neighbor classification to determine the severity of the yellow leaf disease of arecanut, which is expressed by the proportion of the yellowing area of a single areca crown (in percentage). The traditional qualitative expression of this disease is transformed into the quantitative expression of the yellow leaf disease of arecanut per plant. The results demonstrate that the classification accuracy of the test set of the BPNN algorithm and SVM algorithm is the highest, at 86.57% and 86.30%, respectively. Additionally, the UAV structure from motion technology is used to measure the LVV of a single areca tree and establish a model of the correlation between the LVV and the severity of the yellow leaf disease of arecanut. The results show that the relative root mean square error is between 34.763% and 39.324%. This study presents the novel quantitative expression of the severity of the yellow leaf disease of arecanut, along with the correlation between the LVV of areca and the severity of the yellow leaf disease of arecanut. Significant development is expected in the degree of integration of multispectral software and hardware, observation accuracy, and ease of use of UAVs owing to the rapid progress of spectral sensing technology and the image processing and analysis algorithms.},

However, the same level of progress has not been observed in research on spiking neural networks (SNN), despite their capability to handle temporal data, energy-efficiency and low latency.

Particularly, the benchmarking of SNN approaches with regards to energy efficiency and latency requires realization in suitable hardware, which imposes additional temporal and resource constraints upon ongoing projects. This review aims to provide an overview of the current real-world applications of SNNs and identifies steps to accelerate research involving SNNs in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Severe frost usually has adverse impacts on agricultural production, resulting in crop freeze injury, poor crop yield, and crop quality reduction. Timely and accurate detection of frost plays an important role in cold damage warnings, prevention, and control. Current frost detection methods mostly use physical properties such as light, electricity, and heat, or the judge and quantify using environmental factors such as temperature and wind speed. However, it is difficult to detect and accurately identify the frosting phenomenon in real time during field trials because of the complex environment, different plant types, and interference by many factors during observation. To provide an overview of the analytical tools for scientists, researchers, and product developers, a review and comparative analysis of the available literature on frost mechanisms, correlations, and characteristics are presented in this study. First, the mechanisms of the frost formation process, frost level, and the significance of detection, are introduced. Then, the methods and techniques used to measure frost on plant surfaces are synthetically classified and further compared. Moreover, the key points and difficulties are summarized and discussed. Finally, some constructive methods of frost detection are proposed to improve the frost detection process.},

ABSTRACT = {The detection of rice leaf folder (RLF) infestation usually depends on manual monitoring, and early infestations cannot be detected visually. To improve detection accuracy and reduce human error, we use push-broom hyperspectral sensors to scan rice images and use machine learning and deep neural learning methods to detect RLF-infested rice leaves. Different from traditional image processing methods, hyperspectral imaging data analysis is based on pixel-based classification and target recognition. Since the spectral information itself is a feature and can be considered a vector, deep learning neural networks do not need to use convolutional neural networks to extract features. To correctly detect the spectral image of rice leaves infested by RLF, we use the constrained energy minimization (CEM) method to suppress the background noise of the spectral image. A band selection method was utilized to reduce the computational energy consumption of using the full-band process, and six bands were selected as candidate bands. The following method is the band expansion process (BEP) method, which is utilized to expand the vector length to improve the problem of compressed spectral information for band selection. We use CEM and deep neural networks to detect defects in the spectral images of infected rice leaves and compare the performance of each in the full frequency band, frequency band selection, and frequency BEP. A total of 339 hyperspectral images were collected in this study; the results showed that six bands were sufficient for detecting early infestations of RLF, with a detection accuracy of 98% and a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.8, which provides advantages of commercialization of this field.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban river networks have the characteristics of medium and micro scales, complex water quality, rapid change, and time–space incoherence. Aiming to monitor the water quality accurately, it is necessary to extract suitable features and establish a universal inversion model for key water quality parameters. In this paper, we describe a spectral- and spatial-feature-integrated ensemble learning method for urban river network water quality grading. We proposed an in situ sampling method for urban river networks. Factor and correlation analyses were applied to extract the spectral features. Moreover, we analyzed the maximum allowed bandwidth for feature bands. We demonstrated that spatial features can improve the accuracy of water quality grading using kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA). Based on the spectral and spatial features, an ensemble learning model was established for total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N). Both models were evaluated by means of fivefold validation. Furthermore, we proposed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne water quality multispectral remote sensing application process for urban river networks. Based on the process, we tested the model in practice. The experiment confirmed that our model can improve the grading accuracy by 30% compared to other machine learning models that use only spectral features. Our research can extend the application field of water quality remote sensing to complex urban river networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Belt conveyors are commonly used for the transportation of bulk materials. The most characteristic design feature is the fact that thousands of idlers are supporting the moving belt. One of the critical elements of the idler is the rolling element bearing, which requires monitoring and diagnostics to prevent potential failure. Due to the number of idlers to be monitored, the size of the conveyor, and the risk of accident when dealing with rotating elements and moving belts, monitoring of all idlers (i.e., using vibration sensors) is impractical regarding scale and connectivity. Hence, an inspection robot is proposed to capture acoustic signals instead of vibrations commonly used in condition monitoring. Then, signal processing techniques are used for signal pre-processing and analysis to check the condition of the idler. It has been found that even if the damage signature is identifiable in the captured signal, it is hard to automatically detect the fault in some cases due to sound disturbances caused by contact of the belt joint and idler coating. Classical techniques based on impulsiveness may fail in such a case, moreover, they indicate damage even if idlers are in good condition. The application of the inspection robot can “replace” the classical measurement done by maintenance staff, which can improve the safety during the inspection. In this paper, the authors show that damage detection in bearings installed in belt conveyor idlers using acoustic signals is possible, even in the presence of a significant amount of background noise. Influence of the sound disturbance due to the belt joint can be minimized by appropriate signal processing methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The foundation of contemporary weed management practices in many parts of the world is glyphosate. However, dependency on the effectiveness of herbicide practices has led to overuse through continuous growth of crops resistant to a single mode of action. In order to provide a cost-effective weed management strategy that does not promote glyphosate-resistant weed biotypes, differences between resistant and susceptible biotypes have to be identified accurately in the field conditions. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted thermal and multispectral remote sensing has potential for detecting biophysical characteristics of weed biotypes during the growing season, which includes distinguishing glyphosate-susceptible and glyphosate-resistant weed populations based on canopy temperature and deep learning driven weed identification algorithms. The objective of this study was to identify herbicide resistance after glyphosate application in true field conditions by analyzing the UAV-acquired thermal and multispectral response of kochia, waterhemp, redroot pigweed, and common ragweed. The data were processed in ArcGIS for raster classification as well as spectral comparison of glyphosate-resistant and glyphosate-susceptible weeds. The classification accuracy between the sensors and classification methods of maximum likelihood, random trees, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared. The random trees classifier performed the best at 4 days after application (DAA) for kochia with 62.9% accuracy. The maximum likelihood classifier provided the highest performing result out of all classification methods with an accuracy of 75.2%. A commendable classification was made at 8 DAA where the random trees classifier attained an accuracy of 87.2%. However, thermal reflectance measurements as a predictor for glyphosate resistance within weed populations in field condition was unreliable due to its susceptibility to environmental conditions. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a composite reflectance of 842 nm, 705 nm, and 740 nm wavelength managed to provide better classification results than thermal in most cases.},

ABSTRACT = {In response to the difficulty of plant leaf disease detection and classification, this study proposes a novel plant leaf disease detection method called deep block attention SSD (DBA_SSD) for disease identification and disease degree classification of plant leaves. We propose three plant leaf detection methods, namely, squeeze-and-excitation SSD (Se_SSD), deep block SSD (DB_SSD), and DBA_SSD. Se_SSD fuses SSD feature extraction network and attention mechanism channel, DB_SSD improves VGG feature extraction network, and DBA_SSD fuses the improved VGG network and channel attention mechanism. To reduce the training time and accelerate the training process, the convolutional layers trained in the Image Net image dataset by the VGG model are migrated to this model, whereas the collected plant leaves disease image dataset is randomly divided into training set, validation set, and test set in the ratio of 8:1:1. We chose the PlantVillage dataset after careful consideration because it contains images related to the domain of interest. This dataset consists of images of 14 plants, including images of apples, tomatoes, strawberries, peppers, and potatoes, as well as the leaves of other plants. In addition, data enhancement methods, such as histogram equalization and horizontal flip were used to expand the image data. The performance of the three improved algorithms is compared and analyzed in the same environment and with the classical target detection algorithms YOLOv4, YOLOv3, Faster RCNN, and YOLOv4 tiny. Experiments show that DBA_SSD outperforms the two other improved algorithms, and its performance in comparative analysis is superior to other target detection algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Although China is the largest producer of rice, accounting for about 25% of global production, there are no high-resolution maps of paddy rice covering the entire country. Using time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW), this study developed a pixel- and phenology-based method to identify planting areas of double-season paddy rice in China, by comparing temporal variations of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals of unknown pixels to those of known double-season paddy rice fields. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the method’s performance at pixel and regional scales. Based on 145,210 field surveyed samples from 2018 to 2020, the producer’s and user’s accuracy are 88.49% and 87.02%, respectively. Compared to county-level statistical data from 2016 to 2019, the relative mean absolute errors are 34.11%. This study produced distribution maps of double-season rice at 10 m spatial resolution from 2016 to 2020 over nine provinces in South China, which account for more than 99% of the planting areas of double-season paddy rice of China. The maps are expected to contribute to timely monitoring and evaluating rice growth and yield.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart agriculture is a new concept that combines agriculture and new technologies to improve the yield’s quality and quantity as well as facilitate many tasks for farmers in managing orchards. An essential factor in smart agriculture is tree crown segmentation, which helps farmers automatically monitor their orchards and get information about each tree. However, one of the main problems, in this case, is when the trees are close to each other, which means that it would be difficult for the algorithm to delineate the crowns correctly. This paper used satellite images and machine learning algorithms to segment and classify trees in overlapping orchards. The data used are images from the Moroccan Mohammed VI satellite, and the study region is the OUARGHA citrus orchard located in Morocco. Our approach starts by segmenting the rows inside the parcel and finding all the trees there, getting their canopies, and classifying them by size. In general, the model inputs the parcel’s image and other field measurements to classify the trees into three classes: missing/weak, normal, or big. Finally, the results are visualized in a map containing all the trees with their classes. For the results, we obtained a score of 0.93 F-measure in rows segmentation. Additionally, several field comparisons were performed to validate the classification, dozens of trees were compared and the results were very good. This paper aims to help farmers to quickly and automatically classify trees by crown size, even if there are overlapping orchards, in order to easily monitor each tree’s health and understand the tree’s distribution in the field.},

ABSTRACT = {Vegetation inspection and monitoring is a time-consuming task. In the era of industrial revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), commercially known as drones, are in demand, being adopted for vegetation inspection and monitoring activities. However, most off-the-shelf drones are least favoured by vegetation maintenance departments for on-site inspection due to limited spectral bands camera restricting advanced vegetation analysis. Most of these drones are normally equipped with a normal red, green, and blue (RGB) camera. Additional spectral bands are found to produce more accurate analysis during vegetation inspection, but at the cost of advanced camera functionalities, such as multispectral camera. Vegetation indices (VI) is a technique to maximize detection sensitivity related to vegetation characteristics while minimizing other factors which are not categorised otherwise. The emergence of machine learning has slowly influenced the existing vegetation analysis technique in order to improve detection accuracy. This study focuses on exploring VI techniques in identifying vegetation objects. The selected VIs investigated are Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI), Green Leaf Index (GLI), and Vegetation Index Green (VIgreen). The chosen machine learning technique is You Only Look Once (YOLO), which is a clever convolutional neural network (CNN) offering object detection in real time. The CNN model has a symmetrical structure along the direction of the tensor flow. Several series of data collection have been conducted at identified locations to obtain aerial images. The proposed hybrid methods were tested on captured aerial images to observe vegetation detection performance. Segmentation in image analysis is a process to divide the targeted pixels for further detection testing. Based on our findings, more than 70% of the vegetation objects in the images were accurately detected, which reduces the misdetection issue faced by previous VI techniques. On the other hand, hybrid segmentation methods perform best with the combination of VARI and YOLO at 84% detection accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Water Resource Sustainability Management plays a vitally important role in ensuring sustainable development, especially in water-stressed arid regions throughout the world. In order to achieve sustainable development, it is necessary to study and monitor the water quality in the arid region of Central Asia, an area that is increasingly affected by climate change. In recent decades, the rapid deterioration of water quality in the Ebinur Lake basin in Xinjiang (China) has severely threatened sustainable economic development. This study selected the Ebinur Lake basin as the study target, with the purpose of revealing the response between the water quality index and water body reflectivity, and to describe the relationship between the water quality index and water reflectivity. The methodology employed remote sensing techniques that establish a water quality index monitoring model to monitor water quality. The results of our study include: (1) the Water Quality Index (WQI) that was used to evaluate the water environment in Ebinur Lake indicates a lower water quality of Ebinur Lake, with a WQI value as high as 4000; (2) an introduction of the spectral derivative method that realizes the extraction of spectral information from a water body to better mine the information of spectral data through remote sensing, and the results also prove that the spectral derivative method can improve the relationship between the water body spectral and WQI, whereby R2 is 0.6 at the most sensitive wavelengths; (3) the correlation between the spectral sensitivity index and WQI was greater than 0.6 at the significance level of 0.01 when multi-source spectral data were integrated with the spectral index (DI, RI and NDI) and fluorescence baseline; and (4) the distribution map of WQI in Ebinur Lake was obtained by the optimal model, which was constructed based on the third derivative data of Sentinel 2 data. We concluded that the water quality in the northwest of Ebinur Lake was the lowest in the region. In conclusion, we found that remote sensing techniques were highly effective and laid a foundation for water quality detection in arid areas.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper considers the self-localization of a tethered drone without using a cable-tension force sensor in GPS-denied environments. The original problem is converted to a state-estimation problem, where the cable-tension force and the three-dimensional position of the drone with respect to a ground platform are estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed approach uses the data reported by the onboard electric motors (i.e., the pulse width modulation (PWM) signals), accelerometers, gyroscopes, and altimeter, embedded in the commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) inertial measurement units (IMU). A system-identification experiment was conducted to determine the model that computes the drone thrust force using the PWM signals. The proposed approach was compared with an existing work that assumes known cable-tension force. Simulation results show that the proposed approach produces estimates with less than 0.3-m errors when the actual cable-tension force is greater than 1 N.},

ABSTRACT = {As nuclear technology evolves, and continues to be used in various fields since its discovery less than a century ago, radiation safety has become a major concern to humans and the environment. Radiation monitoring plays a significant role in preventive radiological nuclear detection in nuclear facilities, hospitals, or in any activities associated with radioactive materials by acting as a tool to measure the risk of being exposed to radiation while reaping its benefit. Apart from in occupational settings, radiation monitoring is required in emergency responses to radiation incidents as well as outdoor radiation zones. Several radiation sensors have been developed, ranging from as simple as a Geiger-Muller counter to bulkier radiation systems such as the High Purity Germanium detector, with different functionality for use in different settings, but the inability to provide real-time data makes radiation monitoring activities less effective. The deployment of manned vehicles equipped with these radiation sensors reduces the scope of radiation monitoring operations significantly, but the safety of radiation monitoring operators is still compromised. Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been introduced to the world and offered solutions to these limitations. This review elucidates a systematic understanding of the fundamental usage of the Internet of Drones for radiation monitoring purposes. The extension of essential functional blocks in IoT can be expanded across radiation monitoring industries, presenting several emerging research opportunities and challenges. This article offers a comprehensive review of the evolutionary application of IoT technology in nuclear and radiation monitoring. Finally, the security of the nuclear industry is discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Traffic density around the globe is increasing on a day-to-day basis, resulting in more accidents, congestion, and pollution. The dynamic vehicular environment induces challenges in designing an efficient and reliable protocol for communication. Timely delivery of safety and non-safety messages is necessary for traffic congestion control and for avoiding road mishaps. For efficient resource sharing and optimized channel utilization, the media access control (MAC) protocol plays a vital role. An efficient MAC protocol design can provide fair channel access and can delay constraint safety message dissemination, improving road safety. This paper reviews the applications, characteristics, and challenges faced in the design of MAC protocols. A classification of the MAC protocol is presented based on contention mechanisms and channel access. The classification based on contention is oriented as contention-based, contention-free, and hybrid, whereas the classification based on channel access is categorized as distributed, centralized, cluster-based, cooperative, token-based, and random access. These are further sub-classified as single-channel and multi-channel, based on the type of channel resources they utilize. This paper gives an analysis of the objectives, mechanisms, advantages/disadvantages, and simulators used in specified protocols. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on the future scope and open challenges for improving the MAC protocol design.},

ABSTRACT = {In soybean, there is a lack of research aiming to compare the performance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to predict more than one agronomic variable, such as days to maturity (DM), plant height (PH), and grain yield (GY). As these variables are important to developing an overall precision farming model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict DM, PH, and GY for soybean cultivars based on multispectral bands. The field experiment considered 524 genotypes of soybeans in the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 growing seasons and a multitemporal–multispectral dataset collected by embedded sensor in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We proposed a multilayer deep learning regression network, trained during 2000 epochs using an adaptive subgradient method, a random Gaussian initialization, and a 50% dropout in the first hidden layer for regularization. Three different scenarios, including only spectral bands, only vegetation indices, and spectral bands plus vegetation indices, were adopted to infer each variable (PH, DM, and GY). The DL model performance was compared against shallow learning methods such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and linear regression (LR). The results indicate that our approach has the potential to predict soybean-related variables using multispectral bands only. Both DL and RF models presented a strong (r surpassing 0.77) prediction capacity for the PH variable, regardless of the adopted input variables group. Our results demonstrated that the DL model (r = 0.66) was superior to predict DM when the input variable was the spectral bands. For GY, all machine learning models evaluated presented similar performance (r ranging from 0.42 to 0.44) for each tested scenario. In conclusion, this study demonstrated an efficient approach to a computational solution capable of predicting multiple important soybean crop variables based on remote sensing data. Future research could benefit from the information presented here and be implemented in subsequent processes related to soybean cultivars or other types of agronomic crops.},

ABSTRACT = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices have strict energy constraints as they often operate on a battery supply. The cryptographic operations within IoT devices consume substantial energy and are vulnerable to a class of hardware attacks known as side-channel attacks. To reduce the energy consumption and defend against side-channel attacks, we propose combining adiabatic logic and Magnetic Tunnel Junctions to form our novel Energy Efficient-Adiabatic CMOS/MTJ Logic (EE-ACML). EE-ACML is shown to be both low energy and secure when compared to existing CMOS/MTJ architectures. EE-ACML reduces dynamic energy consumption with adiabatic logic, while MTJs reduce the leakage power of a circuit. To show practical functionality and energy savings, we designed one round of PRESENT-80 with the proposed EE-ACML integrated with an adiabatic clock generator. The proposed EE-ACML-based PRESENT-80 showed energy savings of 67.24% at 25 MHz and 86.5% at 100 MHz when compared with a previously proposed CMOS/MTJ circuit. Furthermore, we performed a CPA attack on our proposed design, and the key was kept secret.},

ABSTRACT = {Controlling and managing surface source pollution depends on the rapid monitoring of total nitrogen in water. However, the complex factors affecting water quality (plant shading and suspended matter in water) make direct estimation extremely challenging. Considering the spectral response mechanisms of emergent plants, we coupled discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and fractional order discretization (FOD) techniques with three machine learning models (random forest (RF), bagging algorithm (bagging), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) to mine this potential spectral information. A total of 567 models were developed, and airborne hyperspectral data processed with various DWT scales and FOD techniques were compared. The effective information in the hyperspectral reflectance data were better emphasized after DWT processing. After DWT processing the original spectrum (OR), its sensitivity to TN in water was maximally improved by 0.22, and the correlation between FOD and TN in water was optimally increased by 0.57. The transformed spectral information enhanced the TN model accuracy, especially for FOD after DWT. For RF, 82% of the model R2 values improved by 0.02~0.72 compared to the model using FOD spectra; 78.8% of the bagging values improved by 0.01~0.53 and 65.0% of the XGBoost values improved by 0.01~0.64. The XGBoost model with DWT coupled with grey relation analysis (GRA) yielded the best estimation accuracy, with the highest precision of R2 = 0.91 for L6. In conclusion, appropriately scaled DWT analysis can substantially improve the accuracy of extracting TN from UAV hyperspectral images. These outcomes may facilitate the further development of accurate water quality monitoring in sophisticated global waters from drone or satellite hyperspectral data.},

Firstly, a pure backward motion and a pure rotational motion are applied to the mobile robot in succession. Thus, the principle point and the scaled focal length in x direction of the camera are identified through the visual feedback from a fixed onboard camera. Secondly, the identified parameters are used to build the system model in polar-coordinate representation. Then an adaptive non-smooth controller is designed to maneuver the mobile robot to the desired configuration under the nonholonomic constraint. And a switched strategy which consists of two image-based controllers is utilized for keeping the features in the field-of-view. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote eye tracking has become an important tool for the online analysis of learning processes. Mobile eye trackers can even extend the range of opportunities (in comparison to stationary eye trackers) to real settings, such as classrooms or experimental lab courses. However, the complex and sometimes manual analysis of mobile eye-tracking data often hinders the realization of extensive studies, as this is a very time-consuming process and usually not feasible for real-world situations in which participants move or manipulate objects. In this work, we explore the opportunities to use object recognition models to assign mobile eye-tracking data for real objects during an authentic students&rsquo; lab course. In a comparison of three different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a Faster Region-Based-CNN, you only look once (YOLO) v3, and YOLO v4, we found that YOLO v4, together with an optical flow estimation, provides the fastest results with the highest accuracy for object detection in this setting. The automatic assignment of the gaze data to real objects simplifies the time-consuming analysis of mobile eye-tracking data and offers an opportunity for real-time system responses to the user&rsquo;s gaze. Additionally, we identify and discuss several problems in using object detection for mobile eye-tracking data that need to be considered.},

ABSTRACT = {For monitoring protected forest landscapes over time it is essential to follow changes in tree species composition and forest dynamics. Data driven remote sensing methods provide valuable options if terrestrial approaches for forest inventories and monitoring activities cannot be applied efficiently due to restrictions or the size of the study area. We demonstrate how species can be detected at a single tree level utilizing a Random Forest (RF) model using the Black Forest National Park as an example of a Central European forest landscape with complex relief. The classes were European silver fir (Abies alba, AA), Norway spruce (Picea abies, PA), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris, PS), European larch (Larix decidua including Larix kampferii, LD), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii, PM), deciduous broadleaved species (DB) and standing dead trees (snags, WD). Based on a multi-temporal (leaf-on and leaf-off phenophase) and multi-spectral mosaic (R-G-B-NIR) with 10 cm spatial resolution, digital elevation models (DTM, DSM, CHM) with 40 cm spatial resolution and a LiDAR dataset with 25 pulses per m2, 126 variables were derived and used to train the RF algorithm with 1130 individual trees. The main objective was to determine a subset of meaningful variables for the RF model classification on four heterogeneous test sites. Using feature selection techniques, mainly passive optical variables from the leaf-off phenophase were considered due to their ability to differentiate between conifers and the two broader classes. An examination of the two phenological phases (using the difference of the respective NDVIs) is important to clearly distinguish deciduous trees from other classes including snags (WD). We also found that the variables of the first derivation of NIR and the tree metrics play a crucial role in discriminating PA und PS. With this unique set of variables some classes can be differentiated more reliably, especially LD and DB but also AA, PA and WD, whereas difficulties exist in identifying PM and PS. Overall, the non-parametric object-based approach has proved to be highly suitable for accurately detecting (OA: 89.5%) of the analyzed classes. Finally, the successful classification of complex 265 km2 study area substantiates our findings.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a secure blockchain-aware framework for distributed data management and monitoring. Indeed, images-based data are captured through drones and transmitted to the fog nodes. The main objective here is to enable process and schedule, to investigate individual captured entity (records) and to analyze changes in the blockchain storage with a secure hash-encrypted (SH-256) consortium peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The proposed blockchain mechanism is also investigated for analyzing the fog-cloud-based stored information, which is referred to as smart contracts. These contracts are designed and deployed to automate the overall distributed monitoring system. They include the registration of UAVs (drones), the day-to-day dynamic captured drone-based images, and the update transactions in the immutable storage for future investigations. The simulation results show the merit of our framework. Indeed, through extensive experiments, the developed system provides good performances regarding monitoring and management tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Some essential water conservation areas in China have continuously suffered from various serious problems such as water pollution and water quality deterioration in recent decades and thus called for real-time water pollution monitoring system underwater resources management. On the basis of the remote sensing data and ground monitoring data, this study firstly constructed a more accurate retrieval model for total phosphorus (TP) concentration by comparing 12 machine learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), lasso regression (Lasso), elastic net (EN), linear regression (LR), decision tree regressor (DTR), K neighbor regressor (KNR), random forest regressor (RFR), extra trees regressor (ETR), AdaBoost regressor (ABR) and gradient boosting regressor (GBR). Then, this study applied the constructed retrieval model to explore the spatial-temporal evolution of the Miyun Reservoir and finally assessed the water quality. The results showed that the model of TP concentration built by the ETR algorithm had the best accuracy, with the coefficient R2 reaching over 85% and the mean absolute error lower than 0.000433. The TP concentration in Miyun Reservoir was between 0.0380 and 0.1298 mg/L, and there was relatively significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity. It changed remarkably during the periods of the flood season, winter tillage, planting, and regreening, and it was lower in summer than in other seasons. Moreover, the TP in the southwest part of the reservoir was generally lower than in the northeast, as there was less human activities interference. According to the Environmental Quality Standard for the surface water environment, the water quality of Miyun Reservoir was overall safe, except only for an over-standard case occurrence in the spring and September. These conclusions can provide a significant scientific reference for water quality monitoring and management in Miyun Reservoir.},

ABSTRACT = {Flash floods occur almost exclusively in small basins, and they are common in small Mediterranean catchments. They pose one of the most common natural disasters, as well as one of the most devastating. Such was the case of the recent flood in Euboea island, in Greece, in August 2020. A field survey was accomplished after the 2020 flash floods in order to record the main impacts of the event and identify the geomorphological and man-made causes. The flash flood susceptibility in the urbanized alluvial fans was further assessed using a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based approach. Our findings suggest that a large portion of the alluvial fans of Politika, Poros and Mantania streams are mainly characterized by high and very high hazard. In fact, ~27% of the alluvial fans of Politika and Poros streams are characterized with very high susceptibility, and ~54% of Psachna area. GIS results have been confirmed by field observations after the 2020 flash flood, with significant damages noted, such as debris flows and infrastructure damages, in buildings, bridges and the road networks. In addition, even though the adopted approach may be more time-consuming in comparison to purely computational methods, it has the potential of being more accurate as it combines field observations and the effect of past flooding events.},

ABSTRACT = {Chlorophyll is an essential vegetation pigment influencing plant photosynthesis rate and growth conditions. Remote sensing images have been widely used for mapping vegetation chlorophyll content in different ecosystems (e.g., farmlands, forests, grasslands, and wetlands) for evaluating vegetation growth status and productivity of these ecosystems. Compared to farmlands and forests that are more homogeneous in terms of species composition, grasslands and wetlands are more heterogeneous with highly mixed species (e.g., various grass, forb, and shrub species). Different species contribute differently to the ecosystem services, thus, monitoring species-specific chlorophyll content is critical for better understanding their growth status, evaluating ecosystem functions, and supporting ecosystem management (e.g., control invasive species). However, previous studies in mapping chlorophyll content in heterogeneous ecosystems have rarely estimated species-specific chlorophyll content, which was partially due to the limited spatial resolution of remote sensing images commonly used in the past few decades for recognizing different species. In addition, many previous studies have used one universal model built with data of all species for mapping chlorophyll of the entire study area, which did not fully consider the impacts of species composition on the accuracy of chlorophyll estimation (i.e., establishing species-specific chlorophyll estimation models may generate higher accuracy). In this study, helicopter-acquired high-spatial resolution hyperspectral images were acquired for species classification and species-specific chlorophyll content estimation. Four estimation models, including a universal linear regression (LR) model (i.e., built with data of all species), species-specific LR models (i.e., built with data of each species, respectively), a universal random forest regression (RFR) model, and species-specific RFR models, were compared to determine their performance in mapping chlorophyll and to evaluate the impacts of species composition. The results show that species-specific models performed better than the universal models, especially for species with fewer samples in the dataset. The best performed species-specific models were then used to generate species-specific chlorophyll content maps using the species classification results. Impacts of species composition on the retrieval of chlorophyll content were further assessed to support future chlorophyll mapping in heterogeneous ecosystems and ecosystem management.},

ABSTRACT = {Forest mensuration remains critical in managing our forests sustainably, however, capturing such measurements remains costly, time-consuming and provides minimal amounts of information such as diameter at breast height (DBH), location, and height. Plot scale remote sensing techniques show great promise in extracting detailed forest measurements rapidly and cheaply, however, they have been held back from large-scale implementation due to the complex and time-consuming workflows required to utilize them. This work is focused on describing and evaluating an approach to create a robust, sensor-agnostic and fully automated forest point cloud measurement tool called the Forest Structural Complexity Tool (FSCT). The performance of FSCT is evaluated using 49 forest plots of terrestrial laser scanned (TLS) point clouds and 7022 destructively sampled manual diameter measurements of the stems. FSCT was able to match 5141 of the reference diameter measurements fully automatically with mean, median and root mean squared errors (RMSE) of 0.032 m, 0.02 m, and 0.103 m respectively. A video demonstration is also provided to qualitatively demonstrate the diversity of point cloud datasets that the tool is capable of measuring. FSCT is provided as open source, with the goal of enabling plot scale remote sensing techniques to replace most structural forest mensuration in research and industry. Future work on this project will seek to make incremental improvements to this methodology to further improve the reliability and accuracy of this tool in most high-resolution forest point clouds.},

ABSTRACT = {From the first use of airborne electromagnetic (AEM) systems for remote sensing in the 1950s, AEM data acquisition, processing and inversion technology have rapidly developed. Once used extensively for mineral exploration in its early days, the technology is increasingly being applied in other industries alongside ground-based investigation techniques. This paper reviews the application of onshore AEM in Norway over the past decades. Norway&rsquo;s rugged terrain and complex post-glacial sedimentary geology have contributed to the later adoption of AEM for widespread mapping compared to neighbouring Nordic countries. We illustrate AEM&rsquo;s utility by using two detailed case studies, including time-domain and frequency domain AEM. In both cases, we combine AEM with other geophysical, geological and geotechnical drillings to enhance interpretation, including machine learning methods. The end results included bedrock surfaces predicted with an accuracy of 25% of depth, identification of hazardous quick clay deposits, and sedimentary basin mapping. These case studies illustrate that although today&rsquo;s AEM systems do not have the resolution required for late-phase, detailed engineering design, AEM is a valuable tool for early-phase site investigations. Intrusive, ground-based methods are slower and more expensive, but when they are used to complement the weaknesses of AEM data, site investigations can become more efficient. With new developments of drone-borne (UAV) systems and increasing investment in AEM surveys, we see the potential for continued global adoption of this technology.},

ABSTRACT = {Soil changes, including landslides and erosion, are some of the most prominent post-fire effects in Mediterranean ecosystems. Landslide detection and monitoring play an essential role in mitigation measures. We tested two different methodologies in five burned sites with different characteristics in Central Greece. We compared Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-derived high-resolution Digital Surface Models and point clouds with terrestrial Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived point clouds to reveal new cracks and monitor scarps of pre-existing landslides. New cracks and scarps were revealed at two sites after the wildfire, measuring up to 27 m in length and up to 25 &plusmn; 5 cm in depth. Pre-existing scarps in both Kechries sites appeared to be active, with additional vertical displacements ranging from 5&ndash;15 &plusmn; 5 cm. In addition, the pre-existing landslide in Magoula expanded by 8%. Due to vegetation regrowth, no changes could be detected in the Agios Stefanos pre-existing landslide. This high-spatial-resolution mapping of slope deformations can be used as landslide precursor, assisting prevention measures. Considering the lack of vegetation after wildfires, UAV photogrammetry has great potential for tracing such early landslide indicators and is more efficient for accurately recording soil changes.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning-based models for building delineation from remotely sensed images face the challenge of producing precise and regular building outlines. This study investigates the combination of normalized digital surface models (nDSMs) with aerial images to optimize the extraction of building polygons using the frame field learning method. Results are evaluated at pixel, object, and polygon levels. In addition, an analysis is performed to assess the statistical deviations in the number of vertices of building polygons compared with the reference. The comparison of the number of vertices focuses on finding the output polygons that are the easiest to edit by human analysts in operational applications. It can serve as guidance to reduce the post-processing workload for obtaining high-accuracy building footprints. Experiments conducted in Enschede, the Netherlands, demonstrate that by introducing nDSM, the method could reduce the number of false positives and prevent missing the real buildings on the ground. The positional accuracy and shape similarity was improved, resulting in better-aligned building polygons. The method achieved a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 0.80 with the fused data (RGB + nDSM) against an IoU of 0.57 with the baseline (using RGB only) in the same area. A qualitative analysis of the results shows that the investigated model predicts more precise and regular polygons for large and complex structures.},

ABSTRACT = {Advances in spaceborne hyperspectral (HS) remote sensing, cloud-computing, and machine learning can help measure, model, map and monitor agricultural crops to address global food and water security issues, such as by providing accurate estimates of crop area and yield to model agricultural productivity. Leveraging these advances, we used the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion historical archive and the new generation DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) data to evaluate the performance of hyperspectral narrowbands in classifying major agricultural crops of the U.S. with machine learning (ML) on Google Earth Engine (GEE). EO-1 Hyperion images from the 2010&ndash;2013 growing seasons and DESIS images from the 2019 growing season were used to classify three world crops (corn, soybean, and winter wheat) along with other crops and non-crops near Ponca City, Oklahoma, USA. The supervised classification algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB), and the unsupervised clustering algorithm WekaXMeans (WXM) were run using selected optimal Hyperion and DESIS HS narrowbands (HNBs). RF and SVM returned the highest overall producer&rsquo;s, and user&rsquo;s accuracies, with the performances of NB and WXM being substantially lower. The best accuracies were achieved with two or three images throughout the growing season, especially a combination of an earlier month (June or July) and a later month (August or September). The narrow 2.55 nm bandwidth of DESIS provided numerous spectral features along the 400&ndash;1000 nm spectral range relative to smoother Hyperion spectral signatures with 10 nm bandwidth in the 400&ndash;2500 nm spectral range. Out of 235 DESIS HNBs, 29 were deemed optimal for agricultural study. Advances in ML and cloud-computing can greatly facilitate HS data analysis, especially as more HS datasets, tools, and algorithms become available on the Cloud.},

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the impacts of environmental factors on spatial–temporal and large-scale rodent distribution is important for rodent damage prevention. Investigating rat hole density (RHD) is one of the most effective methods to obtain the intensity of rodent damage. However, most of the previous field surveys or UAV-based remote sensing methods can only evaluate small-scale RHD and its influencing factors. However, these studies did not consider large-scale temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, we collected small-scale and in situ measurement records of RHD on the northern slope of the Tien Shan Mountains in Xinjiang (NTXJ), China, from 1982 to 2015, and then used correlation analysis and Bayesian network (BN) to analyze the environmental impacts on large-scale RHD with satellite remote sensing data such as the GIMMS NDVI product. The results show that the built BN can better quantify causality in the environmental mechanism modeling of RHD. The NDVI and LAI data from satellite remote sensing are important to the spatial–temporal RHD distribution and the mapping in the future. In regions with an elevation higher than 600 m (UPR) and lower than 600 m (LWR) of NTXJ, there are significant differences in the driving mechanism patterns of RHD, which are dependent on the elevation variation. In LWR, vegetation conditions have a weaker impact on RHD than UPR. It is possibly due to the Artemisia eaten by the dominant species Lagurus luteus (LL) in UPR being more sensitive to precipitation and temperature if compared with the Haloxylon ammodendron eaten by the Rhombomys opimus (RO) in LWR. In LWR, grazing intensity is more strongly and positively correlated to RHD than UPR, possibly due to both winter grazing and RO dependency on vegetation distribution; moreover, in UPR, sheep do not feed Artemisia as the main food, and the total vegetation is sufficient for sheep and LL to coexist. Under the different conditions of water availability of LWR and UPR, grazing may affect the ratio of aboveground and underground biomass by photosynthate allocation, thereby affecting the distribution of RHD. In extremely dry years, the RHD of LWR and UPR may have an indirect interactive relation due to changes in grazing systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), also known as Smart Transportation, is an infusion of information and communication technologies into transportation. ITS are a key component of smart cities, which have seen rapid global development in the last few decades. This has in turn translated to an increase in the deployment and adoption of ITS, particularly in countries in the Western world. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the developing countries of Africa and Asia, where dilapidated road infrastructure, poorly maintained public/mass transit vehicles and poverty are major concerns. However, the impact of Westernization and “imported technologies” cannot be overlooked; thus, despite the aforementioned challenges, ITS have found their way into African cities. In this paper, a systematic review was performed to determine the state of the art of ITS in Africa. The output of this systematic review was then fed into a hybrid multi-criteria model to analyse the research landscape, identify connections between published works and reveal research gaps and inequalities in African ITS. African peculiarities inhibiting the widespread implementation of ITS were then discussed, followed by the development of a conceptual architecture for an integrated ITS for African cities.},

ABSTRACT = {Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing can be used to estimate soil properties; however, little is known regarding the effects of UAV and satellite remote sensing data integration on the estimation of soil comprehensive attributes, or how to estimate quickly and robustly. In this study, we tackled those gaps by employing UAV multispectral and Sentinel-2B data to estimate soil salinity and chemical properties over a large agricultural farm (400 ha) covered by different crops and harvest areas at the coastal saline-alkali land of the Yellow River Delta of China in 2019. Spatial information of soil salinity, organic matter, available/total nitrogen content, and pH at 0&ndash;10 cm and 10&ndash;20 cm layers were obtained via ground sampling (n = 195) and two-dimensional spatial interpolation, aiming to overlap the soil information with remote sensing information. The exploratory factor analysis was conducted to generate latent variables, which represented the salinity and chemical characteristics of the soil. A machine learning algorithm (random forest) was applied to estimate soil attributes. Our results indicated that the integration of UAV texture and Sentinel-2B spectral data as random forest model inputs improved the accuracy of latent soil variable estimation. The remote sensing-based information from cropland (crop-based) had a higher accuracy compared to estimations performed on bare soil (soil-based). Therefore, the crop-based approach, along with the integration of UAV texture and Sentinel-2B data, is recommended for the quick assessment of soil comprehensive attributes.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: The increasing population of humans, changing food consumption behavior, as well as the recent developments in the awareness for food sustainability, lead to new challenges for the production of food. Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, including Machine Learning and data analytics, might help to account for these challenges. Scope and Approach: Several research perspectives, among them Precision Agriculture, Industrial IoT, Internet of Food, or Smart Health, already provide new opportunities through digitalization. In this paper, we review the current state-of-the-art of the mentioned concepts. An additional concept is Food Informatics, which so far is mostly recognized as a mainly data-driven approach to support the production of food. In this review paper, we propose and discuss a new perspective for the concept of Food Informatics as a supportive discipline that subsumes the incorporation of information technology, mainly IoT and AI, in order to support the variety of aspects tangent to the food production process and delineate it from other, existing research streams in the domain. Key Findings and Conclusions: Many different concepts related to the digitalization in food science overlap. Further, Food Informatics is vaguely defined. In this paper, we provide a clear definition of Food Informatics and delineate it from related concepts. We corroborate our new perspective on Food Informatics by presenting several case studies about how it can support the food production as well as the intermediate steps until its consumption, and further describe its integration with related concepts.},

ABSTRACT = {Synthetic-aperture radar&rsquo;s (SAR&rsquo;s) capacity to resolve the cloud cover concerns encountered while gathering optical data has tremendous potential for soil moisture data retrieval using SAR data. It is possible to use SAR data to recover soil moisture because the backscatter coefficient is sensitive to both soil and vegetation by penetrating through the vegetation layer. This study investigated the feasibility of employing a SAR-derived radar vegetation index (RVI), the ratios of the backscatter coefficients using polarizations of HH/HV (RHH/HV) and HV/HH (RHH/HV) to an oil palm crops as vegetation indicators in the water cloud model (WCM) using phased-array L-band SAR-2 (PALSAR-2). These data were compared to the manual leaf area index (LAI) and a physical soil sampling method for computing soil moisture. The field data included the LAI input parameters and, more importantly, physical soil samples from which to calculate the soil moisture. The fieldwork was carried out in Chuping District, Perlis State, Malaysia. Corresponding PALSAR-2 data were collected on three observation dates in 2019: 17 January, 16 April, and 9 July. The results showed that the WCM modeled using the LAI under HV polarization demonstrated promising accuracy, with the root mean square error recorded as 0.033 m3/m3. This was comparable to the RVI and RHH/HV under HV polarization, which had accuracies of 0.031 and 0.049 m3/m3, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that SAR-based indicators, RHH/HV and RVI using PALSAR-2, can be used to reduce field-related input in the retrieval of soil moisture data using the WCM for oil palm crop.},

ABSTRACT = {Earthquakes are one of the most catastrophic natural phenomena. After an earthquake, earthquake reconnaissance enables effective recovery by collecting data on building damage and other impacts. This paper aims to identify state-of-the-art data sources for building damage assessment and provide guidance for more efficient data collection. We have reviewed 39 articles that indicate the sources used by different authors to collect data related to damage and post-disaster recovery progress after earthquakes between 2014 and 2021. The current data collection methods have been grouped into seven categories: fieldwork or ground surveys, omnidirectional imagery (OD), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), remote sensing (RS), crowdsourcing platforms, social media (SM) and closed-circuit television videos (CCTV). The selection of a particular data source or collection technique for earthquake reconnaissance includes different criteria depending on what questions are to be answered by these data. We conclude that modern reconnaissance missions cannot rely on a single data source. Different data sources should complement each other, validate collected data or systematically quantify the damage. The recent increase in the number of crowdsourcing and SM platforms used to source earthquake reconnaissance data demonstrates that this is likely to become an increasingly important data source.},

ABSTRACT = {Airborne laser scanning has proven useful for rapid and extensive documentation of historic cultural landscapes after years of applications mapping natural landscapes and the built environment. The recent integration of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) with LiDAR systems is potentially transformative and offers complementary data for mapping targeted areas with high precision and systematic study of coupled natural and human systems. We report the results of data capture, analysis, and processing of UAV LiDAR data collected in the Maya Lowlands of Chiapas, Mexico in 2019 for a comparative landscape study. Six areas of archaeological settlement and long-term land-use reflecting a diversity of environments, land cover, and archaeological features were studied. These missions were characterized by areas that were variably forested, rugged, or flat, and included pre-Hispanic settlements and agrarian landscapes. Our study confirms that UAV LiDAR systems have great potential for broader application in high-precision archaeological mapping applications. We also conclude that these studies offer an important opportunity for multi-disciplinary collaboration. UAV LiDAR offers high-precision information that is not only useful for mapping archaeological features, but also provides critical information about long-term land use and landscape change in the context of archaeological resources.},

ABSTRACT = {This study examines the effects of quality of service, product awareness, and perceptions among customers of Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) on customer loyalty through technology integration using customer satisfaction as a mediator. A well-structured, comprehensive questionnaire was developed and data were collected from 203 respondents who were customers of six IFIs in Pakistan and had at least 2 years of experience in dealing confiorm this is correct with these IFIs. A total of 171 accurate responses were received from the respondents. Ten hypotheses were developed and statistically verified using regression and correlation analytical techniques. The results reveal that the quality of customer services and awareness of IFIs had a direct and positive relationship with customer loyalty, which in turn was mediated by customer satisfaction. Perceptions about IFIs had a direct positive relation with customer satisfaction. However, the relation of perceptions and quality of service with customer loyalty and satisfaction in financial institutions through technology integration was found to be insignificant, even in the presence of customer satisfaction as a mediator.},

ABSTRACT = {Detecting newly established invasive plants is key to prevent further spread. Traditional field surveys are challenging and often insufficient to identify the presence and extent of invasions. This is particularly true for wetland ecosystems because of difficult access, and because floating and submergent plants may go undetected in the understory of emergent plants. Unpiloted aerial systems (UAS) have the potential to revolutionize how we monitor invasive vegetation in wetlands, but key components of the data collection and analysis workflow have not been defined. In this study, we conducted a rigorous comparison of different methodologies for mapping invasive Emergent (Typha &times; glauca (cattail)), Floating (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae (European frogbit)), and Submergent species (Chara spp. and Elodea canadensis) using the machine learning classifier, random forest, in a Great Lakes wetland. We compared accuracies using (a) different spatial resolutions (11 cm pixels vs. 3 cm pixels), (b) two classification approaches (pixel- vs. object-based), and (c) including structural measurements (e.g., surface/canopy height models and rugosity as textural metrics). Surprisingly, the coarser resolution (11 cm) data yielded the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 81.4%, 2.5% higher than the best performing model of the finer (3 cm) resolution data. Similarly, the Mean Area Under the Receiving Operations Characteristics Curve (AUROC) and F1 Score from the 11 cm data yielded 15.2%, and 6.5% higher scores, respectively, than those in the 3 cm data. At each spatial resolution, the top performing models were from pixel-based approaches and included surface model data over those with canopy height or multispectral data alone. Overall, high-resolution maps generated from UAS classifications will enable early detection and control of invasive plants. Our workflow is likely applicable to other wetland ecosystems threatened by invasive plants throughout the globe.},

ABSTRACT = {The potential of hyperspectral measurements for early disease detection has been investigated by many experts over the last 5 years. One of the difficulties is obtaining enough data for training and building a hyperspectral training library. When the goal is to detect disease at a previsible stage, before the pathogen has manifested either its first symptoms or in the area surrounding the existing symptoms, it is impossible to objectively delineate the regions of interest containing the previsible pathogen growth from the areas without the pathogen growth. To overcome this, we propose an image labelling and segmentation algorithm that is able to (a) more objectively label the visible symptoms for the construction of a training library and (b) extend this labelling to the pre-visible symptoms. This algorithm is used to create hyperspectral training libraries for late blight disease (Phytophthora infestans) in potatoes and two types of leaf rust (Puccinia triticina and Puccinia striiformis) in wheat. The model training accuracies were compared between the automatic labelling algorithm and the classic visual delineation of regions of interest using a logistic regression machine learning approach. The modelling accuracies of the automatically labelled datasets were higher than those of the manually labelled ones for both potatoes and wheat, at 98.80% for P. infestans in potato, 97.69% for P. striiformis in soft wheat, and 96.66% for P. triticina in durum wheat.},

ABSTRACT = {Basal stem rot (BSR) disease occurs due to the most aggressive and threatening fungal attack of the oil palm plant known as Ganoderma boninense (G. boninense). BSR is a disease that has a significant impact on oil palm crops in Malaysia and Indonesia. Currently, the only sustainable strategy available is to extend the life of oil palm trees, as there is no effective treatment for BSR disease. This study used thermal imagery to identify the thermal features to classify non-infected and BSR-infected trees. The aims of this study were to (1) identify the potential temperature features and (2) examine the performance of machine learning (ML) classifiers (na&iuml;ve Bayes (NB), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF) to classify oil palm trees that are non-infected and BSR-infected. The sample size consisted of 55 uninfected trees and 37 infected trees. We used the imbalance data approaches such as random undersampling (RUS), random oversampling (ROS) and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) in these classifications due to the different sample sizes. The study found that the Tmax feature is the most beneficial temperature characteristic for classifying non-infected or infected BSR trees. Meanwhile, the ROS approach improves the curve region (AUC) and PRC results compared to a single approach. The result showed that the temperature feature Tmax and combination feature TmaxTmin had a higher correct classification for the G. boninense non-infected and infected oil palm trees for the ROS-RF and had a robust success rate, classifying correctly 87.10% for non-infected and 100% for infected by G. boninense. In terms of model performance using the most significant variables, Tmax, the ROS-RF model had an excellent receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve region (AUC) of 0.921, and the precision&ndash;recall curve (PRC) region gave a value of 0.902. Therefore, it can be concluded that the ROS-RF, using the Tmax, can be used to predict BSR disease with relatively high accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {We propose the Point Cloud Tree Species Classification Network (PCTSCN) to overcome challenges in classifying tree species from laser data with deep learning methods. The network is mainly composed of two parts: a sampling component in the early stage and a feature extraction component in the later stage. We used geometric sampling to extract regions with local features from the tree contours since these tend to be species-specific. Then we used an improved Farthest Point Sampling method to extract the features from a global perspective. We input the intensity of the tree point cloud as a dimensional feature and spatial information into the neural network and mapped it to higher dimensions for feature extraction. We used the data obtained by Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAVLS) to conduct tree species classification experiments of white birch and larch. The experimental results showed that in both the TLS and UAVLS datasets, the input tree point cloud density and the highest feature dimensionality of the mapping had an impact on the classification accuracy of the tree species. When the single tree sample obtained by TLS consisted of 1024 points and the highest dimension of the network mapping was 512, the classification accuracy of the trained model reached 96%. For the individual tree samples obtained by UAVLS, which consisted of 2048 points and had the highest dimension of the network mapping of 1024, the classification accuracy of the trained model reached 92%. TLS data tree species classification accuracy of PCTSCN was improved by 2&ndash;9% compared with other models using the same point density, amount of data and highest feature dimension. The classification accuracy of tree species obtained by UAVLS was up to 8% higher. We propose PCTSCN to provide a new strategy for the intelligent classification of forest tree species.},

ABSTRACT = {Building function labelling plays an important role in understanding human activities inside buildings. This study develops a method of function label classification using integrated features derived from remote sensing and crowdsensing data with an extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost). The classification framework is verified based on a dataset from Shenzhen, China. An extended label system for six building types (residential, commercial, office, industrial, public facilities, and others) was applied, and various social functions were considered. The overall classification accuracies were 88.15% (kappa index = 0.72) and 85.56% (kappa index = 0.69). The importance of features was evaluated using the occurrence frequency of features at decision nodes. In the six-category classification system, the basic building attributes (22.99%) and POIs (46.74%) contributed most to the classification process; moreover, the building footprint (7.40%) and distance to roads (11.76%) also made notable contributions. The result shows that it is feasible to extract building environments from POI labels and building footprint geometry with a dimensional reduction model using an autoencoder. Additionally, crowdsensing data (e.g., POI and distance to roads) will become increasingly important as classification tasks become more complicated and the importance of basic building attributes declines.},

ABSTRACT = {Anthropogenic marine debris (AMD) represent a global threat for aquatic environments. It is important to locate and monitor the distribution and presence of macroplastics along beaches to prevent degradation into microplastics (MP), which are potentially more harmful and more difficult to remove. UAV imaging represents a quick method for acquiring pictures with a ground spatial resolution of a few centimeters. In this work, we investigate strategies for AMD mapping on beaches with different ground resolutions and with elevation and multispectral data in support of RGB orthomosaics. Operators with varying levels of expertise and knowledge of the coastal environment map the AMD on four to five transects manually, using a range of photogrammetric tools. The initial survey was repeated after one year; in both surveys, beach litter was collected and further analyzed in the laboratory. Operators assign three levels of confidence when recognizing and describing AMD. Preliminary validation of results shows that items identified with high confidence were almost always classified properly. Approaching the detected items in terms of surface instead of a simple count increased the percentage of mapped litter significantly when compared to those collected. Multispectral data in near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths and digital surface models (DSMs) did not significantly improve the efficiency of manual mapping, even if vegetation features were removed using NDVI maps. In conclusion, this research shows that a good solution for performing beach AMD mapping can be represented by using RGB imagery with a spatial resolution of about 200 pix/m for detecting macroplastics and, in particular, focusing on the largest items. From the point of view of assessing and monitoring potential sources of MP, this approach is not only feasible but also quick, practical, and sustainable.},

ABSTRACT = {Target detection in offshore unmanned aerial vehicle data is still a challenge due to the complex characteristics of targets, such as multi-sizes, alterable orientation, and complex backgrounds. Herein, a YOLO-based detection model (YOLO-D) was proposed for target detection in offshore unmanned aerial vehicle data. Based on the YOLOv3 network, the residual module was improved by establishing dense connections and adding a dual-attention mechanism (CBAM) to enhance the use of features and global information. Then, the loss function of the YOLO-D model was added to the weight coefficients to increase detection accuracy for small-size targets. Finally, the feature pyramid network (FPN) was replaced by the secondary recursive feature pyramid network to reduce the impacts of a complicated environment. Taking the car, boat, and deposit near the coastline as the targets, the proposed YOLO-D model was compared against other models, including the faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and YOLOv5, to evaluate its detection performance. The results showed that the evaluation metrics of the YOLO-D model, including precision (Pr), recall (Re), average precision (AP), and the mean of average precision (mAP), had the highest values. The mAP of the YOLO-D model increased by 37.95%, 39.44%, 28.46%, and 5.08% compared to the faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3, and YOLOv5, respectively. The AP of the car, boat, and deposit reached 96.24%, 93.70%, and 96.79% respectively. Moreover, the YOLO-D model had a higher detection accuracy than other models, especially in the detection of small-size targets. Collectively, the proposed YOLO-D model is a suitable model for target detection in offshore unmanned aerial vehicle data.},

ABSTRACT = {mmWave radars play a vital role in autonomous systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), ground station control and monitoring systems. The challenging task when using mmWave radars is to estimate the accurate angle of arrival (AoA) of the targets, due to the limited number of receivers. In this paper, we present a novel AoA estimation technique, using mmWave FMCW radars operating in the frequency range 77&ndash;81 GHz by utilizing the mechanical rotation. Rotating the radar also increases the field of view in both azimuth and elevation. The proposed method estimates the AoA of the targets, using only a single transmitter and receiver. The measurements are carried out in a variety of practical scenarios including pedestrians, a car, and an UAV, also known as a drone. With measured data, range-angle maps are created, and morphological operators are used to estimate the AoA of the targets. We also process radar range-angle images for improved visual representation. The proposed method will be extremely beneficial for practical ground stations, traffic control and monitoring frameworks for both on-ground and airborne vehicles.},

ABSTRACT = {In general, the quality of imagery from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is evaluated after the flight, and then a decision is made on the further value and use of the acquired data. In this paper, an a priori (preflight) image quality prediction methodology is proposed to estimate the preflight image quality and to avoid unfavourable flights, which is extremely important from a time and cost management point of view. The XBoost Regressor model and cross-validation were used for machine learning of the model and image quality prediction. The model was learned on a rich database of real-world images acquired from UAVs under conditions varying in both sensor type, UAV type, exposure parameters, weather, topography, and land cover. Radiometric quality indices (SNR, Entropy, PIQE, NIQE, BRISQUE, and NRPBM) were calculated for each image to train and test the model and to assess the accuracy of image quality prediction. Different variants of preflight parameter knowledge were considered in the study. The proposed methodology offers the possibility of predicting image quality with high accuracy. The correlation coefficient between the actual and predicted image quality, depending on the number of parameters known a priori, ranged from 0.90 to 0.96. The methodology was designed for data acquired from a UAV. Similar prediction accuracy is expected for other low-altitude or close-range photogrammetric data.},

ABSTRACT = {Africa has the largest grassland area among all grassland ecosystems in the world. As a typical agricultural and animal husbandry country in Africa, animal husbandry plays an important role in this region. The investigation of grassland resources and timely grasping the quantity and spatial distribution of grassland resources are of great significance to the stable development of local animal husbandry economy. Therefore, this paper uses Kenya as the study area to investigate the effective and fast approach for grassland mapping with 100-m resolution using the open resources in the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) In the feature combination optimization part of this paper, the machine learning algorithm is used to compare the scores and standard deviations of several common algorithms combined with RFE. It is concluded that the combination of RFE and random forest algorithm has the highest stability in modeling and the best feature optimization effect. (2) After feature optimization by the RFE-RF algorithm, the number of features is reduced from 12 to 8, which compressed the original feature space and reduced the redundancy of features. The optimal combination features are applied to random forest classification, and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of classification are 0.87 and 0.85, respectively. The eight features are: elevation, NDVI, EVI, SWIR, RVI, BLUE, RED, and LSWI. (3) There are great differences in topographic features among the local land types in the study area, and the addition of topographic features is more conducive to the recognition and classification of various land types. There exists &ldquo;salt-and-pepper phenomenon&rdquo; in pixel-oriented classification. Later research focus will combine the RFE-RF algorithm and the segmentation algorithm to achieve object-oriented land cover classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can play a key role in meeting certain demands of cellular networks. UAVs can be used not only as user equipment (UE) in cellular networks but also as mobile base stations (BSs) wherein they can either augment conventional BSs by adapting their position to serve the changing traffic and connectivity demands or temporarily replace BSs that are damaged due to natural disasters. The flexibility of UAVs allows them to provide coverage to UEs in hot-spots, at cell-edges, in coverage holes, or regions with scarce cellular infrastructure. In this work, we study how UAV locations and other cellular parameters may be optimized in such scenarios to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE) of the network. We compare the performance of machine learning (ML) techniques with conventional optimization approaches. We found that, on an average, a double deep Q learning approach can achieve 93.46% of the optimal median SE and 95.83% of the optimal mean SE. A simple greedy approach, which tunes the parameters of each BS and UAV independently, performed very well in all the cases that we tested. These computationally efficient approaches can be utilized to enhance the network performance in existing cellular networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning is a promising method for image classification, including satellite images acquired by various sensors. However, the synergistic use of geospatial data for water body extraction from Sentinel-1 data using deep learning and the applicability of existing deep learning models have not been thoroughly tested for operational flood monitoring. Here, we present a novel water body extraction model based on a deep neural network that exploits Sentinel-1 data and flood-related geospatial datasets. For the model, the U-Net was customised and optimised to utilise Sentinel-1 data and other flood-related geospatial data, including digital elevation model (DEM), Slope, Aspect, Profile Curvature (PC), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI), and Buffer for the Southeast Asia region. Testing and validation of the water body extraction model was applied to three Sentinel-1 images for Vietnam, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. By segmenting 384 Sentinel-1 images, model performance and segmentation accuracy for all of the 128 cases that the combination of stacked layers had determined were evaluated following the types of combined input layers. Of the 128 cases, 31 cases showed improvement in Overall Accuracy (OA), and 19 cases showed improvement in both averaged intersection over union (IOU) and F1 score for the three Sentinel-1 images segmented for water body extraction. The averaged OA, IOU, and F1 scores of the &lsquo;Sentinel-1 VV&rsquo; band are 95.77, 80.35, and 88.85, respectively, whereas those of &lsquo;band combination VV, Slope, PC, and TRI&rsquo; are 96.73, 85.42, and 92.08, showing improvement by exploiting geospatial data. Such improvement was further verified with water body extraction results for the Chindwin river basin, and quantitative analysis of &lsquo;band combination VV, Slope, PC, and TRI&rsquo; showed an improvement of the F1 score by 7.68 percent compared to the segmentation output of the &lsquo;Sentinel-1 VV&rsquo; band. Through this research, it was demonstrated that the accuracy of deep learning-based water body extraction from Sentinel-1 images can be improved up to 7.68 percent by employing geospatial data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of research that demonstrates the synergistic use of geospatial data in deep learning-based water body extraction over wide areas. It is anticipated that the results of this research could be a valuable reference when deep neural networks are applied for satellite image segmentation for operational flood monitoring and when geospatial layers are employed to improve the accuracy of deep learning-based image segmentation.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a measurement of risk (MOR) method to recognize risky driving behavior based on the trajectory data extracted from surveillance videos. Three types of risky driving behavior are studied in this paper, i.e., speed-unstable driving, serpentine driving, and risky car-following driving. The risky driving behavior recognition model contains an MOR-based risk evaluation model and an MOR threshold selection method. An MOR-based risk evaluation model is established for three types of risky driving behavior based on driving features to quantify collision risk. Then, we propose two methods, i.e., the distribution-based method and the boxplot-based method, to determine the threshold value of the MOR to recognize risky driving behavior. Finally, the trajectory data extracted from UAV videos are used to validate the proposed model. The impact of vehicle types is also taken into consideration in the model. The results show that there are significant differences between threshold values for cars and heavy trucks when performing speed-unstable driving and risky car-following driving. In addition, the difference between the proportion of recognized risky driving behavior in the testing dataset compared with that in the training dataset is limited to less than 3.5%. The recognition accuracy of risky driving behavior with the boxplot- and distribution-based methods are, respectively, 91% and 86%, indicating the validation of the proposed model. The proposed model can be widely applied to risky driving behavior recognition in video-based surveillance systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a booming area in artificial intelligence. The applications of RL are endless nowadays, ranging from fields such as medicine or finance to manufacturing or the gaming industry. Although multiple works argue that RL can be key to a great part of intelligent vehicle control related problems, there are many practical problems that need to be addressed, such as safety related problems that can result from non-optimal training in RL. For instance, for an RL agent to be effective it should first cover all the situations during training that it may face later. This is often difficult when applied to the real-world. In this work we investigate the impact of RL applied to the context of intelligent vehicle control. We analyse the implications of RL in path planning tasks and we discuss two possible approaches to overcome the gap between the theorical developments of RL and its practical applications. Specifically, firstly this paper discusses the role of Curriculum Learning (CL) to structure the learning process of intelligent vehicle control in a gradual way. The results show how CL can play an important role in training agents in such context. Secondly, we discuss a method of transferring RL policies from simulation to reality in order to make the agent experience situations in simulation, so it knows how to react to them in reality. For that, we use Arduino Y&uacute;n controlled robots as our platforms. The results enhance the effectiveness of the presented approach and show how RL policies can be transferred from simulation to reality even when the platforms are resource limited.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have gained widespread interest in civilian and military applications, which has led to the development of novel UAVs that can perform various operations. UAVs are aircraft that can fly without the need of a human pilot onboard, meaning they can fly either autonomously or be remotely piloted. They can be equipped with multiple sensors, including cameras, inertial measurement units (IMUs), LiDAR, and GPS, to collect and transmit data in real time. Due to the demand for UAVs in various applications such as precision agriculture, search and rescue, wireless communications, and surveillance, several types of UAVs have been invented with different specifications for their size, weight, range and endurance, engine type, and configuration. Because of this variety, the design process and analysis are based on the type of UAV, with the availability of several control techniques that could be used to improve the flight of the UAV in order to avoid obstacles and potential collisions, as well as find the shortest path to save the battery life with the support of optimization techniques. However, UAVs face several challenges in order to fly smoothly, including collision avoidance, battery life, and intruders. This review paper presents UAVs&rsquo; classification, control applications, and future directions in industry and research interest. For the design process, fabrication, and analysis, various control approaches are discussed in detail. Furthermore, the challenges for UAVs, including battery charging, collision avoidance, and security, are also presented and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, pavement management systems (PMS) are mainly based on monitoring processes that have been established for a long time, and strongly depend on acquired experience. However, with the emergence of smart technologies, such as internet of things and artificial intelligence, PMS could be improved by applying these new smart technologies to their decision support systems, not just by updating their data collection methodologies, but also their data analysis tools. The application of these smart technologies to the field of pavement monitoring and condition evaluation will undoubtedly contribute to more efficient, less costly, safer, and environmentally friendly methodologies. Thus, the main drive of the present work is to provide insight for the development of future decision support systems for smart pavement management by conducting a systematic literature review of the developed works that apply smart technologies to this field. The conclusions drawn from the analysis allowed for the identification of a series of future direction recommendations for researchers. In fact, future PMS should tend to be capable of collecting and analyzing data at different levels, both externally at the surface or inside the pavement, as well as to detect and predict all types of functional and structural flaws and defects.},

ABSTRACT = {The integration of geospatial data in hydrography, performed using different measurement systems, involves combining several study results to provide a comprehensive analysis. Each of the hydroacoustic and optoelectronic systems is characterised by a different spatial reference system and the method for technical implementation of the measurement. Therefore, the integration of hydrographic data requires that problems in selected fields of electronics, geodesy and physics (acoustics and optics) be solved. The aim of this review is to present selected fusion methods applying the data derived from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Real Time Kinematic (RTK) measurements, hydrographic surveys, a photogrammetric pass using unmanned vehicles and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and compare their accuracy. An additional goal is the evalution of data integration methods according to the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S-44 standard. The publication is supplemented by implementation examples of the integration of geospatial data in the Geographic Information System (GIS). The methods described indicate the lack of a uniform methodology for data fusion due to differences in both the spatial reference systems and the techniques used. However, the integration of hydroacoustic and optoelectronic data allows for high accuracy geospatial data to be obtained. This is confirmed by the methods cited, in which the accuracy of integrated geospatial data was in the order of several centimetres.},

ABSTRACT = {The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autopilot flight to survey urban rooftop solar panels needs a certain flight altitude at a level that can avoid obstacles such as high-rise buildings, street trees, telegraph poles, etc. For this reason, the autopilot-based thermal imaging has severe data redundancy&mdash;namely, that non-solar panel area occupies more than 99% of ground target, causing a serious lack of the thermal markers on solar panels. This study aims to explore the correlations between the thermal signatures of urban rooftop solar panels obtained from a UAV video stream and autopilot-based photomosaic. The thermal signatures of video imaging are strongly correlated (0.89&ndash;0.99) to those of autopilot-based photomosaics. Furthermore, the differences in the thermal signatures of solar panels between the video and photomosaic are aligned in the range of noise equivalent differential temperature with a 95% confidence level. The results of this study could serve as a valuable reference for employing video stream-based thermal imaging to urban rooftop solar panels.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided multi-antenna configured downlink mmWave cooperative generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) system is proposed. To provide physical layer security (PLS), a 3D controlled Lorenz mapping system is introduced. Furthermore, the combination of T-transformation spreading codes, walsh Hadamard transform, and discrete Fourier transform (DFT) techniques are integrated with a novel linear multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) gyre precoding (GP) for multi-user interference reduction. Furthermore, concatenated channel-coding with multi-user beamforming weighting-aided maximum-likelihood and zero forcing (ZF) signal detection schemes for an improved bit error rate (BER) are also used. The system is then simulated with a single base station (BS), eight massive machine-type communications (mMTC) users, and two UAV relay stations (RSs). Numerical results reveal the robustness of the proposed system in terms of PLS and an achievable ergodic rate with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) under the implementation of T-transformation scheme. By incorporating the 3D mobility model, brownian perturbations of the UAVs are also analyzed. An out-of-band (OOB) reduction of 320 dB with an improved BER of 1&times;10&minus;4 in 16-QAM for a signal-to-noise ratio, Eb/N0, of 20 dB is achieved.},

ABSTRACT = {Several cities have recently moved towards becoming smart cities for better services and quality of life for residents and visitors, with: optimized resource utilization; increased environmental protection; enhanced infrastructure operations and maintenance; and strong safety and security measures. Smart cities depend on deploying current and new technologies and different optimization methods to enhance services and performance in their different sectors. Some of the technologies assisting smart city applications are the Internet of Things (IoT), fog computing, and cloud computing. Integrating these three to serve one system (we will refer to it as integrated IoT-fog-cloud system (iIFC)) creates an advanced platform to develop and operate various types of smart city applications. This platform will allow applications to use the best features from the IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud services to deliver best capabilities and performance. Utilizing this powerful platform will provide many opportunities for enhancing and optimizing applications in energy, transportation, healthcare, and other areas. In this paper we survey various applications of iIFCs for smart cities. We identify different common issues associated with utilizing iIFCs for smart city applications. These issues arise due to the characteristics of iIFCs on the one side and the requirements of different smart city applications on the other. In addition, we outline the main requirements to effectively utilize iIFCs for smart city applications. These requirements are related to optimization, networking, and security.},

ABSTRACT = {Cloud robotics and advanced communications can foster a step-change in cooperative robots and hybrid wireless sensor networks (H-WSN) for demanding environments (e.g., disaster response, mining, demolition, and nuclear sites) by enabling the timely sharing of data and computational resources between robot and human teams. However, the operational complexity of such multi-agent systems requires defining effective architectures, coping with implementation details, and testing in realistic deployments. This article proposes X-IoCA, an Internet of robotic things (IoRT) and communication architecture consisting of a hybrid and heterogeneous network of wireless transceivers (H2WTN), based on LoRa and BLE technologies, and a robot operating system (ROS) network. The IoRT is connected to a feedback information system (FIS) distributed among multi-access edge computing (MEC) centers. Furthermore, we present SAR-IoCA, an implementation of the architecture for search and rescue (SAR) integrated into a 5G network. The FIS for this application consists of an SAR-FIS (including a path planner for UGVs considering risks detected by a LoRa H-WSN) and an ROS-FIS (for real-time monitoring and processing of information published throughout the ROS network). Moreover, we discuss lessons learned from using SAR-IoCA in a realistic exercise where three UGVs, a UAV, and responders collaborated to rescue victims from a tunnel accessible through rough terrain.},

ABSTRACT = {Modern wireless networks are notorious for being very dense, uncoordinated, and selfish, especially with greedy user needs. This leads to a critical scarcity problem in spectrum resources. The Dynamic Spectrum Access system (DSA) is considered a promising solution for this scarcity problem. With the aid of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), a post-disaster surveillance system is implemented using Cognitive Radio Network (CRN). UAVs are distributed in the disaster area to capture live images of the damaged area and send them to the disaster management center. CRN enables UAVs to utilize a portion of the spectrum of the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) gates operating in the same area. In this paper, a joint transmission power selection, data-rate maximization, and interference mitigation problem is addressed. Considering all these conflicting parameters, this problem is investigated as a budget-constrained multi-player multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. The whole process is done in a decentralized manner, where no information is exchanged between UAVs. To achieve this, two power-budget-aware PBA-MAB) algorithms, namely upper confidence bound (PBA-UCB (MAB) algorithm and Thompson sampling (PBA-TS) algorithm, were proposed to realize the selection of the transmission power value efficiently. The proposed PBA-MAB algorithms show outstanding performance over random power value selection in terms of achievable data rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV, aka drones) are being used for mapping macro-litter in the environment. As drone images require a manual processing task for detecting marine litter, it is of interest to evaluate the accuracy of non-expert citizen science operators (CSO) in performing this task. Students from Italian secondary schools (in this work, the CSO) were invited to identify, mark, and classify stranded litter items on a UAV orthophoto collected on an Italian beach. A specific training program and working tools were developed for the aim. The comparison with the standard in situ visual census survey returned a general underestimation (50%) of items. However, marine litter bulk categorisation was fairly in agreement with the in situ survey, especially for sources classification. The concordance level among CSO ranged between 60% and 91%, depending on the item properties considered (type, material, and colour). As the assessment accuracy was in line with previous works developed by experts, remote detection of marine litter on UAV images can be improved through citizen science programs, upon an appropriate training plan and provision of specific tools.},

ABSTRACT = {Hyper-DRELIO (Hyperspectral DRone for Environmental and LIttoral Observations) is a custom, mini-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) platform (&lt;20 kg), equipped with a light push broom hyperspectral sensor combined with a navigation module measuring position and orientation. Because of the particularities of UAV surveys (low flight altitude, small spatial scale, and high resolution), dedicated pre-processing methods have to be developed when reconstructing hyperspectral imagery. This article presents light, easy-implementation, in situ methods, using only two Spectralon&reg; and a field spectrometer, allowing performance of an initial calibration of the sensor in order to correct &ldquo;vignetting effects&rdquo; and a field standardization to convert digital numbers (DN) collected by the hyperspectral camera to reflectance, taking into account the time-varying illumination conditions. Radiometric corrections are applied to a subset of a dataset collected above mudflats colonized by pioneer mangroves in French Guiana. The efficiency of the radiometric corrections is assessed by comparing spectra from Hyper-DRELIO imagery to in situ spectrometer measurements above the intertidal benthic biofilm and mangroves. The shapes of the spectra were consistent, and the spectral angle mapper (SAM) distance was 0.039 above the benthic biofilm and 0.159 above the mangroves. These preliminary results provide new perspectives for quantifying and mapping the benthic biofilm and mangroves at the scale of the Guianese intertidal mudbanks system, given their importance in the coastal food webs, biogeochemical cycles, and the sediment stabilization.},

ABSTRACT = {Temperature is often used to infer how climate influences wildlife distributions; yet, other parameters also contribute, separately and combined, with effects varying across geographical scales. Here, we used an unoccupied aircraft system to explore how environmental parameters affect the regional distribution of the terrestrial and marine breeding habitats of threatened loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). Surveys spanned four years and ~620 km coastline of western Greece, encompassing low (&lt;10 nests/km) to high (100&ndash;500 nests/km) density nesting areas. We recorded 2395 tracks left by turtles on beaches and 1928 turtles occupying waters adjacent to these beaches. Variation in beach track and inwater turtle densities was explained by temperature, offshore prevailing wind, and physical marine and terrestrial factors combined. The highest beach-track densities (400 tracks/km) occurred on beaches with steep slopes and higher sand temperatures, sheltered from prevailing offshore winds. The highest inwater turtle densities (270 turtles/km) occurred over submerged sandbanks, with warmer sea temperatures associated with offshore wind. Most turtles (90%) occurred over nearshore submerged sandbanks within 10 km of beaches supporting the highest track densities, showing the strong linkage between optimal marine and terrestrial environments for breeding. Our findings demonstrate the utility of UASs in surveying marine megafauna and environmental data at large scales and the importance of integrating multiple factors in climate change models to predict species distributions.},

ABSTRACT = {In the recent decade, the rapid development of drone technologies has made many spatial problems easier to solve, including the problem of 3D reconstruction of large objects. A review of existing solutions has shown that most of the works lack the autonomy of drones because of nonscalable mapping techniques. This paper presents a method for centralized multi-drone 3D reconstruction, which allows performing a data capturing process autonomously and requires drones equipped only with an RGB camera. The essence of the method is a multiagent approach&mdash;the control center performs the workload distribution evenly and independently for all drones, allowing simultaneous flights without a high risk of collision. The center continuously receives RGB data from drones and performs each drone localization (using visual odometry estimations) and rough online mapping of the environment (using image descriptors for estimating the distance to the building). The method relies on a set of several user-defined parameters, which allows the tuning of the method for different task-specific requirements such as the number of drones, 3D model detalization, data capturing time, and energy consumption. By numerical experiments, it is shown that method parameters can be estimated by performing a set of computations requiring characteristics of drones and the building that are simple to obtain. Method performance was evaluated by an experiment with virtual building and emulated drone sensors. Experimental evaluation showed that the precision of the chosen algorithms for online localization and mapping is enough to perform simultaneous flights and the amount of captured RGB data is enough for further reconstruction.},

ABSTRACT = {Pothole repair is one of the paramount tasks in road maintenance. Effective road surface monitoring is an ongoing challenge to the management agency. The current pothole detection, which is conducted image processing with a manual operation, is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Computer vision offers a mean to automate its visual inspection process using digital imaging, hence, identifying potholes from a series of images. The goal of this study is to apply different YOLO models for pothole detection. Three state-of-the-art object detection frameworks (i.e., YOLOv4, YOLOv4-tiny, and YOLOv5s) are experimented to measure their performance involved in real-time responsiveness and detection accuracy using the image set. The image set is identified by running the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) on several deep learning pothole detectors. After collecting a set of 665 images in 720 &times; 720 pixels resolution that captures various types of potholes on different road surface conditions, the set is divided into training, testing, and validation subsets. A mean average precision at 50% Intersection-over-Union threshold (mAP_0.5) is used to measure the performance of models. The study result shows that the mAP_0.5 of YOLOv4, YOLOv4-tiny, and YOLOv5s are 77.7%, 78.7%, and 74.8%, respectively. It confirms that the YOLOv4-tiny is the best fit model for pothole detection.},

ABSTRACT = {The detection of buildings in the city is essential in several geospatial domains and for decision-making regarding intelligence for city planning, tax collection, project management, revenue generation, and smart cities, among other areas. In the past, the classical approach used for building detection was by using the imagery and it entailed human&ndash;computer interaction, which was a daunting proposition. To tackle this task, a novel network based on an end-to-end deep learning framework is proposed to detect and classify buildings features. The proposed CNN has three parallel stream channels: the first is the high-resolution aerial imagery, while the second stream is the digital surface model (DSM). The third was fixed on extracting deep features using the fusion of channel one and channel two, respectively. Furthermore, the channel has eight group convolution blocks of 2D convolution with three max-pooling layers. The proposed model&rsquo;s efficiency and dependability were tested on three different categories of complex urban building structures in the study area. Then, morphological operations were applied to the extracted building footprints to increase the uniformity of the building boundaries and produce improved building perimeters. Thus, our approach bridges a significant gap in detecting building objects in diverse environments; the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of the proposed method are greater than 80% and 0.605, respectively. The findings support the proposed framework and methodologies&rsquo; efficacy and effectiveness at extracting buildings from complex environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, technology utilizing ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors for robot localization in an indoor environment where the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) cannot be used has begun to be actively studied. UWB-based positioning has the advantage of being able to work even in an environment lacking feature points, which is a limitation of positioning using existing vision- or LiDAR-based sensing. However, UWB-based positioning requires the pre-installation of UWB anchors and the precise location of coordinates. In addition, when using a sensor that measures only the one-dimensional distance between the UWB anchor and the tag, there is a limitation whereby the position of the robot is solved but the orientation cannot be acquired. To overcome this, a framework based on an interacting multiple model (IMM) filter that tightly integrates an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor and a UWB sensor is proposed in this paper. However, UWB-based distance measurement introduces large errors in multipath environments with obstacles or walls between the anchor and the tag, which degrades positioning performance. Therefore, we propose a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) robust UWB ranging model to improve the pose estimation performance. Finally, the localization performance of the proposed framework is verified through experiments in real indoor environments.},

Conventionally, the high dimension of the Q-table is a primary drawback when implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm. To overcome the obstacle, the idea underlying the n-armed bandit problem is used in this paper. Moreover, gain-scheduled actions are presented to tune the algorithms to improve the overall system behavior; therefore, the proposed controllers fulfill the multiple performance requirements. An experiment was conducted for the piezo-actuated stage to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control designs relative to competing algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: As the Internet of Things (IoT) has become more prevalent in recent years, digital twins have attracted a lot of attention. A digital twin is a virtual representation that replicates a physical object or process over a period of time. These tools directly assist in reducing the manufacturing and supply chain lead time to produce a lean, flexible, and smart production and supply chain setting. Recently, reinforced machine learning has been introduced in production and logistics systems to build prescriptive decision support platforms to create a combination of lean, smart, and agile production setup. Therefore, there is a need to cumulatively arrange and systematize the past research done in this area to get a better understanding of the current trend and future research directions from the perspective of Industry 4.0. Methods: Strict keyword selection, search strategy, and exclusion criteria were applied in the Scopus database (2010 to 2021) to systematize the literature. Results: The findings are snowballed as a systematic review and later the final data set has been conducted to understand the intensity and relevance of research work done in different subsections related to the context of the research agenda proposed. Conclusion: A framework for data-driven digital twin generation and reinforced learning has been proposed at the end of the paper along with a research paradigm.},

ABSTRACT = {The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as base station (BS) is gaining popularity. In this paper, we consider maximization of the overall data rate by intelligent deployment of UAV BS in the downlink of a cellular system. We investigate a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided approach to optimize the position of flying BSs mounted on board UAVs to support a macro BS (MBS). We propose an algorithm to avoid collision between multiple UAVs undergoing exploratory movements and to restrict UAV BSs movement within a predefined area. Q-learning technique is used to optimize UAV BS position, where the reward is equal to sum of user equipment (UE) data rates. We consider a framework where the UAV BSs carry out exploratory movements in the beginning and exploitary movements in later stages to maximize the overall data rate. Our results show that a cellular system with three UAV BSs and one MBS serving 72 UE reaches 69.2% of the best possible data rate, which is identified by brute force search. Finally, the RL algorithm is compared with a K-means algorithm to study the need of accurate UE locations. Our results show that the RL algorithm outperforms the K-means clustering algorithm when the measure of imperfection is higher. The proposed algorithm can be made use of by a practical MBS&ndash;UAV BSs&ndash;UEs system to provide protection to UAV BSs while maximizing data rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Stem biomass is a fundamental component of the global carbon cycle that is essential for forest productivity estimation. Over the last few decades, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has proven to be a useful tool for accurate carbon stock and biomass estimation in various biomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of multispectral LiDAR data for the reliable estimation of single-tree total and barkless stem biomass (TSB and BSB) in an uneven-aged structured forest with complex topography. Destructive and non-destructive field measurements were collected for a total of 67 dominant and co-dominant Abies borisii-regis trees located in a mountainous area in Greece. Subsequently, two allometric equations were constructed to enrich the reference data with non-destructively sampled trees. Five different regression algorithms were tested for single-tree BSB and TSB estimation using height (height percentiles and bicentiles, max and average height) and intensity (skewness, standard deviation and average intensity) LiDAR-derived metrics: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Gaussian Process (GP), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The results showcased that the RF algorithm provided the best overall predictive performance in both BSB (i.e., RMSE = 175.76 kg and R2 = 0.78) and TSB (i.e., RMSE = 211.16 kg and R2 = 0.65) cases. Our work demonstrates that BSB can be estimated with moderate to high accuracy using all the tested algorithms, contrary to the TSB, where only three algorithms (RF, SVR and GP) can adequately provide accurate TSB predictions due to bark irregularities along the stems. Overall, the multispectral LiDAR data provide accurate stem biomass estimates, the general applicability of which should be further tested in different biomes and ecosystems.},

ABSTRACT = {This study analyzed highly correlated, feature-rich datasets from hyperspectral remote sensing data using multiple statistical and machine-learning methods. The effect of filter-based feature selection methods on predictive performance was compared. In addition, the effect of multiple expert-based and data-driven feature sets, derived from the reflectance data, was investigated. Defoliation of trees (%), derived from in situ measurements from fall 2016, was modeled as a function of reflectance. Variable importance was assessed using permutation-based feature importance. Overall, the support vector machine (SVM) outperformed other algorithms, such as random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and lasso (L1) and ridge (L2) regressions by at least three percentage points. The combination of certain feature sets showed small increases in predictive performance, while no substantial differences between individual feature sets were observed. For some combinations of learners and feature sets, filter methods achieved better predictive performances than using no feature selection. Ensemble filters did not have a substantial impact on performance. The most important features were located around the red edge. Additional features in the near-infrared region (800&ndash;1000 nm) were also essential to achieve the overall best performances. Filter methods have the potential to be helpful in high-dimensional situations and are able to improve the interpretation of feature effects in fitted models, which is an essential constraint in environmental modeling studies. Nevertheless, more training data and replication in similar benchmarking studies are needed to be able to generalize the results.},

ABSTRACT = {A record-breaking agglomeration of Sargassum was packed along the northern Jeju coast in Korea in 2021, and laborers suffered from removing them from the beach. If remote sensing can be used to detect the locations at which Sargassum accumulated in a timely and accurate manner, we could remove them before their arrival and reduce the damage caused by Sargassum. This study aims to detect Sargassum distribution on the coast of Jeju Island using the Geostationary KOMPSAT 2B (GK2B) Geostationary Ocean Color Imager-II (GOCI-II) imagery that was launched in February 2020, with measurements available since October 2020. For this, we used GOCI-II imagery during the first 6 months and machine learning models including Fine Tree, a Fine Gaussian support vector machine (SVM), and Gentle adaptive boosting (GentleBoost). We trained the models with the GOCI-II Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (RhoC) image and a ground truth map extracted from high-resolution images as input and output, respectively. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were carried out using the three machine learning models and traditional methods such as Sargassum indexes. We found that GentleBoost showed a lower false positive (6.2%) and a high F-measure level (0.82), and a more appropriate Sargassum distribution compared to other methods. The application of the machine learning model to GOCI-II images in various atmospheric conditions is therefore considered successful for mapping Sargassum extent quickly, enabling reduction of laborers&rsquo; efforts to remove them.},

ABSTRACT = {The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a global biodiversity hotspot and has been extensively mapped using satellite remote sensing. However, past mapping focused on overall forest cover without consideration of keystone plant resources such as Araucaria angustifolia.&nbsp;A. angustifolia is a critically endangered coniferous tree that is essential for supporting overall biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest. A. angustifolia&rsquo;s distribution has declined dramatically because of overexploitation and land-use changes. Accurate detection and rapid assessments of the distribution and abundance of this species are urgently needed. We compared two approaches for mapping Araucaria angustifolia across two scales (stand vs. individual tree) at three study sites in Brazil. The first approach used Worldview-2 images and Random Forest in Google Earth Engine to detect A. angustifolia at the stand level, with an accuracy of &gt;90% across all three study sites. The second approach relied on object identification using UAV-LiDAR and successfully mapped individual trees (producer&rsquo;s/user&rsquo;s accuracy = 94%/64%) at one study site. Both approaches can be employed in tandem to map remaining stands and to determine the exact location of A. angustifolia trees. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we discuss their adoptability by managers to inform conservation of A. angustifolia.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, more and more solutions have utilised artificial intelligence approaches in order to enhance or optimise processes to achieve greater sustainability. One of the most pressing issues is the emissions caused by cars; in this paper, the problem of optimising the route of delivery cars is tackled. In this paper, the applicability of the deep reinforcement learning algorithms with regards to the aforementioned problem is tested on a simulation game designed and implemented to pose various challenges such as constant change of delivery locations. The algorithms chosen for this task are Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) with and without Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). These novel and advanced reinforcement learning algorithms have yet not been utilised in similar scenarios. The differences in performance and learning process of those are visualised and discussed. It is demonstrated that both of those algorithms present a slow but steady learning curve, which is an expected effect of reinforcement learning algorithms, leading to a conclusion that the algorithms would discover an optimal policy with an adequately long learning process. Additionally, the benefits of the Proximal Policy Optimisation algorithm are proven by the enhanced learning curve with comparison to the Advantage Actor-Critic approach, as the learning process is characterised by faster growth with a significantly smaller variation. Finally, the applicability of such algorithms in the described scenarios is discussed, alongside the possible improvements and future work.},

ABSTRACT = {The vision-based robot pose estimation and mapping system has the disadvantage of low pose estimation accuracy and poor local detail mapping effects, while the modeling environment has poor features, high dynamics, weak light, and multiple shadows, among others. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive pose fusion (APF) method to fuse the robot&rsquo;s pose and use the optimized pose to construct an indoor map. Firstly, the proposed method calculates the robot&rsquo;s pose by the camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU), respectively. Then, the pose fusion method is adaptively selected according to the motion state of the robot. When the robot is in a static state, the proposed method directly uses the extended Kalman filter (EKF) method to fuse camera and IMU data. When the robot is in a motive state, the weighted coefficient is determined according to the matching success rate of the feature points, and the weighted pose fusion (WPF) method is used to fuse camera and IMU data. According to the different states, a series of new poses of the robot are obtained. Secondly, the fusion optimized pose is used to correct the distance and azimuth angle of the laser points obtained by LiDAR, and a Gauss&ndash;Newton iterative matching process is used to match the corresponding laser points to construct an indoor map. Finally, a pose fusion experiment is designed, and the EuRoc data and the measured data are used to verify the effectiveness of this method. The experimental results confirm that this method provides higher pose estimation accuracy compared with the robust visual inertial odometry (ROVIO) and visual-inertial ORB-SLAM (VI ORB-SLAM) algorithms. Compared with the Cartographer algorithm, this method provides higher two-dimensional map modeling accuracy and modeling performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Large sheets of high-density polyethene geomembrane are used as floating covers on some of the wastewater treatment lagoons at the Melbourne Water Corporation&rsquo;s Western Treatment Plant. These covers provide an airtight seal for the anaerobic digestion of sewage and allow for harvesting the methane-rich biogas, which is then used to generate electricity. There is a potential for scum to develop under the covers during the anaerobic digestion of the raw sewage by microorganisms. Due to the nature of the operating environment of the lagoons and the vast size (450 m &times; 170 m) of these covers, a safe non-contact method to monitor the development and movement of the scum is preferred. This paper explores the potential of using a new thermographic approach to identify and monitor the scum under the covers. The approach exploits naturally occurring variations in solar intensity as a trigger for generating a transient thermal response that is then fitted to an exponential decay law to determine a cooling constant. This approach is investigated experimentally using a laboratory-scale test rig. A finite element (FE) model is constructed and shown to reliably predict the experimentally observed thermal transients and cooling constants. This FE model is then set up to simulate progressive scum accumulation with time, using a specified scumberg geometry and a stepwise change in thermal properties. The results indicate a detectable change in the cooling constant at different locations on the cover, thereby providing a quantitative basis for characterising the scum accumulation beneath the cover. The practical application and limitations of these results are briefly discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Terraces, which are typical artificial landforms found around world, are of great importance for agricultural production and soil and water conservation. However, due to the lack of maintenance, terrace damages often occur and affect the local flow process, which will influence soil erosion. Automatic high-accuracy mapping of terrace damages is the basis of monitoring and related studies. Researchers have achieved artificial terrace damage mapping mainly via manual field investigation, but an automatic method is still lacking. In this study, given the success of high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry and object-based image analysis (OBIA) for image processing tasks, an integrated framework based on OBIA and UAV photogrammetry is proposed for terrace damage mapping. The Pujiawa terrace in the Loess Plateau of China was selected as the study area. Firstly, the segmentation process was optimised by considering the spectral features and the terrains and corresponding textures obtained from high-resolution images and digital surface models. The feature selection was implemented via correlation analysis, and the optimised segmentation parameter was achieved using the estimation of scale parameter algorithm. Then, a supervised k-nearest neighbourhood classifier was used to identify the terrace damages in the segmented objects, and additional geometric features at the object level were considered for classification. The comparison with the ground truth, as delineated by the image and field survey, showed that proposed classification can be adequately performed. The F-measures of extraction on three terrace damages were 92.07% (terrace sinkhole), 81.95% (ridge sinkhole), and 85.17% (collapse), and the Kappa coefficient was 85.34%. Finally, the potential application and spatial distribution of the terrace damages in this study were determined. We believe that this work can provide a credible framework for mapping terrace damages in the Loess Plateau of China.},

ABSTRACT = {Forest disturbances&mdash;driven by pests, pathogens, and discrete events&mdash;have led to billions of dollars in lost ecosystem services and management costs. To understand the patterns and severity of these stressors across complex landscapes, there must be an increase in reliable data at scales compatible with management actions. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS or UAV) offer a capable platform for collecting local scale (e.g., individual tree) forestry data. In this study, we evaluate the capability of UAS multispectral imagery and freely available National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery for differentiating coniferous healthy, coniferous stressed, deciduous healthy, deciduous stressed, and degraded individual trees throughout a complex, mixed-species forests. These methods are first compared to assessments of crown vigor in the field, to evaluate the potential in supplementing this resource intensive practice. This investigation uses the random forest and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithms to classify the imagery into the five forest health classes. Using the random forest classifier, the UAS imagery correctly classified five forest Health classes with an overall accuracy of 65.43%. Using similar methods, the high-resolution airborne NAIP imagery achieved an overall accuracy of 50.50% for the five health classes, a reduction of 14.93%. When these classes were generalized to healthy, stressed, and degraded trees, the accuracy improved to 71.19%, using UAS imagery, and 70.62%, using airborne imagery. Further analysis into the precise calibration of UAS multispectral imagery, a refinement of image segmentation methods, and the fusion of these data with more widely distributed remotely sensed imagery would further enhance the potential of these methods to more effectively and efficiently collect forest health information from the UAS instead of using field methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep Learning (DL) has been recently introduced into the hyperspectral and multispectral image classification landscape. Despite the success of DL in the remote sensing field, DL models are computationally intensive due to the large number of parameters they need to learn. The high density of information present in remote sensing imagery with high spectral resolution can make the application of DL models to large scenes challenging. Methods such as patch-based classification require large amounts of data to be processed during the training and prediction stages, which translates into long processing times and high energy consumption. One of the solutions to decrease the computational cost of these models is to perform segment-based classification. Segment-based classification schemes can significantly decrease training and prediction times, and also offer advantages over simply reducing the size of the training datasets by randomly sampling training data. The lack of a large enough number of samples can, however, pose an additional challenge, causing these models to not generalize properly. Data augmentation methods are used to generate new synthetic samples based on existing data to increase the classification performance. In this work, we propose a new data augmentation scheme using data imputation and matrix completion methods for segment-based classification. The proposal has been validated using two high-resolution multispectral datasets from the literature. The results obtained show that the proposed approach successfully increases the classification performance across all the scenes tested and that data imputation methods applied to multispectral imagery are a valid means to perform data augmentation. A comparison of classification accuracy between different imputation methods applied to the proposed scheme was also carried out.},

ABSTRACT = {Construction sites are increasingly complex, and their layout have an impact on productivity, safety, and efficiency of construction operations. Dynamic site layout planning (DSLP) considers the adjustment of construction facilities on-site, on an evolving basis, allowing the relocation of temporary facilities according to the stages of the project. The main objective of this study is to develop a framework for integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their capacity for effective photogrammetry with site layout planning optimisation and Building Information Modelling (BIM) for automating site layout planning in large construction projects. The mathematical model proposed is based on a mixed integer programming (MIP) model, which was employed to validate the framework on a realistic case study provided by an industry partner. Allocation constraints were formulated to ensure the placement of the facilities in feasible regions. Using information from the UAV, several parameters could be considered, including proximity to access ways, distances between the facilities, and suitability of locations. Based on the proposed framework, a layout was developed for each stage of the project, adapting the location of temporary facilities according to current progress on-site. As a result, the use of space was optimised, and internal transport costs were progressively reduced.},

ABSTRACT = {Seagrass meadows are one of the blue carbon ecosystems that continue to decline worldwide. Frequent mapping is essential to monitor seagrass meadows for understanding change processes including seasonal variations and influences of meteorological and oceanic events such as typhoons and cyclones. Such mapping approaches may also enhance seagrass blue carbon strategy and management practices. Although unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial photography has been widely conducted for this purpose, there have been challenges in mapping accuracy, efficiency, and applicability to subtidal water meadows. In this study, a novel method was developed for mapping subtidal and intertidal seagrass meadows to overcome such challenges. Ground truth seagrass orthophotos in four seasons were created from the Futtsu tidal flat of Tokyo Bay, Japan, using vertical and oblique UAV photography. The feature pyramid network (FPN) was first applied for automated seagrass classification by adjusting the spatial resolution and normalization parameters and by considering the combinations of seasonal input data sets. The FPN classification results ensured high performance with the validation metrics of 0.957 overall accuracy (OA), 0.895 precision, 0.942 recall, 0.918 F1-score, and 0.848 IoU, which outperformed the conventional U-Net results. The FPN classification results highlighted seasonal variations in seagrass meadows, exhibiting an extension from winter to summer and demonstrating a decline from summer to autumn. Recovery of the meadows was also detected after the occurrence of Typhoon No. 19 in October 2019, a phenomenon which mainly happened before summer 2020.},

ABSTRACT = {The wide use of cooperative missions using multiple unmanned platforms has made relative distance information an essential factor for cooperative positioning and formation control. Reducing the range error effectively in real time has become the main technical challenge. We present a new method to deal with ranging errors based on the distance increment (DI). The DI calculated by dead reckoning is used to smooth the DI obtained by the cooperative positioning, and the smoothed DI is then used to detect and estimate the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) error as well as to smooth the observed values containing random noise in the filtering process. Simulation and experimental results show that the relative accuracy of NLOS estimation is 8.17%, with the maximum random error reduced by 40.27%. The algorithm weakens the influence of NLOS and random errors on the measurement distance, thus improving the relative distance precision and enhancing the stability and reliability of cooperative positioning.},

ABSTRACT = {Access to broadband communications in different parts of the world has become a priority for some governments and regulatory authorities around the world in recent years. Building new digital roads and pursuing a connected society includes looking for easier access to the internet. In general, not all areas where people congregate are fully covered, especially in rural zones, thus restricting access to data communications and inducing inequality. In the present review article, we have comprehensively surveyed the use of three platforms to deliver broadband services to such remote and low-income areas, and they are proposed as follows: unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), altitude platforms (AP), and low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. These novel strategies support the connected and accessible world hypothesis. Hence, UAVs are considered a noteworthy solution since their efficient maneuverability can solve rural coverage issues or not-spots.},

ABSTRACT = {Detection and assessment of cracks in civil engineering structures such as roads, bridges, dams and pipelines are crucial tasks for maintaining the safety and cost-effectiveness of those concrete structures. With the recent advances in machine learning, the development of ANN- and CNN-based algorithms has become a popular approach for the automated detection and identification of concrete cracks. However, most of the proposed models are trained on images taken in ideal conditions and are only capable of achieving high accuracy when applied to the concrete images devoid of irregular illumination conditions, shadows, shading, blemishes, etc. An overview of challenges related to the automatic detection of concrete cracks in the presence of shadows is presented in this paper. In particular, difficulties associated with the application of deep learning-based methods for the classification of concrete images with shadows are demonstrated. Moreover, the limitations of the shadow removal techniques for the improvement of the crack detection accuracy are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban trees and forests provide multiple ecosystem services (ES), including temperature regulation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity. Interest in ES has increased amongst policymakers, scientists, and citizens given the extent and growth of urbanized areas globally. However, the methods and techniques used to properly assess biodiversity and ES provided by vegetation in urban environments, at large scales, are insufficient. Individual tree identification and characterization are some of the most critical issues used to evaluate urban biodiversity and ES, given the complex spatial distribution of vegetation in urban areas and the scarcity or complete lack of systematized urban tree inventories at large scales, e.g., at the regional or national levels. This often limits our knowledge on their contributions toward shaping biodiversity and ES in urban areas worldwide. This paper provides an analysis of the state-of-the-art studies and was carried out based on a systematic review of 48 scientific papers published during the last five years (2016&ndash;2020), related to urban tree and greenery characterization, remote sensing techniques for tree identification, processing methods, and data analysis to classify and segment trees. In particular, we focused on urban tree and forest characterization using remotely sensed data and identified frontiers in scientific knowledge that may be expanded with new developments in the near future. We found advantages and limitations associated with both data sources and processing methods, from which we drew recommendations for further development of tree inventory and characterization in urban forestry science. Finally, a critical discussion on the current state of the methods, as well as on the challenges and directions for future research, is presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Catechin is a major reactive substance involved in black tea fermentation. It has a determinant effect on the final quality and taste of made teas. In this study, we applied hyperspectral technology with the chemometrics method and used different pretreatment and variable filtering algorithms to reduce noise interference. After reduction of the spectral data dimensions by principal component analysis (PCA), an optimal prediction model for catechin content was constructed, followed by visual analysis of catechin content when fermenting leaves for different periods of time. The results showed that zero mean normalization (Z-score), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and standard normal variate (SNV) can effectively improve model accuracy; while the shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), the variable combination population analysis genetic algorithm (VCPA-GA), and variable combination population analysis iteratively retaining informative variables (VCPA-IRIV) can significantly reduce spectral data and enhance the calculation speed of the model. We found that nonlinear models performed better than linear ones. The prediction accuracy for the total amount of catechins and for epicatechin gallate (ECG) of the extreme learning machine (ELM), based on optimal variables, reached 0.989 and 0.994, respectively, and the prediction accuracy for EGC, C, EC, and EGCG of the content support vector regression (SVR) models reached 0.972, 0.993, 0.990, and 0.994, respectively. The optimal model offers accurate prediction, and visual analysis can determine the distribution of the catechin content when fermenting leaves for different fermentation periods. The findings provide significant reference material for intelligent digital assessment of black tea during processing.},

ABSTRACT = {Northern leaf blight (NLB) is a serious disease in maize which leads to significant yield losses. Automatic and accurate methods of quantifying disease are crucial for disease identification and quantitative assessment of severity. Leaf images collected with natural backgrounds pose a great challenge to the segmentation of disease lesions. To address these problems, we propose an image segmentation method based on YOLACT++ with an attention module for segmenting disease lesions of maize leaves in natural conditions in order to improve the accuracy and real-time ability of lesion segmentation. The attention module is equipped on the output of the ResNet-101 backbone and the output of the FPN. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves segmentation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art disease lesion-segmentation methods. The proposed method achieved 98.71% maize leaf lesion segmentation precision, a comprehensive evaluation index of 98.36%, and a mean Intersection over Union of 84.91%; the average processing time of a single image was about 31.5 ms. The results show that the proposed method allows for the automatic and accurate quantitative assessment of crop disease severity in natural conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {As the number of civil aerial vehicles increase explosively, spectrum scarcity and security become an increasingly challenge in both the airspace and terrestrial space. To address this difficulty, this paper presents an unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted (UAV-assisted) spectrum mapping system and a spectrum data reconstruction algorithm driven by spectrum data and channel model are proposed. The reconstruction algorithm, which includes a model-driven spectrum data inference method and a spectrum data completion method with uniformity decision mechanism, can reconstruct limited and incomplete spectrum data to a three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map. As a result, spectrum scarcity and security can be achieved. Spectrum mapping is a symmetry-based digital twin technology. By employing an uniformity decision mechanism, the proposed completion method can effectively interpolate spatial data even when the collected data are unevenly distributed. The effectiveness of the proposed mapping scheme is evaluated by comparing its results with the ray-tracing simulated data of the campus scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed reconstruction algorithm outperforms the classical inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method and the tensor completion method by about 12.5% and 92.3%, respectively, in terms of reconstruction accuracy when the collected spectrum data are regularly missing, unevenly distributed and limited.},

The proposed system is applied to the A* path planning algorithm, and the presented results demonstrate up to 94% accuracy in offloading decisions.},

ABSTRACT = {Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in remote sensing image analysis (RSIA). Fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the task of semantic segmentation of natural scene images. However, due to distinctive differences between natural scene images and remotely-sensed (RS) images, FCN-based semantic segmentation methods from the field of computer vision cannot achieve promising performances on RS images without modifications. In previous work, we proposed an RS image semantic segmentation framework SDFCNv1, combined with a majority voting postprocessing method. Nevertheless, it still has some drawbacks, such as small receptive field and large number of parameters. In this paper, we propose an improved semantic segmentation framework SDFCNv2 based on SDFCNv1, to conduct optimal semantic segmentation on RS images. We first construct a novel FCN model with hybrid basic convolutional (HBC) blocks and spatial-channel-fusion squeeze-and-excitation (SCFSE) modules, which occupies a larger receptive field and fewer network model parameters. We also put forward a data augmentation method based on spectral-specific stochastic-gamma-transform-based (SSSGT-based) during the model training process to improve generalizability of our model. Besides, we design a mask-weighted voting decision fusion postprocessing algorithm for image segmentation on overlarge RS images. We conducted several comparative experiments on two public datasets and a real surveying and mapping dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that compared with the SDFCNv1 framework, our SDFCNv2 framework can increase the mIoU metric by up to 5.22% while only using about half of parameters.},

ABSTRACT = {Timely observations of nearshore water depths are important for a variety of coastal research and management topics, yet this information is expensive to collect using in situ survey methods. Remote methods to estimate bathymetry from imagery include using either ratios of multi-spectral reflectance bands or inversions from wave processes. Multi-spectral methods work best in waters with low turbidity, and wave-speed-based methods work best when wave breaking is minimal. In this work, we build on the wave-based inversion approaches, by exploring the use of a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) to infer nearshore bathymetry from imagery of the sea surface and local wave statistics. We apply transfer learning to adapt a CNN originally trained on synthetic imagery generated from a Boussinesq numerical wave model to utilize tower-based imagery collected in Duck, North Carolina, at the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center&rsquo;s Field Research Facility. We train the model on sea-surface imagery, wave conditions, and associated surveyed bathymetry using three years of observations, including times with significant wave breaking in the surf zone. This is the first time, to the authors&rsquo; knowledge, an FCNN has been successfully applied to infer bathymetry from surf-zone sea-surface imagery. Model results from a separate one-year test period generally show good agreement with survey-derived bathymetry (0.37 m root-mean-squared error, with a max depth of 6.7 m) under diverse wave conditions with wave heights up to 3.5 m. Bathymetry results quantify nearshore bathymetric evolution including bar migration and transitions between single- and double-barred morphologies. We observe that bathymetry estimates are most accurate when time-averaged input images feature visible wave breaking and/or individual images display wave crests. An investigation of activation maps, which show neuron activity on a layer-by-layer basis, suggests that the model is responsive to visible coherent wave structures in the input images.},

ABSTRACT = {Wetland vegetation is an important component of wetland ecosystems and plays a crucial role in the ecological functions of wetland environments. Accurate distribution mapping and dynamic change monitoring of vegetation are essential for wetland conservation and restoration. The development of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides an efficient and economic platform for wetland vegetation classification. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of RGB imagery obtained from the DJI Mavic Pro for wetland vegetation classification at the species level, with a specific application to Honghu, which is listed as a wetland of international importance. A total of ten object-based image analysis (OBIA) scenarios were designed to assess the contribution of five machine learning algorithms to the classification accuracy, including Bayes, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF), multi-feature combinations and feature selection implemented by the recursive feature elimination algorithm (RFE). The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were compared to determine the optimal classification method. The main results are as follows: (1) RF showed the best performance among the five machine learning algorithms, with an overall accuracy of 89.76% and kappa coefficient of 0.88 when using 53 features (including spectral features (RGB bands), height information, vegetation indices, texture features, and geometric features) for wetland vegetation classification. (2) The RF model constructed by only spectral features showed poor classification results, with an overall accuracy of 73.66% and kappa coefficient of 0.70. By adding height information, VIs, texture features, and geometric features to construct the RF model layer by layer, the overall accuracy was improved by 8.78%, 3.41%, 2.93%, and 0.98%, respectively, demonstrating the importance of multi-feature combinations. (3) The contribution of different types of features to the RF model was not equal, and the height information was the most important for wetland vegetation classification, followed by the vegetation indices. (4) The RFE algorithm effectively reduced the number of original features from 53 to 36, generating an optimal feature subset for wetland vegetation classification. The RF based on the feature selection result of RFE (RF-RFE) had the best performance in ten scenarios, and provided an overall accuracy of 90.73%, which was 0.97% higher than the RF without feature selection. The results illustrate that the combination of UAV-based RGB imagery and the OBIA approach provides a straightforward, yet powerful, approach for high-precision wetland vegetation classification at the species level, in spite of limited spectral information. Compared with satellite data or UAVs equipped with other types of sensors, UAVs with RGB cameras are more cost efficient and convenient for wetland vegetation monitoring and mapping.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents the results of a landslide susceptibility analysis applied to the Vrancea-Buz&#259;u seismogenic region in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania. The target area is affected by a large diversity of landslide processes. Slopes are made-up of various types of rocks, climatic conditions can be classified as wet, and the area is a seismically active one. All this contributes to the observed high landslide hazard. The paper analyses the spatial component of the landslide hazard affecting the target area, the regional landslide susceptibility. First, an existing landslide inventory was completed to cover a wider area for the landslide susceptibility analysis. Second, two types of methods are applied, a purely statistical technique, based on correlations between landslide occurrence and local conditions, as well as the simplified spatial process-based Newmark Displacement analysis. Landslide susceptibility maps have been produced by applying both methods, the second one also allowing us to simulate different scenarios, based on various soil saturation rates and seismic inputs. Furthermore, landslide susceptibility was computed both for the landslide source and runout zones&mdash;the first providing information about areas where landslides are preferentially triggered and the second indicating where landslides preferentially move along the slope and accumulate. The analysis showed that any of the different methods applied produces reliable maps of landslide susceptibility. However, uncertainties were also outlined as validation is insufficient, especially in the northern area, where only a few landslides could be mapped due to the intense vegetation cover.},

ABSTRACT = {The brain&ndash;computer interface (BCI) is a mechanism for extracting information from the brain, with this information used for various applications. This study proposes a method to control an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flying through a BCI system using the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) approach. The UAV&rsquo;s screen emits three frequencies for visual stimulation: 15, 23, and 31 Hz for the UAV&rsquo;s left-turn, forward-flight, and right-turn functions. Due to the requirement of immediate response to the UAV flight, this paper proposes a method to improve the accuracy rate and reduce the time required to correct instruction errors in the resolution of brainwave signals received by UAVs. This study tested ten subjects and verified that the proposed method has a 10% improvement inaccuracy. While the traditional method can take 8 s to correct an error, the proposed method requires only 1 s, making it more suitable for practical applications in UAVs. Furthermore, such a BCI application for UAV systems can achieve the same experience of using the remote control for physically challenged patients.},

ABSTRACT = {Hyperspectral Images (HSIs) have been utilized in many fields which contain spatial and spectral features of objects simultaneously. Hyperspectral image matching is a fundamental and critical problem in a wide range of HSI applications. Feature descriptors for grayscale image matching are well studied, but few descriptors are elaborately designed for HSI matching. HSI descriptors, which should have made good use of the spectral feature, are essential in HSI matching tasks. Therefore, this paper presents a descriptor for HSI matching, called HOSG-SIFT, which ensembles spectral features with spatial features of objects. First, we obtain the grayscale image by dimensional reduction from HSI and apply it to extract keypoints and descriptors of spatial features. Second, the descriptors of spectral features are designed based on the histogram of the spectral gradient (HOSG), which effectively preserves the physical significance of the spectral profile. Third, we concatenate the spatial descriptors and spectral descriptors with the same weights into a new descriptor and apply it for HSI matching. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HOSG-SIFT performs superior against traditional feature descriptors.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning (DL) has shown promising performances in various remote sensing applications as a powerful tool. To explore the great potential of DL in improving the accuracy of individual tree species (ITS) classification, four convolutional neural network models (ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-40) were employed to classify four tree species using the combined high-resolution satellite imagery and airborne LiDAR data. A total of 1503 samples of four tree species, including maple, pine, locust, and spruce, were used in the experiments. When both WorldView-2 and airborne LiDAR data were used, the overall accuracies (OA) obtained by ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-40 were 90.9%, 89.1%, 89.1%, and 86.9%, respectively. The OA of ResNet-18 was increased by 4.0% and 1.8% compared with random forest (86.7%) and support vector machine (89.1%), respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the size of input images impacted on the classification accuracy of ResNet-18. It is suggested that the input size of ResNet models can be determined according to the maximum size of all tree crown sample images. The use of LiDAR intensity image was helpful in improving the accuracies of ITS classification and atmospheric correction is unnecessary when both pansharpened WorldView-2 images and airborne LiDAR data were used.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates maximum power extraction from a wind-energy-conversion system (WECS) with a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) operating in standalone mode. This was achieved by designing a robust adaptive nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control (ANFTSMC) for the WECS-PMSG. The proposed scheme guaranteed optimal power generation and suppressed the system uncertainties with a rapid convergence rate. Moreover, it is independent of the upper bounds of the system uncertainties as an online adjustment algorithm was utilized to estimate and compensate them. Finally, four case studies were carried out, which manifested the remarkable performance of ANFTSMC in comparison to previous methods reported in the literature.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the past few decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of studies about the use of remote sensing techniques for the monitoring of inland waters. Since these aquatic environments have multiple uses for mankind, monitoring them is essential for the environment, society, and the economy. The use of Earth Observations data for the monitoring of inland waters is important for water quantity and quality management. Because of this, the goal of the present study is to systematically analyze and visualize the evolution of publications in this field. This study will not focus on algorithm comparisons or descriptions; instead, it will use a co-citation analysis to map the relationship among publications. Using the Web of Science database, publications related to the terms, &ldquo;remote sensing&rdquo; + &ldquo;inland waters&rdquo;, were analyzed using the entire database. The bibliometric analysis showed how research topics evolved from measuring optical properties and understanding their signal to the development of remote sensing algorithms and their applications to satellite imagery. This study provides the historical development of the scientific publications in this field and points out what could be the direction for future research.},

ABSTRACT = {Supported by the advances in rocket technology, companies like SpaceX and Amazon competitively have entered the satellite Internet business. These companies said that they could provide Internet service sufficiently to users using their communication resources. However, the Internet service might not be provided in densely populated areas, as the satellites coverage is broad but its resource capacity is limited. To offload the traffic of the densely populated area, we present an adaptable aerial access network (AAN), composed of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and federated reinforcement learning (FRL)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using the proposed system, UAVs could operate with relatively low computation resources than centralized coverage management systems. Furthermore, by utilizing FRL, the system could continuously learn from various environments and perform better with the longer operation times. Based on our proposed design, we implemented FRL, constructed the UAV-aided AAN simulator, and evaluated the proposed system. Base on the evaluation result, we validated that the FRL enabled UAV-aided AAN could operate efficiently in densely populated areas where the satellites cannot provide sufficient Internet services, which improves network performances. In the evaluations, our proposed AAN system provided about 3.25 times more communication resources and had 5.1% lower latency than the satellite-only AAN.},

ABSTRACT = {It is of great significance to find tomato gray mold in time and take corresponding control measures to ensure the production of tomato crops. This study proposed a rapid detection method for spores of Botrytis cinerea in green-house based on microfluidic chip enrichment and lens-free diffraction image processing. Microfluidic chip with a regular triangular inner rib structure was designed to achieve the enrichment of Botrytis cinerea spores. In order to obtain the diffraction image of the diseased spores, a lens-less diffraction imaging system was built. Furthermore, the collected spore diffraction images were processed and counted. The simulation results showed that the collection efficiency of 16 &mu;m particles was 79%, 100%, and 89% at the inlet flow rate of 12, 14 and 16 mL/min, respectively. The experimental verification results were observed under a microscope. The results showed that when the flow rate of the microfluidic chip was 12, 14 and 16 mL/min, the collection efficiency of Botrytis cinerea spores was 70.65%, 87.52% and 77.96%, respectively. The Botrytis cinerea spores collected in the experiment were placed under a microscope for manual counting and compared with the automatic counting results based on diffraction image processing. A total of 10 sets of experiments were carried out, with an error range of the experiment was 5.13~8.57%, and the average error of the experiment was 6.42%. The Bland&ndash;Altman method was used to analyze two methods based on diffraction image processing and manual counting under a microscope. All points are within the 95% consistency interval. Therefore, this study can provide a basis for the research on the real-time monitoring technology of tomato gray mold spores in the greenhouse.},

ABSTRACT = {Most existing Siamese trackers mainly use a pre-trained convolutional neural network to extract target features. However, due to the weak discrimination of the target and background information of pre-trained depth features, the performance of the Siamese tracker can be significantly degraded when facing similar targets or changes in target appearance. This paper proposes a multi-channel-aware and adaptive hierarchical deep features module to enhance the discriminative ability of the tracker. Firstly, through the multi-channel-aware deep features module, the importance values of feature channels are obtained from both the target details and overall information, to identify more important feature channels. Secondly, by introducing the adaptive hierarchical deep features module, the importance of each feature layer can be determined according to the response value of each frame, so that the hierarchical features can be integrated to represent the target, which can better adapt to changes in the appearance of the target. Finally, the proposed two modules are integrated into the Siamese framework for target tracking. The Siamese network used in this paper is a two-input branch symmetric neural network with two input branches, and they share the same weights, which are widely used in the field of target tracking. Experiments on some Benchmarks show that the proposed Siamese tracker has several points of improvement compared to the baseline tracker.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the complexity and danger of Mars&rsquo;s environment, traditional Mars unmanned ground vehicles cannot efficiently perform Mars exploration missions. To solve this problem, the DeepLabV3+/Efficientnet hybrid network is proposed and applied to the scene area judgment for the Mars unmanned vehicle system. Firstly, DeepLabV3+ is used to extract the feature information of the Mars image due to its high accuracy. Then, the feature information is used as the input for Efficientnet, and the categories of scene areas are obtained, including safe area, report area, and dangerous area. Finally, according to three categories, the Mars unmanned vehicle system performs three operations: pass, report, and send. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the DeepLabV3+/Efficientnet hybrid network in the scene area judgment. Compared with the Efficientnet network, the accuracy of the DeepLabV3+/Efficientnet hybrid network is improved by approximately 18% and reaches 99.84%, which ensures the safety of the exploration mission for the Mars unmanned vehicle system.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, jellyfish outbreaks have frequently occurred in offshore areas worldwide, posing a significant threat to the marine fishery, tourism, coastal industry, and personal safety. Effective monitoring of jellyfish is a vital method to solve the above problems. However, the optical detection method for jellyfish is still in the primary stage. Therefore, this paper studies a jellyfish detection method based on convolution neural network theory and digital image processing technology. This paper studies the underwater image preprocessing algorithm because the quality of underwater images directly affects the detection results. The results show that the image quality is better after applying the three algorithms namely prior defogging, adaptive histogram equalization, and multi-scale retinal enhancement, which is more conducive to detection. We establish a data set containing seven species of jellyfishes and fish. A total of 2141 images are included in the data set. The YOLOv3 algorithm is used to detect jellyfish, and its feature extraction network Darknet53 is optimized to ensure it is conducted in real-time. In addition, we introduce label smoothing and cosine annealing learning rate methods during the training process. The experimental results show that the improved algorithms improve the detection accuracy of jellyfish on the premise of ensuring the detection speed. This paper lays a foundation for the construction of an underwater jellyfish optical imaging real-time monitoring system.},

ABSTRACT = {Extracting road information from high-resolution remote sensing images (HRI) can provide crucial geographic information for many applications. With the improvement of remote sensing image resolution, the image data contain more abundant feature information. However, this phenomenon also enhances the spatial heterogeneity between different types of roads, making it difficult to accurately discern the road and non-road regions using only spectral characteristics. To remedy the above issues, a novel residual attention and local context-aware network (RALC-Net) is proposed for extracting a complete and continuous road network from HRI. RALC-Net utilizes a dual-encoder structure to improve the feature extraction capability of the network, whose two different branches take different feature information as input data. Specifically, we construct the residual attention module using the residual connection that can integrate spatial context information and the attention mechanism, highlighting local semantics to extract local feature information of roads. The residual attention module combines the characteristics of both the residual connection and the attention mechanism to retain complete road edge information, highlight essential semantics, and enhance the generalization capability of the network model. In addition, the multi-scale dilated convolution module is used to extract multi-scale spatial receptive fields to improve the model&rsquo;s performance further. We perform experiments to verify the performance of each component of RALC-Net through the ablation study. By combining low-level features with high-level semantics, we extract road information and make comparisons with other state-of-the-art models. The experimental results show that the proposed RALC-Net has excellent feature representation ability and robust generalizability, and can extract complete road information from a complex environment.},

ABSTRACT = {The wealth of data and the enhanced computation capabilities of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enable the optimized motion control of vehicles passing through an intersection without traffic lights. However, more intersections and demands for privacy protection pose new challenges to motion control optimization. Federated Learning (FL) can protect privacy via model interaction in IoV, but traditional FL methods hardly deal with the transportation issue. To address the aforementioned issue, this study proposes a Traffic-Aware Federated Imitation learning framework for Motion Control (TAFI-MC), consisting of Vehicle Interactors (VIs), Edge Trainers (ETs), and a Cloud Aggregator (CA). An Imitation Learning (IL) algorithm is integrated into TAFI-MC to improve motion control. Furthermore, a loss-aware experience selection strategy is explored to reduce communication overhead between ETs and VIs. The experimental results show that the proposed TAFI-MC outperforms imitated rules in the respect of collision avoidance and driving comfort, and the experience selection strategy can reduce communication overheads while ensuring convergence.},

ABSTRACT = {Object detection on aerial and satellite imagery is an important tool for image analysis in remote sensing and has many areas of application. As modern object detectors require accurate annotations for training, manual and labor-intensive labeling is necessary. In situations where GPS coordinates for the objects of interest are already available, there is potential to avoid the cumbersome annotation process. Unfortunately, GPS coordinates are often not well-aligned with georectified imagery. These spatial errors can be seen as noise regarding the object locations, which may critically harm the training of object detectors and, ultimately, limit their practical applicability. To overcome this issue, we propose a co-correction technique that allows us to robustly train a neural network with noisy object locations and to transform them toward the true locations. When applied as a preprocessing step on noisy annotations, our method greatly improves the performance of existing object detectors. Our method is applicable in scenarios where the images are only annotated with points roughly indicating object locations, instead of entire bounding boxes providing precise information on the object locations and extents. We test our method on three datasets and achieve a substantial improvement (e.g., 29.6% mAP on the COWC dataset) over existing methods for noise-robust object detection.},

ABSTRACT = {Situational awareness formation is one of the most critical elements in solving the problem of UAV behavior control. It aims to provide information support for UAV behavior control according to its objectives and tasks to be completed. We consider the UAV to be a type of controlled dynamic system. The article shows the place of UAVs in the hierarchy of dynamic systems. We introduce the concepts of UAV behavior and activity and formulate requirements for algorithms for controlling UAV behavior. We propose the concept of situational awareness as applied to the problem of behavior control of highly autonomous UAVs (HA-UAVs) and analyze the levels and types of this situational awareness. We show the specifics of situational awareness formation for UAVs and analyze its differences from situational awareness for manned aviation and remotely piloted UAVs. We propose the concept of situational awareness as applied to the problem of UAV behavior control and analyze the levels and types of this situational awareness. We highlight and discuss in more detail two crucial elements of situational awareness for HA-UAVs. The first of them is related to the analysis and prediction of the behavior of objects in the vicinity of the HA-UAV. The general considerations involved in solving this problem, including the problem of analyzing the group behavior of such objects, are discussed. As an illustrative example, the solution to the problem of tracking an aircraft maneuvering in the vicinity of a HA-UAV is given. The second element of situational awareness is related to the processing of visual information, which is one of the primary sources of situational awareness formation required for the operation of the HA-UAV control system. As an example here, we consider solving the problem of semantic segmentation of images processed when selecting a landing site for the HA-UAV in unfamiliar terrain. Both of these problems are solved using machine learning methods and tools. In the field of situational awareness for HA-UAVs, there are several problems that need to be solved. We formulate some of these problems and briefly describe them.},

ABSTRACT = {With possible new use cases and demanding requirements of future 5th generation (5G) and beyond cellular networks, the future of mobile communications sounds promising. However, the propagation medium has been considered a randomly acting agent between the transmitter and the receiver. With the advent of the digital age of wireless communications, the received signal quality is degrading due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding artifacts. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and assisted application areas. With the RIS, the network operators can control radio waves&rsquo; scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics by resolving the harmful properties of environmental wireless propagation. Further, the RIS can effectively control the wavefront, such as amplitude, phase, frequency, and even polarization, without requiring complex encoding, decoding, or radio wave processing techniques. Motivated by technological advances, the metasurfaces, reflectarrays, phase shift, and liquid crystals are potential candidates for implementing RIS. Thus, they can be considered the front runner for realizing the 5G and beyond network. Furthermore, the current research activities in the evolving field of wireless networks operated by RIS are reviewed and discussed thoroughly. Finally, to fully explore the potential of RISs in wireless networks, the fundamental research issues to be addressed have been discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Crop planting area and spatial distribution information have important practical significance for food security, global change, and sustainable agricultural development. How to efficiently and accurately identify crops in a timely manner by remote sensing in order to determine the crop planting area and its temporal&ndash;spatial dynamic change information is a core issue of monitoring crop growth and estimating regional crop yields. Based on hundreds of relevant documents from the past 25 years, in this paper, we summarize research progress in relation to farmland vegetation identification and classification by remote sensing. The classification and identification of farmland vegetation includes classification based on vegetation index, spectral bands, multi-source data fusion, artificial intelligence learning, and drone remote sensing. Representative studies of remote sensing methods are collated, the main content of each technology is summarized, and the advantages and disadvantages of each method are analyzed. Current problems related to crop remote sensing identification are then identified and future development directions are proposed.},

ABSTRACT = {Crop monitoring is crucial to understand crop production changes, agronomic practice decision-support, pests/diseases mitigation, and developing climate change adaptation strategies. Banana, an important staple food and cash crop in East Africa, is threatened by Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) disease. Yet, there is no up-to-date information about the spatial distribution and extent of banana lands, especially in Rwanda, where banana plays a key role in food security and livelihood. Therefore, delineation of banana-cultivated lands is important to prioritize resource allocation for optimal productivity. We mapped the spatial extent of smallholder banana farmlands by acquiring and processing high-resolution (25 cm/px) multispectral unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) imageries, across four villages in Rwanda. Georeferenced ground-truth data on different land cover classes were combined with reflectance data and vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, and EVI2) and compared using pixel-based supervised multi-classifiers (support vector models-SVM, classification and regression trees-CART, and random forest&ndash;RF), based on varying ground-truth data richness. Results show that RF consistently outperformed other classifiers regardless of data richness, with overall accuracy above 95%, producer&rsquo;s/user&rsquo;s accuracies above 92%, and kappa coefficient above 0.94. Estimated banana farmland areal coverage provides concrete baseline for extension-delivery efforts in terms of targeting banana farmers relative to their scale of production, and highlights opportunity to combine UAV-derived data with machine-learning methods for rapid landcover classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Shrublands are the main vegetation component in the Gobi region and contribute considerably to its ecosystem. Accurately classifying individual shrub vegetation species to understand their spatial distributions and to effectively monitor species diversity in the Gobi ecosystem is essential. High-resolution remote sensing data create vegetation type inventories over large areas. However, high spectral similarity between shrublands and surrounding areas remains a challenge. In this study, we provide a case study that integrates object-based image analysis (OBIA) and the random forest (RF) model to classify shrubland species automatically. The Gobi region on the southern slope of the Tian Shan Mountains in Northwest China was analyzed using readily available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) RGB imagery (1.5 cm spatial resolution). Different spectral and texture index images were derived from UAV RGB images as variables for species classification. Principal component analysis (PCA) extracted features from different types of variable sets (original bands, original bands + spectral indices, and original bands + spectral indices + texture indices). We tested the ability of several non-parametric decision tree models and different types of variable sets to classify shrub species. Moreover, we analyzed three main shrubland areas comprising different shrub species and compared the prediction accuracies of the optimal model in combination with different types of variable sets. We found that the RF model could generate higher accuracy compared with the other two models. The best results were obtained using a combination of the optimal variable set and the RF model with an 88.63% overall accuracy and 0.82 kappa coefficient. Integrating OBIA and RF in the species classification process provides a promising method for automatic mapping of individual shrub species in the Gobi region and can reduce the workload of individual shrub species classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have made significant impacts on our daily lives with the advancement of technologies and their applications. Tracking UAVs have become more important because they not only provide location-based services, but are also faced with serious security threats and vulnerabilities. UAVs are smaller in nature, move with high speed, and operate in a low-altitude environment, which makes it conceivable to track UAVs using fixed or mobile radars. Kalman Filter (KF)-based methodologies are widely used for extracting valuable trajectory information from samples composed of noisy information. As UAVs&rsquo; trajectories resemble uncertain behavior, the traditional KF-based methodologies have poor tracking accuracy. Recently, the Diffusion-Map-based KF (DMK) was introduced for modeling uncertainties in the environment without prior knowledge. However, the model has poor accuracy when operating in environments with higher noise. In order to achieve better tracking performance, this paper presents the Uncertainty and Error-Aware KF (UEAKF) for tracking UAVs. The UEAKF-based tracking method provides a good tradeoff among preceding estimate confidence and forthcoming measurement under dynamic environments; the resulting filter is robust and nonlinear in nature. The experimental results showed that the UEAKF-based UAV tracking model achieves much better Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance compared to the existing particle filter-based and DMK-based UAV tracking models.},

ABSTRACT = {Obtaining accurate forest coverage of tree species is an important basis for the rational use and protection of existing forest resources. However, most current studies have mainly focused on broad tree classification, such as coniferous vs. broadleaf tree species, and a refined tree classification with tree species information is urgently needed. Although airborne LiDAR data or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images can be used to acquire tree information even at the single tree level, this method will encounter great difficulties when applied to a large area. Therefore, this study takes the eastern regions of the Qilian Mountains as an example to explore the possibility of tree species classification with satellite-derived images. We used Sentinel-2 images to classify the study area&rsquo;s major vegetation types, particularly four tree species, i.e., Sabina przewalskii (S.P.), Picea crassifolia (P.C.), Betula spp. (Betula), and Populus spp. (Populus). In addition to the spectral features, we also considered terrain and texture features in this classification. The results show that adding texture features can significantly increase the separation between tree species. The final classification result of all categories achieved an accuracy of 86.49% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.83. For trees, the classification accuracy was 90.31%, and their producer&rsquo;s accuracy (PA) and user&rsquo;s (UA) were all higher than 84.97%. We found that altitude, slope, and aspect all affected the spatial distribution of these four tree species in our study area. This study confirms the potential of Sentinel-2 images for the fine classification of tree species. Moreover, this can help monitor ecosystem biological diversity and provide references for inventory estimation.},

ABSTRACT = {Modern cities require a tighter integration with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for bringing new services to the citizens. The Smart City is the revolutionary paradigm aiming at integrating the ICT with the citizen life; among several urban services, transports are one of the most important in modern cities, introducing several challenges to the Smart City paradigm. In order to satisfy the stringent requirements of new vehicular applications and services, Edge Computing (EC) is one of the most promising technologies when integrated into the Vehicular Networks (VNs). EC-enabled VNs can facilitate new latency-critical and data-intensive applications and services. However, ground-based EC platforms (i.e., Road Side Units&mdash;RSUs, 5G Base Stations&mdash;5G BS) can only serve a reduced number of Vehicular Users (VUs), due to short coverage ranges and resource shortage. In the recent past, several new aerial platforms with integrated EC facilities have been deployed for achieving global connectivity. Such air-based EC platforms can complement the ground-based EC facilities for creating a futuristic VN able to deploy several new applications and services. The goal of this work is to explore the possibility of creating a novel joint air-ground EC platform within a VN architecture for helping VUs with new intelligent applications and services. By exploiting most modern technologies, with particular attention towards network softwarization, vehicular edge computing, and machine learning, we propose here three possible layered air-ground EC-enabled VN scenarios. For each of the discussed scenarios, a list of the possible challenges is considered, as well possible solutions allowing to overcome all or some of the considered challenges. A proper comparison is also done, through the use of tables, where all the proposed scenarios, and the proposed solutions, are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Surface defect detection for printed circuit board (PCB) is indispensable for managing PCB production quality. However, automatic detection of PCB surface defects is still a challenging task because, even within the same category of surface defect, defects present great differences in morphology and pattern. Although many computer vision-based detectors have been established to handle these problems, current detectors struggle to achieve high detection accuracy, fast detection speed and low memory consumption simultaneously. To address those issues, we propose a cost-effective deep learning (DL)-based detector based on the cutting-edge YOLOv4 to detect PCB surface defect quickly and efficiently. The YOLOv4 is improved upon with respect to its backbone network and the activation function in its neck/prediction network. The improved YOLOv4 is evaluated with a customized dataset, collected from a PCB factory. The experimental results show that the improved detector achieved a high performance, scoring 98.64% on mean average precision (mAP) at 56.98 frames per second (FPS), outperforming the other compared SOTA detectors. Furthermore, the improved YOLOv4 reduced the parameter space of YOLOv4 from 63.96 M to 39.59 M and the number of multiply-accumulate operations (Madds) from 59.75 G to 26.15 G.},

ABSTRACT = {This study is concerned with developing a robust tracking control system that merges the optimal control theory with fractional-order-based control and the heuristic optimization algorithms into a single framework for the non-minimum phase pitch angle dynamics of Boeing 747 aircraft. The main control objective is to deal with the non-minimum phase nature of the aircraft pitching-up action, which is used to increase the altitude. The fractional-order integral controller (FIC) is implemented in the control loop as a pre-compensator to compensate for the non-minimum phase effect. Then, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is introduced as an optimal feedback controller to this augmented model ensuring the minimum phase to create an efficient, robust, and stable closed-loop control system. The control problem is formulated in a single objective optimization framework and solved for an optimal feedback gain together with pre-compensator parameters according to an error index and heuristic optimization constraints. The fractional-order integral pre-compensator is replaced by a fractional-order derivative pre-compensator in the proposed structure for comparison in terms of handling the non-minimum phase limitations, the magnitude of gain, phase-margin, and time-response specifications. To further verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the LQR-FIC controller is compared with the pole placement controller as a full-state feedback controller that has been successfully applied to control aircraft dynamics in terms of time and frequency domains. The performance, robustness, and internal stability characteristics of the proposed control strategy are validated by simulation studies carried out for flight conditions of fault-free, 50%, and 80% losses of actuator effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Studying the spatial representativeness of carbon flux measurement data for typical land cover types can provide important information for benchmarking Earth system models and validating multiple-scale remote sensing products. In our study, daily gross primary productivity (GPP) was firstly derived from eddy covariance observation systems and seasonal variations in field GPP were analyzed at nine flux tower sites for typical land cover types in the Heihe River Basin, China. Then, the real-time footprint distance and climate footprint distance of the field GPP were obtained by using a footprint source area model. Lastly, multiple-scale GPP products were validated at footprint scale, and the impacts (measurement height, surface roughness and turbulent state of the atmosphere) on the footprint distance of field GPP were analyzed. The results of this paper demonstrated that climate footprint distances ranged from about 500 m to 1500 m for different land cover types in the Heihe River Basin. The accuracy was higher when validating MODIS GPP products at footprint scale (R2 = 0.56, RMSE = 3.07 g C m&minus;2 d&minus;1) than at field scale (R2 = 0.51, RMSE = 3.34 g C m&minus;2 d&minus;1), and the same situation occurred in the validation of high-resolution downscaled GPP (R2 = 0.85, RMSE = 1.34 g C m&minus;2 d&minus;1 when validated at footprint scale; R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 1.47 g C m&minus;2 d&minus;1 when validated at field scale). The results of this study provide information about the footprints of field GPP for typical land cover types in arid and semi-arid areas in Northwestern China, and reveal that precision may be higher when validating multiple-scale remote sensing GPP products at the footprint scale than at the field scale.},
