abstract={Collision detection is one of the most challenging tasks for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This is especially true for small or micro-UAVs due to their limited computational power. In nature, flying insects with compact and simple visual systems demonstrate their remarkable ability to navigate and avoid collision in complex environments. A good example of this is provided by locusts. They can avoid collisions in a dense swarm through the activity of a motion-based visual neuron called the Lobula giant movement detector (LGMD). The defining feature of the LGMD neuron is its preference for looming. As a flying insect's visual neuron, LGMD is considered to be an ideal basis for building UAV's collision detecting system. However, existing LGMD models cannot distinguish looming clearly from other visual cues, such as complex background movements caused by UAV agile flights. To address this issue, we proposed a new model implementing distributed spatial-temporal synaptic interactions, which is inspired by recent findings in locusts' synaptic morphology. We first introduced the locally distributed excitation to enhance the excitation caused by visual motion with preferred velocities. Then, radially extending temporal latency for inhibition is incorporated to compete with the distributed excitation and selectively suppress the nonpreferred visual motions. This spatial-temporal competition between excitation and inhibition in our model is, therefore, tuned to preferred image angular velocity representing looming rather than background movements with these distributed synaptic interactions. Systematic experiments have been conducted to verify the performance of the proposed model for UAV agile flights. The results have demonstrated that this new model enhances the looming selectivity in complex flying scenes considerably and has the potential to be implemented on embedded collision detection systems for small or micro-UAVs.},

abstract={Delineation approaches provide significant benefits to various domains, including agriculture, environmental and natural disasters monitoring. Most of the work in the literature utilize traditional segmentation methods that require a large amount of computational and storage resources. Deep learning has transformed computer vision and dramatically improved machine translation, though it requires massive dataset for training and significant resources for inference. More importantly, energy-efficient embedded vision hardware delivering real-time and robust performance is crucial in the aforementioned application. In this work, we propose a U-Net based tree delineation method, which is effectively trained using multi-spectral imagery but can then delineate single-spectrum images. The deep architecture that also performs localization, i.e., a class label corresponds to each pixel, has been successfully used to allow training with a small set of segmented images. The ground truth data were generated using traditional image denoising and segmentation approaches. To be able to execute the proposed DNN efficiently in embedded platforms designed for deep learning approaches, we employ traditional model compression and acceleration methods. Extensive evaluation studies using data collected from UAV s equipped with multi-spectral cameras demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in terms of delineation accuracy and execution efficiency.},

abstract={An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is expected to be one of the powerful IoT tools in a search and rescue (SAR) operation. Notably, an aerial video would be most promising. However, in a SAR operation, a searching task via an aerial video compels laborious tasks such as high concentration to practitioners. In this paper, to reduce such a laborious task, we propose a method to provide supportive information, i.e., the number of persons, the time and thumbnails, for finding victims via an aerial video with an object detection algorithm. Also, to use it in a SAR operation, we need to meet the requirements for a dataset and lightweight process. Through the evaluation, we showed that we could get supportive information reasonably and displayed them on a GUI.},

abstract={This study presents a novel approach in detecting and tracking of fish in pisciculture. Pisciculture in general involves challenging tasks of counting and monitoring fish in natural or nature like, man-made habitats such as inland fisheries for breeding, feeding and sorting purposes. These are presently achieved using conventional methods that are inefficient when implemented in large-scale commercial productions. To overcome such difficulties and improve the efficiency of the processes, images of fish and fish seeds are captured in natural murky water habitats through a vision sensor on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In this research paper, a deep instance segmentation algorithm called Mask R-CNN along with GOTURN tracking algorithm is employed for real time fish detection and tracking. A comparison study is also carried out (i) fish detection on high resolution images (ii) fish detection on high resolution image multi-region parallel processing (iii) fish detection on high resolution image multi-region parallel processing with tracking. The results are found to be accurate with image multi-region parallel processing along with tracking, with an F1 score of 0.91 at 16 frames per seconds on in-land fishes environment.},

abstract={In this study, we have highlighted the main challenges of real-time fault diagnosis on small scale fixed-wing UAVs. The feasibility of real-time fault prediction has been shown in real flight conditions experiencing noisy measurements, communication limitations, and wrapped wing structure that breaks the geometric symmetry. A total of eleven flight logs have been recorded and shared publicly for future potential use by other researchers on fault and anomaly detection. Our proposed method uses a data driven algorithm, SVM, in order to classify the behavior of the vehicle in nominal flight phase and faulty phase. Feasibility of a basic binary classification is shown, despite the well-known over-fitting problem caused by limited data. We have shown that geometrical imperfections that are common in small UAVs can cause particular effects on the prediction performance, and we used it in our advantage to improve the detection on multi-class classification. The SVM algorithm with proposed feature trajectories was capable to detect variation of loss of control effectiveness faults up to an accuracy of 95% in real flights.

Based on the prediction method, the mutual information cross entropy is used to select blocks that are most related to the prediction results. Considering the effects caused by various noise rates, a prediction module including a set of recurrent neural networks is trained and reserved under different noise environments, then a classification module consists of convolutional neural networks is used to choose suitable prediction model. Based on the errors between the predicted series and the test series, anomaly detection is implemented by Neyman Pearson criterion.},

abstract={The cadastre is the foundation of land management. However, it is estimated that 70% of the land rights in the world remain unregistered. Traditional approaches are costly and labor intensive, therefore, recently the use of remotely sensed images has been investigated. The delineation of cadastral boundaries from such data is challenging since not all boundaries are demarcated by visible physical objects. In this paper, we introduce a technique based on deep Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), which can automatically learn high-level spatial features from images, to extract cadastral boundaries. Our strategy combines FCN and a grouping algorithm using the Oriented Watershed Transform (OWT) to generate connected contours. We carried out an experimental analysis in a real case study in Busogo, Rwanda, using images acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in 2018. Our investigation shows promising results in automatically extracting visible boundaries, which can contribute to the current mapping and updating practices in Rwanda.},

abstract={A new control method for an underactuated quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed to solve the problem of moving target tracking and obstacle avoidance. In order to achieve a better target tracking and obstacle avoidance control, the dynamic model of quadrotor UAV is decoupled into position control subsystem and attitude control subsystem. Firstly, a method combining artificial potential field (APF) with sliding model control is introduced for the position system to track the moving target at a fixed distance in the case of obstacles and external disturbances. Secondly, a sliding mode control method based on radial basis function (RBF) network is applied to ensure the attitude of the quadrotor converges to the desired values. In addition, the stabilities of the two subsystems are respectively proved based on Lyapunov theory. Finally, the simulation results of moving target tracking verify the superiority and robustness of the proposed control method in the presence of obstacles and external interference.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) acting as aerial Wi-Fi Access Points or cellular Base Stations are being considered to deploy on-demand network capacity in order to serve traffic demand surges or replace Base Stations. The ability to estimate the Quality of Service (QoS) for a given network setup may help in solving UAV placement problems. This paper proposes a Machine Learning (ML) based QoS estimator, based on convolutional neural networks, which estimates the QoS for a given network by considering the UAV positions, the user positions and their offered traffic. The ML-based QoS estimator represents a novel paradigm for estimating the QoS in aerial wireless networks. It provides fast and accurate estimations with reduced computational complexity. We demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of the proposed QoS estimator using the ideal UAV placement algorithm. Simulation results show the QoS estimator has an average prediction error lower than 5%.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered as a promising technique to enhance future wireless mobile communication. In this paper, the UAVs serve as aerial base stations (UBSs) to provide reliable service for terminal users (TUs). We construct the physical model and air-ground link model to formulate an optimization problem, aiming to maximize the total channel capacity of the network. To address this non-convex problem, we proposed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm (MADRL) based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to optimize the trajectory design and bandwidth assignment dynamically. Proper reward function is well designed to guide the agents to exploit the potential of the aerial network. Simulations demonstrate that our scheme can adapt the rapidly changing environment and obtains 29.49% performance improvement comparing to the baseline scheme.},

abstract={With the stringent requirement of receiving video from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from anywhere in the stadium of sports events and the significant-high per-cell throughput for video transmission to virtual reality (VR) users, a promising solution is a cell-free multi-group broadcast (CF-MB) network with cooperative reception and broadcast access points (AP). To explore the benefit of broadcasting user-correlated decode-dependent video resources to spatially correlated VR users, the network should dynamically cluster APs into virtual cells for a different group of VR users with overlapped video requests. We first introduce the conventional non-learning-based association algorithms. We then formulate the association problem into a networked-distributed Partially Observable Markov decision process (ND-POMDP). To solve it, we propose a multi-agent deep DRL algorithm based on the rainbow agent with a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate decisions from observation. Our simulation results shown that our CF-MB network can effectively handle real-time video transmission from UAVs to VR users. Our proposed learning architectures is effective and scalable for a high-dimensional cooperative association problem with increasing APs and VR users. Also, our proposed algorithms outperform non-learning based methods with significant performance improvement.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning are important tools at the forefront of automated forest monitoring research, where classification of individual tree species is a critical forest management goal. Near-infrared (NIR) information provided by specialized UAV sensors may improve classification accuracy at the cost of added operational complexity; however, this potential for improvement is context-dependent and, therefore, may not be necessary. We assessed the performance of conventional red-green-blue (RGB) versus NIR imagery when classifying regenerating lodgepole pine and white spruce crowns automatically delineated by a trained deep learning algorithm. Models trained on NIR imagery slightly outperformed those trained on RGB imagery. Models trained on spectral bands outperformed those trained on spectral indices. The minor difference in performance between the two sets of imagery showed that accurate classification of lodgepole pine and white spruce can be carried-out using conventional RGB imagery.},

abstract={In heterogeneous wireless networks, massive mobile terminals randomly generate a large number of computation tasks (payloads). How to better manage these mobile terminals located in wireless networks to achieve acceptable quality of service (QoS) such as latency minimization, energy consumption minimization is crucial. A multi-access edge computing (MEC) server can be leveraged to execute the offloaded payloads generated from mobile terminals owing to its powerful processing power and location proximity features. However, an MEC server cannot tackle all offloaded tasks from multiple mobile terminals, and its energy consumption needs further consideration. We introduce an edge server model combined with the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and equipped with the macro base station (MBS-MEC) to process the arrival payloads, and all UAVs and MBS-MECs can harvest renewable energy by using energy harvesting equipment. Furthermore, we model the computation offloading as a deep reinforcement learning scheme without priori knowledge. Considering the infeasibility of deep-reinforcement learning-based centralized learning for the proposed edge computing framework, we propose a distributed computation offloading scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (DCODRL) to minimize the weighted average cost, including the latency cost and the energy cost. Each mobile terminal can be regarded as a learning agent for the DCODRL. To compensate for the lack of cooperation of the DCODRL, we propose a gated-recurrent-unit-assisted multi-agent computation offloading scheme based on deep reinforcement learning (MCODRL) to improve the offloading policy by obtaining global observation information and designing a common reward for all agents. Comprehensive numerical results reflect the convergence and effectiveness of the DCODRL and MCODRL, and the efficacy of the proposed algorithms is further verified through comparisons with two baseline algorithms.},

In this paper, we investigate the behavior of such few-shot methods in the context of drone vision cinematography for sports event filming, in order to recognize new image classes by taking into consideration the fact that this new class we wish to identify is a subclass of an already known class. More specifically we use UAV footage to recognize certain types of athletes, belonging to a subset of an original athlete class, utilizing only a handful of recorded images of this athlete subclass. We examine the effects of such methods on image recognition accuracy while proposing a novel approach for accuracy optimizations. The overall task is evaluated on actual cycling race UAV footage.},

abstract={Semantic segmentation is understanding images at pixel level, which becomes increasingly vital in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) imagery classification tasks. With the powerful calculating ability of GPU, a growing number of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are designed to address semantic segmentation challenges. However, compared with CPU, GPU is much more costly, and GPU relies on powerful supplementary equipments to support it. Therefore, GPU-based methods are hard to carry out in practical applications. In this study, we propose a CPU-based method named fully convolutional support vector machine (FCSVM) to address the semantic segmentation challenge in UAV images. On the one hand, we adopt the SVM kernel from the original convolutional SVM networks (CSVM), which completes classification at image level. On the other hand, FCSVM consists of two processes which are a compressed process and a extensive process. In the compressed process, the FCSVM has convolutional layers and reduction layers. In the extensive process, the FCSVM has convolutional layers and upsampling layers. This structure allows FCSVM to classify images at pixel level using limited number of training data. The experiments are implemented on one UAV dataset with very little training data. The result shows our FCSVM achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods.},

abstract={Aiming at the problem that the reliability of data fusion in the unmanned aerial vehicle navigation system will be drastically reduced when the environmental characteristic changes, this paper proposes a new algorithm to address the problem based on the prediction and compensation of neural network. First, the Extended Kalman Filter and particle filter are used for the data fusion of laser and optical flow sensor. And then a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network is used to estimate the error of the particle filter. When the laser data is reliable, RBF Neural Network converts into the learning mode to train the model, and when the laser data is interrupted or unreliable, the system is compensated by using the trained model. The experimental results show that the RBF neural network model can effectively improve the reliability of the UAV navigation information when the environment characteristic changes, which prove the validity of the algorithm, proposed in this paper.},

pages={50-59},
abstract={We propose Nazr-CNN1, a deep learning pipeline for object detection and fine-grained classification in images acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for damage assessment and monitoring. Nazr-CNN consists of two components. The function of the first component is to localize objects (e.g. houses or infrastructure) in an image by carrying out a pixel-level classification. In the second component, a hidden layer of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to encode Fisher Vectors (FV) of the segments generated from the first component in order to help discriminate between different levels of damage. To showcase our approach we use data from UAVs that were deployed to assess the level of damage in the aftermath of a devastating cyclone that hit the island of Vanuatu in 2015. The collected images were labeled by a crowdsourcing effort and the labeling categories consisted of fine-grained levels of damage to built structures. Since our data set is relatively small, a pre-trained network for pixel-level classification and FV encoding was used. Nazr-CNN attains promising results both for object detection and damage assessment suggesting that the integrated pipeline is robust in the face of small data sets and labeling errors by annotators. While the focus of Nazr-CNN is on assessment of UAV images in a post-disaster scenario, our solution is general and can be applied in many diverse settings. We show one such case of transfer learning to assess the level of damage in aerial images collected after a typhoon in Philippines.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted extensive interests from both academia and industry due to the potential wide applications with universal applicable nature of the deployment. However, currently the bottleneck for UAVs is the limited carried energy resources (e.g. oil box, battery), especially for electric-driven UAVs. For a system consisting of multiple UAVs using batteries, its stability depends on each UAV. Therefore, the lifetime of each UAV is expected to be extended. In this paper, we propose the concept of RF charging aerially for the UAV fleet. Specifically, in order to ensure the stability of the system, wireless charging is considered for enhancing the lifetime of each UAV. However, it may be unbalanced. Accordingly, the issue of charging scheduling arises. The problem is formulated as a Q-Learning problem in this paper. Agent constantly explores and optimizes its scheduling policy. Finally, it can adapt to different UAV distribution situations. We take the energy levels of UAVs as input, which is easy for implementation. We have compared with two other algorithms (RSA and LESA) and compared with the case of no-charging. The results show that comparing with no-charging, the stability of the system can be improved by up to 78%. Compared with RSA and LESA, system stability is increased by up to 30%-40%. In addition, our method is more flexible and applicable to fleet than other ways (such as return to base station, landing to power line, ground laser, etc) to supplement energy.},

In this paper, we propose a solution to this issue by applying a new framework for the prediction of received signal strength (RSS) in mobile communications based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). The experimental data measurements are taken with a UAV at different altitudes. We apply several evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in conjunction with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) backpropagation algorithm in order to train different ANNs and in particular the L-SHADE algorithm, which self-adapts control parameters and dynamically adjusts population size. Five new hybrid training methods are designed by combining LM with self-adaptive differential evolution (DE) strategies. These new training methods obtain better performance to ANN weight optimization than the original LM method. The received results are compared with the real values using representative ANN performance indices and exhibit satisfactory accuracy.},

abstract={The effective trajectory design of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is investigated for improving the capacity of the communication system. The aim is for maximizing real-time downlink capacity under the coverage constraint by reaping the mobility benefits of UAVs. The problem of three-dimension (3D) dynamic movement of UAVs under coverage constraint is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problem, while a constrained Deep Q-Network (cDQN) algorithm is proposed for solving the formulated problem. In the proposed cDQN model, each UAV acts as an agent to explore and learn its 3D deploying policy. The aim of the proposed cDQN model is for obtaining the maximum capacity while attempting to guarantee that all ground terminals (GTs) are covered. In order to satisfy the coverage constraint, a primal-dual method is adopted for training primal variable and dual variable (lagrangian multiplier) in turn. Furthermore, in an effort to reduce the action space of the cDQN algorithm, prior information is utilized for eliminating the invalid actions by the action filter. Experiment results demonstrate that the cDQN algorithm is capable of converging after some training steps. Additionally, the UAVs are capable of adapting the movement of GTs under the coverage constraint according to the 3D deploying policy derived from the proposed cDQN algorithm.},

Considering the devices' limited data storage capacity and battery life, we propose a multi-objective optimization problem that aims to minimize the average data buffer length, maximize the residual battery level of the system and avoid data overflow and running out of battery of devices. Since the services requirements of IoT devices are dynamic and uncertain and the system can not be full observed by the UAV, it is challenging for UAV to achieve trajectory planning.

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can pose a major risk for aviation safety, due to both negligent and malicious use. For this reason, the automated detection and tracking of UAV is a fundamental task in aerial security systems. Common technologies for UAV detection include visible-band and thermal infrared imaging, radio frequency and radar. Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) for image-based object detection open the possibility to use visual information for this detection and tracking task. Furthermore, these detection architectures can be implemented as backbones for visual tracking systems, thereby enabling persistent tracking of UAV incursions. To date, no comprehensive performance benchmark exists that applies DNNs to visible-band imagery for UAV detection and tracking. To this end, three datasets with varied environmental conditions for UAV detection and tracking, comprising a total of 241 videos (331,486 images), are assessed using four detection architectures and three tracking frameworks. The best performing detector architecture obtains an mAP of 98.6% and the best performing tracking framework obtains a MOTA of 98.7%. Cross-modality evaluation is carried out between visible and infrared spectrums, achieving a maximal 82.8% mAP on visible images when training in the infrared modality. These results provide the first public multi-approach benchmark for state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods and give insight into which detection and tracking architectures are effective in the UAV domain.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly leveraged to perform infrastructure inspection tasks, especially with the support of rapidly evolving AI algorithms and hardware in recent years. While the integration of UAV and AI techniques enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure inspection, it also raises security concerns due to the potential vulnerabilities existing in the underlying AI models. In this paper, we propose to investigate and discover these vulnerabilities with the case study on bridge inspection. In particular, we designed a two-stage approach that can construct effective adversarial perturbations that make the UAV miss the detection of risk-prone regions during the inspection. Spatial constraints, physical limits, as well as dynamic environmental changes are taken into consideration in our approach to make it practical in the physical world. We evaluate our approach using the COCO-Bridge dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both white-box attack and black-box attack settings.},

abstract={Due to the dynamic nature of connectivity in terrestrial vehicular networks, it is of great benefit to deploy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in these networks to act as relays. As a result, a remarkable number of studies have exploited UAVs to bridge the communication gaps between terrestrial vehicles, and sometimes despite their unoptimized mobility, their restricted communication coverage, and their limited energy resources. However, it was noted that for an intermittently connected vehicular network, UAVs could not cover all sparse areas all the time. Even worse, when deploying enough UAVs to cover all these areas, the probability of inter-UAV collisions increases, and it will be complex to control their movements efficiently. Consequently, it is required to dispatch an organized and intelligent group of UAVs to perform communication relays in the long term while keeping their connectivity, minimizing their average energy consumption, and providing an efficient coverage strategy. To meet these requirements, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, called DISCOUNT (Dispatch of UAVs for Urban VANETs). Extensive simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. It has been shown that the proposed framework significantly outperforms two commonly-used baseline techniques and some reinforcement learning methods in terms of energy consumption, coverage, and routing performances.},

abstract={The problem of balancing an inverted pendulum on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been achieved using linear and nonlinear control approaches. However, to the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been solved using learning methods. On the other hand, the classical inverted pendulum is a common benchmark problem to evaluate learning techniques. In this paper we demonstrate a novel solution to the inverted pendulum problem extended to UAVs, specifically quadrotors. This complex system is underactuated and sensitive to small acceleration changes of the quadrotor. The solution is provided by reinforcement learning (RL), a platform commonly applied to solve nonlinear control problems. We generate a control policy to balance the pendulum using Continuous Action Fitted Value Iteration (CAFVI) [1] which is a RL algorithm for high-dimensional input-spaces. This technique combines learning of both state and state-action value functions in an approximate value iteration setting with continuous inputs. Simulations verify the performance of the generated control policy for varying initial conditions. The results show the control policy is computationally fast enough to be appropriate of real-time control.},

We compare table-based and neural network (NN) approximations of the Q-function and analyze the results. In contrast to previous works, movement decisions are directly made by the neural network and the algorithm requires no explicit information about the environment and is able to learn the topology of the network to improve the system-wide performance.},

abstract={In the case of explosive content requests being generated by numerous vehicles in rush hour, the cellular downlink resources become insufficient. This paper considers two supplementary schemes for exploiting the uplink resources: One is letting vehicles cache the browsed contents so that the vehicles can share contents with one another; and the other is dispatching a cache-enabled UAV to transmit contents to the vehicles nearby. We formulate a joint optimization problem for maximizing the average data rate of vehicles, and then decompose it into the subproblems of client association and UAV scheduling. The client association aims at matching the vehicles to the resources, and the UAV scheduling is to update the UAV's caching and trajectory to adapt to the environment changing. The two subproblems focus respectively on the current condition and the long term profit, and are solved respectively by a matching-based algorithm and a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm. Our simulation results based on a real-world traffic data set demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approaches.},

abstract={Mapping ecological change in the Antarctic Peninsula is an important problem in the context of global climate change. Penguin populations are an important indicator of the health of the oceans and their associated ecosystems. Unfortunately, most species of penguins live and nest far from human settlements and are, thus, difficult to monitor. Systematic population surveys of penguin colonies require researchers to land on remote Antarctic islands and count the penguins and their nests manually. A recent alternative has been to use Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to map out colonies in detail and use the overlapping imagery to construct orthomosaics that have enough resolution to allow researchers to count entire populations within large areas that encompass multiple colonies. However, the sheer volume of data collected with UAVs acts as a major impediment to a manual census of the penguin population. Thus, our efforts have focused on an image-based penguin counting pipeline that is efficient, automated and non-intrusive. Our approach includes using an UAV to perform aerial imagery surveys on-site, stitching the UAV images into orthomosaics and counting penguins automatically with a deep learning model. We applied two different criteria in the deep learning model: counting penguins laying on their nests during incubation and counting penguin with their chicks on the nests after incubation. Our pipeline has shown promising results on data collected in our 2015 Danger Island campaign and our 2020 Elephant Island and Low Island campaign. This work broadens and expands our own previous efforts using UAV and deep convolutional networks in 2015 on the Danger Islands.},

abstract={In this work, we synthesize collaboration protocols for human-unmanned aerial vehicle (H-UAV) command and control systems, where the human operator aids in securing the UAV by intermittently performing geolocation tasks to confirm its reported location. We first present a stochastic game-based model for the system that accounts for both the operator and an adversary capable of launching stealthy false-data injection attacks, causing the UAV to deviate from its path. We also describe a synthesis challenge due to the UAV's hidden-information constraint. Next, we perform human experiments using a developed RESCHU-SA testbed to recognize the geolocation strategies that operators adopt. Furthermore, we deploy machine learning techniques on the collected experimental data to predict the correctness of a geolocation task at a given location based on its geographical features. By representing the model as a delayed-action game and formalizing the system objectives, we utilize off-the-shelf model checkers to synthesize protocols for the human-UAV coalition that satisfy these objectives. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the H-UAV protocol synthesis through a case study where the protocols are experimentally analyzed and further evaluated by human operators.},

abstract={This work presents a three-dimensional control algorithm using reinforcement learning to guide an attacking hunter drone capable of performing a global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) repeater attack on the GNSS receiver of a target invader drone. Considering the mission and movement requirements of the hunter drone, a Q-learning algorithm was developed, for which the table with the possible transitions of the states and actions is obtained by the actions that the vehicle can take considering directions and the respective consequences of each action. The learning capability of the proposed algorithm arises from the trial and error by an agent. The penalty calculation is based on the error of the invader position to the hunter's desired position of the attacked drone. The developed algorithm is tested using a software-in-the-loop (SITL) implementation, which is based on the Ardupilot platform. SITL simulations are performed in a developed testbed to emulate operational scenarios, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is hijacked and then controlled by an attacking UAV until it reaches the final position desired by the hunter, usually a secure area where the vehicle can be captured without being destroyed. Results, including error metrics and action time, are discussed for different mission scenarios.},

abstract={Combat units in joint operations have huge decision space and many uncertain factors. Generally speaking, most of the traditional decision-making methods are based on rules, and it is impossible to establish a reliable mapping relationship between decision space and combat results. To promote the research of intelligent decision making in joint operations, the Equipment Development Department of the Central Military Commission held a challenge called `strategic plans on the computer, joint intelligent win'. In this challenge, the forces and the performance equipment are fixed at both the sides of the attack and defense. This setup helps the intelligent deci-sion-making agents to identify the scenarios which score high and have good learning scope in decision making. In the study, we propose an air offensive operations decision-making agent based on a neural network. To perform testing and analysis, we have used the neural network dataset available at a decision space. The decision space comprises of different decision-making rules and rando disturbances. The proposed model shows better results as compared to traditional rule-based operations and military expert decision-based operations in the test set.},

abstract={Semantic segmentation using adversarial networks has been approved to produce the better artificial results in image processing fields. Focused on current Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), since the convolutional kernel size has been fixed in every convolutional operation, the small objects would be ignored with large convolutional kernel size, and the segmentation result of large objects is not continuous with small convolutional kernel size. The paper developed a semantic segmentation model that combined the adversarial networks with multi-scale context aggregation. Further, the model was applied to road segmentation of UAV RS images. The experimental results of this semantic segmentation model with multi-scale context aggregation has a better performance for road segmentation and fit well with the reference standard results. It can improve the road segmentation accuracy obviously in the situation where there are other small regions whose shape or color is similar to road regions in UAV RS images.},

abstract={Floating trash in the river presents a major environmental problem that endangers the lives of river inhabitants. However, conventional trash monitoring relies on labor-intensive manual inspection by dispatching inspectors to the filed, which is highly cost-ineffective. Despite that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely proposed for many real-time monitoring applications, limited power supply remains the most challenging bottleneck for such UAV-assisted monitoring applications. In this work, we propose an automated river trash monitoring system called SuperDock. SuperDock consists of a remote processing unit, a docking station and a UAV. SuperDock lands the UAV precisely onto the docking station followed by performing automated battery replacement. As a result, the UAV can continue the monitoring task after the battery replacement. Furthermore, SuperDock includes a deep learning-assisted river trash detection module based on YOLOv3 that runs much faster than the conventional Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). In addition, a data set has been generated for training and testing the deep learning network, specifically for the floating trash detection application. Finally, SuperDock enables the UAV to communicate wirelessly with a remote computer in a real-time manner. Experimental and simulation results show that SuperDock is highly effective in monitoring the floating trash in the river.},

Second, extra 4,000 UAV images shot by the embedded UAV camera are fed into the YOLO which is used to predict bounding-box with label probabilities from a full image. The YOLO is compared with the Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network, as well as other deep-learning frameworks for object detection. Field experiments on UAV videos shot in various backgrounds are performed to testify that the proposed system can detect objects in UAV images effectively and robustly, achieving a real-time detection speed at 15 frames per second and a satisfying accuracy on the wild test set of 400 UAV images with a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration.},

abstract={In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) self-adaptive region fuzzy guidance law based on radial basis function (RBF) neural networks for some attacking UAV was proposed. Firstly, 3D motion equations for pursuit-evasion of UAV and maneuvering target are given. Secondly, the proposed method was applied to decreasing the miss distance, which is mostly arisen from the fixed navigation rates of traditional proportional navigation guidance laws (TPNGLs). The line of sight (LOS) rate and the closing speed between the attacking UAV and the target are taken as inputs of the fuzzy controller. The output of the fuzzy controller is the commanded acceleration. Then a nonlinear, self-adaptive region function is introduced based on the RBF neural networks to change the region. This nonlinear function can be changed with the input variables, thus can realize dynamic change of the fuzzy variable region. Finally, two engagement scenarios were examined, and a comparison between TPNGLs and the proposed PNGLRBF was made, the simulation results show that the proposed 3D SRFGLRBF can achieve ideal miss distance than TPNGLs.},

We tested four different machine learning algorithms. The boosted regression tree algorithm provided the best accuracy model with mean absolute error of 3.8 % volumetric water content. The most important variables for the prediction of soil moisture were precipitation, reflectance in the red wavelengths, potential evapotranspiration, and topographic position indices (TPI). Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of soil water status across heterogeneous terrain may be adequately described and predicted by UAS remote sensing data and machine learning. Our modeling approach and the variable importance and relationships we have assessed in this study should be useful for management and environmental modeling tasks where spatially explicit soil moisture information is important.},

In the considered model, each IoT device aims to balance its information freshness and energy consumption tradeoff by controlling its computational resource allocation at each time slot under dynamic environments. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is deployed as a flying base station so as to enable the IoT devices to adapt to novel environments. To this end, a new lifelong reinforcement learning algorithm, used by the UAV, is proposed in order to adapt the operation of the devices at each visit by the UAV. By using the experience from previously visited devices and environments, the UAV can help devices adapt faster to future states of their environment. To do so, a knowledge base shared by all devices is maintained at the UAV. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can converge 25% to 50% faster than a policy gradient baseline algorithm that optimizes each device’s decision making problem in isolation.},

In order to have a comprehensive analysis of cellular traffic, an ML framework based on a Gaussian mixture model and a weighted expectation maximization algorithm is introduced to predict the potential network congestion. Then, the optimal deployment of UAVs is studied with the objective of minimizing the power needed for UAV transmission and mobility, given the predicted traffic. To this end, first, the optimal partition of service areas of each UAV is derived, based on a fairness principle. Next, the optimal location of each UAV that minimizes the total power consumption is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed ML approach can reduce power needed for downlink transmission and mobility by over 20% and 80%, respectively, compared with an optimal deployment of UAVs with no ML prediction.},

Controller design for the quadrotor UAV is a difficult task due to its uncertain nonlinear dynamics. Unlike most previous works, we also consider uncertain actuator dynamics into the model construction of the UAV. For state estimation, a nonlinear observer using neural networks is designed. For the controller, the dynamic surface control technique has been used, which has the advantage of less complexity as compared to the conventional backstepping technique. The closed loop stability is proved using Lyapunov stability analysis. Unlike previously published techniques, we do not assume actuator signals are available for measurement in the observer/controller design. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller in presence of uncertainties in quadrotor UAV and actuator dynamics.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can collaborate to collect and relay data for ground sensors in remote and hostile areas. In multi-UAV-assisted wireless sensor networks (MA-WSN), the UAVs' movements impact on channel condition and can fail data transmission, this situation along with newly arrived data give rise to buffer overflows at the ground sensors. Thus, scheduling data transmission is of utmost importance in MA-WSN to reduce data packet losses resulting from buffer overflows and channel fading. In this paper, we investigate the optimal ground sensor selection at the UAVs to minimize data packet losses. The optimization problem is formulated as a multi-agent Markov decision process, where network states consist of battery levels and data buffer lengths of the ground sensor, channel conditions, and waypoints of the UAV along the trajectory. In practice, an MA-WSN contains a large number of network states, while the up-to-date knowledge of the network states and other UAVs' sensor selection decisions is not available at each agent. We propose a Multi-UAV Deep Reinforcement Learning based Scheduling Algorithm (MUAIS) to minimize the data packet loss, where the UAVs learn the underlying patterns of the data and energy arrivals at all the ground sensors. Numerical results show that the proposed MUAIS achieves at least 46 % and 35% lower packet loss than an optimal solution with single-UAV and an existing non-learning greedy algorithm, respectively.},

abstract={An automatic landing site selection algorithm generates potential landing sites for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) with engine failures. One important step in the landing site selection algorithm is surface type estimation. In this paper, we focus on distinguishing the following three surface types: grass/soil, tree, and inland water. Two approaches are presented. One is a conventional approach that combines Gabor features and a nonlinear classifier known as Support Vector Machine (SVM). Another one is a deep learning-based approach called SegNet. Extensive simulations showed that although both approaches achieved high performance, the Gabor/SVM approach yielded slightly better robustness with respect to illumination changes.},

The localization is performed using mobile unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as the anchor nodes to send the beacon signals every period of time, thus every unknown node can estimate it's current position based on the RSSI values of the received beacon signals by training the SLFN using extreme learning machine (ELM) technique. There are no deployed ground anchor node and require fewer anchor nodes compared to traditional RSSI-based localization technique to yield better accuracy.

abstract={Deep learning (DL) based localization and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has recently gained considerable attention demonstrating remarkable results. Instead of constructing hand-crafted algorithms through geometric theories, DL based solutions provide a data-driven solution to the problem. Taking advantage of large amounts of training data and computing capacity, these approaches are increasingly developing into a new field that offers accurate and robust localization systems. In this work, the problem of global localization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is analyzed by proposing a sequential, end-to-end, and multimodal deep neural network based monocular visual-inertial localization framework. More specifically, the proposed neural network architecture is three-fold; a visual feature extractor convNet network, a small IMU integrator bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM), and a global pose regressor bi-directional LSTM network for pose estimation. In addition, by fusing the traditional IMU filtering methods instead of LSTM with the convNet, a more time-efficient deep pose estimation framework is presented. It is worth pointing out that the focus in this study is to evaluate the precision and efficiency of visual-inertial (VI) based localization approaches concerning indoor scenarios. The proposed deep global localization is compared with the various state-of-the-art algorithms on indoor UAV datasets, simulation environments and real-world drone experiments in terms of accuracy and time-efficiency. In addition, the comparison of IMU-LSTM and IMU-Filter based pose estimators is also provided by a detailed analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed filter-based approach combined with a DL approach has promising performance in terms of accuracy and time efficiency in indoor localization of UAVs.},

pages={133989-134004},
abstract={A Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) helps vehicles send and receive environmental and traffic information, making it a crucial component towards fully autonomous roads. For VANETs to serve their purpose, there has to be sufficient coverage, even in areas where there is less demand. Moreover, a lot of the safety information is time-sensitive; excessive delay in data transfer can increase the risk of fatal accidents. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be used as mobile base-stations to fill in gaps of coverage. The placement of these UAVs is crucial towards how well the system performs. We are particularly interested in the placement of mobile base-stations for a rural highway with sparse traffic, as it represents the worst-case scenario for vehicular communication. Instead of heuristic or linear programming methods for optimal placement, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The main benefit of MARL is that it allows the agents to learn model-free through experience. We propose a variation of the traditional Deep Independent Q-Learning. The modifications include an observation function augmented with information directly shared between neighbouring agents as well a shared policy scheme. We also implement a custom sparse highway simulator that is used for training and testing our algorithm. Our testing shows that the proposed MARL algorithm is able to learn the placement policies that produce the maximum rewards for different scenarios while adapting to the dynamic road densities along the service area. Our experiments show that our model is scalable, allowing the number of agents to increase without any modifications to the code. Finally, we show that our model can be generalized as the algorithm can be directly used on an industry standard simulator with similar performance. Future experiments can be performed to improve the realism and complexity of the highway models as well as to test the method on real-world data.},

abstract={A mixed aerial and ground robot team, which includes both unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), is widely used for disaster rescue, social security, precision agriculture, and military missions. However, team capability and corresponding configuration vary since robots have different motion speeds, perceiving ranges, reaching areas, and resilient capabilities to the dynamic environment. Due to heterogeneous robots inside a team and the resilient capabilities of robots, it is challenging to perform a task with an optimal balance between reasonable task allocations and maximum utilization of robot capability. To address this challenge for effective mixed ground and aerial teaming, this paper developed a novel teaming method, proficiency aware multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (Mix-RL), to guide ground and aerial cooperation by considering the best alignments between robot capabilities, task requirements, and environment conditions. Mix-RL largely exploits robot capabilities while being aware of the adaption of robot capabilities to task requirements and environment conditions. Mix-RL's effectiveness in guiding mixed teaming was validated with the task “social security for criminal vehicle tracking”.},

The system performances are evaluated through long short term memory(LSTM) and comparison was made with multi- layer perceptron(MLP) algorithm. Finally, the evaluation result shows the system has accurate and motivated prediction performances of the user throughput.},

abstract={The survivable network concept refers to contexts where the wireless communication between ground agents needs to be maintained as much as possible at all times, regardless of any adverse conditions that may arise. In this paper we propose a nature-inspired approach to survivable networks, in which we bring together swarm intelligence and evolutionary computation. We use an on-line real-time Genetic Algorithm to optimize the movements of an UAV swarm towards maintaining communication between the ground agents. The proposed approach models the ground agents and the UAVs as boids-based swarms, and optimizes the movement of the UAVs using different instances of the GA running independently on each UAV. The UAV coordination mechanism is an implicit one, embedded in the fitness function of the Genetic Algorithm instances. The behaviors of the individual UAVs emerge into an aggregated optimization of the overall network survivability. The results show that the proposed approach is able to maintain satisfactory network survivability levels regardless of the ground agents' movements, including for cases as complex as random walks.},

abstract={The agility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been recently harnessed in developing potential solutions that provide seamless coverage for vehicles in areas with poor cellular infrastructure. In this letter, multiple UAVs are deployed to provide the needed cellular coverage to vehicles traveling with random speeds over a given highway segment. This letter minimizes the number of deployed UAVs and optimizes their trajectories to offer prevalent communication coverage to all vehicles crossing the highway segment while saving energy consumption of the UAVs. Due to varying traffic conditions on the highway, a reinforcement learning approach is utilized to govern the number of needed UAVs and their trajectories to serve the existing and newly arriving vehicles. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show that during the mission time, a minimum number of UAVs adapt their velocities in order to cover the vehicles.},

abstract={Fifth Generation (5G) cellular networks are expected to provide cellular connectivity for vehicular users, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). When flying in the air, these users experience strong, unobstructed channel conditions to a large number of Base Stations (BSs) on the ground. This creates very strong interference conditions for the UAV users, while at the same time offering them a large number of BSs to potentially associate with for cellular service. Therefore, to maximise the performance of the UAV-BS wireless link, the UAV user needs to be able to choose which BSs to connect to, based on the observed environmental conditions. This paper proposes a supervised learning-based association scheme, using which a UAV can intelligently associate with the most appropriate BS. We train a Neural Network (NN) to identify the most suitable BS from several candidate BSs, based on the received signal powers from the BSs, known distances to the BSs, as well as the known locations of potential interferers. We then compare the performance of the NN-based association scheme against strongest-signal and closest-neighbour association schemes, and demonstrate that the NN scheme significantly outperforms the simple heuristic schemes.},

abstract={With the rapidly increasing number and complexity of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), enabling high-density operations becomes the most important goal for UAS operations in congested airspace. However, it is difficult to capture the global environment information such as geolocation of other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the steep terrain in real-time. As a result, avoiding dynamic obstacles rather than static ones is challenging. Previous work demonstrates the feasibility of using traditional Q-learning to solve the navigation problem in a static environment, but this method is problematic when facing a dynamic environment because it usually causes the overestimation of action values. To address this challenge, this paper presents a framework based on double deep Q-network with priority experience replay (DDQN-PER) which allows the UAVs to navigate and avoid obstacles in a dynamic environment. The model is built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose input is raw pixels of the local known environment and whose output is an action after estimating future rewards. We set up multiple experimental scenarios with static and moving obstacles for different tasks which are ranging from single-agent navigation to multi-agent navigation. Then this model is applied to other pre-defined environments, without adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm, to validate its generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed models can allow the UAVs reach the goal successfully in new dynamic environments.},

year={2021},
volume={9},
number={},
pages={1286-1303},
abstract={A swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires the transmission of mission-related data across the network. The resource constraints and dynamic nature of the swarm bring critical challenges to the design of UAV routing protocols. Most of the conventional ad hoc routing schemes are not intelligent and cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of UAV swarming networks. On the other hand, some artificial intelligence (AI)-based routing schemes may consume significant computational resources in the UAVs. In this article, a low-cost, adaptive routing protocol, namely skeleton-based swarm routing (SSR), is proposed, which exploits an intelligent online learning algorithm and the topology features of the mission-driven UAV swarm to distribute the traffic over optimal routes. Here, the skeleton represents the most stable parts of the swarm formation. SSR architecture consists of three modules: 1) A geometric addressing module, which assigns geometric coordinates to each node based on the swarm skeleton structure; 2) A leaf-like routing pipe which allows the selection of multiple candidate routes around the shortest path; 3) An intelligent low-complexity learning model which determines how to distribute the packets inside the routing pipe to achieve load-balanced, high-throughput transmissions. The proposed skeleton-based scheme can also facilitate the UAV formation construction and morphing. The simulation results show that the proposed SSR protocol can noticeably improve the network performance (up to 100% throughput improvement) compared to the single path routing schemes, such as the ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and link-quality and traffic-load aware optimized link state routing (LTA-OLSR) protocols.},

abstract={Most of the recent results in control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have focused on motion stability and navigation in well-structured environments, without considering communication delay influences. In order to deal with time delays and packet losses in networked UAVs, this paper suggests a machine learning based Gaussian process (GP) filter for a path planning problem. The developed GP filter estimates the UAV states accurately given delayed observation by learning the pattern of network-induced effects on UAV maneuvers. We validate that the GP filter produces the lower error rate than Kalman filter by analyzing error covariances. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a collaborative trajectory tracking task for two networked-UAVs and the better control performance is achieved.},

abstract={There have been a significant number of recent studies on autonomous landing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Early studies employed a global positioning system (GPS) receivers for this purpose. However, because GPS signals cannot be used in certain urban environments, prior studies used vision-based marker detection. To accurately detect a marker, a high-resolution camera on a drone must obtain a high-quality image. This can not only be expensive but also increases the weight of the drone. In general, drones are only equipped with a frontal-viewing and fixed angle camera, and an additional downward-viewing camera becomes necessary for drone landing. Therefore, expensive and weighted high-resolution cameras are not feasible for use on drones. Nevertheless, most previous studies on vision-based drone landing use high-resolution images. To address such limitations, we propose a new method of drone landing using deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction and marker detection on an image captured by a cost-effective and low-resolution visible light camera. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits higher performance than the existing methods in terms of super-resolution reconstruction and marker detection.},

Particularly, the UAV flies towards the sensors to collect status update packets within a given duration while maintaining a non-negative residual energy. We formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to find the optimal flight trajectory of the UAV and transmission scheduling of the sensors that minimizes the weighted sum of the age of information (AoI). A UAV-assisted data collection algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is further proposed to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based algorithm can significantly reduce the weighted sum of the AoI compared to other baseline algorithms.},

abstract={Real-time decision making with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) imagery is desired in many applications. Deep learning (DL) is a promising enabler for such applications thanks to its recent advancements. However, direct execution of DL models on UAVs, especially small and micro ones, would not only introduce severe delay but also significantly shorten the flight time of UAVs due to the high energy consumption. Realtime transmission of UAV images to ground edge devices for deep analysis can mitigate the computational complexity but may introduce severe interference to ground devices, in addition unpredictable delays due to the dynamic network conditions. To minimize real-time image transmission, this paper designs a new offloading prediction algorithm which first estimates nearfuture need for DL of each UAV and transmit images only when necessary. Holistic resource allocation is made at the edge based on the offloading likelihood analysis of multiple UAVs as well as available resources. Experimental results on real UAV video clips show that our design can save 92% of the communication costs with less than 4% false positive rate.},

The algorithm relies on a mixed-use of decentralized Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the A* pathfinder. Each UAV has elementary cognitive skills to sense information about the nearby environment which are then fed as an input to the network. The neural network creates a correlation between the current state of a UAV and the best action to take at each time step. The exploration strategy is stored in a labeled database for the single-UAV case; the neural network learns and replicates it in the multi-UAV case, being able to generalize the acquired skills over new maps not contained in the database. The training session imitates human priors in a multi-class classification, which completely bypasses common drawbacks such as the need for large databases or high computational resources. The case study focuses on complex urban areas, for which the grid resolution of the traditional approaches can't model the problem with sufficient accuracy.},

abstract={This paper investigates the control of a massive population of UAVs such as drones. The straightforward method of control of UAVs by considering the interactions among them to make a flock requires a huge inter-UAV communication which is impossible to implement in real-time applications. One method of control is to apply the mean field game (MFG) framework which substantially reduces communications among the UAVs. However, to realize this framework, powerful processors are required to obtain the control laws at different UAVs. This requirement limits the usage of the MFG framework for real-time applications such as massive UAV control. Thus, a function approximator based on neural networks (NN) is utilized to approximate the solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. Nevertheless, using an approximate solution can violate the conditions for convergence of the MFG framework. Therefore, the federated learning (FL) approach which can share the model parameters of NNs at drones, is proposed with NN based MFG to satisfy the required conditions. The stability analysis of the NN based MFG approach is presented and the performance of the proposed FL-MFG is elaborated by the simulations.},
