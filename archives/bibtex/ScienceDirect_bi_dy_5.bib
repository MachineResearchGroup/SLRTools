abstract = {This study investigated spontaneous language measures (SLM) derived from a narrative task among Spanish-speaking (SS) preschool children to provide clinicians with developmental data on SLM and to examine whether SLM show changes in development for SS preschool children. A total of 110 monolingual SS children participated in this study. Children were divided into 3 age groups: 3, 4, and 5 years of age. Two general language measures were collected from the children: a standardized receptive vocabulary measure (Test de Vocabulario en Imágenes, TVIP), and a parental report of speech and language problems (PRSLP). In addition, four developmental language measures were calculated from a language sample collected using a story-retelling task: number of T-units (NU-TU), mean length of T-units (MLTU), subordination index (SUB-I), and grammatical errors per T-unit (GRE-TU). No statistically significant differences were found between the age groups on the standard scores for the TVIP or problem scores for the PRSLP, showing that the age groups were comparable. Increasing developmental patterns were found for NU-TU, MLTU and SUB-I. These data represent an important step in the characterization of typical language development for Spanish-speaking children. The use of the means and standard deviations obtained in this study may assist clinicians and researchers in the identification of potential language disorders in SS children.
Resumen
En este estudio se han examinado algunas medidas del lenguaje espontáneo (SLM, por sus siglas en inglés) a partir de una narración en un grupo de niños hispanohablantes en edad preescolar. El objetivo de este trabajo es ofrecer una descripción del desarrollo de esas SLM y comprobar si muestran cambios significativos a lo largo del desarrollo lingüístico de los niños hispanohablantes. Los participantes en este estudio fueron 110 niños hispanohablantes monolingües divididos en tres grupos de edad: de 3, de 4 y de 5 años. Se tomaron dos medidas generales del lenguaje: el vocabulario receptivo con el TVIP (Test de vocabulario en imágenes) y la existencia de dificultades de habla y lenguaje por medio de un informe de los padres (PRSLP). Además, se utilizaron cuatro medidas de lenguaje espontáneo extraídas de la muestra de lenguaje: Número de unidades T (NU-TU), Longitud media de unidades T (MLTU), Índice de subordinación (SUB-I), y Número de errores gramaticales por unidades T (GRE-TU). No se encontraron diferencias significativas entre los grupos en los resultados del TVIP y del PRSLP, lo que ponía de manifiesto que los grupos eran iguales en habilidades lingüísticas generales. Las medidas NU-TU, MLTU y SUB-I mostraron un perfil evolutivo ascendente, con diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre los grupos. Estos datos son importantes para la caracterización del desarrollo típico del lenguaje en niños hispanohablantes, y pueden ser utilizados por logopedas y fonoaudiólogos para identificar trastornos de lenguaje en población de habla hispana.}

abstract = {Objectives
To determine parental understanding of directions on common pediatric prescription pharmacy labels and to identify enablers and barriers that affect interpretation of these labels.
Methods
Prospective qualitative descriptive study (July to August 2020) of 20 parents in post-surgical wards at a single Australian tertiary pediatric center.
Results
Four key themes emerged through inductive analysis of the interview transcripts: 1) the addition of specific directions, such as administration with/without food and treatment course duration were perceived to be beneficial; 2) explicit phrasing of dosing intervals and times were more easily interpreted; 3) the use of simpler and common terminology enhanced understanding of the directions; and 4) presentation of multiple-step directions (e.g. tapering regimens) in a simplified and more organized manner was identified as an enabler and was thought to reduce confusion.
Conclusion
Differences in wording and presentation of pediatric prescription medication label directions led to variable interpretation by parents.
Practise Implications
Therefore, there is a need for guidelines to standardize the wording of prescription medication advice labels. Findings from this study can be used to achieve this goal.}

The highest rest-retest reliability was observed on the Depression (.84) and Pain scales (.85). The V-5 was sensitive to the variability in symptom severity. Classification accuracy was driven by the base rate of the target construct, and was invariant across administration format (in-person or online) or level of English proficiency. The V-5 demonstrated promise as a cross-culturally robust screening instrument that is sensitive to change over time, lends itself to online administration, and is suitable for examinees with limited English proficiency.}

Auditory neural myelination (ANM) as evaluated by auditory brainstem evoked response (ABR) during the neonatal period has been used as a surrogate outcome for long-term neurodevelopment. The validity of ANM as a surrogate outcome for long-term neurodevelopment has not been well studied.
Aim
Evaluate the association of ABR I–V interpeak latency (IPL), an index of ANM, at 35week postmenstrual age (PMA) with language outcome at 3years of age.
Design
Prospective study.
Subjects
24–33week gestational age (GA) infants were eligible if they did not meet exclusion criteria: craniofacial malformation, chromosomal disorders, deafness, auditory dys-synchrony, TORCH infection, or non-English speaking parents. Infants with malignancy, head injury, encephalopathy, meningitis, blindness, or who died or relocated were also excluded.
Outcome measures
ABRs were performed at 35week PMA using 80dB nHL and I–V IPL (ms) measured. Auditory Comprehension (AC) and Expressive Communication (EC) were evaluated by a speech-language pathologist at 3years of age using Preschool Language Scale.
Results
Eighty infants were studied. The mean GA and birth weight of infants were 29.2weeks and 1336g, respectively. There was association of worse ear I–V IPL and better ear I–V IPL with AC (Coefficient−5.4, 95% CI: −9.8 to −0.9 and Coefficient−5.5, 95% CI: −10 to−0.9, respectively) and EC (Coefficient−5.6, 95% CI: −9.5 to−1.8 and Coefficient−6.7, 95% CI: −10.6 to−2.7, respectively) after controlling for confounders.
Conclusion
The neonatal I–V IPL is a predictor of language development at 3years of age in preterms.}

During fMRI scanning, participants performed a semantic decision (concrete concept?), a phonological decision (two syllables?), and a false-font control task (string underlined?). No significant group differences were observed with the full participant set. However, an analysis with the 10 most and 10 least skilled readers revealed that for the semantic task (vs. control task), proficient deaf readers exhibited greater activation in left inferior frontal and middle temporal gyri than less proficient readers. No group differences were observed for the phonological task. Whole-brain correlation analyses (all participants) revealed that for the semantic task, reading ability correlated positively with neural activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus and in a region associated with the orthography-semantics interface, located anterior to the visual word form area. Reading ability did not correlate with neural activity during the phonological task. Accuracy on the semantic task correlated positively with neural activity in left anterior temporal lobe (a region linked to conceptual processing), while accuracy on the phonological task correlated positively with neural activity in left posterior inferior frontal gyrus (a region linked to syllabification processes during speech production). Finally, reading comprehension scores correlated positively with vocabulary and print exposure measures, but not with phonological awareness scores.}

The present study aims to examine how these ubiquitous neurophysiological attributes may inform us about the brain processes that underpin individual differences in speech perception and production, which in turn elucidate the specific functions of neural oscillations in the domain of speech processing. To this end, we recorded electrophysiological responses to a lexical tone contrast in a passive auditory oddball paradigm from two groups of healthy tone-language speakers who were equal in perceptual discriminability but differed in response latency and production distinctiveness of the tone contrast. Time-frequency analysis was applied to the EEG data, and decomposed into theta (4–7 Hz), beta (12–30 Hz), and gamma (30–50 Hz) frequency bands. Results show that listeners with longer discrimination RT and less distinctive production showed significantly higher induced (non-phase-locked) gamma during tone processing. Moreover, among speakers with less distinctive production, individual differences in induced gamma were significantly correlated with discrimination latency and production distinction. Based on the present findings, we propose that differences in gamma oscillations reflect differential sensory/perceptual computations during acoustic encoding, impacting the quality of perceptual representations, which further mediates individual differences in speech perception and production.}

A further goal is to study how individual differences in children’s receptive language abilities are associated with such changes in cortical responses. Fourteen children, 10–16years old, participated in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment using a cross modal sentence-picture verification paradigm. We manipulated sentence difficulty and length in a 2×2 factorial design. Task-related activation covered large regions of the left and right superior temporal cortex, inferior parietal lobe, precuneous, cingulate, middle frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus. Sentence difficulty, independent of length, led to increased activation in the left temporal-parietal junction and right superior temporal gyrus. Changes in activation in frontal regions positively correlated with age-standardized receptive vocabulary scores and negatively correlated with reaction time on a receptive grammar test outside the scanner. Thus, individual differences in language skills were associated with changes in the network in response to changing task demands. These preliminary findings in a small sample of typically developing children suggest that the investigation of individual differences may prove useful in elucidating the underlying neural mechanisms of language disorders in children.}

abstract = {Background
Communication between nursing staff and people with dementia can be challenging. According to the literature, communication is seen as a process of social- and/or informational exchange between a sender and a receiver in a context. Factors related to these elements determine the quality of communication. Insight into the factors involved in the communication process between nursing staff and people with dementia is limited and a comprehensive model of communication in dementia care is lacking.
Objectives
To identify and visualize factors associated with communication between nursing staff and people with dementia.
Design
A scoping review of scientific literature.
Data Sources
Scientific articles were retrieved from the bibliographic databases of PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO.
Review Methods
The reviewing process was directed by the Joanna Briggs guidelines for scoping reviews. Full-text articles describing the communication process between nursing staff and people with dementia were eligible for inclusion. A data extraction form was used to identify factors associated with communication. Following a directed content analysis approach, factors were categorized in one of three categories: nursing staff; people with dementia; or context. Each category was thematically analysed to identify themes and subthemes. Results were visualized into a communication model.
Results
The review included 31 articles; in total, 115 factors were extracted. Thematic analysis of nursing staff factors (n = 78) showed that communication is associated with professional characteristics, individual experiences, verbal- and non-verbal communication skills, communication approach and values. Factors attributed to people with dementia (n = 22) concerned client characteristics, functional status, behaviour, verbal communication skills and values. Contextual factors (n = 15) related to organization of care, time and situation. Based on these results, the Contac-d model was constructed.
Conclusions
The Contac-d model gives a comprehensive overview of factors involved in the communication process between nursing staff and people with dementia, providing insight in potential starting points for communication improvement, e.g. respect for needs, identity and privacy of people with dementia, a flexible and adapted communication approach and matching language. Additionally, results suggest that an appealing location, longer duration of the interaction, and music in the surrounding may improve communication in certain situations. However, it was not feasible based on current literature to recommend what works to improve communication in which situations. Future studies should study factors and their interrelatedness in specific care situations. Authors further believe that more attention should be paid to strengths and capabilities of people with dementia and to non-modifiable factors that influence communication.}

Multiple regression analysis and structural equation modeling results suggested that the component skills of Chinese reading comprehension can be categorized into two major components: linguistic comprehension and decoding. The former is made up of oral narrative skills and syntactic skills, while the latter is made up of word recognition and reading fluency. The additive (i.e., linear) model with linguistic comprehension and decoding as predictors of reading comprehension provided an adequate account of the data in most analyses. The product of linguistic comprehension (syntactic skills) and decoding (word recognition/reading fluency) accounted for a significant amount of variance in passage comprehension at Grade 1 in addition to the linear contribution of linguistic comprehension and decoding.}

Experiment 1 revealed that individual differences in nonverbal intelligence predicted word learning and that novel words with conflicting orthography-to-phonology mappings were harder to learn when their spelling was more typical of the native language than less typical (due to increased competition from the native language). Notably, Experiment 2 used eye tracking to reveal, for the first time, that hearing non-native spoken words activates native language orthography and both native and non-native letter-to-sound mappings. These findings evince high interactivity in the language system, illustrate the role of orthography in phonological learning and processing, and demonstrate that experience with written form changes the linguistic mind.}

abstract = {Introduction
Contemporary research papers have highlighted the issue of lesion-aphasia discordance in reference to the classic ‘associationist’ model provided by Wernicke-Lichtheim. The objective of the present study is to explore frequency, pattern and evolution of lesion-discordant aphasia following first ever acute stroke in Bengali-speaking subjects.
Methods
Bengali version of Western Aphasia Battery, a validated scale, was used for language assessment in our study subjects. Lesion localization was done by using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (3T) for ischemic stroke (if not contraindicated) and computed tomography (CT) for hemorrhagic stroke. Among 515 screened cases of first-ever acute stroke, 208 presented aphasia. Language assessment was done between 7 and 14 days in all study subjects and was repeated between 90 and 100 days in patients available for follow-up. Ischemic stroke cases with contraindication for MRI underwent CT imaging. Discordance between lesion and aphasic phenotype was determined only for right-handed subjects with cortical involvement (isolated or in combination with sub-cortical white matter) in the left hemisphere. Appropriate statistical tests were used to analyze the collected data.
Results
Lesion-aphasia discordance was found in 20 out of 134 patients with aphasia who were dextral and had cortical involvement in the left hemisphere (14.92%). The pattern of discordance observed were- posterior lesion with Broca's aphasia (4; 20%); posterior lesion with global aphasia (8; 40%); anterior lesion with global aphasia (4; 20%), and posterior lesion with mixed transcortical aphasia (4; 20%). On univariate analysis, the factors significantly associated with lesion-aphasia discordance were hemorrhagic stroke (p = 0.000); posterior perisylvian location (p = 0.002), and higher education (p = 0.048). After adjusting for all other variables, hemorrhagic stroke was found to have strong association with lesion-aphasia discordance (p = 0.001, OR = 11.764, 95% CI, 2.83–50.0). Discordant cases were more likely to recover or change to a milder type compared to concordant cases (p = 0.007, OR = 11.393, 95% CI, 1.960–66.231), after adjusting for all other variables including initial severity of aphasia (p = 0.006, OR = 8.388, 95% CI, 1.816–38.749).
Conclusion
Lesion-aphasia discordance following acute stroke is not uncommon among Bengali-speaking subjects. In the discordant group, preponderance towards non-fluent aphasia was observed. Discordance occurred more frequently after hemorrhagic stroke. Subjects with lesion-discordant aphasia presented better recovery during early post-stroke phase.}

Overall, Romanian families who gave a Spanish name to their child receive 7 % (5 p.p.) more responses than those who selected a Romanian name. Emails from families whose members have Romanian names are 12 % (9 p.p.) less likely to receive a response than those from native Spanish-named families.

Although this observation indicates a role for attention in language processing, it is unclear whether this type of attention is part of basic speech perception mechanisms, higher-level language skills, or general cognitive abilities. The current study examined these possibilities by measuring ERPs from 5-year-old children listening to a narrative containing attention probes presented before, during, and after word onsets as well as at random control times. Children also completed behavioral tests assessing verbal and nonverbal skills. Probes presented after word onsets elicited a more negative ERP response beginning around 100ms after probe onset than control probes, indicating increased attention to word-initial segments. Crucially, the magnitude of this difference was correlated with performance on verbal tasks, but showed no relationship to nonverbal measures. More specifically, ERP attention effects were most strongly correlated with performance on a complex metalinguistic task involving grammaticality judgments. These results demonstrate that effective allocation of attention during speech perception supports higher-level, controlled language processing in children by allowing them to focus on relevant information at individual word and complex sentence levels.}

However, the nature of this relationship remains controversial because verbal STM, like reading acquisition, depends on the complexity of underlying phonological processing skills. This longitudinal study addressed the relation between STM and reading decoding acquisition by distinguishing between STM for item information and STM for order information based on recent studies showing that STM for item information, but not STM for order information, recruits underlying phonological representations. If there is a specific link between STM and reading decoding acquisition, STM for order information should be an independent predictor of reading decoding acquisition. Tasks maximizing STM for serial order or item information, measures of phonological abilities, and reading tests were administered to children followed from kindergarten through first grade. We observed that order STM capacity, but not item STM capacity, predicted independent variance in reading decoding abilities 1year later. These results highlight the specific role of STM for order in reading decoding acquisition and argue for a causal role of order STM capacity in reading acquisition. Mechanisms relating STM for order information and reading acquisition are discussed.}

The study investigates the links between maternal and paternal parenting styles and the imposter syndrome among adult female students, while probing the meditative role played by self-esteem in this context. The sample comprised 182 female students (Mage = 27.85, SD = 7.25) who completed the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), the Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). The results of the analyses of the regressions models using SEM revealed that parental care is associated with students’ lower imposter feelings via self-esteem, and paternal overprotection is associated with students’ higher imposter feelings via self-esteem. Hence, parental care and overprotection may be related to female students’ imposter feelings since they increase and decrease (respectively) their self-esteem which, in turn, affects their imposter feelings. The current study is among the first to demonstrate the mediation role played by self-esteem in the association in question separately for mothers and fathers, which contributes to facilitating the understanding of the etiology mechanism of the imposter phenomenon.}

Background
This study investigated the effect of teachers' dysphonic voices on children's listening comprehension.
Methods
One hundred thirty-four grade three and four students were recruited from local primary schools in Hong Kong. They were required to listen to six passages, three in Cantonese and three in English, which were either read in normal, mildly dysphonic, or severely dysphonic voices. The students were required to complete six multiple-choice comprehension questions upon listening to each passage. Comprehension performance across languages, dysphonic severities, genders, and question types were examined.
Results
The results showed that listening comprehension was significantly poorer even when speaker's voice quality was mildly impaired. Performance in Cantonese was generally better than that in English but no significant difference in the pattern of decline was found. Both boys and girls suffered to similar extent under dysphonic situations. Differences in performance in various question types were discussed.
Conclusions
These findings support the urgent need to implement voice care education for the teaching profession.}

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have an employment rate well below the general population. One potential solution to address this issue is the implementation of supported employment services. The purpose of our study was to evaluate a Canadian community supported employment program designed for individuals with ASD without an intellectual disability.
Method
Thirty-seven individuals with ASD, who were receiving services from a local community agency (Action main-d’oeuvre) providing supported employment services, participated in the study. The research team monitored the characteristics of the participants, the number of hours of services provided, and outcome measures related to employment. We then conducted descriptive analyses, t-tests, and Wilcoxon signed rank tests to compare anxiety about work and self-efficacy before services and after outcomes of the program.
Results
Despite high levels of comorbid mental health issues, our results indicated that 62.1 % of individuals obtained paid employment within 12 months. Furthermore, participants with post-secondary education found jobs related to their degree or requiring specialized skills. Participants felt less anxious and more self-efficacious towards employment. Maintaining employment was a greater challenge and continuing support may be required.
Conclusions
The study suggests that the employment services may have supported the participants in finding a job. However, collaboration is essential to address mental health issues in job seekers with ASD, which appeared to hinder job search and maintenance.}

To develop and validate a Lithuanian version of the Liverpool Adverse Events Profile (LT-LAEP), and to evaluate the main demographic, clinical, and pharmacological determinants of its score.
Materials and methods
We developed the LT-LAEP and examined its psychometric properties. People with epilepsy (PWE) were asked to fill in the LT-LAEP, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale-7 (GAD-7), the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E), and a questionnaire addressing key demographic and clinical information. Antiseizure medicine (ASM) burden was expressed as a number of ASM and total drug load. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the influence of various variables on LAEP results.
Results
The data of 157 participants with the established diagnosis of epilepsy and stable ASM regimen were included in the final analysis. The mean LT-LAEP score was 48.72 ± 13.65. High internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.912) and test–retest reliability (ICC = 0.801) were demonstrated. The most common adverse effects (AEs) were tiredness (24.8%) and memory problems (23.6%). Lithuanian version of the Liverpool Adverse Events Profile score significantly correlated with NDDI-E (r = 0.635, p < 0.001) and GAD-7 (r = 0.640, p < 0.001) scores. The correlation between LT-LAEP score and total drug load was weak (r = 0.243, p = 0.002). The significant predictors of higher LT-LAEP score were female sex (β = −4.768, p = 0.003), higher seizure frequency (β = 4.757, p < 0.001), and higher NDDI-E (β = 1.457, p < 0.001) and GAD-7 scores (β = 0.610, p = 0.007) (F(4,152) = 43.975, R2 = 0.536, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
The LT-LAEP is a reliable and valid instrument for the evaluation of the AEs of ASM. A higher score of LT-LAEP is predicted by female sex, seizure frequency, and anxiety and depression levels rather than total drug load.}

Studying neurodegenerative diseases has greatly expanded our knowledge of language, speech and emotion as these diseases can affect areas not typically seen with stroke or tumor. Newer imaging techniques such as voxel based morphometry), fluorodeoxyglucose (F18) positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging have allowed localization of these deficits and a greater understanding of the language network targeted by these progressive neurodegenerative illnesses. This review illustrates these important points by describing five syndromes, using clinical cases and then noting the anatomy, typical pathology, and proposed pathophysiology. The syndromes are Progressive Nonfluent Aphasia, Semantic Dementia, Logopenic Aphasia, Primary Progressive Apraxia of Speech and Dysprosody of Speech. Clinicians recognizing these syndromes using the associated clinico-anatomic patterns will lead to more accurate diagnosis and improved patient counseling and management. Further, patients may be included in appropriate clinical trials when their doctors are aware of the most likely pathology.}

In the course of post-stroke aphasia different mechanisms can contribute to the recovery of language: recovery from ischemia, compensatory rerouting of language modalities and neuroplasticity occur at different time scales after the initial injury. These mechanisms may occur spontaneously or may be induced or influenced by various therapeutic interventions. This report contains a systematic review of the literature concerning the debated role of the right hemisphere in the recovery from stroke-related aphasia. The existing literature was approached using the PICOS principle and well-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although many gaps remain in the knowledge on the role of the right hemisphere, there is some evidence of a facilitation of spontaneous language recovery in the acute and subacute phase. In the subacute and chronic phase, the right hemisphere homologous language areas, along with memory and attention-related areas, facilitate treatment related improvement. In contrast, in therapy-free periods in the chronic stage, the right hemisphere no longer contributes to language recovery or may even be inhibitory. Injury-, language- and therapy-related variables impact on the role of the right hemisphere in aphasia recovery.}

Results indicate that input-providing feedback led to higher frequencies of successful repair than did output-pushing feedback. However, microanalysis revealed that this advantage was usually short-lived, as the pupils typically repeated the original error soon after its successful repair. In contrast, although output-pushing feedback resulted in more forms that still needed repair, microanalysis revealed that following output-pushing, fewer episodes were required until accurate and fluent reading was achieved.}

abstract = {Purpose
The identification and differential diagnosis of children with speech sound disorders (SSD) is an important task of paediatric speech-language pathologists (SLPs). A correct identification requires valid and reliable assessment tools. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the diagnostic validity and accuracy as well as inter-rater reliability of the phonology test of LogoFova which was developed for Danish-speaking children.
Method
Investigation was carried out on two Danish-speaking populations: 61 suspected typically developing (TD) children and 61 children with suspected speech sound disorder aged 2–6 years. All children were assessed with the single-word picture-naming test of LogoFoVa. In order to determine diagnostic validity, it was investigated whether the test differentiated TD children from children with SSD as well as subgroups of SSD via a phonetic and phonological pattern analysis. Two different cut-off criteria were applied for the definition of patterns. Sensitivity and specificity as well as likelihood ratios were additionally calculated. To determine inter-rater reliability, transcriptions, pattern analyses and subgrouping were compared across raters.
Results
Overall, diagnostic validity of the picture-naming test of LogoFoVa was good as differentiation between TD children and children with suspected SSD as well as amongst subgroups of SSD (articulation impairment, phonological delay and atypical speech development) was possible. However, accuracy of differentiation between TD children and children with SSD was affected by the cut-off criterion applied. Inter-rater reliability was found to be almost perfect for transcription and moderate for identification of phonological processes as well as for subgrouping. Again, agreement rates depended on the cut-off criterion chosen for the definition of a phonological pattern.
Conclusion
LogoFoVa was found to be a reliable and valid clinical tool for the identification and subgrouping of children with SSD in Danish SLP practice if a new cut-off criterion was applied.}

To describe the social needs of families screened by the Community Health Advocates Team (CHAT) Desk, situated within a pediatric emergency department (PED); and to evaluate the effectiveness of this help desk in connecting families to community resources.
Methods
Trained undergraduates, onsite in the PED 30 hours/week during daytime and evening hours, weekdays and weekends, screened a convenience sample of families of patients in the PED for social needs, and provided information on available community resources. Families were offered a follow-up phone call several weeks after their PED visit to assess program satisfaction and success, and identify remaining social needs.
Results
Between January 2019 and March 2020, CHAT Desk screened and assisted 682 families. CHAT routinely provided resources about free outdoor recreational activities for families, but after that, the most commonly provided informational resources pertained to: healthcare (n=200), housing (n=143), and food (n=137). Of families who completed the follow-up phone call (n=294), almost half (n=134, 46%) reported being able to contact at least one of the resources; 100 reported that the resource was able to assist them, and 99 families planned to continue using the resource. When asked about satisfaction, 93% (n=274) reported being very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with CHAT; 94% (n=276) said they would recommend it to others.
Conclusions
The PED of a busy tertiary care children's hospital is an opportune location to screen families for social needs, and provide them with information on requested community resources.}

The study then examined individual, family, and socioeconomic predictors of profile. Data were drawn from the Early Head Start Family and Child Experiences Study, a nationally-representative, prospective, longitudinal study of children assessed at ages 1, 2, and 3. The latent profile analyses suggested four distinct profiles of development at age 3: children who were well-adjusted, children with parent-reported behavior problems, children with staff-reported behavior problems, and children with multiple difficulties. Among the patterns of risk and protective factors, those in the profile with multiple difficulties were most likely to have missed early developmental milestones at age 1. Those in the parent-reported behavior problems profile experienced less supportive and more negative parenting, and had caregivers with higher levels of depressive symptoms than those who were well-adjusted. Those in the staff-reported behavior problems profile were more likely to be male as well as have higher levels of caregiver depressive symptoms. Overall, findings suggest unique patterns of risk factors for each profile, suggesting that interventions tailored to the precise needs of the family may be beneficial.}

Inter-talker variation in voice characteristics is traditionally seen as posing a challenge for infant language learners, who must disregard this variation when the task is to detect talkers’ shared linguistic conventions. However, talkers often differ markedly in their pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. This is true even in monolingual environments, given factors like gender, dialect, and proficiency. We therefore asked whether infants treat the voice characteristics distinguishing talkers as a cue for learning linguistic conventions that one talker may follow more closely than another. Supporting this previously untested hypothesis, 12-month-olds did not freely combine two talkers’ sentences distinguished by voice to more robustly learn the talkers’ shared grammar rules. Rather, they used this voice information to learn rules to which only one talker adhered, a finding replicated in same-aged infants with greater second language exposure. Both language groups generalized the rules to novel sentences produced by a novel talker. Voice characteristics can thus help infants learn and generalize talker-dependent linguistic structure, which pervades natural language. Results are interpreted in light of theories linking language learning with voice perception.}

Functional connectivity of the left frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical regions predicted reading speed. These results extend previous findings on the relationship between functional connectivity and reading competence in children, providing new evidence about such relationships in previously unexplored regions in the resting brain, including the left caudate, putamen and thalamus.

Given adult musicians’ perceptual and neural speech-in-noise enhancements, we asked whether similar effects are present in musically-trained children. We assessed the perception and subcortical processing of speech in noise and related cognitive abilities in musician and nonmusician children that were matched for a variety of overarching factors. Outcomes reveal that musicians’ advantages for processing speech in noise are present during pivotal developmental years. Supported by correlations between auditory working memory and attention and auditory brainstem response properties, we propose that musicians’ perceptual and neural enhancements are driven in a top-down manner by strengthened cognitive abilities with training. Our results may be considered by professionals involved in the remediation of language-based learning deficits, which are often characterized by poor speech perception in noise.}

abstract = {Foreign accent syndrome (FAS) is a rare condition which is placed in the mildest end of the spectrum of speech disorders. The impairment, not severe enough to elicit phonological errors, is associated with various alterations in the fine execution of speech sounds which cause the impression of foreignness. There is a growing interest in the study of linguistic and paralinguistic components, psychosocial aftermaths, and neural basis of FAS, but there are not yet neuroscience-driven treatments for this condition. A multimodal evaluation was conducted in a single patient with the aim of searching for clues which may assist to design neuroscience-driven therapies. The patient was a middle-aged bilingual woman who had chronic FAS. She had segmental deficits, abnormal production of linguistic and emotional prosody, impaired verbal communication, and reduced motivation and social engagement. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral small lesions mainly affecting the left deep frontal operculum and dorsal anterior insula. Diffusion tensor tractography suggested disrupted left deep frontal operculum-anterior insula connectivity. Metabolic activity measured with positron emission tomography was primarily decreased in key components of networks implicated in planning and execution of speech production, cognitive control and emotional communication (Brodmann’s areas 4/6/9/10/13/25/47, basal ganglia, and anterior cerebellar vermis). Compensatory increases of metabolic activity were found in cortical areas (left anterior cingulate gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus and right prefrontal cortex) associated with feedback and focal attention processes critical for monitoring and adjustment of verbal utterances. Moreover, bilateral structural and functional abnormalities probably interrupted the trajectory of the lateral and medial cholinergic pathways causing region-specific hypoactivity. The results from this study provide targets for further investigation and some clues to design therapeutic interventions.}

There are good reasons to expect such a relationship because learning to read involves learning the sounds of individual letters and possibly also sounds of strings of letters (e.g., spelling patterns). However, results from longitudinal studies have been mixed. A closer look at these studies suggests that PAL may be related to development of accuracy rather than speed in reading. This suggestion was investigated directly in the current longitudinal study. The study followed 137 students from Grade 0 (kindergarten) to Grade 5. In Grade 0, they completed measures of PAL, letter knowledge, phoneme awareness, and rapid automatized naming (RAN). In Grades 1 and 5, decoding accuracy was measured with the addition of decoding speed in Grade 5. PAL in Grade 0 was found to be a unique predictor of decoding accuracy in Grades 1 and 5 after controlling for Grade 0 letter knowledge, phoneme awareness, and RAN. PAL in Grade 0 even contributed to Grade 5 decoding accuracy after also controlling for Grade 1 decoding. Zero-order correlations between PAL and Grade 5 decoding speed were nonsignificant and close to zero. The results indicate that PAL measures a trait that may influence reading development over a substantial amount of time. Possible roles of PAL in decoding development over time are discussed, for example, how verbal learning may be a core component in the acquisition of associations between letter patterns (spelling patterns) and their pronunciation.}

To systematically assess the body of literature using N400 and P600 as they relate to people with aphasia. The primary aim was to reveal patterns in the literature which could be used to direct future research in the development of clinically relevant Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) for language assessment, while also identifying gaps in existing knowledge and highlight areas of further inquiry.
Methods
A literature search was performed on studies published before May 2021. Relevant studies on aphasia and the two ERPs of interest were assessed for quality, and the relationship between aphasia and these ERPs was explored.
Results
A total of 721 articles were identified, with 30 meeting inclusion criteria. Although there is significant variation in the literature, this scoping review revealed people with aphasia show reduced amplitude, delayed latency and different distribution compared to controls, and that ERPs are modulated by severity of aphasia.
Conclusions
To develop a relevant clinical tool for the management of aphasia, future research must strive to improve consistency within ERP methodology, with a greater number of diverse aphasia subtypes included in research.
Significance
This scoping review reveals N400 and P600 represent promising potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and ongoing management of aphasia.}

The purpose of this study was to investigate working memory in adults who do (AWS) and do not (AWNS) stutter using a visual N-back task. Processes involved in an N-back task include encoding, storing, rehearsing, inhibition, temporal ordering, and matching.
Methods
Fifteen AWS (11 males, 4 females; M = 23.27 years, SD = 5.68 years) and 15 AWNS (M = 23.47 years, SD = 6.21 years) were asked to monitor series of images and respond by pressing a “yes” button if the image they viewed was the same as the image one, two, or three trials back. Stimuli included images with phonologically similar (i.e., phonological condition) or phonologically dissimilar (i.e., neutral condition) names. Accuracy and manual reaction time (mRT) were analyzed.
Results
No difference was found between AWS and AWNS in accuracy. Furthermore, both groups were more accurate and significantly faster in 1- followed by 2- followed by 3-back trials. Finally, AWNS demonstrated faster mRT in the phonological compared to neutral condition, whereas AWS did not.
Conclusion
Results from this study suggest different processing mechanisms between AWS and AWNS for visually presented phonologically similar stimuli. Specifically, a phonological priming effect occurred in AWNS but not in AWS, potentially due to reduced spreading activation and organization in the mental lexicon of AWS. However, the lack of differences between AWS and AWNS across all N-back levels does not support deficits in AWS in aspects of working memory targeted through a visual N-back task; but, these results are preliminary and additional research is warranted.}

It involves top-down influences from higher cortical levels on lower-level auditory processes. Individuals with congenital amusia have impaired pitch processing with reduced connectivity between frontal and temporal regions. This study examined whether deficits in amusia would lead to impaired perceptual adaptation in lexical tone perception. Thirteen Mandarin-speaking amusics and 13 controls identified the category of target tones on an 8-step continuum ranging from rising to high-level, either in isolation or in a high-/low-pitched context. For tones with no context, amusics exhibited reduced categorical perception than controls. While controls’ lexical tone categorization demonstrated a significant context effect due to perceptual adaptation, amusics showed similar categorization patterns across both contexts. These findings suggest that congenital amusia impacts the extraction of context-dependent tonal categories in speech perception, indicating that perceptual adaptation may depend on listeners’ perceptual acuity.}

In this paper, which can be regarded as a partial replication of Krug and Schlüter (2013) study, I will reflect on this issue, basing my observations primarily on a survey carried out to identify the most common methods of data collection currently used in English empirical linguistics. For this purpose, the abstracts of 1,143 papers published in 2017 from 32 international and high impact journals were consulted, together with a sample of over 200 papers which were examined in their entirety. The journals were grouped according to seven subdisciplines, to see the extent to which there was a correlation between the method of data collection used and the nature of the subdiscipline in question. General findings were broadly as expected. Experimental studies were the most prevalent, followed by corpora, interviews, questionnaires, case studies, ethnographic projects, computer-mediated communication, observation and grammaticality judgement tests. However, in a fifth of all the studies considered it was not in fact clear what method of data collection had been used. The data also show that there was a correspondence between the subdiscipline, and the particular method of data collection used. Contrary to what could be expected, the combination of several research methods was infrequent.}

We used both unilateral and bilateral presentation modes, which allowed us to assess interhemispheric communications, and manipulated the morphological complexity of the stimuli. The results showed the following pattern: English speakers showed an RVFA for words and not for nonwords, with interhemispheric patterns suggesting independent LH processing and dependent RH processing of words. Hebrew speakers showed no visual field advantage in English, whereas they show an RVFA when they read Hebrew. Findings suggest that the division of labor between the two hemispheres is determined by linguistic experience, whereas the effects of morphological manipulations reflect the structure of the language of the test.}

abstract = {Adaptive interactions with the environment require optimal integration and segregation of sensory information. Yet, temporal misalignments in the presentation of visual and auditory stimuli may generate illusory phenomena such as the sound-induced flash illusion, in which a single flash paired with multiple auditory stimuli induces the perception of multiple illusory flashes. This phenomenon has been shown to be robust and resistant to feedback training. According to a Bayesian account, this is due to a statistically optimal combination of the signals operated by the nervous system. From this perspective, individual susceptibility to the illusion might be moulded through prolonged experience. For example, repeated exposure to the illusion and prolonged training sessions partially impact on the reported illusion. Therefore, extensive and immersive audio-visual experience, such as first-person shooter videogames, should sharpen individual capacity to correctly integrate multisensory information over time, leading to more veridical perception. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the temporal profile of the sound-induced illusion in a group of expert first-person shooter gamers and a non-players group. In line with the hypotheses, gamers experience significantly narrower windows of illusion (~87 ms) relative to non-players (~105 ms), leading to higher veridical reports in gamers (~68%) relative to non-players (~59%). Moreover, according to recent literature, we tested whether audio-visual intensive training in gamers could be related to the incidence of migraine, and found that its severity may be directly proportioned to the time spent on videogames. Overall, these results suggest that continued training within audio-visual environments such as first-person shooter videogames improves temporal discrimination and sensory integration. This finding may pave the way for future therapeutic strategies based on self-administered multisensory training. On the other hand, the impact of intensive training on visual-related stress disorders, such as migraine incidence, should be taken into account as a risk factor during therapeutic planning.}

abstract = {Background:
Pause duration analysis is a common feature in the study of discourse in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) since this patient group has shown a consistent trend for longer pauses in comparison to healthy controls. This speech feature may also be helpful for early detection; however, studies involving patients at the pre-clinical, high-risk phase of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) have yielded varying results.
Objective:
To characterize the probability density distribution of speech pause durations in 26 patients with AD, 57 amnestic multi-domain amnestic MCI patients (29 with memory encoding deficits, a-mdMCI-E, and 28 with retrieval impairment only, a-mdMCI-R) and 29 healthy controls (HC) in order assess whether there are significant differences between them. To explore the potential differences in pause production between patients with a-mdMCI-E and a-mdMCI-R, as the former are considered to be at higher risk of progressing to dementia.
Methods:
The 112 picture-based oral narratives obtained were manually transcribed and annotated for the automatic extraction and analysis of pause durations. Different probability distributions were tested for the fitting of pause durations while truncating shorter ranges. Recent findings in the field of Statistics were considered in order to avoid the inherent methodological uncertainty that this type of analysis entails by addressing the question of temporal thresholding and its potential repercussions on inter-annotator reliability in manual transcriptions.
Results:
A lognormal distribution (LND) explained the distribution of pause duration for all groups. Its fitted parameters (μ, σ) followed a gradation from the group with shorter durations and a higher tendency to produce short pauses (HC) to the group with longer pause durations and a considerably higher tendency to produce long pauses with greater variance (AD). Importantly, a-mdMCI-E produced significantly longer pauses and with greater variability than their a-mdMCI-R counterparts (α=0.05).
Conclusion:
We report significant differences at the group level in pause distribution across all groups of study that could be used in future diagnostic tools and discuss the clinical implications of these findings, particularly regarding the characterization of a-mdMCI.}

Participants read predictive stories in English that made a genitive construction consisting of a third-person singular possessive pronoun and a kinship noun (e.g., his mother) likely in an upcoming continuation. The possessive pronoun's form depended on the antecedent's natural gender, which had been previously established in the stories. The continuation included either the expected genitive construction or an unexpected one with a possessive pronoun of the opposite gender. We manipulated crosslinguistic (dis)similarity by comparing advanced English learners with either Swedish or Spanish as their L1. While Swedish has equivalent possessive pronouns that mark the antecedent's natural gender (i.e., hans/hennes “his/her”), Spanish does not. In fact, Spanish possessive pronouns mark the syntactic features (number, gender) of the possessed noun (e.g., nosotros queremos a nuestra madre “we-MASC love our-FEM mother-FEM). Twenty-four native speakers of English elicited an N400 effect for prenominal possessives that were unexpected based on the possessor noun's natural gender, consistent with the possibility that they activated the pronoun's form or its semantic features (natural gender). Thirty-two Swedish-speaking learners yielded a qualitatively and quantitatively native-like N400 for unexpected prenominal possessives. In contrast, twenty-five Spanish-speaking learners showed a P600 effect for unexpected possessives, consistent with the possibility that they experienced difficulty integrating a pronoun that mismatched the expected gender. Results suggest that differences with respect to the features encoded in the activated representation result in different predictive mechanisms among adult L2 learners.}

We compared the effects of diacritics that provide transparent but less familiar information and vowel letters that increase orthographic transparency without compromising familiarity. Brain activation was measured in 18 adults during oral reading of single words, while manipulating the presence of diacritic marks, the presence of a vowel letter, and word length (3 vs. 4 consonants). We found opposite effects of diacritics and vowel letters on temporo-parietal regions associated with mapping orthography to phonology. The increase in activation for diacritic marks and the decrease in activation for vowel letters in these regions suggest that the greater familiarity of vowel letters compared to diacritics overrides the effect of orthographic transparency. Vowel letters also reduced activation in regions associated with semantic processing in unpointed words, and were thus distinct from the effect of an additional consonant. Altogether the results suggest that both orthographic transparency and familiarity contribute to word recognition.}

abstract = {The origin of developmental delay and the gap between achievement and intellectual ability is clearer to be seen by the age of 9 as young primary student. This study examined cognitive processing of children with reading disabilities based of Luria's three functional units of brain which are Planning, Attention, Simultaneous and Successive (PASS). Cognitive Assessment System (CAS) is capable of measuring the PASS cognitive processing, while Wide Range Achievement Test 4 (WART-4) was used to determine reading processes. CAS and WRAT were administered individually to 50 ESL poor readers in standard 3 at Sekolah Kebangsaan Bandar Tun Hussein Onn (SKBTHO). Profiles of the CAS and WRAT-4 were obtained, while the specific weakness of cognitive processing and reading processes were detected from the children with ESL reading difficulties. There were distinct PASS cognitive profiles among the poor readers of ESL children and gender was not the determinant. The PASS scale standard scores showed 41% (n=20) is at average level, 30% (n=16) is at low average level, 26% (n=13) is at below average level and only 2% (n=1) is at well below average level. There was no significant different between girls and boys in term of cognitive processing. However, girl subjects scored higher on Planning and Attention processing while boy subjects scored higher on Simultaneous and Successive processing. Overall, the poor ESL readers were significantly low for Simultaneous processing. Result of WRAT-4 indicated the subjects have low scores on comprehension (M = 66.64; SD = 5.12) and spelling (M = 68.00; SD = 12.07). Analysis correlation was used to indicate the relationship of cognitive processes and reading processes. There was significant relationship between PASS cognitive processing and reading composite (r = .382, p < .01) especially on word reading (r = .447, p < .01). The specific cognitive processes of planning and successive had significant relationship with word reading (r = .351, p < .05; r = .286, p < .05) respectively. While attention processing was significantly negative correlated with comprehension (r = -.296, p < .01). The simultaneous processing was significantly correlated with reading composite (r = .321, p < .05). No significant correlation between the spelling and the PASS cognitive processing was found. However, planning process was significantly correlated with the attention and successive processes (r = .516, p < .01; r = .338, p < .05) among the subjects. Reasons for this finding are suggested in the discussion and intervention was proposed that might help abilities of particular cognitive processing in enhancing reading processes.}

Here, we measured ERPs in response to known words, pseudowords and nonwords in 24-month-old French-learning children to investigate how individual vocabulary skills contribute to the processing of native-like and non-native-like words during a listening task. The N200 was more pronounced for pseudowords than for nonwords while no difference was found between known words and pseudowords. The amplitude difference between known words and pseudowords was, however, correlated with the productive vocabulary. Toddlers with a higher vocabulary score exhibited a bigger difference than toddlers with a lower vocabulary score. Similarly for the frontally distributed late negativity, only those toddlers with higher vocabulary knowledge exhibited a gradient pattern of activity in response to three word types while children with lower vocabulary skills exhibited a similar responsiveness to each word type. Our results suggest that vocabulary skills contribute to the magnitudes of brain signals in response to native and non-native words in a non-referential listening task.}

We used thematic analysis to analyze interview data from 15 Latinx parents who expressed concerns about their child’s (age 6–13) worry or sadness. Analyses revealed that Latinx parents often have difficulty identifying mental health problems, report stigma about mental health problems and help-seeking and want more information about how they can help their children. Although Latinx parents report significant mental health and treatment-seeking stigma, the majority were open to seeking mental health services for their children or were already receiving services.

We recently showed that sensitivity to morphological information in adult English readers is associated with the ventral reading pathways, bilaterally. It remains unclear, however, whether this association is specific to the English writing system. To shed light on this question, we investigated whether the associations between the ventral reading pathways and morphological sensitivity to word structure generalize across languages with different orthographies and morphological systems. To this end, we assessed neurocognitive correlations between white matter structural properties and morphological sensitivity in Hebrew, a Semitic language where morphemes are combined in a non-linear manner. We used diffusion MRI (dMRI) to segment ventral and dorsal tracts of interest in a sample of 43 adult Hebrew readers, who also completed a behavioral language assessment battery that included a morphological task. Significant correlations were found between morphological sensitivity and properties of bilateral ventral, but not dorsal, tracts. These correlations remained significant after controlling for measures of vocabulary and word reading, demonstrating their specificity to the morphological task. The current findings in Hebrew show striking similarity to prior findings in English. Our results support the view that morphological information contributes to lexical access along the ventral pathways, across orthographies and morphological systems.}

While reading Mandarin Chinese, the control group showed a left-hemispheric specialization within the 400–600ms interval in delta synchronization. However, delta synchronizations were widely distributed in all scalp regions and lasted longer than 600ms in the AS group. One possible interpretation of our data is the hypothesis that the AS group has more difficulty in brain organization of semantic and syntactic processes than the control group when reading their native language, because Chinese syntactic structure requires more work to be done by the perceiver. Nevertheless, other brain mechanisms (e.g., top-down regulation), can partially compensate for this difficulty, allowing AS subjects to attain the same level of response activity as the controls.}

We further examine whether the type of inhibition that influences phonological representation is domain-specific or domain-general. Native French speakers read aloud sentences with words containing a voiced stop that either have a voicing neighbor (target) or not (control). The duration of pre-voicing was measured. Participants similarly performed a lexical decision task on versions of these target and matched control words whose pre-voicing duration was manipulated. Lastly, participants performed linguistic and non-linguistic inhibition tasks. Results indicate that the lower speakers' linguistic or non-linguistic inhibition is, the easier it is for them to recognize words with a voiceless neighbor when these words have a shorter, intermediate, pre-voicing rather than a longer one. Inhibitory skill did not predict recognition time for control words, indicating that the effect was due to the greater activation of the voiceless neighbor. Inhibition did not predict pre-voicing duration in production. These results indicate that individual differences in cognitive skills can influence phonological representations in speech perception.}

abstract = {Background
In jargonaphasia, speech is fluent but meaningless. While neuropsychological evaluation may distinguish a neologistic component characterised by non-word production and a semantic component where pronounced words are real but speech is senseless, how this relates to the underlying white matter anatomy is debated.
Objective
To identify white matter pathways causally involved in jargonaphasia.
Methods
We retrospectively screened the intraoperative brain mapping data of 571 awake oncological resections using direct cortico-subcortical electrostimulation. Jargonaphasia was induced in 17 patients (19 sites) during a naming task. Stimulation sites were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template space and used to generate individual disconnectome maps. Non-parametric voxelwise one and two sample t-tests were performed to identify the underlying white matter anatomy.
Results
Jargonaphasia was induced only during stimulation of the left hemisphere. No cortical stimulation generated jargonaphasia. Subcortical sites causally associated with jargonaphasia clustered in 3 regions: in the temporal lobe (middle to inferior temporal gyri; n = 12), in the parietal lobe (supramarginal gyrus; n = 3) and in the temporal stem (n = 4). Disconnectome analysis indicated the inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) was damaged in both neologistic and semantic jargonaphasia, while the involvement of the arcuate fasciculus was specific to neologistic jargonaphasia.
Conclusion
For the first time, we show that jargonaphasia is induced by white matter stimulation, hinting at disconnection. As IFOF disconnection unites both variants, these may represent a continuum of disorders distinguished by semantic impairment. Conversely, damage to the arcuate fasciculus in addition to the IFOF is specific to neologistic jargonaphasia, thus suggesting a dual-disconnection syndrome.}

Clinical validation of the Spanish version of the Mississippi Aphasia Screening Test (MASTsp) as a screening test for language disorders in patients who have suffered a stroke.
Materials and methods
A total of 29 patients who had suffered a stroke and had aphasia after a left hemispheric lesion were evaluated with the MASTsp, the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination and the token test at baseline and after six months of rehabilitation. Two expert speech-therapists evaluated twelve aphasic patients to determine the inter-observer reliability. This sample was assessed twice in the same week to analyse the reproducibility of the test (test–retest reliability). Aphasic patients were compared with a matched sample of non-aphasic patients with vascular lesions in the right hemisphere (n=29) and a group of healthy subjects (n=60) stratified by age and educational level.
Results
The MASTsp showed a good convergent validity, interobserver validity, test–retest reliability and a moderate sensitivity to detect changes over time. A diagnostic cut-off <90 on the MASTsp total test score is proposed.
Conclusions
The MASTsp is a valid tool for the detection and monitoring of language problems in patients with stroke.

Doce de los pacientes afásicos fueron evaluados por dos logopedas expertos para comprobar la fiabilidad interobservador. Este mismo grupo (n=12) fue evaluado en dos ocasiones en la misma semana para comprobar la fiabilidad test-retest. Como grupo control se seleccionó una muestra pareada de sujetos no afásicos con lesión vascular en el hemisferio derecho (n=29) y un grupo de sujetos sanos (n=60) estratificado por edad y nivel educativo.
Resultados
El MASTsp mostró una adecuada validez convergente y fiabilidad (interobservador y test-retest), siendo parcialmente sensible a detectar cambios a lo largo del tiempo. Se sugiere un punto de corte diagnóstico < 90 en la puntuación total de la prueba.
Conclusiones
El MASTsp es una medida válida para la detección y el seguimiento de los problemas de lenguaje en pacientes con ictus.}

abstract = {Objective
The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a Nordic Auditory Verbal (AV) intervention for children with all degrees and types of hearing impairment (HI) using all kinds of hearing technology. A first specific objective was to identify differences and similarities in early vocabulary development between children with cochlear implant (CI) compared with children with hearing aids (HAs)/Bone anchored hearing aids (Bahs) enrolled in a 3-year AVprogram, and to compare the group of children with HI to a control group of children with normal hearing (NH). A second specific objective was to study universal neonatal hearing screening (UNHS) using the 1-3-6 Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) guidelines.
Introduction
Effect of AV intervention for children with HI using different hearing technology is not thoroughly studied. It is relevant to question, whether children with mild to moderate HI encounter the same intensive need for AV intervention as children with congenital deafness.
Methods
A longitudinal and comparative study design was used involving two cohorts of children, i.e. 36 children with CI and 19 children with HA/Bahs. The children were the first in Denmark to receive a 3-year AV intervention by formally trained AV-practitioners. Children were tested annually with standardized speech and language tests, i.e. Peabody Picture Vocabulary test, Reynell test and a Danish test for active vocabulary, Viborgmaterialet. Categorical variables were compared using Fischer's exact test and continuous variables were compared using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, as data was not normally distributed.
Results
Median age of diagnosis was 6 months and median age at intervention was 13 and 12 months respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of scores according to age equivalency for the three tests. However, there was a significant difference between children with HI regardless of hearing technology and children with NH.
Conclusion
Children with HI progressed over a three-year period, but they did not reach the same level as children with NH. The high completion rate of 98,2% of families over a three-year period indicates the relevance of AV practice in a Nordic country. Children were diagnosed later than 3 months and intervention also started later than recommended. A result that warrants further investigation.}

abstract = {To examine the influence of age and reading proficiency on the development of the spoken language network, we tested 6- and 9-years-old children listening to native and foreign sentences in a slow event-related fMRI paradigm. We observed a stable organization of the peri-sylvian areas during this time period with a left dominance in the superior temporal sulcus and inferior frontal region. A year of reading instruction was nevertheless sufficient to increase activation in regions involved in phonological representations (posterior superior temporal region) and sentence integration (temporal pole and pars orbitalis). A top-down activation of the left inferior temporal cortex surrounding the visual word form area, was also observed but only in 9year-olds (3years of reading practice) listening to their native language. These results emphasize how a successful cultural practice, reading, slots in the biological constraints of the innate spoken language network.}

Early identification may significantly reduce this burden but relevant tools largely lack validation. We aimed to develop and evaluate the predictive validity of a simple screening tool for neurodevelopmental problems in a community sample of 30 month old children. A sample of children was selected from a community cohort screened at 30 months by health visitors using the Sure Start Language Measure (SSLM) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in 2011. Predictive validity was assessed by comparing screening results with detailed psychometric data from the same sample 1–2 years later. Screening performance using different thresholds was explored using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) with ROC area under the curve (AUC) and bootstrapping techniques. The SSLM predicted both language disorder identified by the New Reynell Developmental Language Scales (NRDLS) at follow-up (AUC 0.905) and global developmental delay assessed by the Griffiths Mental Development Scales (AUC 0.983). The SDQ administered at 30 months predicted psychiatric disorders identified by the Development and Wellbeing Assessment (DAWBA) at follow-up (AUC 0.821). Using optimal cut-offs for the SDQ and SSLM at 30 months, both tools together had sensitivity 87%; specificity 64%; positive predictive value 31%; and negative predictive value 97% in the prediction of any kind of neurodevelopmental problem 1–2 years later. The combined measure reported here is not yet sufficient as a stand-alone population screening tool for neurodevelopmental disorders. The SSLM and SDQ did however show promise in identifying preschool children at risk of ongoing language, psychiatric disorders and global developmental delay 1–2 years later but with fairly high false positive rates. Given that current developmental risk prediction in resource-poor settings is little better than random assignment, the SDQ and SSLM may aid clinical judgement when used as interim triage tools for practitioners with no specialist knowledge, in the context of longitudinal follow-up arrangements.}

abstract = {Background
The Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) is a standardized comprehensive developmental assessment tool for children aged 0–68 months. However, few Asia-based studies have explored cultural and linguistic adaptations of the MSEL or investigated its psychometric properties in populations with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Aims
This study evaluated the reliability and validity of the MSEL-Taiwan version (MSEL-T) for Taiwanese children with ASD, global developmental delay (GDD), and typical development (TD).
Methods and procedures
The MSEL items were translated and modified according to the language and culture in Taiwan. In total, 191 children (ASD, 69; GDD, 36; and TD, 86) aged 19–68 months were assessed using the MSEL-T and Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2 (PDMS-2) at enrollment, followed by the assessments of Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-Chinese version (VABS-C) at the age of 36 months or later.
Outcomes and results
All subscales were verified to have good interrater reliability and internal consistency, and subscale scores indicated moderate to high correlations with PDMS-2 and VABS-C scores. Significant differences in MSEL-T scores were observed between same-aged pairs of children with TD and GDD and between pairs of children with TD and ASD.
Conclusions and implications
The findings provide evidence of validity and reliability of the MSEL-T. And it is suggested that the culturally and linguistically adapted MSEL-T is a good tool for the clinical assessment of children with and without ASD.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
We provide a case analysis for a 28-year-old, native Dutch-speaking lady who developed Foreign Accent Syndrome (FAS), a few weeks after falling down the staircase. In addition to FAS, which gave the impression she spoke with a German accent, German(-like) words and structures occurred. Speech symptoms were aggravated by increased stress, fatigue or emotional pressure, and this triggered jargon speech. It was hypothesized her FAS and jargon developed on a functional basis.
Methods
In-depth analyses of the patient’s medical background, neuropsychological and neurolinguistic tests and psychodiagnostic exams were done. The patient participated in an fMRI experiment. In a syllable repetition paradigm, motor speech activations were compared to those of healthy individuals, to see whether they were altered, which would be expected in case of a neurological etiology.
Results
Medical history disclosed prior traumatic experiences for which she sought help, but no neurological incidents. Repeated neuropsychological and neurolinguistic tests showed deficits in recent memory and executive functioning. The patient demonstrated great difficulties with picture naming. Clinically, language switching and mixing as well as recurring jargon speech was found. Formal psychodiagnostic tests did not identify a clear disorder, but psychodiagnostic interviews were consistent with a DSM-5 conversion disorder. The fMRI study demonstrated that speech network activations corresponded to those found in healthy participants.
Conclusion
The clinical neurolinguistic characteristics, outcome of the fMRI experiment, together with the clinical psychodiagnostic findings were strongly indicative for an underlying functional etiology for the FAS and jargon speech, presenting as symptoms of conversion disorder.}

We then examined whether these data-driven participant groupings were associated with improvement in inhibitory control. Latent class mixture modeling was conducted both with reaction time and a measure of response accuracy (d’) of log data. Results indicated two distinct classes based on reaction time, and four classes based on response accuracy over the course of training. Class membership based on reaction time was associated with differential improvements in performance on a subsequent standardized measure of inhibitory control. The findings point towards the need for formative metrics of progress, as well as the need for more adaptive and user-centered cognitive skills interventions. Our findings suggest that there may be some utility in analyzing log data as an indicator of student engagement, particularly when used in complement with more traditional measures of performance.}

From a more clinical point of view, cross-linguistic studies should specifically focus on the relationship between speech disorders and speech intelligibility. The aim of this opinion article is to identify the currently scarce theoretical and clinical avenues for cross-linguistic studies of dysarthria in Parkinson’s disease, and to establish guidelines that would lead future research in this direction. In turn, the practical and behavioral management of dysarthria in Parkinson’s disease has so far only focused on the ‘universal’ dimensions of speech production and feedback (e.g., treatment of loudness and dysprosody). Such approaches could benefit immensely from proper recommendations that would be more ‘language-driven’ and individually adapted to the patients’ language environment. An additional factor to consider for a better understanding and treatment of dysarthria in PD is the role of adjustment and cultural identity.}

The study comprised 247 students, 185 females and 62 males (Mage = 28.27, SD = 8.22), who completed online forms of the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), and the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). The participants' social anxiety was positively correlated (at medium to strong size) with their impostor expressions. Perceived parental care was indirectly associated with the students' impostor expressions through social anxiety for mothers and fathers, meaning that the sample's students who perceived their parents as less caring exhibited greater impostor expressions because they were more socially anxious. Also, perceived paternal overprotection was associated with the students' impostor expressions through social anxiety. Namely, students who perceived their fathers as more overprotective had greater impostor expressions because they were more socially anxious. The etiological significances and applied implications of these findings are discussed.}

However, advances in the field have failed to match the more general research on emotion and learning in psychology and education that has proven beneficial for understanding a broad range of emotions experienced in educational settings and has direct implications for classroom teaching. Specifically, the control-value theory (CVT) of achievement emotion, which addresses the origins and functions of diverse emotions in education, has gained strong momentum and emerged as a useful theoretical framework, although it is largely unknown and unused by L2 researchers. The present article aims to introduce the concept of achievement emotions into the L2 context and bridge the gaps between these two fields of emotion research. We first review research on emotions in second language acquisition (SLA) and identify crucial areas for improvement. Then, we discuss theory, measurement, and empirical studies related to the construct of achievement emotions. In conclusion, we call for an integration of research on achievement emotions with the field of emotions and instructed SLA and highlight the potential benefits of such an endeavor.}

Configural and partial metric invariance was also established across both groups. Furthermore, an ANCOVA was used to show that perceptions of resources and perceptions of inclusive teaching practices are positively interrelated.

On the other hand, at least some scientific findings seem to support the effectiveness and sustainability of training for higher brain functions such as attention and working memory. In the present paper we provide a tectonic integration and synthesis of cognitive training approaches. Specifically, we sketch the relative merits and shortcomings of these programs, which often appeal to parents who must choose between side-effect-laden medication and other less conventional options. Here we examine how neuroplasticity allows the healthy as well the impaired to benefit from cognitive training programs. We evaluate the evidence and consider whether brain training can be a stand-alone treatment or an adjunct to pharmacotherapy, outline promising future prospects, and highlight what training outcomes are plausible in line with available data.

Twenty-three native speakers of English read short contexts including three Noun Phrases (NPs) (e.g., Either an adviser or an agent can be helpful to a banker), followed by a wh-question that established the discourse role of each referent (In your opinion, which of the two should a banker hire?). The NP that the question was about (banker) was the Topic, and the two NPs that could fill the slot opened by the wh-question (adviser, agent) were the Focus NPs. The participants’ brain activity was recorded with EEG while they read the responses to the wh-questions, which differed along two dimensions: (1) the availability of the it-cleft construction (In my opinion, [it is] an agent…), a Focus-devoted device that makes Focus assignment predictable in the response; and (2) the discourse role of the target noun (Focus, Topic), which corresponds to the first referent in the response (In my opinion, [it is] an agent/a banker…). Crucially, we manipulated the phonological properties of the Focus and Topic nouns such that, if the Topic noun began with a consonant (e.g., a banker), both nouns that could fill the slot opened by the wh-question began with a vowel (e.g., an agent, an adviser) (counterbalanced in the overall design). This allowed us to measure effects of prediction at the prenominal article, before the integration of semantic and discourse information took place. The analyses on prenominal articles revealed an N400 effect for articles that were unexpected based on the phonological properties of the Focus nouns, but only in the conditions with the it-cleft. This effect emerged between 250 and 400 ms, with a frontal bias. The analyses on the noun revealed that violations of information structure (i.e., cases where the it-cleft was followed by the Topic noun) yielded a broadly distributed P600 effect, relative to appropriately clefted (i.e., focused) nouns. A similar (but numerically less robust) effect emerged for Topic relative to Focus NPs in the conditions without the it-cleft, suggesting that, in the absence of a constraining cue, comprehenders still assigned Focus to the first referent in the response. Overall, these results suggest that, when reading answers to wh-questions, comprehenders use information structure constraints (i.e., prior context + the it-cleft) to anticipate the form that the response should take (i.e., how information should be packaged).}

abstract = {Objective
Without the current option of a dementia cure, there is an existing need to focus on rehabilitation intervention. This includes interventions that address language and communication impairment (LCI), found to be present early in most types of dementia. Assessment of LCI can occur in many contexts (e.g., speech pathology, neuropsychology, occupational therapy) and is a vital initial step in providing adequate support to people living with dementia and their families. However, no previous research has compared the psychometric properties and utility of currently available and suitable tools for this purpose.
Methods
Eighteen tools with the potential to assess language and communication in dementia were identified through a two-stage process, and a synthesis of evidence is provided.
Results
Three tools satisfied all selection criteria: the Arizona Battery for Communication Disorders of Dementia, the Sydney Language Battery, and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III. Main limitations of the 18 tools reviewed concern a lack of standardization, normative data, and criterion validity, as well as poor evidence of reliability of tools originally developed for non-neurodegenerative LCI (e.g., aphasia in the context of cerebrovascular accidents). Furthermore, no tool considers the perspectives of people with dementia regarding the impact of LCI on their daily lives.
Conclusion
Further research is needed to improve reliability and validity of currently available tools for the linguistic assessment of people living with dementia. Importantly, a tool to assess early identification of language and communication difficulties and associated needs among people with dementia is warranted to facilitate timely management and support.}

We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to examine associations between prenatal PBDE concentrations and functional connectivity of a reading-related network (RN) in a community sample of 5-year-old children (N = 33). Maternal serum PBDE concentrations (∑PBDE) were measured at 12.2 ± 2.8 weeks gestation (mean ± SD). The RN was defined by 12 regions identified in prior task-based fMRI meta-analyses; global efficiency (GE) was used to measure network integration. Linear regression evaluated associations between ∑PBDE, word reading, and GE of the RN and the default mode network (DMN); the latter to establish specificity of findings. Weighted quantile sum regression analyses evaluated the contributions of specific PBDE congeners to observed associations. Greater RN efficiency was associated with better word reading in these novice readers. Children with higher ∑PBDE showed reduced GE of the RN; ∑PBDE was not associated with DMN efficiency, demonstrating specificity of our results. Consistent with prior findings, ∑PBDE was not associated word reading at 5-years-old. Altered efficiency and integration of the RN may underlie associations between ∑PBDE concentrations and reading problems observed previously in older children.}

abstract = {We explored the acquisition of three types of second language (L2) words in a paired–associates learning task. Seventy–six Polish participants were presented with 24 nonwords paired with pictures; they completed 8 interleaving test blocks of form production and meaning recognition, both followed by feedback. The nonwords included “cognates” (nonwords resembling the Polish word for the object depicted in a given picture), “false cognates” (resembling a different Polish word than depicted), and “non–cognates” (nonwords different from Polish words). We measured the learning trajectories for all word types across the blocks. Cognates were fastest to learn in the recognition blocks as well as in the production blocks. Compared to non–cognates, false cognates were learned equally fast in the recognition blocks, but faster in the production blocks. This suggests the learning of false cognates benefits from the overlap in L1–L2 form and is not harmed by L1 interference, while the learning of cognates benefits from both form overlap and conceptual overlap. The study is unique as it examines how learners acquire both the form of new words, and the link between the L2 forms and their meanings. It also explores the dynamics of the learning process.}

The influence of Parental Educational Status (PES) on cognitive performance has been confirmed in several studies.
Objective
The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between PES and several domains of cognitive functioning and examine, through mediation analyses, the relationship between PES, language, and cognitive tasks.
Method
We first administered tasks measuring memory, executive and attentional abilities to 64 European native French speakers, divided into two groups of children according to parents’ educational status.
Results
The results suggest that, on most tasks, the effect of socio-educational status is mediated by language abilities. However, because the results were less clear for executive functions, we carried out a second experiment in which we administered more specific executive measures (i.e. inhibition, cognitive flexibility, updating and reasoning) to 80 children.
Conclusion
The results confirmed the influence of the parents’ educational status on the executive functioning and also that, contrary to other cognitive functions, this influence on executive tasks is not completely explained by language differences.
Résumé
Cette étude vise à explorer l’influence du niveau éducationnel parental sur le fonctionnement cognitif chez des enfants en âge scolaire. Dans la première étude, nous avons tout d’abord administré des tâches qui évaluent les capacités attentionnelles, exécutives et mnésiques chez 64 enfants francophones répartis en deux groupes en fonction du niveau éducationnel de leurs parents. Les résultats montrent que, pour la plupart des tâches, l’effet du niveau socioéducationnel est expliqué par les capacités langagières de ces enfants. Dans une seconde étude, nous avons exploré les capacités d’inhibition, de flexibilité cognitive, de mise à jour et de raisonnement de 80 enfants également répartis en deux groupes. Les résultats confirment l’influence du niveau socioéducationnel parental sur le fonctionnement exécutif. En outre, ces résultats montrent que cette influence n’est pas totalement expliquée par des différences langagières.}

To account for these findings, Bastiaanse et al. (2011) formulated the PAst DIscourse LInking Hypothesis (PADILIH), in line with Avrutin's (2000) claim that discourse linking is impaired in Broca's aphasia. Past forms are impaired in opposition to non-past forms due to the fact that the former are discourse linked. However, this hypothesis entails further predictions: if the problem with tense is restricted to discourse linking, we expect present and future forms to be spared or, at least, damaged to the same extent. In this paper, we investigate time reference in Catalan and Spanish using a sentence completion task with pictures and a sentence-to-picture-matching task (adapted from the TART; Bastiaanse et al., 2008). The results confirm the predicted deficit: forms referring to the past are more impaired than forms referring to non-past, that is, tenses referring to the present and future were better preserved. However, in comprehension, asymmetries arise between present and future forms. Implications for the PADILIH are discussed.}

To explore the differences in sensory processing between children with hearing impairments and children with normal hearing and the variables that influence sensory processing disorder (SPD).
Methods
The sensory processing abilities of 90 children were compared in three age-matched groups of 30, with cochlear implants (CIs), hearing aids (HAs), and normal hearing (NH). The Arabic Sensory Profile (Arabic_SP) was used.
Results
Findings were presented in the Arabic_SP section and factor levels. Sections: The NH group performed better (p < .05) than the CI group in 57% of the sections and better than the HA group in 14%. The CI group exhibited more signs of SPD than the HA group with vestibular processing, multisensory processing, and emotional-social responses. Factors: The NH group differed from the CI group on all the factors that showed significance and from the HA group with inattention/distractibility and poor registration. There were great differences between the CI and the HA groups on all the factors except with poor registration and fine motor/perceptual. Hearing loss variables that most affected results in the Arabic_SP were the age at receiving a hearing device and type of hearing loss onset.
Conclusion
Along with speech and language problems, children with hearing impairment are especially vulnerable to SPD. Children with CIs and HAs are increasingly susceptible to auditory processing disorders. Higher risks of balance, multisensory processing, social-emotional, and fine motor problems are in children with CIs. Increased SPD risks came with a higher age at implantation. Findings indicate the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for early detection and intervention for children with hearing impairment, especially those with CIs.}

The current study investigated the time course of talker normalization in typical listeners and individuals with congenital amusia, a neurodevelopmental disorder of refined pitch processing. We examined the event-related potentials (ERPs) underling lexical tone processing in 24 Cantonese-speaking amusics and 24 typical listeners (controls) in two conditions: blocked-talker and mixed-talker conditions. The results demonstrated that for typical listeners, effects of talker variability can be observed as early as in the N1 time-window (100–150 ms), with the N1 amplitude reduced in the mixed-talker condition. Significant effects were also found in later components: the N2b/c peaked significantly earlier and the P3a and P3b amplitude was enhanced in the blocked-talker condition relative to the mixed-talker condition, especially for the tone pair that is more difficult to discriminate. These results suggest that the blocked-talker mode of stimulus presentation probably facilitates auditory processing and requires less attentional effort with easier speech categorization than the mixed-talker condition, providing neural evidence for the “active control theory”. On the other hand, amusics exhibited comparable N1 amplitude to controls in both conditions, but deviated from controls in later components. They demonstrated overall later N2b/c peak latency significantly reduced P3a amplitude in the blocked-talker condition and reduced P3b amplitude irrespective of talker conditions. These results suggest that the amusic brain was intact in the auditory processing of talker normalization processes, as reflected by the comparable N1 amplitude, but exhibited reduced automatic attentional switch to tone changes in the blocked-talker condition, as captured by the reduced P3a amplitude, which presumably underlies a previously reported perceptual “anchoring” deficit in amusics. Altogether, these findings revealed the time course of talker normalization processes in typical listeners and extended the finding that conscious pitch processing is impaired in the amusic brain.}

Participants heard sentences which contained a highly predictable word (e.g., cloud, following The tourists expected rain when the sun went behind the …), and viewed an array of objects containing a target object which corresponded to the predictable word [cloud; Japanese: kumo], an English competitor object whose English name was phonologically related to the predictable word [clown; piero], a Japanese competitor object whose Japanese name was phonologically related to the Japanese translation of the predictable word [bear; kuma], or an object that was unrelated to the predictable word [globe; tikyuugi]. Both L1 and L2 speakers looked predictively at the target object, but L2 speakers were slower than L1 speakers. L1 speakers looked predictively at the English competitor object, but L2 speakers did not do so predictively. Neither group looked at the Japanese competitor object more than the unrelated object.

To examine whether these sex differences arise from distinct processes, we compared developmental trajectories of each evoked-response component and tested their ability to predict a participant's sex and age. We find that some subcortical sex differences emerge well after the cochlea is mature and that each measure uniquely contributes to predicting participant demographics, indicating that sex differences arise from multiple central auditory processes.}

Here we manipulated language familiarity to test the hypothesis that phonological experience affects voice discrimination via mediating the engagement of multiple perceptual and cognitive resources. The results showed that during voice discrimination, the activation of several prefrontal regions was modulated by language familiarity. More importantly, the same effect was observed concerning the functional connectivity from the fronto-parietal network to the voice-identity network (VIN), and from the default mode network to the VIN. Our findings indicate that phonological experience could bias the recruitment of cognitive control and information retrieval/comparison processes during voice discrimination. Therefore, the study unravels the neural substrates subserving the modulation effect of phonological experience on voice discrimination, and provides new insights into studying voice discrimination from the perspective of network interactions.}

The best fitting models were then used to assess the relationship between working memory and nonverbal measures of fluid reasoning (Gf) and visual processing (Gv) intelligence. One hundred sixty-eight English-speaking 7–9year olds with typical development, from three states, participated. Results showed that Cowan’s three-factor embedded processes model fit the data slightly better than Baddeley and Hitch’s (1974) three-factor model (specified according to Baddeley, 1986) and decisively better than Baddeley’s (2000) four-factor model that included an episodic buffer. The focus of attention factor in Cowan’s model was a significant predictor of Gf and Gv. The results suggest that the focus of attention, rather than storage, drives the relationship between working memory, Gf, and Gv in young school-age children. Our results do not rule out the Baddeley and Hitch model, but they place constraints on both it and Cowan’s model. A common attentional component is needed for feature binding, running digit span, and visual short-term memory tasks; phonological storage is separate, as is a component of central executive processing involved in task manipulation. The results contribute to a zeitgeist in which working memory models are coming together on common ground (cf. Cowan, Saults, & Blume, 2014; Hu, Allen, Baddeley, & Hitch, 2016).}

The current study examined whether 23 Japanese adult learners of English could create a new vowel category along the spectral dimension after phonetic training with the English vowels /i/-/ɪ/ as in beat and bit. As in previous training studies, the Japanese trainees improved their ability to categorize the vowels in tokens included in the training, and were able to generalize to novel tokens and talkers. A cue-weighting task confirmed that the Japanese trainees categorized the vowels based on temporal cues before training, presumably because vowel duration is used phonologically in Japanese. While 12 of the Japanese trainees still relied on vowel duration to distinguish the English vowels after training, 11 of them successfully created a new vowel category along the spectral dimension. However, their category boundary between /i/-/ɪ/ was set at a different location from that of native speakers. We interpret these results as providing evidence that it is possible for late inexperienced learners to create new phonetic categories with phonetic training, but that the new categories may be subject to phonetic category dissimilation, an effect previously documented with early bilinguals.}

Further analysis of relative importance of the predictors showed that orthographic choice was the dominant predictor for the EL1 group and inflectional morpheme production was the dominant predictor for the EFL group.

The present study aimed to determine the fidelity, reliability, and internal validity of the APDQ when translated from English to Brazilian–Portuguese language.
Methods
The first phase included the APDQ translation into Brazilian–Portuguese including forward translation, translation assessment and back-translation in a group of 10 students. The second phase involved establishing the internal consistency and reliability of the APDQ Brazilian–Portuguese version. Data was collected from 66 students without any risk factor for auditory processing disorder. Subjects were divided into a younger group (7–10 yrs) and an older group (11–17 yrs).
Results
All items showed appropriate quality in terms of translation. In determining internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha in subscales of auditory processing, attention and language was found to be 0.93, 0.85 and 0.74, respectively. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for total score was 0.95, ensuring a strong test-retest reliability.
Conclusion
The Brazilian–Portuguese version of the APDQ has favorable translation quality, internal validity and reliability. It is now ready for continued study as a differential screening tool for 7- to 17-year-old Brazilian children with listening difficulties who are at risk for auditory processing disorder, attention deficits and language learning challenges.}

abstract = {Human language appears to be unique among natural communication systems, and such uniqueness impinges on both nature and nurture. Human babies are endowed with cognitive abilities that predispose them to learn language, and this process cannot operate in an impoverished environment. To be effectively complete the acquisition of human language in human children requires highly socialised forms of learning, scaffolded over years of prolonged and intense caretaker–child interactions. How genes and environment operate in shaping language is unknown. These two components have traditionally been considered as independent, and often pitted against each other in terms of the nature versus nurture debate. This perspective article considers how innate abilities and experience might instead work together. In particular, it envisages potential scenarios for research, in which early caregiver verbal and non-verbal attachment practices may mediate or moderate the expression of human genetic systems for language.}

abstract = {Background
People with epilepsy (PWE) beginning in childhood often experience psychological and social hold-ups in addition to seizures. The hold-ups relate to education, employment, driving, and marriage.
Objective
The objective of this study was to document the impact of long-standing, childhood-onset epilepsy on sociopersonal accomplishments of adults pertaining to education, employment, marriage, and driving.
Methods
A prospective, questionnaire-based survey was undertaken in a hospital-based sample of PWE and their unaffected (by epilepsy) older siblings within the immediate/extended family unit.
Results
People with epilepsy were significantly more likely to abandon formal education after primary (6; 2.4% compared to none in controls) or secondary (69; 31.1% compared with controls 58; 26.1%) school, less likely to be currently married (97; 43.7%) when compared with their elder siblings (158; 71.2%) (P = 0.0001), and less likely to be currently employed (103; 46.4%) (P = 0.0001) or driving (111; 50%) (P = 0.0001) compared with the older same-gender siblings (employed: 148; 66.7%; driving: 165; 74.3%). In multivariate models, having epilepsy and age were associated with employment status, whereas age and education and employment status were associated with both marriage and driving.
Conclusion
Notwithstanding the influence of a number of socioeconomic and epilepsy-related variables, childhood-onset epilepsy stands apart in exerting a huge negative impact on educational achievement, employability, marital status, and driving in adulthood.}

abstract = {Subjects 5 to 17 years old participate in two rounds of a lying game. In each round, each participant reports one outcome for themselves and one outcome for another random, anonymous person of the same age. We observe frequent but not omnipresent over-reports for oneself (self-serving lying). We also observe small aggregate levels of under-reports for others and a strong positive correlation across rounds in the reports for others, which might be explained by a coexistence of altruistic liars and spiteful liars in our population. Behavior is similar across ages, except for middle schoolers who exhibit a slightly higher inclination towards self-serving and spiteful lying. A focused analysis of choice in middle school reveals some differences by academic performance and socioeconomic status.}
