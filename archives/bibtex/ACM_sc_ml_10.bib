abstract = {The advent of IoT, ubiquitous and smart sensing, and high performance computing has resulted in a big shift in the adoption of data-driven black-box modeling (also referred to as machine/deep learning) to make our environments smarter and energy systems efficient. Several studies have shown that these AI-enabled solutions for smart buildings, smart cities, smart grids, electric transportation, among others are much more accurate and efficient. However, these data-driven black-box solutions are rarely held accountable for the impact of their actions on the human in the loop which significantly impacts their real-world adoption. To truly conceptualize the idea of smart systems for everyone, it is critical to study these AI-enabled smart environments and energy systems for not just efficiency, but also for affordability and accessibility for all. The first ACM SIGEnergy workshop on Fair, Accountable, Transparent, and Ethical AI for Smart Environments and Energy Systems intends to bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds and discuss key issues, challenges, breakthroughs, and socio-economic impact in developing fair, accountable, transparent and ethical AI techniques for smart environments and energy systems.},

abstract = {The fall is one of the major problems that threaten the health of the elderly. According to world statistics, between 28% and 35% of seniors aged over 65 suffer from at least one fall per year. Continuous monitoring and early detection of critical events such as falls, allow for rapid response and immediate medical management. For this, several fall detection devices have been designed by the researchers. In this paper, we propose a fall detection system based on a portable camera. The camera is worn by the user, which allows him to follow his activity wherever he moves, whether indoors or outdoors. In addition, since it is the environment and not the individual that is being observed, the privacy issue is mitigated. The proposed fall detection method is a new approach based on the original Histogram of Oriented Gradient version (HOG) that we combine with the Optical Flow to improve system performance in detecting true falls. Our method has been implemented on a Raspberry embedded on the developed device, which allows us to parallelize the calculations and thus to answer the real time constraint. The results of the 20 tests performed on 09 subjects; show that the falls can be detected with a sensitivity of 95% from the standing position. The combination of optical flow with HOG has improved the specificity, for the rotation scenario, by increasing it by 50% compared to the use of HOG alone. As a result, we have achieved a specificity of 90%. Experimental results show the success of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Grocery shopping has always played an essential role in our daily lives. It dramatically drives the development of online and offline trading. Several physical cashier-free stores have gradually emerged nowadays, including Amazon Go in Seattle USA, Sam's Club Now in Dallas USA, Jingdong store in Beijing China, and Alibaba TaoCafe in Hangzhou China. To empower a cashier-free store, various technologies are feasible; for example, indoor localization, self-checkout systems, computer vision, and others. Alongside, these methods need large computations and data storage which require high-performance infrastructures. High-performance infrastructures are major obstacles hindering cashier-free stores. Moreover, the installation of these high-performance infrastructures is costly and challenging. In this paper, we first discuss various advanced technologies applied to cashier-free stores in detail. Then, we propose a supermarket simulator that profiles virtual scenes. This simulator serves as a baseline platform that assists researchers in this area to evaluate their add-on algorithms and technologies before applying them in an actual store.},

abstract = {Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT), i.e., tracking multiple targets across multiple cameras, is a crucial technique for smart city applications. In this paper, we propose an effective and reliable MTMCT framework for vehicles, which consists of a traffic-aware single camera tracking (TSCT) algorithm, a trajectory-based camera link model (CLM) for vehicle re-identification (ReID), and a hierarchical clustering algorithm to obtain the cross camera vehicle trajectories. First, the TSCT, which jointly considers vehicle appearance, geometric features, and some common traffic scenarios, is proposed to track the vehicles in each camera separately. Second, the trajectory-based CLM is adopted to facilitate the relationship between each pair of adjacently connected cameras and add spatio-temporal constraints for the subsequent vehicle ReID with temporal attention. Third, the hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to merge the vehicle trajectories among all the cameras to obtain the final MTMCT results. Our proposed MTMCT is evaluated on the CityFlow dataset and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with IDF1 of 74.93%.},

The main focus is the routing techniques that might vary depending on the whole network structure. In this paper, we offer a review of the state-of-the-art routing techniques in IoTs. We first highlight the routing challenges in IoTs followed by a complete survey of variant routing techniques. Overall, the routing techniques are classified into two groups based on the network architecture: the clustering and non-clustering techniques. Moreover, these techniques can be categorized into sub-techniques. We also emphasize the benefits of IoTs and performance issues of all routing technique. The survey paper concludes with possible future recommendations.},

The extracted entity pairs were stored in the gStore database. In order to solve the problem of association of knowledge in knowledge graph, this paper also designed the food safety ontology which organized the concepts, classifications and relationships about food production and food inspection.

abstract = {With the rapid advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and applications, an increasing concern is on the development and application of responsible AI technologies. Building AI technologies or machine-learning models often requires massive amounts of data, which may include sensitive, user private information to be collected from different sites or countries. Privacy, security, and data governance constraints rule out a brute force process in the acquisition and integration of these data. It is thus a serious challenge to protect user privacy while achieving high-performance models. This article reviews recent progress of federated learning in addressing this challenge in the context of privacy-preserving computing. Federated learning allows global AI models to be trained and used among multiple decentralized data sources with high security and privacy guarantees, as well as sound incentive mechanisms. This article presents the background, motivations, definitions, architectures, and applications of federated learning as a new paradigm for building privacy-preserving, responsible AI ecosystems.},

This paper depicts a broad methodical literature analysis of CO scheme and CO methods in VEC domains and divides the current works of CO into various categories. The methodical analysis of this research will help researchers to find the important characteristics of CO and select the most appropriate algorithm for computing tasks.

abstract = {In the last years, the concept of Cognitive Smart City (CSC) emerged from the convergence of the Internet of Things, big data, smart city technologies, and artificial intelligence techniques. At the same time, computational argumentation has consolidated itself as a vibrant area in Artificial Intelligence (AI) which has engineered different approaches to reflect aspects of how humans build, exchange and analyze arguments in their daily lives, mainly to deal with controversial or inconsistent information. Thus, computational argumentation provides a valuable metaphor for reasoning on top of available data in order to draw conclusions and offer explanations for them. This paper discusses a first approach towards integrating computational argumentation in a layered model for cognitive cities, where the bottom layers comprise raw data collected from sensor, actuators and other artifacts deployed in the context of a smart city, and argumentation provides high-level intelligence abilities. We show how our approach can be paired with a layered model for computational argumentation. To illustrate our proposal, we analyze a case study, based on the DECIDE 2.0 framework.},

The approach is mandated by perceived limitations in 5G networking architecture maintaining control in the edge gateway. In our approach, control may be delegated to clusters of IoT nodes beyond the edge gateway. The communication is event-based involving publish-subscribe between related nodes. Clusters are identified in an autonomic fashion based on multi-criteria proximity. Local decisions can combine global and local context information to establish network slices in a decentralized fashion based on application demands. Moreover, such decisions may be part of a collaborative effort (map-reduce) based on either local or global context. Application demands expressed as such are modeled compatible with Open Data initiatives. We demonstrated feasibility of the approach and evaluate its advantages over the 5G architecture involving an edge gateway.},

abstract = {PM2.5 concentration is an important evaluation index of urban air quality. Improving the prediction and early warning ability of PM2.5 concentration is of great significance for guiding residents' real-time protection and efficient control of air pollution. A large number of studies have shown that the temporal and spatial correlation between PM2.5 concentration of surrounding stations and target stations directly affects the prediction accuracy of the model. There is still a lack on how to select strongly correlated and representative temporal and spatial information, and the selection methods are somewhat subjective. In this paper, air pollutants and meteorological factors are taken as the influencing factors, and a PM2.5 prediction model (ST-CCN-PM2.5) based on causal convolution network is proposed to improve the performance of PM2.5 concentration prediction at a fine-grained spatial-temporal scale. We use spatial attention mechanism to fuse spatial correlation information, and optimize threshold parameters. Based on time attention mechanism, the sliding window size is adjusted to dilate the time-series input. Finally, the hourly records of air pollutants and meteorological factors monitored by 95 monitoring stations in Haikou city are employed, and the performance is compared with baseline. Compared with AR and ARMA models, the MSE values decrease by 38.9% and 40.9%, and R2 values increase by 2.3% and 2.6%, respectively. Compared with GRU, SVR, LSTM and ANN models, the MSE value of ST-CCN-PM2.5 decreases by 44.8%, 45.4%, 46.5% and 49.0%, respectively, and its R2 value increases by 3.6%. The final results show that the prediction performance of ST-CCN-PM2.5 model is significantly improved compared with the baseline, which proves that the model has stronger reflection ability and prediction generalization ability for dynamic nonlinear system, and proves the potential of the model in the prediction of fine particle PM2.5 concentration.},

abstract = {Falling poses a significant risk to the elderly people living alone, and timely detection when a fall occurs to an elderly has attracted much research attention. Among the variety of technologies proposed, mmWave sensor based technology has shown promising performance in this task due to its strength in body-pose recognition. However, previous studies have focused on using sophisticated mmWave radars, whereas cheaper commodity mmWave sensors have not received much attention due to their low spatial resolutions. In this paper, we propose a fall detection system based on commodity mmWave sensors along with body-feature estimation algorithm to overcome the low-resolution deficiency. We first compare several body-feature estimation algorithms and select the optimized one. Then we illustrate the potential of body-feature estimation algorithms via a case study of a threshold-based fall detection system. We construct a database that includes 348 datasets; and our experimental evaluation of the datasets demonstrates that our algorithm is effective for detecting falls.},

abstract = {The adoption of network traffic encryption is continually growing. Popular applications use encryption protocols to secure communications and protect the privacy of users. In addition, a large portion of malware is spread through the network traffic taking advantage of encryption protocols to hide its presence and activity. Entering into the era of completely encrypted communications over the Internet, we must rapidly start reviewing the state-of-the-art in the wide domain of network traffic analysis and inspection, to conclude if traditional traffic processing systems will be able to seamlessly adapt to the upcoming full adoption of network encryption. In this survey, we examine the literature that deals with network traffic analysis and inspection after the ascent of encryption in communication channels. We notice that the research community has already started proposing solutions on how to perform inspection even when the network traffic is encrypted and we demonstrate and review these works. In addition, we present the techniques and methods that these works use and their limitations. Finally, we examine the countermeasures that have been proposed in the literature in order to circumvent traffic analysis techniques that aim to harm user privacy.},

abstract = {Water allocation management in an equitable and sustainable way is intrinsically complex. Climate change and managerial policy have further adversely altered the hydrologic cycles thus, threatens to worsen the current supply-demand imbalance. This study was conducted in Lower Benue River Catchment in the North Central crevice of Nigeria, to assess the consequences of climate change due to changing rainfall patterns in the area and proposes different prognostic scenarios adaptation on the current and future water allocation sharing in the area. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was interfaced with Map window - Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for the basin hydrological modeling to assess the impact of the watershed characteristics on runoff and subsequent quantification of the catchment water yield before been allocated optimally based on percentage dependable flow rates of 70% and 85% reliability flow regime at Makurdi, Nigeria discharge station. Furthermore, the Water Evaluation and Planning tool (WEAP) model was used for the water resources utilization simulation and adaptation scenarios by the different riparian users. The SWAT model performed satisfactorily for streamflow and water yield prediction both in the calibration and validation phases with a R2 of 0.57-0.68 and RSR of 0.66-0.82, while the WEAP model calibration and validation at the same station with rainfall data posted a R2 of 0.64 and 0.89. Planners and decision-makers on water resources allocation, therefore, need to consider several integrated plans as alternatives to the adaptation to climate change impacts and anthropogenic activities in resolving the unmet demands.},

abstract = {With the increasing number of higher education students using e-learning technology, collaborative learning has been suggested as a solution to the lack of sufficient support to learners in e-learning environments, particularly LMS (Learning Management System). Nevertheless, current collaborative learning puts a heavy emphasis on group discussion, but provides inadequate support for individual learners to promote teamwork during the whole learning process.The aim of this paper is to propose an intelligent LMS able to improve student's collaboration practices in higher education. The system provides teachers information about the levels of collaboration and productivity of each student and group; and as a result, teachers exploit data provided to promote collaborative learning, avoid students' isolation and motivate them to use collaboration tools. The intelligent LMS called "smart-Cloud Collaborative LMS" integrates a Multi-Agents System (MAS) responsible to the tracking of collaboration and productivity levels of each student and group. On the other hand, in order to optimize the large-scale resource management, the proposed smart-Cloud Collaborative LMS is based on a cloud computing architecture.},

These different SLAs enable IoT service provision with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee. Achieving this guarantee requires several communications and interactions between the components of the proposed IoT architecture. These interactions allow an IoT Service Provider (IoT-SP) to conclude the iSLA with an IoT Client (IoT-C).

abstract = {Energy and water are scarce resources in South Africa, and the management thereof is receiving increased attention. One rare place where energy and water coincide is in water heaters, which consume over 30% of household energy in South Africa and collectively pass over 500 billion litres of water annually. These resource-hungry devices are not well managed and tend to be physically inaccessible and difficult to understand for users. The advent of wireless and cloud computing technology brought expectations of simple management of a multitude of devices and the so-called Internet of Things. A few solutions have been proposed for remote water heater management, but these are not scalable, and have not been benchmarked for scalability above tens of units. This paper proposes an end-to-end architecture to monitor and control EWHs based on MQTT, and specific emphasis is placed on the technologies suitable for large-scale cross-domain interoperability. The performance of the system with 10,000 connections and the results of a pilot deployment are presented.},

abstract = {License plate detection (LPD) in context is a challenging problem due to its sensitivity to environmental factors (such as rain, dust, and shadow) and light, which may greatly influence the detection accuracy. Moreover, LPD is more challenging for real-time systems. The usage of deep learning attracted the attention of researchers in recent years. It is being widely employed to solve classification and detection problems. Recently, for object detection, a new deep network was developed, namely, You Only Look Once (YOLO).We propose a YOLO-inspired adaptive solution with optimized parameters to enhance detection performance. To improve the detection process, the proposed solution employs "model generator" and "testing configurator" components where each model is trained using one single deep network. In addition to testing the newly designed solution using the UFPR-ALPR dataset, this work introduces a new annotated dataset for Canadian license plates (LP), namely CENPARMI datasets. The newly introduced dataset is challenging as it contains images with different settings in terms of: brightness, skewing, and distance. In addition to reporting the recall ratio results, a detailed error analysis to provide some insights into the types of false positives has been conducted. The proposed solution choice of optimal parameters enhanced the recall ratio and precision. For example, the proposed solution improved the recall ratio from 84.4% to 98.3% and the precision from 65.37% to 89.17% when tested using the UFPR-ALPR dataset.},

abstract = {Recommender systems, commonly known as filtering systems, are one of the most important tools that have the ability to predict and provide suggestions, intended to meet users' interests and expectations and hence, solve the issue of information overload. To achieve this goal, the recommendation's process takes into account both the user's profile (set of preferences and interests) and all available items (set of characteristics). Commonly, these systems employ various techniques and different approaches which exploit textual data from users' activities taken either from their profiles or from other valuable resources and are often combined to provide the most suitable results. However, due to the increasing volume of data, the recommendation becomes more redundant and the same elements get proposed repeatedly. In this paper, we intend to discuss the benefits of using traceability and how it can improve the recommendation and make it more reliable.},

Informative representation of road networks is important as it is essential to a wide variety of ITS applications. In this paper, we propose a neural network representation learning model, namely Intersection of Road Network to Vector (IRN2Vec), to learn embeddings of road intersections that encode rich information in a road network by exploring geo-locality and intrinsic properties of intersections and moving behaviors of road users. In addition to model design, several issues unique to IRN2Vec, including data preparation for model training and various relationships among intersections, are examined. We evaluate the learned embeddings via extensive experiments on three real-world datasets using three downstream test cases, including prediction of traffic signals and crossings on intersections and travel time estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed IRN2Vec outperforms three existing methods, DeepWalk, LINE and Node2vec, in terms of F1-score in predicting traffic signals (22.21% to 23.84%) and crossings (8.65% to 11.65%), and mean absolute error (MAE) in travel time estimation (9.87% to 19.28%).},

To ensure this intelligent customization and improve the quality of adaptation, we propose an architecture of a Multi-Agent adaptive learning system based on Incremental Hybrid Case-Based Reasoning (IHCBR) to make the right decision in real time in the face of a current learning situation, using both the execution of a classical cycle (linear process) and a dynamic cycle (dynamic process) of Case-Based Reasoning. This decision will be made by assigning each step of the Incremental Hybrid Case-Based Reasoning at least one agent who ensures a precise task and collaborates with other agents to follow dynamically the learner during the learning process by offering them a personalized real-time learning path.},

abstract = {This work represents a study of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. An intelligent solution that aims to facilitate the daily life. Its ecosystem based on the use of specific network protocols that facilitate the operation of transporting. Reliable transfer and the energy consumption characterize these protocols. Several platforms developed designed for IoT, whose main purpose is to monitor the different uses of the sensors and send collected data to the cloud, according to the network protocols, to ensure the management as well as the quantity of energy consumed. One of the major challenges of IoT is the management of information heterogeneity, and its ability to exist in a complex ubiquitous and distributed system. With this in mind, we present a solution: The integration of the Multi Agent System (MAS) within IoT, by using a new Sigfox shield. This Shield is composed of the Sigfox and the Arduino. This contribution talk about the creation and management of IoT_Agent, setting up the constraints of communication, interactions and the interconnection between objects. To do this, we find that the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol performs well in terms of energy optimization during communications and interactions between IoT_agent. This approach proposes a dynamic management of the bridges, which solves the interconnection problems of the embedded systems in the different networks with an efficiency.},

abstract = {The construction of a smart city needs to be supported by good machine learning methods, random forest is a kind of technology which has been widely applied in dealing with regression or classification problems. The difficult points to be solved include how to set random forest parameters. The number of subtrees and samples will affect the performance of the algorithm to a great extent. This paper proposes a forest parameter optimization method based on firework algorithm (FWA-RF). By using its explosion, mutation and selection mechanisms, the parameters are adjusted in self-adaptive man-ner to avoid falling into a local optimal state. Through the comparative experiments on 15 UCI databases, the accuracy of the improved algorithm is higher than that of the original RF classification by 1.55% to 26.67%, and is superior to decision tree, Bagging, Adaboost as well as RF based on genetic algorithm. The results indicate that this method can effectively find the range of effective adjustment parameters, make parameter optimization and adjustment easier, and provide technical support for the creation of smart city.},

abstract = {Smart Cities is the future of human habitation, which is evangelized by the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. We study the municipality of Papagos, which is located in the Smart City of Athens, Greece. In Papagos is developed a technical infrastructure, which enable citizens to act as human sensors by exploiting their smartphones to report malfunctions in the municipality infrastructure. Using Citify software app municipality problematic situations annotated and submitted to the system for further processing exploiting crowdsourcing and crowdsensing technology. When a report arrives to the municipality control center the system allocates certain department to serve the problem. Since incidents are served by a certain number of departments with limited resources, the early planning and allocation of a department's resources before the incident emerges is significant. To handle such situations, we incorporate an inference engine model, which is based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to learn stochastically examples of incidence occurrence. Based on the LSTM classification model the proposed system is able to predict a similar event in the future thus allocates efficiently a municipality department resource before the problem emerges.},

abstract = {With the advent of digital technology, computer networks have developed rapidly at an unprecedented pace contributing tremendously to social and economic development. They have become the backbone for all critical sectors and all the top Multi-National companies. Unfortunately, security threats for computer networks have increased dramatically over the last decade being much brazen and bolder. Indeed, intrusions or attacks can lead to irreparable damages, information leakage and significant financial losses. Hence, there is a great need for an effective Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). In the current study, we propose a hybrid NIDS to detect network attacks in the network environment by monitoring network traffic, thereby achieving a solid line of protection against inside and outside intruders and maintaining performance and service quality. In our NIDS framework, we use Suricata as a signature based detection to uncover known attacks, while for detecting network anomaly, we use Isolation Forest Algorithm (IFA). By applying Suricata prior to the IFA classifier, IFA has to detect only unknown attacks. Therefore, detection time is reduced and computational power is saved. Suricata is an open source IDS, which has been advanced as a multi-threaded alternative to popular Snort IDS. The major benefits of a multi-threaded design is that it offers increased speed and efficiency in network traffic analysis and can also help divide up the IDS workload based on where the processing needs are. Consequently, Suricata shows an increase in accuracy and system performance over the de facto standard, single threaded NIDS Snort. While, IFA is one of the newest approaches to detect anomalies/outliers, which introduces the use of isolation as a more effective and efficient means to recognize anomalies than the popularly used basic distance and density measures. In fact, IFA uses no distance or density measures to identify outliers, this eliminates major computational cost of distance calculation in all distance-based and density-based algorithms. Additionally, IFA has a low constant in its computational complexity. Moreover, in this framework, the NIDSs operate in collaborative way to oppose attacks by sharing alerts stored in central log. In this way, unknown attacks that were detected by any NIDS can easily be detected by others IDSs. This also helps to reduce computational cost for detecting intrusions at others NIDSs, and improve detection rate in overall the network environment.},

According to [1] "service logistics is an approach that stabilizes and guarantees the continuity of flows: it is then oriented more towards the service provided than towards reducing traffic costs". The SCM of services is of increasing interest to companies facing strong competition, market globalization and rapid changes in information and communication technologies. This evolution has led to a rapid integration of new digital practices in this field.So, how is the digitalization of the SCM of service companies looking today and what will be the future trends? On the one hand, with the help of the literature review, we seek to identify the concept of the SCM in services and its specificities, then that of digitization of the SCM and its organizational dimension. On the other hand, we are attempting a prospective approach to the current practices and digitalization prospects of the service company's SCM.},

Long Range Wireless Area Network (LoRa or LoRaWAN) is one such protocol that can be used to establish a system implementation using an IoT based data acquisition system. LoRaWAN can be used even in remote area to monitor data and send it to a remote server without the need of backhaul internet.

Within this concept, today's competitive business environment need for businesses in order to implement the monitor and analyze the user-generated data on their own and their competitors. The achievement of competitive advantage is often necessary to listen to and understand what customers are saying about competitors' products and services. Not only personality analytics but also the conceptual description can capture an intelligent learning environment, and it is the analytic tools that are used to improve learning and education. The researchers also discuss how learning analytics is developed in different fields. It closely tied to, a series of other fields of study including business intelligence, web analytics, academic analytics, educational data mining, and action analytics. The researchers believe that conceptual of personality analytics in the intelligent learning environment can play an essential role in managing and analyzing personality and contribute to the concept of personality analytics in the intelligent learning environment. The results of this research could be summarized as follows: learning analytics process should be used as measuring and collecting data about learners and learning with the aim of improving teaching and learning practice through analysis of the data. By achieving this process, it should collect data to report or analyze the happening about the learner. Then, instructors monitor learning what is happening now, while as learning analytics should get what is going to happen in the future for learners. Finally, instructors take action to feedback learners.},

Ubiquitous computing turned out to be a fact that has many unutilized resources. These unutilized resources can be used to create Ad-hoc Cloud. In this paper, we create a novel mobile ad-hoc cloud based on a network of interconnected low cost, small size, resource constrained and widely available devices. We present a novel application to detect criminals using low cost equipment. This way the application can be considered a method that compensates the total cost that was needed for creating the cloud infrastructure and operational cost. Simulation studies showed that the performance of the created ad-hoc cloud is acceptable in comparison with a small scale conventional cloud hosting container based distributed application.},

abstract = {Mobile apps are playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives, including the lives of approximately 304 million users worldwide that are either completely blind or suffer from some form of visual impairment. These users rely on screen readers to interact with apps. Screen readers, however, cannot describe the image icons that appear on the screen, unless those icons are accompanied with developer-provided textual labels. A prior study of over 5,000 Android apps found that in around 50% of the apps, less than 10% of the icons are labeled. To address this problem, a recent award-winning approach, called LabelDroid, employed deep-learning techniques to train a model on a dataset of existing icons with labels to automatically generate labels for visually similar, unlabeled icons. In this work, we empirically study the nature of icon labels in terms of distribution and their dependency on different sources of information. We then assess the effectiveness of LabelDroid in predicting labels for unlabeled icons. We find that icon images are insufficient in representing icon labels, while other sources of information from the icon usage context can enrich images in determining proper tokens for labels. We propose the first context-aware label generation approach, called COALA, that incorporates several sources of information from the icon in generating accurate labels. Our experiments show that although COALA significantly outperforms LabelDroid in both user study and automatic evaluation, further research is needed. We suggest that future studies should be more cautious when basing their approach on automatically extracted labeled data.},

Current works on extracting and understanding city events mainly rely on technology-enabled infrastructure to observe and record events. In this work, we propose an approach to leverage citizen observations of various city systems and services, such as traffic, public transport, water supply, weather, sewage, and public safety, as a source of city events. We investigate the feasibility of using such textual streams for extracting city events from annotated text. We formalize the problem of annotating social streams such as microblogs as a sequence labeling problem. We present a novel training data creation process for training sequence labeling models. Our automatic training data creation process utilizes instance-level domain knowledge (e.g., locations in a city, possible event terms). We compare this automated annotation process to a state-of-the-art tool that needs manually created training data and show that it has comparable performance in annotation tasks. An aggregation algorithm is then presented for event extraction from annotated text. We carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the event annotation and event extraction on a real-world dataset consisting of event reports and tweets collected over 4 months from the San Francisco Bay Area. The evaluation results are promising and provide insights into the utility of social stream for extracting city events.},

Unlike loop controllers that can generally be only used for detection and movement of vehicles, cameras can provide rich information about the traffic behavior. Vision-based frameworks for multiple-object detection, object tracking, and near-miss detection have been developed to derive this information. However, much of this work currently addresses processing videos offline. In this article, we propose an integrated two-stream convolutional networks architecture that performs real-time detection, tracking, and near-accident detection of road users in traffic video data. The two-stream model consists of a spatial stream network for object detection and a temporal stream network to leverage motion features for multiple-object tracking. We detect near-accidents by incorporating appearance features and motion features from these two networks. Further, we demonstrate that our approaches can be executed in real-time and at a frame rate that is higher than the video frame rate on a variety of videos collected from fisheye and overhead cameras.},

Geospatial applications (including GIS) have been extensively used in each stage of emergency management. Nowadays, on the technical side, artificial intelligence tools like deep learning could be put to good use. For example, one of the main benefits of deep learning over various machine learning algorithms is its ability to generate new features from limited series of features located in the training dataset. Therefore, deep learning algorithms can create new tasks to solve current ones. Decision-makers can utilize the geospatial information to develop planning and mitigation strategies with such advanced techniques. GIS models and simulation capabilities are used to exercise response and recovery plans during non-disaster times. They help the decision-makers sense the near real-time possibilities during an event. Once disaster occurs, GIS will take effect in real time response and recovery activities.},

abstract = {Vehicle flow estimation has many potential smart cities and transportation applications. Many cities have existing camera networks which broadcast image feeds; however, the resolution and frame-rate are too low for existing computer vision algorithms to accurately estimate flow. In this work, we present a computer vision and deep learning framework for vehicle tracking. We demonstrate a novel tracking pipeline which enables accurate flow estimates in a range of environments under low resolution and frame-rate constraints. We demonstrate that our system is able to track vehicles in New York City's traffic camera video feeds at 1 Hz or lower frame-rate, and produces higher traffic flow accuracy than popular open source tracking frameworks.},

abstract = {Action knowledge graphs can play a central role in smart cities, smart homes, robot planning, and so on. This is since both of the subject and the object of the actions can add more meaningful information for the higher-level application than the action alone as a predicate. We built a system that generates the action knowledge graphs from video using deep learning. Especially, we propose an algorithm which perceives the interaction between hand and object by measuring the proximity between them with considering the direction of fingers. We showed that this approach achieves the performance of 83% in accuracy using the Stair Lab data.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the object detection algorithms have been widely used in many scenarios, but the accurate detection of crowd objectives in real-life scenarios is still a challenging problem, such as the detection problem of single human in a crowded scene, and vehicle positioning with multiple similar license plates (domestic Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao license plates). Aiming at this kind of scenario, we designs a network structure based on multi-scale features. In addition, we also propose a new bounding box regression method with crowd multi-objectives, which has a significant improvement on the detection effect of crowd objectives. The network structure (Exclusion-Net) proposed in this paper, with very few parameters (1000K), achieves SOTA results on the VOC2007 public dataset and the Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao license plate dataset of the actual traffic scene. On the NVIDIA 1080 graphics card, the running speed of our model can reach 40 FPS, which is easy to deploy on embedded devices.},
