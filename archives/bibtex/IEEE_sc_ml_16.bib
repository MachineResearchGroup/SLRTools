abstract={In the mobile network, user can share their trip stories at any time and place, the massive user data can provides an opportunity to mining users' travel preferences. Tourism recommendation has been studied by lots of researchers, although they took into account the social relation of users and the need of travelers, but if multi-dimensional social information and the seasonality of tourism service are considered, it may lead to better personality efficiency for tourism recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized tourism service recommendation model termed GA-LSTM_CSInf, which fused multi-modality travel information include the multi-dimensional social information, time series and tourism service category. The main work is listed as follows:(1)we combined genetic algorithm (GA) and LSTM network for predicting the popularity and score of tourism service.(2) Considering the multi-dimensional social information of users in social networks, we proposed the Explicit Social Influence (ExSoInf) and the Implicit Social Influence (ImSoInf) of users, and then integrated them into SVD algorithm.(3) Calculating user preferences for tourism service categories using matrix factorization technology. And then, the calculation results of the three methods are weighted and summed to obtain a fusion tourism service recommendation algorithm (GA-LSTM_CSInf). We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for our fusion recommendation algorithm using real-world dataset collected from Yelp. Experimental results show that our method achieves significantly superior recommendation quality compared to other state of art recommendation methods.},

abstract={Smart city environments, when applied to healthcare, improve the quality of people's lives, enabling, for instance, disease prediction and treatment monitoring. In medical settings, case prioritization is of great importance, with beneficial outcomes both in terms of patient health and physicians' daily work. Recommender systems are an alternative to automatically integrate the data generated in such environments with predictive models and recommend actions, content, or services. The data produced by smart devices are accurate and reliable for predictive and decision-making contexts. This study main purpose is to assist patients and doctors in the early detection of disease or prediction of postoperative worsening through constant monitoring. To achieve this objective, this study proposes an architecture for recommender systems applied to healthcare, which can prioritize emergency cases. The architecture brings an ensemble approach for prediction, which adopts multiple Machine Learning algorithms. The methodology used to carry out the study followed three steps. First, a systematic literature mapping, second, the construction and development of the architecture, and third, the evaluation through two case studies. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposal. The predictions are promising and adherent to the application context for accurate datasets with a low amount of noises or missing values.},

abstract={Efficiency and accuracy are key parameters in the planning and execution of transport plans. Often drivers are not able to fulfill the planned schedule due to several uncertainties that can not be predicted. This problem has been tackled based on the empiric knowledge and experience of the people involved. Now with the increasing amount of tracking devices and new computational power and storage capacities, it is possible to apply data-mining and machine-learning processes to big amounts of historical data, allowing to explore the hidden relationships related with efficiency and accuracy trips results. This article presents an exploratory analysis of the relationship between scheduling and execution of land transport trips that are tracked through real-time monitoring in Colombia. A data mining techniques exploration is used in the analysis of historical data obtained from vehicles and drivers. The comparison of the trip planned schedules and its real execution, that is extremely volatile, evidences the keys variables that are relevant in the decision-making process related to the transport planning problem.},

abstract={Led by industrialization of smart cities, numerous interconnected mobile devices, and novel applications have emerged in the urban environment, providing great opportunities to realize industrial automation. In this context, autonomous driving is an attractive issue, which leverages large amounts of sensory information for smart navigation while posing intensive computation demands on resource constrained vehicles. Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a potential solution to alleviate the heavy burden on the devices. However, varying states of multiple edge servers as well as a variety of vehicular offloading modes make efficient task offloading a challenge. To cope with this challenge, we adopt a deep Q-learning approach for designing optimal offloading schemes, jointly considering selection of target server and determination of data transmission mode. Furthermore, we propose an efficient redundant offloading algorithm to improve task offloading reliability in the case of vehicular data transmission failure. We evaluate the proposed schemes based on real traffic data. Results indicate that our offloading schemes have great advantages in optimizing system utilities and improving offloading reliability.},

In recent years, many researches have been focusing on it by using machine learning algorithms.

In this paper, we present our models which are respectively inspired from KNN, SVR, MLP and RNN, to predict highway traffic volume, aiming at different evaluation metrics. Based on the revised models, model stacking is used which can boost predictive accuracy by combining the predictions of multiple machine learning models. The experiments show that, when the metrics are specified, the revised models outperform the traditional ones. Moreover, one single model is not always superior to the others and each of them can have encouraging result in certain conditions. By stacking these models, significant improvements can be achieved.},

abstract={As an important attribute of human face, expression is widely used in human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence and other fields. As an important biometric recognition technology, expression recognition has become a hot research topic in the field of computer vision. With the continuous development of deep learning, appropriate neural network and a large number of preprocessed data can train a high-performance model, so as to improve the accuracy and convenience of expression recognition. Because the local details of the face determine the expression information, this paper not only uses the face detection technology in the image preprocessing, but also uses Difference of Gaussian pyramid to obtain the detailed information of the facial expression image to enhance the image detail features. Because of the large amount of parameters in Xception model, this paper proposes a dual channels model based on mini_Xception_SE for facial expression classification. The experimental results on fer2013 and CK+ dataset show that the feature information of facial expressions in different facial regions can be effectively extracted by applying detail enhanced image to the dual channels model based on Mini Xception SE, so as to improve the accuracy of facial expression recognition.},

abstract={Smart cities, utilities, third-parties, and government agencies are having pressure on managing stochastic power generation from distributed rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays, such as predicting and reacting to the variations in electric grid. Recently, there is a rising interest to identify solar PV arrays automatically and passively. Traditional approaches such as online assessment and utilities interconnection filings are time consuming and costly, and limited in geospatial resolution, and thus do not scale up to every location. Significant recent work focuses on using aerial imagery to train machine learning or deep learning models to automatically detect solar PV arrays. Unfortunately, these approaches typically require Very High Resolution (VHR) images and human handcrafted solar PV array templates for training, which have a minimum cost of $15 per km2 and are not always available at every location.To address the problem, we design a new system‚ÄîSolarFinder that can automatically detect distributed solar PV arrays in a given geospatial region without any extra cost. SolarFinder first automatically fetches regular resolution satellite images within the region using publicly-available imagery APIs. Then, SolarFinder leverages multi-dimensional K-means algorithm to automatically segment solar arrays on rooftop images. Eventually, SolarFinder employs hybrid linear regression approach that integrates support vector machine (SVM) modeling with a deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) approach to accurately identify solar PV arrays and characterize each solar deployment. We evaluate SolarFinder using 269,632 satellite images that include 1,143,636 contours from 13 geospatial regions in U.S. We find that pre-trained SolarFinder yields a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.17, which is 3 times better than the most recent pre-trained CNNs approach and the same as a re-trained CNNs approach.},

abstract={The installation and management of traffic monitoring devices can be costly from both a financial and human resource point of view. It is therefore important to take advantage of available infrastructures to maximize the information extraction for each technology. Here we show how low-quality urban road traffic images from cameras, already installed in many cities such as Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto can be used as a non-intrusive traffic monitoring. To this end, we use a pre-trained object detection neural network to count vehicles within images. We then compare the results with human annotations gathered through crowdsourcing campaigns. We use this comparison to assess performance and calibrate the neural network annotations. The performance of our system allows us to consider applications which can monitor the traffic conditions in near real-time, making the counting usable for traffic-related services. Furthermore, the resulting annotations pave the way for building a historical vehicle counting dataset to be used for analysing the impact of road traffic on many city-related issues such as urban planning, security, and pollution.},

abstract={Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has been widely applied in smart home, smart city, smart traffic, etc. It is a big challenge to recognize facial expression of IIoT systems more effectively. Current facial recognition methods only utilize singular facial images, so accurate features that are highly correlated with facial changes can hardly be extracted. In order to overcome this difficulty and improve facial expression recognition, in this article, we propose a parallel neural network combining texture features, which can be applied in facial expression recognition. This parallel neural network is constructed by convolution neural network, residual network, and capsule network. Additionally, texture analysis is conducted on facial expression images to extract abundant features. Eight texture features are extracted by gray-level co-occurrence matrix and integrated with features of original images. Finally, these integrated features extracted by three kinds of networks are used to classify facial images. Experimental results prove that the proposed approach has a high recognition rate and strong robustness compared to competitive algorithms. Remarkably, our accuracy reaches 98.14%, with an increase of 3.71% in comparison with ResNet, and the F1-score of 0.9801. It is thus verified from this result that the proposed algorithm has many outstanding advantages. The idea in combination with texture features also provides a new solution for image classification.},

But the constant monitoring of activities and behaviours and the collection along with the use of confidential data have led to increasing concerns about privacy which have indeed become one of the main barriers to technology acceptance and adoption. The development of new personalised technologies increases the use of sensitive data which should be kept hidden from third parties. The current methods are not sufficient and effective to assess and mitigate the significant privacy risks exposed by IoT and to support the design and adoption of privacy-aware smart systems. In this context, this paper proposes an architecture for privacy preservation which enables fine-grained control over data, anonymization and authentication.

A topologically grid-based map is utilized in the proposed neural dynamics. With the help of the ranging sensors the robot can sense only limited range of area. The next grid cell position of the robot is achieved by determining the maximum neural activity of its neighbouring neurons or the minimum target distance from the maximum activated neurons.

abstract={Balancing production and demand of energy is the main challenge to integrate renewable energy sources (RES) in micro-grid (MG) systems. However, the variability and the uncertainty nature of the production and the consumption make the system more difficult to control. In fact, weather conditions influence on the production of renewable energy sources while occupancy influences on the power consumption. Therefore, the development of accurate short term forecasts are needed for a seamless integration of RES (e.g. photovoltaic system, wind turbine) together with the traditional electrical grid in MG systems. This paper presents a forecasting model for predicting the power production and consumption in MG systems together with the battery state of charge (SoC). A control strategy is then implemented to balance the Demand/Response by taking into account the forecasted and real-time values. Based on the data collected from a real MG system, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of power forecasting for MG control.},

abstract={Urban traffic passenger flows prediction is practically important to facilitate many real applications including transportation management and public safety. Sustained and rapid economic growth requires an orderly organization, and planning is an indispensable part of an orderly organization process. The reduction in travel efficiency due to traffic congestion, as well as energy and various pollution issues from the transportation sector, have become the bottleneck for the further development of the city and are the most troublesome topic for governments in all countries. Recently, deep learning performs the excellent ability to extract high dimensional spatial-temporal characters in regression and classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model based on CNN and RNN, which takes matrixed traffic as input, uses CNN to extract traffic characteristics, and uses RNN to predict the evolution of features to achieve traffic flow prediction. Instead of traditional rnn models, we design a new type of RNN structure unit that can process time data in multiple time dimensions at the same time. Using a network-like RNN model, the evolution of traffic flow in different time dimensions is fully considered, and the interaction between different time dimensions is taken into account to predict the traffic flow of the target time series.The prediction of each data in the sequence has real data as input instead of merely taking the output of the previous moment as the input of the next moment.Experiments show that our model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy for real traffic passenger flow datasets.},

This article addresses computational, storage, connectivity and intelligence concerns using a collaborative approach to engage multiple Internet of Things (IoT) nodes such as connected- vehicles, drones and mobile devices for the provisioning of QoS-optimal complex service compositions in autonomous mobile networks. Continuous and fast compositions emerge using decentralized decisions and interactions with diversified neighboring nodes with the aid of reinforcement learning.

abstract={In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as drones, smartphones, and smart vehicles have increased, and Smart Vehicular Networks (SVNs) have formed. SVN are one of the vital components in smart cities and improves their functionality and efficiency. Despite the many applications that SVN have shown, they have security vulnerabilities issues, and there are many reports of them being hacked. Most attacks on SVN occur due to wireless communications and information sharing between vehicles. Also, due to the communication among vehicles, failures can spread from the victim device to the entire network and cause widespread damages. SVN features include mobility, decentralization, resource constraints that make traditional security solutions unsuitable for it. We propose a secure framework using blockchain and Deep Neural networks (DNN) to address these challenges. In this framework, we consider cluster-based architecture that vehicles in each cluster can securely communicate using the blockchain. Also, DNN is adopted to detect abnormal vehicles that have been attacked using their network traffic analysis in each zone. We assess blockchain impacts on throughput using different miners with multiple block sizes in our proposed framework. The experimental result indicates the throughput improvement with an increase in miners and block size. In addition, we evaluated the DNN performance for abnormal vehicle detection, which represents 99.82% in terms of accuracy.},

abstract={Myocardial Infarction (MI) is one of the major causes of human death. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important tool of the myocardial infarction diagnosis. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Channel Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (MCL-CNN), which combines ECG signals from three leads (V1, V2, and V3) for the purpose of detecting the Anterior Myocardial Infarction (AMI). MCL-CNN utilizes the signal from each ECG lead in order to find the suitable filter to get the superior feature representation. On one hand, MCL-CNN uses the squeeze convolution, the depthwise convolution, and the pointwise convolution to extract ECG features, which has lower computational complexity than the traditional CNN. On the other hand, Adam optimizer is applied by MCL-CNN to improve the classification performance. Comparing to both the single-channel convolutional neural network and the multi-channel convolutional neural networks, experimental results show that MCL-CNN can achieve a superior metrics scores (i.e., Accuracy=96.18%, AUC=95.50%, Sensitivity=93.67%, Specificity=97.32%). Experimental results also demonstrate the MCL-CNN's rationality of multi-lead ECG classification and the lower computational cost.},

abstract={Visual tracking is a fundamental research problem in computer vision field. In this paper, we propose an approach to incorporate visual prior into visual object tracking via deep neural network. Visual prior knowledge is expressed as the parameters of a stacked denoising autoencoder, which is trained from a large collection of natural images. By utilizing natural images, we can obtain generic image features which are more robust against variations. Then we design a classifier for tracking using the same structure as the stacked denoising autoencoder, tracking is then carried out under a particle filter framework by determining the current target's location and updating the parameters. In addition, in order to alleviate the computational burden caused by deep structure, an adaptive updating mechanism is proposed. As a result, we apply a general-to-special strategy for our stacked denoising autoencoder tracker (SDAT), the learned visual prior provides a reasonable initial value for parameters of the neural network, and the deep structure of our tracker is robust to appearance variations. Experiments over 50 challenging videos indicate the effectiveness and robustness of our tracker, and the resulting tracker is outstanding especially against variations with the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

pages={2764-2778},
abstract={One of the most challenging problems in the field of online learning is concept drift, which deeply influences the classification stability of streaming data. If the data stream is imbalanced, it is even more difficult to detect concept drifts and make an online learner adapt to them. Ensemble algorithms have been found effective for the classification of streaming data with concept drift, whereby an individual classifier is built for each incoming data chunk and its associated weight is adjusted to manage the drift. However, it is difficult to adjust the weights to achieve a balance between the stability and adaptability of the ensemble classifiers. In addition, when the data stream is imbalanced, the use of a size-fixed chunk to build a single classifier can create further problems; the data chunk may contain too few or even no minority class samples (i.e., only majority class samples). A classifier built on such a chunk is unstable in the ensemble. In this article, we propose a chunk-based incremental learning method called adaptive chunk-based dynamic weighted majority (ACDWM) to deal with imbalanced streaming data containing concept drift. ACDWM utilizes an ensemble framework by dynamically weighting the individual classifiers according to their classification performance on the current data chunk. The chunk size is adaptively selected by statistical hypothesis tests to access whether the classifier built on the current data chunk is sufficiently stable. ACDWM has four advantages compared with the existing methods as follows: 1) it can maintain stability when processing nondrifted streams and rapidly adapt to the new concept; 2) it is entirely incremental, i.e., no previous data need to be stored; 3) it stores a limited number of classifiers to ensure high efficiency; and 4) it adaptively selects the chunk size in the concept drift environment. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets containing concept drift show that ACDWM outperforms both state-of-the-art chunk-based and online methods.},

abstract={Due to the growing share of wind turbines, the challenges in the maintenance planning of already installed offshore and onshore wind farms are increasing and motivate the author to explore the risk analysis of key components of wind turbines. In this paper, a two-step condition-based maintenance model for wind turbines is proposed. In the first stage, the so-called diagnostic stage, the normal behavior of these components was estimated through a tailor-made artificial neural network. In the second stage, the prognosis stage, the deviation of the real-time measurement data from the estimated values was calculated. If the deviation increases beyond a confidence band, an alarm is triggered and a proposed risk indicator is updated. By increasing the proposed risk indicator, the corresponding anomaly is detected and condition-based maintenance programs can be planned. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated using real data from an offshore wind farm in Germany. By implementing the proposed model using this real-world data, it is shown that the proposed risk indicator is fully consistent with the upcoming wind turbine failures.},

pages={3525-3539},
abstract={Recent studies of imbalanced data classification have shown that the imbalance ratio (IR) is not the only cause of performance loss in a classifier, as other data factors, such as small disjuncts, noise, and overlapping, can also make the problem difficult. The relationship between the IR and other data factors has been demonstrated, but to the best of our knowledge, there is no measurement of the extent to which class imbalance influences the classification performance of imbalanced data. In addition, it is also unknown which data factor serves as the main barrier for classification in a data set. In this article, we focus on the Bayes optimal classifier and examine the influence of class imbalance from a theoretical perspective. We propose an instance measure called the Individual Bayes Imbalance Impact Index (IBI3) and a data measure called the Bayes Imbalance Impact Index (BI3). IBI3 and BI3 reflect the extent of influence using only the imbalance factor, in terms of each minority class sample and the whole data set, respectively. Therefore, IBI3 can be used as an instance complexity measure of imbalance and BI3 as a criterion to demonstrate the degree to which imbalance deteriorates the classification of a data set. We can, therefore, use BI3 to access whether it is worth using imbalance recovery methods, such as sampling or cost-sensitive methods, to recover the performance loss of a classifier. The experiments show that IBI3 is highly consistent with the increase of the prediction score obtained by the imbalance recovery methods and that BI3 is highly consistent with the improvement in the F1 score obtained by the imbalance recovery methods on both synthetic and real benchmark data sets.},

abstract={The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoTs) and pervasive use of many different types of mobile computing devices make wireless communication spectrum a precious resource. In order to accommodate the still fast increasing number of devices requesting wireless connection, more efficient, fine-grained spectrum allocation and sharing schemes are badly in need. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been widely recognized as one promising solution, in which the secondary users (SUs) are allowed to share channels with licensed primary users (PUs) as long as bringing no interference to the normal operations of the PUs. However, malicious attackers or selfish SUs may mimic the behavior of PUs to occupy the channels illegally. It is nontrivial to accurately, timely detect such kind of primary user emulation (PUE) attacks. In this paper, an efficient PUE attacked detection method is introduced leveraging the recurrent neural network (RNN). After a fundamental algorithm using basic RNN, an advanced version taking advantage of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) is proposed, which is more efficient on processing time series with long term memory. The experimental study has provided deeper insights about the different performances the RNNs achieved and validated the effectiveness of the proposed detectors.},

year={2019},
volume={},
number={},
pages={223-230},
abstract={To avoid data loss, data centers adopt disk failure prediction (DFP) technology to raise warnings ahead of actual disk failures, and process the warnings in the order they are raised, i.e., a first-in-first-out (FIFO) warning order. The FIFO-guided warning order can process warnings timely when disk failures are rare in data centers. With the growing scale of data centers, the increasing number of disk failures leads to a complex situation that multiple warnings are raised simultaneously, where the FIFO-guided warning order neither processes warnings timely, nor manages warnings properly due to lack of the priority of warnings. Thus, a real-time and finer-grained priority guidance for warning order management is an urgent need. To this end, we turn our attention to the failures since each warning corresponds to a fail event. The key insight is that the interdependence of failures, i.e., the order failure occurred, indicates the order of warning processing. With an accurate failure order, data centers can decrease the probability of data loss and the downtime of latency-sensitive applications by processing urgent warnings in advance. In this paper, we predict the failure order with a LambdaMART model, which is a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm in information retrieval. To avoid overly concerning on the correctness of high-rank warnings in information retrieval, we design a symmetric metric to evaluate the prediction evaluation of failure order. Experiment on a public dataset, provided by the Backblaze company, shows that our model outperforms the FIFO order and the order from previous DFP models.},

abstract={Flight safety is of vital importance to the aviation industry. As one of the most typical security events, hard landing is extremely concerned by airlines and related studies have received extensive attention in recent years. However, existing regression or risk based models either suffers from low prediction accuracy, or cannot provide good interpretability, making themselves impractical in real applications. To solve these problems, in this paper we propose CurveCluster: a curve clustering-based approach which is able to automatically recognize hard landing patterns from quick access recorder (QAR) data. We first provide a two-level hierarchical classification of hard landing events based on different hard landing patterns. Then we extract curve features from several key QAR parameters through interpolation and resampling. Finally, we apply K-means clustering algorithm on the curve features to automatically recognize the hard landing patterns. We test our approach on a dataset of 9,203 A320 flight QAR data samples and the overall recognition accuracy reaches up to 93.1%. Moreover, our results directly reflect the reasons of different types of hard landing events, which show strong interpretability.},

abstract={The explosive information growth facilitates the generation of increasingly massive streaming data. As a traditional soft computing approach for data analysis, Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) has the severe problem of low efficiency and long time for coping with massive streaming data. Therefore, devising an optimized efficiency algorithm of FCA for attribute-incremental streaming data is becoming a very urgent and challenging issue. In this paper, a quick algorithm on generating concept lattice for attribute-incremental streaming data is presented. Specifically, the correctness of the proposed algorithm is mathematically proved, and several real-world data sets are utilized in our experiments in order to compare with the existing two FCA algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the efficiency for generating concept lattice of attribute-incremental streaming data. Particularly, the running time could be reduced by approximately 44% for Jazz dataset.},

The vector registers are effectively utilized by merging intermediate results in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. In the case of Breadth-first search (BFS) for finding connected components, the evaluation results on large-scale graphs show that our method with a vector architecture achieves 127X and 50X average single-core speedup over spMV and a state-of-the-art spMspV implementation on a X86 architecture. On the same vector architecture, it runs 13X and 9X faster on average than spMV and a baseline spMspV implementation. Compared to a popular computation framework GraphLab on X86, it also realizes 11X average speedup for high-diameter graphs, and 23X for low-diameter graphs with a hybrid strategy. Our method also shows performance superiority in Bellman-Ford single-source-shortest-path (SSSP) algorithm.},

abstract={The critical deterioration of the environment in recent years has led to an increasing urgency of minimizing energy consumption. As residential and tertiary buildings hold a significant potential in terms of energy savings a lot of different approaches have been followed to not only reduce energy consumption but also change energy-related occupant behaviour for long-term results. Taking into account recommendation services through mobile applications, this paper proposes a more dynamic and occupant-centered solution, which not only offers useful energy related recommendations, but also adjusts the moment the recommendation is sent to maximize the receptiveness of the user in order to achieve the optimal energy behavior change. These moments are redefined micro-moments in terms of energy behavior change and occur when three factors' conditions coincide, the location, the physical and the mobile activity of the user. We develop a mobile application which can monitor them and detect a potential micro-moment, when a notification could be pushed to the user. The location is periodically collected from the device's sensors, the physical activity is inferred with the use of Google Activity Recognition API, while the mobile activity is inferred utilizing mobile event triggers and usage statistics. The experimental results show that our dynamic approach is justified, since the micro-moments are highly unpredictable and user-specific.},

abstract={Affective computing is an emerging academic study area in computing technologies. Its purpose is to allow computers to understand emotions as humans do. At present, for affective computing with textual signals, the most common approach is sentiment lexicon approach. The majority of sentiment lexicons are stored in list of words with positivity and negativity. However, the one word might have various sentiment tendencies in various context. This problem can't be solved by these traditional sentiment lexicons which refers to list-based sentiment dictionary in domain of affective computing. In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a new approach that is a tree-based sentiment dictionary. In the tree structure, the similarities between sibling nodes under the same parent node is great but sibling nodes under different parent nodes is small. This paper uses these features to store the item classification in a tree structure and adds the features and sentiment words of the item which are extracted by using syntactic analysis and association rules to the tree structure to form a tree-based sentiment dictionary. In this way, we solve the problem that the one word may have various sentiment tendencies in various context and the problem of finding no sentiment words under the item classification in the dictionary. Comparing with sentiment lexicons, the tree-based sentiment dictionary outperforms for affective computing in the criteria, such as precision, recall, F-measure, etc.},

In this study, we proposed a new method of web service discovery, which is based on the clustering and differential evolution algorithm. To carry out our study, firstly, we clustered the service set and identified the most similar class to narrow down the searching scope by calculating the semantic similarity between each class and the query. Second, the similarities of each service in the target class to the query are calculated by using different measurement methods, including Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Chebyshev distance and Bray Curtis distance. These results are used as the input of the differential evolution algorithm for our iterative simulation. Our findings show that compared with the traditional methods, our proposed approach that integrates the benefits of the clustering and differential evolution algorithm has a lower error, and is more consistent with the users' requirements. More importantly, relevant web services can be retrieved more efficiently and accurately.},

Modern vehicles are generally equipped with many (dozens of, or even hundreds of) electronic and intelligent devices so that drivers can gain a more comfortable driving experience. Protecting this increasingly complex vehicle ecosystem can be an arduous task, especially as the proliferation of data across different connected devices makes them more vulnerable than ever before. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been found extremely helpful in monitoring CAN traffic and detecting potential intrusions. The paper proposes a novel and robust intrusion detection mechanism for in-vehicle CAN network by using spatiotemporal information enabled time series prediction. The proposed IDS analyzes the CAN traffic generated by the in-vehicle network in real time and identifies the abnormal state of the vehicle practically. Our model utilizes substantially both the time and space information of the instructions information sent by the ECUs in detecting the intrusions and thus outperforms the classical Long Short Term Memory model. The intrusion detection mechanism provides strong robustness in the sense that it can perform fast online learning of packet features (while the vehicle is running) to implement new protocols for intrusion detection (enabling to capture the fresh state of the vehicle) if the underlying communication protocol of the vehicle has changed. In particular, the IDS can evolve by itself as exotic environment factors (such as road conditions, atmospheric conditions, etc.) change and manage its model by itself in a self-organized way. Experiment results demonstrate the performance of the model and the effectiveness against both known and unknown attacks.},

abstract={One of the major challenges in intelligent transportation and smart city is efficient assignment of vehicles to satisfy trip demands, and thus to achieve road utilization and energy efficiency. Traditional order-driven dispatches often result in instability of resource utilization toward unsatisfactory user experience and waste in scheduling, due to lacking of knowledge in future trip demands. Accurate and immediate prediction of trip demand of each region is important for coordinating regional autonomous fleet allocation and improving service efficiency. This paper proposes a temporal-spatial prediction model for trip demand based on points of interest (POI) and multivariate long short term memory (MLSTM) model. Parameters of models are trained using heterogeneous data sets. Influence of meteorology information on the reliability of historical trip demand data is considered in temporal prediction, while the regional imbalance caused by POI is considered in spatial prediction. The prediction accuracy of MLSTM is improved when compared with the univariate LSTM. A Beijing taxi trajectory dataset is used to verify the temporal-spatial prediction method.},

abstract={Due to the ever increasing attacks using malicious documents, the detection of such documents has become a serious and urgent research issue. In the past decade, detection of malicious documents has attracted significant research attentions, and many methods have been proposed, including conventional static detection methods, and dynamic detection methods. However, both of the two categories of methods have limitations under either obfuscated or run-time conditions, and can not achieve a satisfactory detection performance for malicious behaviors. In this work, we firstly present a new descriptive structure of our targeted documents, using a two layers abstraction including the structure and the scripting language. We then propose a unified model for malicious documents detection based on two layers of abstraction. A series of experiments under a real world data set with 20,000 samples show that, our proposed model has a better detection performance for all of the four indicators, the accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC of malicious documents simultaneously, when compared to the Hidost model.},

In order to solve these problems, the tracking-learning-detection algorithm for online single-target long-term tracking is used and improved. A novel eye tracking method-the human eye tracking-learning-detection algorithm with tracking feedback is proposed. The detection area is adjusted adaptively and narrowed by the tracking feedback.

abstract={GPU has been applied to many fields for its excellent parallel computing ability, but the complexity of GPU architecture makes it hard to find the performance bottlenecks of GPU applications. Although profiling tools exist, they only provide a large number of data that programmers can not well understand. Some mathematical modelling methods are presented for analysis, but they are often too complicated and time-consuming for users. A performance evaluation method named GPUPerfML is proposed, which combines decision tree and theoretical analytical model to locate performance bottlenecks of GPU applications and guide application optimization. Based on its feature selection, decision tree is used to extract the sorted influential features from a large number of features. The proposed theoretical analysis model defines the categories of performance issues and establishes mapping relationships between features and performance issues, so as to quickly and directly identify performance bottlenecks. Besides, theoretical analysis can be used to guide decision tree building and features analysis, which improves and guarantees the accuracy of the proposed method. The experiments on three common applications (Matrix transpose, Parallel Reduction, and BFS) show that it can identify performance bottlenecks accurately and quickly, to help programmers write high-efficient programs conveniently.},

abstract={Traffic accidents usually lead to severe human casualties and huge economic losses. Timely accurate prediction of traffic accidents has great potential to protect public safety and reduce economic losses. However, it is a nontrivial endeavor to predict traffic accidents due to the complex causality of traffic accidents with multiple factors, the dynamic interactions of the related factors, and the intrinsic complexity of spatio-temporal traffic data. To overcome these difficulties, this paper provides a novel traffic accident prediction method, namely, STENN, which takes multiple information (Spatial distributions, Temporal dynamics, and External factors) into account, and aggregates these factors by a joint Neural Network structure. To evaluate the proposed method, we collect large-scale real-world data, which include accident records, real-time and citi-wide vehicle speeds, road networks, meteorological condition, and Point-of-Interest (POI) distributions. Experiments on the collected data set demonstrate that STENN is able to predict the traffic accidents in a fine-grained level and the prediction of accuracy outperforms four classical baselines.},

abstract={With rapid development of location-based social network, data mining on location check-in records can extract a variety of valuable information. In this paper, we aim at using check-in records and user influence to discover influential areas in social networks. Firstly, user influence is calculated by eigenvector centrality method after comparing different centrality methods. Then, the areas with high check-in density are discovered by density-based clustering algorithm. Finally, influence of each area is obtained by accumulated influence within a cluster. The results suggest that areas with high check-in quantity not necessarily have high influence in social networks, and that some users with extremely high influence can significantly improve the influence of the check-in area. Knowing different areas' influence can help advertisers to better locate advertisements and provide reference to merchant for site selection.},

abstract={Recently, VoIP applications win most of the users' favor with their high service quality and low price. However, owing to the flexible of VoIP services, they will cause incalculable damage if these services are used improperly. In order to make VoIP applications serve humans better, it is important to keep VoIP applications under supervision. The upgrading of VoIP technology makes the traditional identification methods inefficient, it becomes more difficult to identify VoIP traffic. For the challenge of identifying VoIP traffic, the deep learning technology provides us a new solution. With supervised learning method, we can build feature set for identifying VoIP traffic. This way is not only able to find the most useful features, but also it can get rid of human effort in exploring features. In this paper, we adopt CLNN(Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory) to extract features for accurate VoIP application identification. In addition, we design a real-time identification system to capture VoIP traffic in a large-scale network and identify their application types with the features we trained. The evaluation results verify that our system can identify VoIP traffic timely and accurately.},

abstract={With the spread of the number of smart devices in the context of Smart City, Software Defined Networking (SDN) is considered as a vital principle to manage a large-scale heterogeneous network within centralized controller. To deal with cyberattacks against such networks, intrusion detection system (IDS) is built to recognize and alert to the system administrator for further appropriate response. Currently, machine learning-based IDS (ML-IDS) has been explored and is still being developed. However, these systems give a high rate of false alert and are easily deceived by sophisticated attacks such as variants of attacks containing perturbation. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously evaluate and improve these systems by simulating mutation of real-world network attack. Relied on the Generative Discriminative Networks (GANs), we introduce DIGFuPAS, a framework that generates data flow of cyberattacks capable of bypassing ML-IDS. It can generate malicious data streams that mutate from real attack traffic making the IDS undetectable. The generated traffic flow is used to retrain ML-IDS, for improving the robustness of IDS in detecting sophisticated attacks. The experiments are performed and evaluated through 2 criteria: Detection rate (DR) and F1 Score (F1) on the public dataset, named CICIDS2017. DIGFuPAS can be used for continuously pentesting and evaluating IDS‚Äôs capability once integrated as an automated sustainability test pipeline for SDN-enabled networks.},

abstract={Breaches in online contracts (Service Level Agreements, SLAs) are usually compensated by gift vouchers at present, however as the online contracts emerge towards smart contracts, the breaches could potentially lead to court injunctions over blockchains. This research proposes Probability based Factor Model (PFM) that can be implemented over the blockchain to automatically identify breaches that can cause substantial damage and have high probability for recurrence. PFM can also issue court injunctions for the breaches. The underlying concept in PFM is built upon the notion of factor analysis and stochastic modeling from the discipline of Data Science. High performance computing (HPC) cluster at University of Luxembourg (HPC @ Uni.lu) and docker (a software container platform) were used to emulate contractual environment of three service providers: Redis, MongoDB, and Memcached Servers. The results showed that court injunction(s) was issued only for Redis and MongoDB Servers. Technically, this difference could be attributed to the fact that Memcached is simply used for caching and therefore, it is less prone to breach of contract. Whereas, Redis and MongoDB as databases and message brokers are performing more complex operations and are more likely to cause a breach. This research will benefit enterprises that view breach of contract as a limiting factor for implementation of smart contract in cyber-physical system or internet of things.},

Therefore, there has been an increasing need in handling and processing these data efficiently. In this paper, we present our experience in applying unsupervised clustering on PMU data for event characterization on the smart grid. We show that although the PMU data are time series in nature, it is more efficient and robust to apply clustering methods on carefully selected features from the data collected at certain instantaneous moments in time. These features are more representative at the moments when the events have the most impact on the grid. Experiments have been carried out on real PMU data collected by Bonneville Power Administration in their wide-area monitoring system in the pacific northwest, and the results show that our instantaneous clustering method achieves high homogeneity, which provides great potentials for identifying unknown events in the grid without substantial training data.},

abstract={Accurate spatio-temporal traffic forecasting serves as the basis of dynamic strategy and applications for intelligent transportation systems, which is of great practical significance for improving traffic safety and mitigating road congestion. Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been applied to traffic flow forecasting, which exhibits better performance than conventional methods. However, these CNN-based methods typically learn traffic as images to model spatial correlation, which is only applicable to Euclidean grid map data rather than non-Euclidean multi-sensor data. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based temporal attention framework GTA, which considers both spatial and temporal correlation, to forecast traffic flow based on data collected from multiple sensors. More specifically, GTA can better capture spatial dependencies leveraging graph embedding techniques on sensor networks because it preserves more details in the algorithms. We also introduce an attention mechanism to adaptively identify the relations among temporal submodules. Spatio-temporal dependencies are more effectively and comprehensively integrated due to the full use of the topological properties of transportation networks. We evaluate GTA with a large-scale traffic dataset from England and enhance it with topology information. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines.},

Parking Availability can be influenced by many factors such as time of day, day of week, location, nearby events, weather and traffic conditions. Driven by the idea of predicting parking availability to help drivers plan ahead of time, we contribute a Parking Availability Forecasting Model, which uses a time-series analysis and machine-learning algorithms to predict the number of available parking spots at a certain location on a desired date and time.

abstract={Graphics processing units (GPUs) provide high performance at low power consumption as long as resources are well utilized. Thread block size is one factor in determining a kernel's occupancy, which is a metric for measuring GPU utilization. A general guideline is to find the block size that leads to the highest occupancy. However, many combinations of block and grid sizes can provide highest occupancy, but performance can vary significantly between different configurations. This is because variation in thread structure yields different utilization of hardware resources. Thus, optimizing for occupancy alone is insufficient and thread structure must also be considered. It is the programmer's responsibility to set block size, but selecting the right size is not always intuitive. In this paper, we propose using machine learning to automatically select profitable block sizes. Additionally, we show that machine learning techniques coupled with performance counters can provide insight into the underlying reasons for performance variance between different configurations.},

abstract={Predicting the density and flow of the crowd or traffic at a citywide level becomes possible by using the big data and cutting-edge AI technologies. It has been a very significant research topic with high social impact, which can be widely applied to emergency management, traffic regulation, and urban planning. In particular, by meshing a large urban area to a number of fine-grained mesh-grids, citywide crowd and traffic information in a continuous time period can be represented with 4D tensor (Timestep, Height, Width, Channel). Based on this idea, a series of methods have been proposed to address grid-based prediction for citywide crowd and traffic. In this study, we revisit the density and in-out flow prediction problem and publish a new aggregated human mobility dataset generated from a real-world smartphone application. Comparing with the existing ones, our dataset holds several advantages including large mesh-grid number, fine-grained mesh size, and high user sample. Towards this large-scale crowd dataset, we propose a novel deep learning model called DeepCrowd by designing pyramid architectures and high-dimensional attention mechanism based on Convolutional LSTM. Lastly, thorough and comprehensive performance evaluations are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DeepCrowd comparing to multiple state-of-the-art methods.},

In addition, existing work simply depends on empirical analysis, which lacks of useful guidance to performance optimization. In this paper, we propose a new methodology of fine-grained straggler root-cause analysis using machine learning. We collect raw metrics from Spark event log and hardware sampling tool, and refine them into high-level metrics for model learning. Then we present the root-cause analysis of stragglers through CART tree. A customized prune method is also applied to improve analysis accuracy. From the analysis, we derive several new findings beyond the well known causes of stragglers. Our work provides a new perspective on identifying and understanding the inefficiency in parallel data processing programs by applying machine learning techniques to fine-grained root-cause analysis of straggler tasks.},

abstract={A technological revolution is occurring in the field of robotics with the data-driven deep learning technology. However, building datasets for each local robot is laborious. Meanwhile, data islands between local robots make data unable to be utilized collaboratively. To address this issue, the work presents Peer-Assisted Robotic Learning (PARL) in robotics, which is inspired by the peer-assisted learning in cognitive psychology and pedagogy. PARL implements data collaboration with the framework of cloud robotic systems. Both data and models are shared by robots to the cloud after semantic computing and training locally. The cloud converges the data and performs augmentation, integration, and transferring. Finally, fine tune this larger shared dataset in the cloud to local robots. Furthermore, we propose the DAT Network (Data Augmentation and Transferring Network) to implement the data processing in PARL. DAT Network can realize the augmentation of data from multi-local robots. We conduct experiments on a simplified self-driving task for robots (cars). DAT Network has a significant improvement in the augmentation in self-driving scenarios. Along with this, the self-driving experimental results also demonstrate that PARL is capable of improving learning effects with data collaboration of local robots.},

year={2020},

pages={409-416},
abstract={Proxies can provide privacy and anonymity protection for users, but can also be exploited by attackers to hide their malicious behaviors. In order to strengthen the monitoring and management of network, proxy detection has become an urgent and challenging task. Although a great deal of efforts has been made for proxy detection, existing methods mostly rely on the packet-level features of a single flow, such as packet inter-arrival time and payload size. In addition, handling the raw traffic throughout the communication process may lead to user privacy leakage to a certain extent. Considering the use of multi-flow statistics and reducing the invasion of user privacy, in this paper, we propose a machine learning based approach for proxy detection with NetFlow data, which only contains session-level statistical information. We extract features through NetFlow data aggregation to build machine learning model and verify the performances on different combinations of features to get the optimal feature sets. Furthermore, the importance of appropriate time windows and minimum flow numbers of NetFlow data aggregation are demonstrated by comprehensive experiments. Based on the real-world datasets, our detection method can distinguish proxy and normal traffic accurately, and achieve about 96% True Positive Rate(TPR) in our experiments with random forest classifier.},

abstract={Ambient awareness on a sidewalk is critical for safe navigation, especially for the people who are visually impaired. Awareness of obstacles such as debris, potholes, construction site, and traffic movement pattern improve mobility and independence of them. To address this problem, we implemented an interactive and portable sidewalk assistive device (IPSAD). The key idea is to use the power of deep learning to model the ‚Äúobstacles‚Äù on a sidewalk to provide personalized feedback to the user. We focus on transfer learning and fine tuning of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time obstacle recognition that can be deployed in small form factor devices. This approach also account for issues related to the execution time and energy efficiency. We empirically evaluate a number of state-of-the-art architectures to choose the best model based on fewer parameters and lower energy consumption. Finally, we built fully integrated IPSAD prototype on Raspberry Pi3 (RPi3). Audio feedback scheme were implemented to accommodate user preferences and personalization. We perform quantitative evaluation of the prototype system based on the accuracy of the model on Ambient Awareness on Sidewalk (AS) dataset, on-field system performance, data communication, response time (capturing images, recognition of obstacle and feedback), and failure points. Empirical evaluation showed that the accuracy of the model is 87% on the AS dataset and 78.75% on-field system. The system can operate either standalone mode when there is no Internet or cloud mode. In addition, the system can use human intelligence through crowd source and caregiver(s) to assist the users when automated system fails.},

year={2016},

pages={35-41},
abstract={Speculative Multithreading (SpMT) is a thread level automatic parallelization technique to accelerate sequential programs. Machine learning has been successfully introduced into SpMT to improve its performance. An appropriate sample set is important for machine learning-based (ML-based) thread partition. Conventionally, heuristic rules-based (HR-based) sample generation approach can not generate adaptive samples, which conform to ML-based thread partition platform and characteristics of source applications. A hybrid sample generation approach is proposed. With this method, we firstly automatically generate samples which are mips codes consisting spawning points (SP) and control quasi-independent points (CQIP) by heuristic rules, then manually adjust the positions of SP and CQIP and rebuild pre-computation slice (p-slice) to obtain better performance for every application. During the implementation of this approach, three measures: bias weighting, reservation of optimal solutions, summary of greedy rules are carried out. In this way, we enhance the adjustment frequency for the subroutine with high called number, achieving a stable improvement of speedups. On Prophet, which is a generic SpMT processor to evaluate the performance of multithreaded programs, Olden benchmarks are used to realize the approach. Experiments show that the approach can obtain better sample sets, which deliver a better performance improvement of about 10% on a 32 core than conventional heuristic-based approach. Experiments also prove that this approach is effective to get sample sets for ML-based thread partition methods.},

abstract={Modern pattern recognition and artificial intelligence systems can help in providing better health care and medical solutions. The performance of human diagnosis degrades due to fatigue, cognitive biases, systems faults, and distractions. However, artificial intelligence based diagnosis systems are less error prone and give safe support to clinicians in detection and decision making. This work presents a smart and reliable way of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its possible early stage i.e., mild cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease and leads to severe memory loss and inability to cope with daily life tasks. The diagnosis of AD from structural images requires great skill and is challenging for human diagnostics. The presented framework is based on deep learning and detects Alzheimer's and its initial stages accurately from structural MRI scans. The framework analyzes four different classes simultaneously in a single setup. The testing accuracy of diagnosis obtained by the method is 98.88%. Experiments are also performed on binary data and transfer learning is applied for multiclass classification achieving 99.7% accuracy. Once a good trained model is obtained, the decision for an unseen test scan is given within a few seconds. These models are free from the factors that are responsible for causing human diagnostic errors. Therefore, these models are dependable and can provide much faster diagnosis.},

This paper proposes a software defect prediction model based on KPCA-SVM.First, the dimension reduction pretreatment of software defect data sets is carried out.Then, This paper using support vector machines for classification.The accuracy of the model can be improved by keeping global features in the selection of the dimension reduction algorithm.Therefore, the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) algorithm was selected for dimensionality reduction.

In order to predict and monitor the risk situation of the laboratory, various sensors that can detect various harmful elements are needed. There is an inconvenience because it is possible to check and manage the status of each device only through its own application with different manufacturers. Identification and service identification of each device in a laboratory safety management system to which many sensor devices are connected is an important management, security and operational function. The fingerprinting method is used to identify devices in existing routers or gateways. Recently, research has been conducted on applying a machine learning algorithm to solve the disadvantage of being limited to a known device of a fingerprinting method. However, there is a lack of research on fingerprinting for IoT devices such as sensor devices. In this paper, we propose a system that automatically identifies and services IoT devices in a gateway by applying a machine learning algorithm to the fingerprinting analysis method.},

abstract={Multiview video summarization (MVS) has not received much attention from the research community due to inter-view correlations and views' overlapping, etc. The majority of previous MVS works are offline, relying on only summary, and require additional communication bandwidth and transmission time, with no focus on foggy environments. We propose an edge intelligence-based MVS and activity recognition framework that combines artificial intelligence with Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In our framework, resource-constrained devices with cameras use a lightweight CNN-based object detection model to segment multiview videos into shots, followed by mutual information computation that helps in a summary generation. Our system does not rely solely on a summary, but encodes and transmits it to a master device using a neural computing stick for inter-view correlations computation and efficient activity recognition, an approach which saves computation resources, communication bandwidth, and transmission time. Experiments show an increase of 0.4 unit in F-measure on an MVS Office dateset and 0.2% and 2% improved accuracy for UCF-50 and YouTube 11 datesets, respectively, with lower storage and transmission times. The processing time is reduced from 1.23 to 0.45 s for a single frame and optimally 0.75 seconds faster MVS. A new dateset is constructed by synthetically adding fog to an MVS dateset to show the adaptability of our system for both certain and uncertain IoT surveillance environments.},

abstract={Network trustworthiness is a critical component of network security, as it builds on positive inter-actions, guarantees, transparency, and accountability. And with the growth of smart city services and applications, trustworthiness is becoming more important. Most current network trustworthiness solutions are insufficient, particularly for critical infrastructures where end devices are vulnerable and easily hacked. In terms of the energy sector, blockchain technology transforms all currencies into digital modes, thereby allowing one person to manage and exchange energy with others. This has drawn the attention of experts in many fields as a safe, low-cost platform to track billions of transactions in a distributed energy economy. Security and trust issues are still relatively new in the current centralized energy management scheme. With blockchain technology, a decentralized energy infrastructure enables parties to establish micro- grid trading energy transactions and apply artificial intelligence (AI). Using AI in energy systems enables machines to learn various parameters, such as predicted required amounts, excess amounts, and trusted partners. In this article, we envision a cooperative and distributed framework based on cutting-edge computing, communication, and intelligence capabilities such as AI and blockchain in the energy sector to enable secure energy trading, remote monitoring, and trustworthiness. The proposed framework can also enable secure energy trading at the edge devices and among multiple devices. There are also discussions on difficulties, issues, and design principles, as well as spotlights on some of the more popular solutions.},

abstract={Smart lighting systems play a more and more important role in people's work and life, since efficient adaptive and energy-saving lighting control is a necessary way to improve people's quality of life and create an economical, comfortable, and environmentally friendly lighting environment. To improve the energy consumption in an indoor environment and satisfy body comfort, this paper proposes an adaptive and energy-saving smart lighting control algorithm based on a Deep Q-Network algorithm (DQN), wherein the light number, illuminance and body comfort are considered. The proposed algorithm has some research in other fields, but no one has used it in smart lighting control yet, and few people consider body comfort in the existing energysaving control research of smart lighting. The simulation results show that the proposed DQN based control algorithm can save power up to 62% without body comfort loss, compared to the traditional lighting system. Further, there is no additional delay under the proposed control algorithm.},

abstract={Monitoring health and noise pollution in urban environments often entails deploying acoustic sensor networks to passively collect data in public spaces. Although spaces are technically public, people in the environment may not fully realize the degree to which they may be recorded by the sensor network, which may be perceived as a violation of expected privacy. Therefore, we propose a method to anonymize and blur the voices of people recorded in public spaces-a novel, yet increasingly important task as acoustic sensing becomes ubiquitous in sensor-equipped smart cities. This method is analogous to Google's face blurring in its Street View photographs, which arose from similar concerns in the visual domain. The proposed blurring method aims to anonymize voices by removing both the linguistic content and personal identity from voices, while preserving the rest of the acoustic scene.The method consists of a three-step process. First, voices are separated from non-voice content by a deep U-Net source separation model. Second, we evaluate two approaches to obscure the identity and intelligibility of the extracted voices: a low pass filter to remove most of the formants in the voices, and an inversion of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). Finally, the blurred vocal content is mixed with the separated non-vocal signal to reconstruct the acoustic scene. Using background recordings from a real urban acoustic sensor network in New York City, we present a complete evaluation of our method, with automatic speech recognition, speaker identification, sound event detection, and human perceptual evaluation.},

abstract={With the advent of the incorporation of GPS receivers and then GPS-enabled smartphones in transportation data collection, many studies have looked at how to infer meaningful information from this data. Research in this field has concentrated on the use of heuristics and supervised machine learning methods to detect: trip ends, trip itineraries, travel mode and trip purpose. All the methods used until now have depended on methods relying uniquely on fully-validated data. However, respondent burden associated with validation lowers participation rates and results in less reliable data. In this paper, we propose the use of semi-supervised methods that use both validated and un-validated data. We compare the accuracy for two popular supervised methods (i.e. decision tree and random forest) with a simple semi-supervised method (i.e. label propagation with KNN kernel). We use speed, duration and length of trip, as well as proximity of trip start and end points to the transit network to detect mode of transport. The results show that the semi-supervised method slightly outperforms the supervised methods in the presence of high portions of unvalidated data, while run-times of the more efficient of the two supervised methods was on average almost 16 times longer than the average run-times of the semi-supervised method.},

abstract={Human casualties at entertaining, religious, or political events often occur due to lack of proper crowd management. Notably, for the crowd in mobile, a minor accident can create a panic for the people to start stampeding and trampling others. Although many smart video surveillance technologies are recently proposed, it is still very challenging problems to predict a crash in real-time among the mobile crowd for preventing any potential disaster. In this paper, we propose CROMO that enhances crowd mobility characterization through real-time Radio Frequency (RF) data analytics. Inspired by the recent advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technology and machine learning (ML) algorithms, traditional video surveillance technologies make object detection and identification possible in real-time. However, their scalability and capacity lack in a crowded mobile environment. CROMO propose to fill the gap via RF signal analytics. Among the many crowd mobility characteristics, we tackle object group identification, the speed, and direction detection for the mobile group. We also apply them to group semantics to track the crowd status and predict any potential accidents and disasters. Taking advantage of power-efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and ubiquitous availability, we specifically analyze a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. We have tested CROMO in both a practical crowd event and the controlled indoor and outdoor lab environments. The results show that CROMO can detect the direction, the speed, and the density of the mobile crowd in real-time. Therefore, it can help the crowd management in avoiding disasters possibilities at crowd events.},

For the study of two-mode classifiers, the prediction accuracy was found to be 65.71% and 88.00% for motorized and non-motorized trips, respectively. For the four-mode classifiers (bike, bus, drive, and walk), the model correctly predicted 66.67% and 57.14% of the trips for the Drive and Walk modes. The prediction accuracy for Bike and Bus was not as high due to the small number of trips observed in these two modes.

abstract={In ear of smart cities, intelligent medical image recognition technique has become a promising way to solve remote patient diagnosis in IoMT. Although deep learning-based recognition approaches have received great development during the past decade, explainability always acts as a main obstacle to promote recognition approaches to higher levels. Because it is always hard to clearly grasp internal principles of deep learning models. In contrast, the conventional machine learning (CML)-based methods are well explainable, as they give relatively certain meanings to parameters. Motivated by the above view, this paper combines deep learning with the CML, and proposes a hybrid intelligence-driven medical image recognition framework in IoMT. On the one hand, the convolution neural network is utilized to extract deep and abstract features for initial images. On the other hand, the CML-based techniques are employed to reduce dimensions for extracted features and construct a strong classifier that output recognition results. A real dataset about pathologic myopia is selected to establish simulative scenario, in order to assess the proposed recognition framework. Results reveal that the proposal that improves recognition accuracy about two to three percent.},

abstract={A sensor network that connects multiple 3D image sensor devices using light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is effective for collecting spatial information to detect potential risks associated with people‚Äôs movements. However, due to the large volume and high frame rate of point cloud data obtained by LIDAR devices, under the condition of strictly limited bandwidth, some part of the data can go missing when detection is performed from point cloud data, causing a degradation of the accuracy. As the communication traffic volume of other applications increases, the communication available bandwidth for spatial information applications becomes insufficient. This paper proposes a scheme of spatial feature-based prioritization for the transmission of point cloud data with strictly limited communication bandwidth. It estimates how much each piece of point cloud data contributes to the accuracy improvement of a machine learning task for spatial prediction and assigns a higher score to those with a larger contribution. These scores prioritize the control for the transmission of point cloud data from sensor devices to an edge server. Feature selection with machine learning is helpful for estimating data importance. To improve the estimation accuracy, the proposed scheme complements missing entries when performing feature selection. We developed an indoor experimental environment and found that the prediction accuracy was sufficiently maintained compared to two benchmark schemes, random and heuristic, with limited communication bandwidth. Comparison with the perturbation method, which is a conventional method of feature selection, demonstrated the effectiveness to complement missing values in the proposed scheme.},

abstract={Traffic prediction and analysis is an essential task towards intelligent mobility, particularly for path planning and navigation. When the traffic flow starts after the COVID-19 pandemic is subsided, the mobility patterns changes and may become unpredictable or challenging. This problem may be crucial, particularly if many people hurry to single occupancy transport mode. Notably, the rapid development in machine learning with new methods and the emergence of new data sources make it possible to evaluate and predict traffic conditions in smart cities more quickly and precisely. The proposed work is modeled in two-fold manner to investigate the impact of COVID shift in regular urban traffic movements given the particular period of the pre, during, and post lockdown phases. Firstly, the investigation is carried out for time series analysis considering the three phases of lockdown. Secondly, the real-time spatial information is analyzed for different time zones in a day. Notably, this requires a detailed analysis of the heterogeneous and complex input traffic data. Machine learning and advanced deep learning methodologies such as regression models, RNN, variants of LSTM, and GRU is used for analysis in this proposed traffic modeling. Significantly, the least error scores with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) loss of 1.82 is observed for the RNN and GRU models, and 0.058 with the Gradient Boosting regression analysis, respectively.},

Smart City and districts, through the integration of technologies such as Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Electric Vehicles (EVs) represent the future of the urban landscape. This work faces this theme at a district level, considering a residential neighborhood of a big metropolitan area and proposing a model for the development of a Smart Residential District, including RES, loads and EVs. The optimum quantities of installed RES power are calculated through an optimization procedure based on an Artificial Neural Network. In particular, a predictive model based on feed-forward neural network trained with Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation learning algorithm is proposed to forecast solar irradiation and load power consumption. This enables to optimize the self-consumption of electricity produced from renewable sources using EVs batteries, to limit the electrical power exchanged with the grid and the related carbon dioxide emissions.},

abstract={Recent works that utilized deep models have achieved superior results in various image restoration (IR) applications. Such approach is typically supervised, which requires a corpus of training images with distributions similar to the images to be recovered. On the other hand, the shallow methods, which are usually unsupervised remain promising performance in many inverse problems, e.g., image deblurring and image compressive sensing (CS), as they can effectively leverage nonlocal self-similarity priors of natural images. However, most of such methods are patch-based leading to the restored images with various artifacts due to naive patch aggregation in addition to the slow speed. Using either approach alone usually limits performance and generalizability in IR tasks. In this paper, we propose a joint low-rank and deep (LRD) image model, which contains a pair of triply complementary priors, namely, internal and external, shallow and deep, and non-local and local priors. We then propose a novel hybrid plug-and-play (H-PnP) framework based on the LRD model for IR. Following this, a simple yet effective algorithm is developed to solve the proposed H-PnP based IR problems. Extensive experimental results on several representative IR tasks, including image deblurring, image CS and image deblocking, demonstrate that the proposed H-PnP algorithm achieves favorable performance compared to many popular or state-of-the-art IR methods in terms of both objective and visual perception.},

Therefore, we consider an EH relay aided NOMA NB-IoT network in this letter. To reduce the rate variance among NB-IoT devices, we aim to maximize the proportional fairness of data rate across all NB-IoT devices through jointly optimizing the communication resource allocation and successive interference cancellation (SIC) ordering subject to the minimum data rate requirements. Considering the non-convexity of this optimization problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based online optimization algorithm to obtain the sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can efficiently improve the proportional fairness and the total throughput among NB-IoT devices, in comparison with orthogonal multiple access techniques.},

In essence, estimating the quality of wireless links ensures the optimization of several protocols, reduces the end-to-end latency, and increases the reliability and the network lifetime. In this paper, we study the link quality in the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) network by analyzing the received signal strength (RSSI) and error rates. The objective is to understand the temporal properties of these parameters which is important to select the appropriate channels for the critical applications and to enhance the Quality of Service (QoS) of the network. We apply machine learning techniques to a real dataset collected from a testbed IoT network deployed at Grenoble, France. We define five classes and present a classification of the 16 channels by comparing the performances of KNN (k-Nearest Neighbor) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithms.},

abstract={As a part of a larger research project to control an All-terrain Vehicle (ATV) using Machine Learning techniques, this paper discusses the implementation of a base architecture for a Honda Rancher ATV to control the vehicle using digital signals and CAN bus messages. Previous research implemented a CAN network that connects a central processing unit to a throttle controller, a steering module, and a braking system. The previous research successfully accomplished controlling the ATV to move in a Figure-8 pattern backward, but it faced a problem in maintaining a constant speed on different inclined ramps and to make sharp turns going forward. This paper discusses the solutions to control the speed and the handlebar angle. The research includes a closed loop control system to control the ATV speed by getting current speed feedback from the ATV engine velocity sensor. The paper discusses different methodologies to determine the speed including an encoder and Global Positioning System. This paper also describes the problem with the caster angle in the previous studies with respect to the steering angle control. A new design was implemented with an additional servo motor using pulleys and aluminum wire to steer the handlebar as an average human would steer it. Testing demonstrated stable control of the ATV in different environments with the full range motion control of the handlebar.},

abstract={Human activity recognition can be applied to various applications, ranging from intelligent security to medical care. Action recognition via WiFi had caught great attention due to its ubiquity, non-occlusion and privacy preservation. Movement of human body can cause fluctuations in the wireless signal reflection, resulting in fluctuation of channel state information (CSI), which is computed from the received WiFi signal containing detailed information of current channel conditions for different sub-carriers and spatial streams, and this can be used to classify human activities. In this paper, we focus on the human activity recognition problem based on the features extracted from CSI data using deep neural network. First, the application of human activity classification as well as data preprocessing techniques are introduced in details, and then a fully connected network is developed as the baseline network model. Furthermore, the weight sharing technique is introduced with the similarity network structure, and a new hybrid loss containing the classification loss and similarity loss is proposed. Experiment results are also included and show that the proposed network can achieve higher classification accuracy than the baseline model.},

abstract={Conventional facial expression recognition methods usually deal with frontal face images via only one or several features, which are easy to loss useful information and sensitive to face poses, scales and noise. As an interesting application of facial expression, this paper proposes an effective smile detection method under unconstrained scenarios, employing convolution neural network to learn and automatically extract discriminative features from a large number of human face images. Specifically, our method firstly converts the original color images to grayscale images, and due to the important role of mouth in expression analysis, we then localizes the mouth region according to 5 key points on the face. After the brightness adjustment and size normalization, the mouth images are input as training images of an improved LeNet-5 model to learn and automatically extract the discriminative features of the mouth regions. Finally, a SVM classifier is trained to distinguish smiling or non-smiling. Experimental results of the public MTFL database and GENKI-4K database show that the accuracy rates of our method are up to 87.81% and 86.80%, respectively.},

In this paper, we propose a novel attributed network embedding method based on a Siamese neural network, named SANE, to capture both the network structure and node attribute information in a principled way. Specifically, to preserve local semantic proximity, we adopt a Siamese neural network, which can directly learn the similarity of paired nodes with their attributes as input. Then, a skip-gram module is connected with the final shared hidden layer to capture high-order proximity based on the latent representation of node attributes. Thus, we can learn the complex interrelations between nodes. Empirically, we evaluate our model on several real-world datasets and the experimental results have verified the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

abstract={Gastric cancer is one of the common malignant tumor diseases, with its incidence increasing year after year. The primary issue of preventing gastric cancer is to assess its risk level. Most of the current approaches merely contain histological and demographic information for cancer risk assessment. However, the factors of patient-based information, such as family history, diet, high-risk habits and exposure to environmental carcinogens are often not considered in cancer prediction. To address the issue, we present a fully connected neural network method with weighted neighborhood feature (WNF-FCNN) to improve the accuracy of gastric cancer risk prediction based on patient-based information. We first adopt two feature selection schemes to choose weighted neighborhood feature from the 121 raw medical attributes about gastric cancer. Then, a four-layer FCNN is constructed to model the risk level of gastric cancer with Adam optimization algorithm being used to speed up the convergence during training stages. Empirical evaluations on a real hospital cancer medical dataset containing 50,611 records demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach. The results show that our approach is viable to assess individual gastric cancer risk using patient-based information, with the accuracy rate of 96.2%. Our experimental results also show that the neural network-based approach outperforms other competing approaches in terms of prediction accuracy.},

abstract={Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is an artificial intelligence approach inspired by mammalian brain. Recent research has explored SNNs in Network-on-Chip (NoC) electronic circuits with the aim to deal with spatiotemporal dynamic tasks in real time. For the NoC-based hardware SNNs, their interconnections are suffering from large area overhead and power consumption due to the numerous buffers and complex structures of routers. This paper presents a novel Multi-Ring Interconnected Architecture (MRIA) to address this problem. Specifically, multiple unidirectional ring topologies are incorporated in MRIA to simplify the routers' crossbar switches, control logic and routing calculation units, and to decrease the interconnections' hardware area and power consumption. In addition, many buffers are also eliminated to further reduce interconnection costs. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to prior approaches, the proposed MRIA achieves average 20.3X and 7.9X reductions for the router area and power, respectively. Meantime, a high throughput of two million spikes per second is obtained.},

abstract={High-resolution scattered data restoration is vital for series analysis of imaging through scattering medium.

Thus, learning based networks are applied to do image restoration through different random scattering mediums. In this work, we develop a novel dual-loss path networks fusion architecture for scattered image restoration focusing on improving reconstructed image details and the edge information. Our architecture consists of dual-loss path of convolution neural network (CNN) modules. In particular, we use the perceptual loss to extract the high level feature images, and the objective loss to extract the low level feature images, individually. After the both low level and high level feature manners are reconstructed by dual-path CNNs model, we use our proposed fusion method to combine them in frequency domain. Our network architecture is verified effective on two kinds of public datasets (MINST and Fashion-MINST). The experimental results show that our proposed method achieving better restoration than common CNN methods especially in the edges and the corner information of the predicted images.},

abstract={Business outliers can influence the development of a company negatively. Detecting the outliers is always an essential topic. Traditionally, the outlier detection can be completed by using statistical analysis software or just manual analysis. Low efficiency is one of the disadvantages of such an approach. In this research, an outlier detection algorithm is established through combining three different types of approaches with a creative computing method. The hybrid business outlier detection algorithm uses the statistical approach to pre-process the data, PCA algorithm to discover the main components and BP neural network to complete the outliers separating. Each part can reach an efficient working condition in an appropriate place in this algorithm. Meanwhile, BP neural network and PCA can improve the accuracy of the outlier detecting results.},

abstract={User Generated Content (UGC) videos have become very popular since the birth of web services such as YouTube and Youku allowing users to upload, view and share videos in an efficient manner. It is intriguing to study the distribution service of UGC videos for the rapidly increasing number of users with satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we conduct extensive measurement of a real-world online UGC video system to study the properties of UGC videos. We summarize important characteristics in terms of correlation analysis, including temporal locality, geographic locality and propagation locality. We then propose a video popularity prediction framework based on a recurrent neural network. Furthermore, we design a content and network aware replication and scheduling mechanism, namely CNARS, to serve the distribution of UGC videos. Our trace-driven experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CNARS, which significantly improves the hit ratio at edge data centers, lowers the average transmission distance and alleviates the server load for origin site against traditional approaches.},

abstract={Ultrasound image segmentation plays an important role in judgement of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Compared with the traditional convolutional neural network, the fully convolutional networks has better sparsity, higher precision and faster training speed. In this paper, we develop an 8-layer fully convolutional networks for ultrasound image segmentation of thyroid nodules, which is called FCN-Thyroid Nodules, or FCN-TN for short. We constructed a data set with 300 images to train FCN-TN. Each nodule is delineated by expert and served as ground truth for making comparison. The segmentation accuracy of 91% is obtained on the proposed network with 100 test images, which indicates that the fully convolutional networks has great potential in the field of ultrasound image segmentation of thyroid nodules.},

abstract={As an important biometric, gait has been extensively used for human recognition. Currently gait analysis based on 3D skeleton data are more commonly studied due to its accuracy, succinctness, and view-invariant representation. Traditional methods generally extract geometric features of human body and temporal dynamics characteristic. However, designing features from ad-hoc schemes mainly is based on experience, and thus it is difficult to obtain high-dimensional features beyond the limits of human interpretability. In this paper, considering that Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) recurrent neural network can model the long-term contextual information of time sequences well, we first propose a dynamic approach to LSTM network for gait recognition from skeleton data. These skeleton data is essentially the discriminative information without extracting any hand-crafted features in advance. The framework is able to process sequences with variable length. Our experiments based on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed gait recognition method is effective and outperformed those in literature.},

abstract={This paper studies Bayesian network parameter learning from small data sets. Among existing techniques for parameter estimation in Bayesian network, qualitative maximum a posterior (QMAP) is state-of-the-art for small data sets. However, the uncertainty of pseudo prior statistic counts and the interference information in the broad prior constraints given by domain experts limit its performance. To further improve the learning accuracy and to eliminate interference information from given constraints, a self-adapted and filtered QMAP (SFQMAP) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm improves the learning performance by exploiting proper quantities of pseudo prior statistic count and applying the filtration model in QMAP. Via experiments on a series of examples we demonstrate that our approach is significantly more accurate than existing techniques for parameter learning from small data sets.},

abstract={Recognizing the states of household appliance is helpful to monitor the power consumption and model user behaviors at home. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) receives widespread attention as it can identify a individual appliance state using a single sensor. However, presented approaches today can not be adopted in actual home scenarios because they either ignore the energy limitation of sensors or require a complex user configuration. To solve this problem, this paper proposes IEHouse which is a Non-Intrusive Household Appliance State Recognition System. It leverages a supervised learning process over the labeled appliance data sets which can be constructed dynamically based on a small number of appliance profiles. It uses Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models, to identify appliance states and improves the accuracy through online learning gradually. By simulating a common household scenario, the energy consumption of sampling sensor is 5.12fcJ per week and the average accuracy of recognizing 10 mixed typical appliance states is 92.9%, which achieves better accuracy with low energy.},

abstract={With the development of Internet based services, the requirement of keeping keep their vitality and the user viscosity has become an important challenge. Better understanding of users behaviour is an effective way to improve the services lifecycle management. As such analysis of users experience from web log, questionnaire and some other ways have been attached much importance. From previous studies it is realised that users personal information is a key data for such analysis. However, due to privacy protection or other security reasons, it is difficult to obtain the users personal profiling. In this research we propose a classification method to predict users age and activity by analysing their questionnaires on certain App services. BP neural network classification approach is employed to this end. We further adopt principal component analysis (PCA) to treat the input data before the predicting model's training process. The experimental study of proposed method on WeChat payment user experience rating data has shown its possible potential in improving the classifying prediction accuracy.},
