abstract = {With teacher quality repeatedly cited as the most important schooling factor influencing student achievement, there has been increased interest in examining the efficacy of teacher training programs. This paper presents the results of research investigating the relationship between teachers who graduate from different training programs and student achievement on state reading and math tests. Using a novel methodology that allows teacher training effects to decay, we find that training institution indicators explain a statistically significant portion of the variation in student achievement in reading, but not in math. Moreover, there is evidence that graduates from some specific training programs are differentially effective at teaching reading than the average teacher trained out-of-state and that these differences are large enough to be educationally meaningful.}

The present research used a comprehensive Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) approach to represent interviews with patients suffering from schizophrenia (N=35) and with healthy people (N=35). We compared its results to the approach described by Bedi et al. (2015), referred to here as the coherence model. Evaluations were also performed by a clinician using the Scale for the Assessment of Thought, Language and Communication (TLC). Using all six TLC questions the ELMo obtained an accuracy of 80% in distinguishing patients from healthy people. Previously used coherence models were less accurate at 70%. The classifying clinician was accurate 74% of the time. Our analysis shows that both ELMo and TLC are sensitive to the symptoms of disorganization in patients. In this study methods using text representations from language models were more accurate than those based solely on the assessment of FTD, and can be used as measures of disordered language that complement human clinical ratings.}

abstract = {Background
Oral-Diadochokinesis (oral-DDK) tasks measure how quickly and accurately one can repeat a series of target sounds. Thus, they are a popular tool for evaluating oral-motor skills for individuals with various speech disorders. Typically, oral-DDK tasks involve rapid repetition of non-words. For several populations (e.g., young children, older adults), it has been suggested that repetitions of real words may be more suitable, commonly resulting in faster rates. Yet, the literature is either silent or inconsistent regarding this real-word repetition advantage for other age groups, from preschoolers to young adults. It is not clear whether performance accuracy is affected as well. Specifically, for Hebrew speakers, this data is missing.
Aims
The goal of this study was to compare rate and accuracy for non-word and real-word repetition, in four groups of Hebrew-speaking individuals; preschoolers (5 years old), younger elementary school children (7 years old), adolescents (15 years old) and young adults (25 years old). Secondary goals were to provide a developmental pattern for oral-DDK rates for Hebrew speakers, and to compare it to the English norms.
Methods & Procedures
All participants (n=150) had typical speech and language development. They were asked to repeat “pataka” (non-word) and “bodeket” (Hebrew real word) as quickly and accurately as possible for 10 sec. Production rates (syllables per second) and accuracy (on a 5-point scale) were measured.
Outcomes & Results
As expected, oral-DDK rates gradually increased with age, with similar rates for both real- and non-words. Accuracy scores were higher for real- than non-word repetition, across all age groups. For the group of school-age children, the Hebrew rates differed from the English ones.
Conclusions & Implications
A real-word repetition advantage was documented only for repetition accuracy, but not for rate. These findings can be explained as each stimulus involves different demands on an individual's neuro-motor and linguistic processing abilities. Further research using real- and non-word tasks should be conducted with clinical populations to assess whether both procedures could assist in differential diagnosis between various speech disorders. Finally, the large differences between children of different ages, as well as the apparent rate differences between Hebrew and English, highlight the need to create age- and language-sensitive norms.}

This has led to the exploration of alternative sound perception methods involving training of vibrotactile discrimination of sounds within the language spectrum. In particular, stimulus duration plays an important role in linguistic categorical perception. We comparatively evaluated vibrotactile temporal discrimination of sound and how specific training can modify the underlying electrical brain activity. Fifteen profoundly deaf (PD) and 15 normal-hearing (NH) subjects performed a vibrotactile oddball task with simultaneous EEG recording, before and after a short training period (5 one-hour sessions; in 2.5–3 weeks). The stimuli consisted of 700 Hz pure-tones with different duration (target: long 500 ms; non-target: short 250 ms). The sound-wave stimuli were delivered by a small device worn on the right index finger. A similar behavioral training effect was observed in both groups showing significant improvement in sound-duration discrimination. However, quantitative EEG measurements reveal distinct neurophysiological patterns characterized by higher and more diffuse delta band magnitudes in the PD group, together with a generalized decrement in absolute power in both groups that might reflect a facilitating process associated to learning. Furthermore, training-related changes were found in the beta-band in NH. Findings suggest PD have different cognitive adaptive mechanisms which are not a mere amplification effect due to greater cortical excitability.}

We examined the effect of learning context on encoding, immediate recall and integration of new vocabulary into semantic memory by contrasting categorically related (novel names for familiar concepts blocked by semantic category) and unrelated (mixed semantic categories) learning contexts. Two learning sessions were conducted 24 hours apart, with each participant exposed to both contexts. Subsequently, a test phase examined picture naming, translation and picture-word interference tasks. Compared to the unrelated context, the categorically related context resulted in poorer naming accuracy in the learning phase, slower response latencies at the immediate recall tasks and greater semantic interference in the picture-word interference task (picture naming in L1 with semantically related novel word distractors). We develop a theoretical account of word learning that attributes observed differences to episodic rather than semantic memory.}

As a consequence, children become actors in world where they use passwords to authenticate themselves from a very young age. As such, there is a need for guidance to inform educators and parents about how to prepare children for responsible password practice. Very little attention has been paid to determining which password-related principles young children should know, and the age at which this information should be imparted. To address this deficiency, we commenced by deriving an ontology of “best practice” password principles from official sources. These password principles encode essential knowledge for password users of all ages and provide a benchmark that can be used to ground a set of age-appropriate ontologies. We compared this benchmark “good practice” ontology to the advice provided by a wide-ranging snapshot of password-related children’s books and parents’ online resources. We then consulted the research literature to identify the skills required to understand and apply each principle, and removed those that were unsuitable for young children. We then consulted parents of young children to help us to confirm the classification of the ontology’s principles in terms of age appropriateness. Parents also helped us to rephrase each principle to maximise accessibility and understandability for each age group. We conclude with our final set of three age-appropriate password best practice ontologies as a helpful resource for early education professionals and parents.}

We find that hyperlexia, or a hyperlexic-like profile, characterises a substantial portion of the autistic spectrum, in which the subcomponents of the typical reading architecture are altered and dissociated. Autistic children follow a chronologically inverted path when learning to read, and make extended use of the perceptual expertise system, specifically the visual word form recognition systems. We conclude by discussing the possible use of hyperlexic skills in intervention.}

A recent clinical trial (Andrews et al., 2012) showed Syllable Timed Speech (STS) to be a potentially useful treatment agent for the reduction of stuttering for school-age children. The present trial investigated a modified version of this program that incorporated parent verbal contingencies.
Methods
Participants were 22 stuttering children aged 6–11 years. Treatment involved training the children and their parents to use STS in conversation. Parents were also taught to use verbal contingencies in response to their child’s stuttered and stutter-free speech and to praise their child’s use of STS. Outcome assessments were conducted pre-treatment, at the completion of Stage 1 of the program and 6 months and 12 months after Stage 1 completion.
Results
Outcomes are reported for the 19 children who completed Stage 1 of the program. The group mean percent stuttering reduction was 77% from pre-treatment to 12 months post-treatment, and 82% with the two least responsive participants removed. There was considerable variation in response to the treatment. Eleven of the children showed reduced avoidance of speaking situations and 18 were more satisfied with their fluency post-treatment. However, there was some suggestion that stuttering control was not sufficient to fully eliminate situation avoidance for the children.
Conclusions
The results of this trial are sufficiently encouraging to warrant further clinical trials of the method.}

As Gutknecht (2001) claims, the translation theorists have made little systematic use of the techniques and insights of contemporary linguistics. However, two points must be emphasized: (1) although translation has existed for many centuries, it was not until the second half of this century that ‘Translation Studies’ developed into a discipline in its own right, and (2) although translation has taken on concepts and methods of other disciplines, “it is still conceived as a subdiscipline of applied linguistics” (Schaffner, 2004, p. 2). On the other hand, the past fifteen years or so have seen the focus of translation studies shift away from linguistics and increasingly to forms of cultural studies. There has also been a shift towards studies that have incorporated models from functional linguistics and Critical Discourse Analysis, locating the text within its sociocultural context. More recently, technological advances, which have transformed the working conditions of professional translators and researchers and have spawned new forms of translation, have also produced new areas of research, some linked to the effects of globalization and some to forms of intersemiotic translation. The present study, therefore, attempts to outline the scope of the discipline of translation studies (TS), to give some indication of the kind of work that has been done so far. More importantly, it is an attempt to demonstrate that (TS) is a vastly complex field with many far-reaching ramifications.}

abstract = {Purpose
Previous studies have reported that the planum temporale – a language-related structure that normally shows a leftward asymmetry – had reduced asymmetry in people who stutter (PWS) and reversed asymmetry in those with severe stuttering. These findings are consistent with the theory that altered language lateralization may be a cause or consequence of stuttering. Here, we re-examined these findings in a larger sample of PWS.
Methods
We evaluated planum temporale asymmetry in structural MRI scans obtained from 67 PWS and 63 age-matched controls using: 1) manual measurements of the surface area; 2) voxel-based morphometry to automatically calculate grey matter density. We examined the influences of gender, age, and stuttering severity on planum temporale asymmetry.
Results
The size of the planum temporale and its asymmetry were not different in PWS compared with Controls using either the manual or the automated method. Both groups showed a significant leftwards asymmetry on average (about one-third of PWS and Controls showed rightward asymmetry). Importantly, and contrary to previous reports, the degree of asymmetry was not related to stuttering severity. In the manual measurements, women who stutter had a tendency towards rightwards asymmetry but men who stutter showed the same degree of leftwards asymmetry as male Controls. In the automated measurements, Controls showed a significant increase in leftwards asymmetry with age but this relationship was not observed in PWS.
Conclusions
We conclude that reduced planum temporale asymmetry is not a prominent feature of the brain in PWS and that the asymmetry is unrelated to stuttering severity.}

We report the findings from a systematic survey of research on non-parental interventions, with the goal of identifying strengths and weaknesses in current literature which can inform current practice and also guide the design of future research.

The studies reviewed include some well-documented and validated intervention strategies that have potential to be useful for addressing the word gap. This survey of the literature exposes gaps in the knowledge base about language interventions for infants and toddlers.

This work describes an extensive systematic literature review on assessment instruments for dementia in persons with intellectual disability (ID). Existing instruments for the detection of dementia in persons with ID were collected and described systematically. This allows a direct and quick overview of available tools. Additionally, it contributes to the availability and usability of information about these instruments, thus enhancing further developments in this field.
Methods
A systematic literature search in five databases (CINAHL, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) was conducted. In order to include gray literature an invisible college approach was used. Relevant studies were identified and selected using defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the selection process all instruments were coded and classified. It was determined which concepts they assess, whether they were especially developed or adapted for persons with ID, and whether they were designed to assess dementia. The selection of relevant papers, as well as the coding of instruments was done independently by two researchers.
Results
In total, 97 records met the search criteria. Out of these, 114 different instruments were extracted. There were 79 instruments to be completed by the person with ID, and 35 informant-based instruments. Additionally, four test batteries were found. Some of these instruments were neither designed for the assessment of dementia, nor for persons with ID.
Conclusions
There are a variety of different tools used for the assessment of dementia in ID. Nevertheless, an agreed-upon approach or instrument is missing. Establishing this would improve the quality of assessment in clinical practice, and benefit research. Data collected would become comparable and combinable, and allow research to have more informative value.}

We tested “the Galker test”, a speech reception in noise test developed for primary care for Danish preschool children, to explore if the children's ability to hear and understand speech was associated with gender, age, middle ear status, and the level of background noise.
Methods
The Galker test is a 35-item audio-visual, computerized word discrimination test in background noise. Included were 370 normally developed children attending day care center. The children were examined with the Galker test, tympanometry, audiometry, and the Reynell test of verbal comprehension. Parents and daycare teachers completed questionnaires on the children's ability to hear and understand speech. As most of the variables were not assessed using interval scales, non-parametric statistics (Goodman–Kruskal's gamma) were used for analyzing associations with the Galker test score. For comparisons, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. Interrelations were adjusted for using a non-parametric graphic model.
Results
In unadjusted analyses, the Galker test was associated with gender, age group, language development (Reynell revised scale), audiometry, and tympanometry. The Galker score was also associated with the parents’ and day care teachers’ reports on the children's vocabulary, sentence construction, and pronunciation. Type B tympanograms were associated with a mean hearing 5–6dB below that of than type A, C1, or C2. In the graphic analysis, Galker scores were closely and significantly related to Reynell test scores (Gamma (G)=0.35), the children's age group (G=0.33), and the day care teachers’ assessment of the children's vocabulary (G=0.26).
Conclusions
The Galker test of speech reception in noise appears promising as an easy and quick tool for evaluating preschool children's understanding of spoken words in noise, and it correlated well with the day care teachers’ reports and less with the parents’ reports.}

abstract = {Background
given the lack of sufficient information and research about phonological acquisition in the Kurdish language, the aim of this study was to examine phonological acquisition in typically developing Kurdish-speaking children. Three analyses were performed: (1) the age of customary, acquisition and mastery production of Kurdish consonants; (2) phonological accuracy and the age of phonological pattern suppression; and (3) effect of age and sex on speech sound acquisition.
Methods
this research assessed 120 monolingual Kurdish-speaking children aged 3;0 to 5;0 years. The participants were selected randomly from the health center of Bukan city, Iran. Acquisition of 29 Kurdish consonants was assessed using the Kurdish Speech Test.
Findings
results found that Kurdish-speaking children had acquired all the vowels before 3;0 and all the consonants in the three positions of initial, medial and final up to 4;6 years old, with the exception of /ʤ/ in initial position, /ɣ/ in medial position and /ʒ/, /z/, /ɡ/, /ɣ/ in final position. Consonant production in initial position was more accurate than in medial and final positions. The accuracy of Kurdish vowels and consonants improves with increasing age as phonological patterns decrease. There was no significant sex difference within the age groups; however, overall, a statistically significant difference was noted for fricative production and for production of word final consonants in the older groups with females outperforming males.
Conclusions
the present study is the first investigation of speech sound acquisition in Kurdish-speaking children. Knowledge of typical speech sound acquisition provides a basis for speech-language pathologists working with Kurdish-speaking children to differentiate children with typical development from those with speech delays and speech sound disorders.}

We used the computationally specified ‘Theory of Visual Attention’ together with whole- and partial-report paradigms to compare attentional sub-mechanisms of pre- (n=33) and full-term (n=32) born adults. Resting-state fMRI was used to evaluate both between-group differences and inter-individual variance in changed functional connectivity of intrinsic brain networks relevant for visual attention.

Furthermore, changed functional connectivity was found in unimodal visual and supramodal attention-related intrinsic networks.

These findings provide first evidence for selectively changed attentional sub-mechanisms in preterm born adults and their relation to altered intrinsic brain networks. In particular, data suggest that cortical changes in intrinsic functional connectivity may compensate adverse developmental consequences of prematurity on visual short-term storage capacity.}

They obtained verbatim data from semi-structured interviews with eight participants recruited from London-based Chinese and church communities in Britain. They analyzed the data using the principles of Grounded Theory and in-depth content analysis. They examined cultural idioms in participants' accounts. Findings suggested that Western diagnostic categories of mental illness were alien to participants. They had a culturally constructed way of defining and characterizing mental illness. Participants used idioms of ‘nerve’, ‘mood’, ‘behavior’, ‘personality’, ‘normal life’, ‘compassion’ and the idiom of ‘others’ to construct an alternative world for stigma management. They erected an invisible but permeable barrier to limit access to their normal world. The role of traditional Chinese culture of Confucianism was significant in shaping perceptions and conceptions of mental illness. This article offered another perspective on the alternative world of Chinese migrants' cultural understandings of mental illness, an area with limited understanding at present. The authors discussed important implications for future research and social policy.}

abstract = {Purpose
The Italian version (Granocchio et al., 2019) of the protocol proposed by Robbins and Klee (1987) allows the assessment of structure of the vocal tract, oromotor and oro-phonatory ability, and articulatory diadochokinesis in children. The aim of this study was to collect the first normative sample of Italian children.
Methods
We measured the total structural score (TSS), total functional score (TFS), oral function score (OFS), phonatory function score (PFS), maximum phonation time (MPT), speed of monosyllable repetition (SMR), and speed of polysyllable repetition (SPR) in 191 typically developing Italian children aged 2.6–6.11 years.
Results
Like the finding observed in the original protocol, there were no significant age-related changes in TSS, but the correlation was observed for TFS, OFS, PFS, MPT, SMR and SPR. The Inter-observer agreement was “good” or “excellent” for all scores except for SPR that was “moderate”.
Conclusions
The increase in oro-motor, oro-phonatory and diadochokinetic abilities confirmed the progressive maturation of these functions with age. The protocol can therefore be considered a useful instrument to classify speech sound disorders (SSDs) by excluding alterations in anatomical structures and evaluate the motor impairment. This normative sample of Italian children allows to use these measures for diagnostic purposes in young Italian speakers.}

The aim was to compare real-time language/cognitive processing in picture naming in adults who stutter (AWS) versus typically-fluent adults (TFA).
Methods
Participants named pictures preceded by masked prime words. Primes and target picture labels were identical or mismatched. Priming effects on naming and picture-elicited ERP activity were analyzed. Vocabulary knowledge correlations with these measures were assessed.
Results
Priming improved naming RTs and accuracy in both groups. RTs were longer for AWS, and correlated positively with receptive vocabulary in TFA. Electrophysiologically, posterior-P1 amplitude negatively correlated with expressive vocabulary in TFA versus receptive vocabulary in AWS. Frontal/temporal-P1 amplitude correlated positively with expressive vocabulary in AWS. Identity priming enhanced frontal/posterior-N2 amplitude in both groups, and attenuated P280 amplitude in AWS. N400 priming was topographically-restricted in AWS.
Conclusions
Results suggest that conceptual knowledge was perceptually-grounded in expressive vocabulary in TFA versus receptive vocabulary in AWS. Poorer expressive vocabulary in AWS was potentially associated with greater suppression of irrelevant conceptual information. Priming enhanced N2-indexed cognitive control and visual attention in both groups. P280-indexed focal attention attenuated with priming in AWS only. Topographically-restricted N400 priming suggests that lemma/word form connections were weaker in AWS.
Significance
Real-time language/cognitive processing in picture naming operates differently in AWS.}

The reliability, including internal consistency and test-retest reliability, of the Chinese version of the EmQue-CA was acceptable. Concurrent validity was assessed by examining the correlations of the EmQue-CA with the Basic Empathy Scale and the prosocial behavior subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, with significant associations delivered. The results of convergent validity demonstrated strong correlations of the EmQue-CA subscales with callous unemotional traits and bullying. For the measurement invariance across gender, configural invariance and metric invariance were supported by the data, while scalar invariance failed.

Analyze the characteristics and rate of disfluency clusters in adults with and without neurogenic stuttering after traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Method
Twenty adults with TBI participated in this study, including 10 with neurogenic stuttering (Group B) and 10 without -stuttering (Group A). Disfluency clusters in speech samples were classified into three types: Stuttering-like (SLD), other (OD), and mixed (MIX).
Results
Speakers with and without neurogenic stuttering produced the same mean number of disfluency clusters. In addition, the mean length of clusters did not differ between these speaker groups although the longest clusters did. The most frequently occurring cluster type for people with neurogenic stuttering was MIX and OD for people without stuttering. Although the speakers in Group A produced stuttering-like disfluencies, these never occurred together to form a SLD type cluster. For Group B, the starter units of the clusters were usually stuttering-like disfluencies, while for Group A, the starter units were mostly interruptions.
Conclusions
Compared to non-stuttering speakers, stuttering after TBI did not increase the number of clusters, but rather lengthened them. In speakers with neurogenic stuttering, the number and length of clusters were related to the manifestation of other communication deficits, not to the frequency of stuttering-like disfluencies. Still, SLD clusters occurred only in those people with neurogenic stuttering. These findings raise questions about the nature of both neurogenic stuttering and the dynamics of disfluency clustering.}

abstract = {Summary
Objectives
The introduction of prenatal cfDNA screening for fetal aneuploidy and other genetic conditions has exacerbated concerns about informed decision-making in clinical prenatal testing. To assess the information provided to patients to facilitate decisions about cfDNA screening, we collected written patient education and consent documents created by laboratories and clinics.
Methods
Informed consent documents (IC) were coded by two independent coders. Each IC was assessed for readability, attention to elements of informed consent, and completeness of information about the test and the screened conditions.
Results
We found variance between IC produced by commercial laboratories versus those provided by local clinics or health care systems, and considerable variance among materials from all sources. “Commercial” IC were longer and written at a more difficult reading level than “non-commercial” IC, and were less likely to state explicitly that cfDNA only screens for certain conditions. About one-third of IC were combined with laboratory order forms. Though most IC recommended confirmatory testing for positive results, only about half clearly stated that results could be incorrect — including mentions of false positives or false negatives. About one-third of IC explicitly stated that cfDNA screening was optional. While nearly all IC from any source listed the conditions screened by the test, only about half of the IC included any phenotypic descriptions of these conditions. Few IC mentioned psychosocial considerations, and only one IC mentioned the availability of support groups for families of children with genetic conditions.
Conclusions
Based on our findings, we recommend that written and well-informed consent be sought before performing cfDNA screening, and we offer minimal and recommended standards for patient education and consent materials.
Résumé
Objectifs
L’introduction du dépistage prénatal cfDNA aneuploïdie fœtale et d’autres maladies génétiques a exacerbé des préoccupations au sujet de prise de décisions éclairée dans les cliniques de dépistage prénatal. Afin d’évaluer les informations fournies aux patients pour faciliter les décisions sur le dépistage de la cfDNA, nous avons recueilli la documentation aux patients et les consentements écrits émanant des laboratoires et des cliniques.
Méthodes
Les documents de consentement éclairé (IC) ont été codés par deux programmeurs indépendants. Chaque IC a été évalué pour sa lisibilité, pour les éléments du consentement éclairé et l’exhaustivité des informations sur le test et les conditions de dépistage.
Résultats
Nous avons trouvé des différences entre les IC produits par les laboratoires commerciaux par rapport à ceux fournis par les cliniques locales ou des systèmes de soins de santé et une variance considérable entre les matériaux de toutes les sources. Les IC « Commerciaux » étaient plus longs et rédigés à un niveau de lecture plus difficile que les IC « non commerciaux » et étaient moins susceptible de statuer explicitement sur le statut de dépistage du cfDNA seulement sous certaines conditions. Environ un tiers des IC ont été combinés avec les bons de commande de laboratoire. Si la plupart des IC recommandaient des tests de confirmation pour des résultats sûrs, seulement environ la moitié a clairement indiqué que les résultats pourraient être incorrects — en incluant les mentions de faux positifs ou faux négatifs. Environ un tiers des IC a explicitement déclaré que le dépistage cfDNA était facultatif. Tandis que presque tous les IC de n’importe quelle source répertoriaient les conditions examinées par le test, seulement environ la moitié des IC incluait une description phénotypique de ces conditions. Peu d’IC ont mentionné les facteurs psychosociaux et seul un IC a mentionné l’existence de groupes de soutien pour les familles des enfants atteints de maladies génétiques.
Conclusions
D’après nos résultats, nous recommandons que le consentement écrit et bien informé soit fourni avant d’effectuer le dépistage des cfDNA, et nous offrons des normes minimales de recommandation pour l’éducation du patient et les éléments du consentement. Une de nos neuf recommandations est que quelle que soit la question de savoir si une signature est requise, les documents de consentement éclairé devraient inclure une instruction simple suggérant de ne pas associer des accords juridiques ou financiers. Le nom et les coordonnées d’une clinique locale disponible pour d’autres questions devraient également figurer en bonne place.}

The present study extends these findings into the domain of second-language (L2) literacy, through brain imaging data of English and Hebrew L2 learners. Participants received an fMRI brain scan, while performing a semantic judgement task on spoken and written words and pseudowords in both their L1 and L2, alongside a battery of L1 and L2 behavioural measures. Imaging results show, overall, a similar network of activation for reading across the two languages, alongside significant convergence of print and speech processing across a network of left-hemisphere regions in both L1 and L2 and in both cohorts. Importantly, convergence is greater for L1 in occipito-temporal regions tied to automatic skilled reading processes including the visual word-form area, but greater for L2 in frontal regions of the reading network, tied to more effortful, active processing. The main groupwise brain effects tell a similar story, with greater L2 than L1 activation across frontal, temporal and parietal regions, but greater L1 than L2 activation in parieto-occipital regions tied to automatic mapping processes in skilled reading. These results provide evidence for the shifting of the reading networks towards more automatic processing as reading proficiency rises and the mappings and statistics of the new orthography are learned and incorporated into the reading system.}

abstract = {In rodents, noise exposure can destroy synapses between inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers (“cochlear synaptopathy”) without causing hair cell loss. Noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy usually leaves cochlear thresholds unaltered, but is associated with long-term reductions in auditory brainstem response (ABR) amplitudes at medium-to-high sound levels. This pathophysiology has been suggested to degrade speech perception in noise (SPiN), perhaps explaining why SPiN ability varies so widely among audiometrically normal humans. The present study is the first to test for evidence of cochlear synaptopathy in humans with significant SPiN impairment. Individuals were recruited on the basis of self-reported SPiN difficulties and normal pure tone audiometric thresholds. Performance on a listening task identified a subset with “verified” SPiN impairment. This group was matched with controls on the basis of age, sex, and audiometric thresholds up to 14 kHz. ABRs and envelope-following responses (EFRs) were recorded at high stimulus levels, yielding both raw amplitude measures and within-subject difference measures. Past exposure to high sound levels was assessed by detailed structured interview. Impaired SPiN was not associated with greater lifetime noise exposure, nor with any electrophysiological measure. It is conceivable that retrospective self-report cannot reliably capture noise exposure, and that ABRs and EFRs offer limited sensitivity to synaptopathy in humans. Nevertheless, the results do not support the notion that noise-induced synaptopathy is a significant etiology of SPiN impairment with normal audiometric thresholds. It may be that synaptopathy alone does not have significant perceptual consequences, or is not widespread in humans with normal audiograms.}

Preterm infants are at greater risk of language delay. Early identification of language delay is essential to improve functional outcome in these children.
Aim
To examine the concurrent validity of Rescorla's Language Development Survey and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-III) at 18months corrected age in preterm infants.
Study design
Test accuracy study.
Participants
189 preterm infants born <29weeks were assessed at 18months.
Outcome measures
The Language Development Survey, a parent-reported screening instrument, was administered in French concurrently with the Language Scales of the Bayley-III. Receiver-Operating-Characteristics curves were used to determine optimal cut-off score on the Language Development Survey to identify Bayley-III score <85. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and κ coefficient were calculated.
Results
Using Rescorla's original cut-off scores of ≤10 words for boys and ≤24 for girls, sensitivity was 76% and 88% for boys and girls, respectively, and specificity was 73% and 52% for boys and girls, respectively, in identifying language delay as per the Bayley-III. The optimal threshold was ≤10 words for both boys and girls. In girls, lowering the cut-off score decreased sensitivity (79%), but improved specificity (82%), thus lowering the number of false-positives.
Conclusion
Our findings support using the Language Development Survey as an expressive language screener in preterm infants.}

Analyses included nine studies (1980 dyads) of physical (n = 762) or mental (n = 604) health conditions, or intellectual disability (n = 614), in 10 countries. Mean person–proxy correlations ranged from 0.28 (social QoL) to 0.44 (physical QoL). Proxy measures were underestimates (ie, significantly lower than persons reported for themselves) for social [mean difference (MD) = 4.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8, 7.6], psychological (MD = 3.7, 95% CI: 0.6, 6.8), and physical (MD = 3.1, 95% CI: 0.6, 5.6) QoL. Underestimates varied significantly between health conditions for social (P < 0.001), psychological (P = 0.009), and physical (P = 0.02) QoL. Family members assessed psychological and environmental QoL better than professionals.
Conclusion
Proxies tend to be imprecise, underestimating QoL, and should be aware of this tendency. Where health care is decided for others, family members' views about QoL should be prioritized.}

abstract = {Purpose
The Wada test has been the gold standard for determining hemispheric language dominance (HLD) in the presurgical evaluation of patients scheduled for neurosurgical procedures. As it poses inherent risks associated with intra-arterial catheter techniques and as it occasionally fails to indicate language dominance, an alternative reliable test is needed. We quantitatively assessed the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using the Shiritori task, a Japanese word chain, to identify the threshold for correctly predicting HLD.
Methods
The subjects were 28 patients with intractable epilepsy scheduled to undergo the Wada test and focus resection. We set the region of interest (ROI) on the bilateral Brodmann areas 44 and 45 (BA 44 and 45). To compare the functional activity at both ROIs we calculated the language laterality index (LI) using the formula: [VL−VR]/[VL+VR]×100, where VL and VR indicated the number of activated voxels in the left and right ROIs, respectively.
Results
As 2 patients were excluded due to the lack of activation in either ROI, the final study population consisted of 26 patients. By the Wada test, HLD was left in 20, right in 3, and equivocal in 3. At a cut-off of LI+50, the predictive sensitivity and specificity for left HLD were 85% (17/20) and 100%; right HLD was predicted in a single patient (sensitivity 33.3%, specificity 100%).
Conclusion
The fMRI using the Shiritori task showed good activation in ROI of BA 44 and 45. At a cut-off of LI+50, LI of BA 44 and 45 predicted HLD identified by the Wada test with high specificity.}

Here we investigated whether this was true for neural representations of simple events described using sentences. Participants viewed sentences describing four events in different ways. Multivariate classifiers were trained to discriminate the four events using a subset of sentences, allowing us to test generalisation to novel sentences. We found that neural patterns in a left-lateralised network of frontal, temporal and parietal regions discriminated events in a way that generalised successfully over changes in the syntactic and lexical properties of the sentences used to describe them. In contrast, decoding in visual areas was sentence-specific and failed to generalise to novel sentences. In the reverse analysis, we tested for decoding of syntactic and lexical structure, independent of the event being described. Regions displaying this coding were limited and largely fell outside the canonical semantic network. Our results indicate that a distributed neural network represents the meaning of event sentences in a way that is robust to changes in their structure and form. They suggest that the semantic system disregards the surface properties of stimuli in order to represent their underlying conceptual significance.}

Research on selective mutism (SM) has been limited by the absence of standardised, psychometrically sound and cross-culturally valid assessment measures. Our aim is to present the results of a study of the factor structure and the reliability and concurrent validity of the scores of the Selective Mutism Questionnaire (SMQ), translated and adapted into Spanish. The SMQ contains 17 items about children's difficulty in speaking adequately in the family, school and social environment (out-of-school and out-of-family), each of which is answered according to a Likert scale with four response alternatives on speech frequency. Method: The study involved 110 pairs of parents of children diagnosed with SM whose ages ranged from 3 to 10 years. Results: The results show that the data from the Spanish sample fit the factorial model obtained by Bergman et al., and that data on its reliability and validity are robust and confirm that it as a good instrument for assessing SM in Spanish-speaking children. Conclusions: Therefore, we can affirm that the SMQ is a good instrument to assess SM in Spanish-speaking children.
Resumen
Antecedentes/Objetivo
La investigación sobre el mutismo selectivo (MS) se ha visto limitada por la ausencia de medidas de evaluación estandarizadas, psicométricamente sólidas y con validez transcultural. Nuestro objetivo es presentar los resultados de un estudio de la estructura factorial, fiabilidad y validez concurrente de las puntaciones del Selective Mutism Questionnaire (SMQ), traducido y adaptado al español. El SMQ contiene 17 ítems sobre la dificultad de los niños para hablar adecuadamente en el ámbito familiar, escolar y social (extraescolar y ajeno al ámbito familiar), cada uno de los cuales se contesta según una escala tipo Likert con cuatro alternativas de respuesta sobre la frecuencia del habla. Método: En el estudio participaron 110 parejas de padres de niños y niñas diagnosticados con MS. Resultados: Los resultados muestran que los datos de la muestra española se ajustan al modelo factorial obtenido por Bergman et al., así como que los datos sobre su fiabilidad y la validez son robustos. Conclusiones: Por todo ello podemos afirmar que el SMQ es un buen instrumento para valorar el MS en niños y niñas españoles de habla castellana.}

abstract = {Charters represent an expansion of public school choice, offering free, publicly funded educational alternatives to traditional public schools. One relatively unexplored research question concerning charter schools asks whether charter schools are more efficient suppliers of educational services than are traditional public schools. The potential relative efficiency advantage of charters vis-a-vis traditional publics is one of the mechanisms that supports the hypotheses that charters could improve performance for their students while using the same or fewer resources, and that the systemic effect of charters could lead to improved outcomes for traditional public students without requiring an increase in education sector resources. In this paper, we provide evidence as to the cost efficiency of charter schools relative to traditional public schools, and explore the extent to which those differences are attributable to differences in hiring and compensation practices, or to differences in the length of time a campus has been operating. We generate estimates of efficiency using a stochastic cost frontier approach. We estimate a translog stochastic cost frontier model using panel data for charter campuses and traditional public campuses in Texas over the five-year period 2005–2009. Our main findings suggest that charter schools are able to produce educational outcomes at lower cost than traditional public schools—probably because they face fewer regulations—but are not systematically more efficient relative to their frontier than are traditional public schools.}

We consider how these mechanisms might be implicated in human–computer interaction (HCI), and then review recent empirical studies that investigated linguistic alignment in HCI. We argue that there is strong evidence that alignment occurs in HCI, but that it differs in important ways from that found in interactions between humans: It is generally stronger and has a larger mediated component that is concerned with enhancing communicative success.}

One recent study conducted in preschool classrooms serving low-income children found negative associations between age-mixing and children's social and cognitive development. The current study extended this research by examining associations between classroom age composition (variability in ages of children in the classroom) and low-income preschool children's rates of change in school readiness. The sample consisted of 4417 preschool children enrolled in 207 classrooms in a large, diverse urban Head Start program. Multilevel modeling was employed to examine the main effect of classroom age composition, as well as the interaction between classroom age composition and children's age, as predictors of children's rates of change in emergent literacy, emergent numeracy, social and emotional skills, and approaches to learning. In contrast to previous research, classroom age composition was not associated with school readiness outcomes. This study contributes to the conflicting literature examining the associations between age mixing and children's school readiness and calls for a future research agenda to examine age mixing in context that is focused on sorting out these conflicting results. In the meantime, policymakers should consider other relevant factors when making decisions regarding mixed-age classrooms, such as family preference or the capability for teachers to individualize instruction to children based on their individual needs.}

This functional gap limits the capacity of psychometric theories to explain and predict fundamental aspects of individual differences in cognitive abilities that have long been studied experimentally.

In this review, the performance of patients with Parkinson’s disease in these domains of language will be reviewed with a focus on the links that they have with the rest of cognition and on how they could contribute to the earlier and more precise characterization and prediction of cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is among the most widely adopted screening tools for cognitive impairment because it includes tests in multiple domains and is available in 55 languages. The MoCA is often the only formal cognitive assessment available when comprehensive neuropsychological testing is not practical, such as rural clinical settings or large retrospective and multi-lingual research settings. However, the MoCA domain-specific subsections have never been formally assessed for sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, in Parkinson's disease, we examined whether the subsections of the MoCA could identify cognitive impairment within specific cognitive domains.
Methods
We administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to 85 Parkinson's disease participants, who were then categorized as with or without cognitive impairment, with respect to global cognition and in five cognitive domains. We then assessed the domain-specific categorization of the MoCA subsections compared to the full neuropsychology battery.
Results
All MoCA subsections predicted impairment in their respective cognitive domain. However, the executive subsection showed the highest sensitivity and specificity (89.3% and 82.5%, respectively), followed by visuospatial (93.3% and 45.7%, respectively) and memory (84.6% and 56.5%, respectively).
Conclusion
The MoCA is a useful screening tool for PD global cognitive and executive functions. The MoCA is also highly sensitive to visuospatial and memory impairment, but with limited specificity and accuracy these subsections should be interpreted with caution.}

The incidence of depression is difficult to determine because of low clinical depression detection rates in the primary care setting. This low level of detection is a significantly greater problem in people from ethnic minority communities. The availability of culturally validated screening questionnaires might help to improve the detection and treatment of depression.
Method
The aim of the study was to assess the validity of the self-reporting questionnaire SRQ 20, (English and Urdu versions) in white Europeans and British Pakistanis and to determine the optimum cut-off scores for detecting depression. Validation of the English and Urdu versions of the SRQ was conducted with a sample of white Europeans and British Pakistani participants. The semi-structured Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) was used as the gold standard diagnostic interview, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate SRQ test performance.
Results
The SRQ was completed by 1856 participants out of whom 651 completed the SCAN interview. The SRQ sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values versus SCAN indicated a cut-off score of 7 as optimum for white Europeans and a cut-off score of 6 for British Pakistanis.
Limitations
This study focused on depression alone and did not take into consideration comorbid conditions such as anxiety which might have affected the way respondents answered the questions and contributed to comparatively lower optimum cut-off scores in British Pakistanis.
Conclusions
The findings of this validation study provide evidence for high sensitivity and specificity of SRQ amongst both white Europeans and British Pakistanis. The SRQ can be used as a routine screening questionnaire for depression in English and Urdu speaking populations in the UK.}

Behavioral studies have shown that this lexical integration process is enhanced when there is more time for consolidation. Neuroimaging studies have further revealed that novel word representations are initially represented in a hippocampally-centered system, whereas left posterior middle temporal cortex activation increases with lexicalization. In this study, we measured behavioral and brain responses to newly-learned words in children. Two groups of Dutch children, aged between 8–10 and 14–16 years, were trained on 30 novel Japanese words depicting novel concepts. Children were tested on word-forms, word-meanings, and the novel words’ influence on existing word processing immediately after training, and again after a week. In line with the adult findings, hippocampal involvement decreased with time. Lexical integration, however, was not observed immediately or after a week, neither behaviorally nor neurally. It appears that time alone is not always sufficient for lexical integration to occur. We suggest that other factors (e.g., the novelty of the concepts and familiarity with the language the words are derived from) might also influence the integration process.}

abstract = {Objective
With the implementation of the Universal Newborn Hearing Screening (UNHS), the age of diagnosis of children with hearing loss (HL) has been steadily declining in the past years. Consequently, there is a need for early educational intervention methods that are suitable for infants at the preverbal level. To meet this need we have developed and evaluated the Muenster Parental Programme (MPP), a responsive parenting programme for parents of children with HL aged 3–18 months. It aims at enhancing the parents’ communicative skills towards their child.
Methods
The MPP is introduced following confirmation of a HL. Flanked by two individual counselling sessions, the programme comprises six group sessions and two single training sessions with video feedback. The focus of the programme lies in enhancing parents’ responsive behaviour and in reducing inappropriate initiative behaviour. The present study involved 29 parents of 24 children aged 6.6 (mean, range: 3–12) months at the outset of the MPP. The children's degree of HL ranged from moderate to profound. Parents of children with unilateral HL and/or risk for an additional developmental delay were included. The prospective study compared parent communication skills of a trained (N=15) versus a control group (N=14) before and after the MPP. For this purpose, instances of responsive behaviour to the signals of the child and total time of initiative behaviour within a 4-min video-sample were measured before and after completion of the study in both groups.
Results
Trained parents could enhance their responsiveness to vocal and preverbal signals of the child (Wilcoxon test, p=.002) and also their responsiveness to non-verbal signals (Wilcoxon test, p<.001). Moreover, parents reduced their inappropriate initiative behaviour (related t-test, p<.001). Pre-post comparisons in the control group were non-significant.
Conclusions
The increased parental responsiveness to infants with HL is of great importance as these early behaviours underlie later acquisition of speech, language, hearing and social communication skills. The MPP constitutes the first evaluated group concept for parents of infants with HL in the German-speaking countries and equally meets the needs of parents and professionals.}

Although Hebrew has an alphabetic writing system, just like English, French, or Spanish, a series of studies consistently suggested that simple form-orthographic priming, or letter-transposition priming are not found in Hebrew. In four experiments, we tested the hypothesis that this is due to the fact that Semitic words have an underlying structure that constrains the possible alignment of phonemes and their respective letters. The experiments contrasted typical Semitic words which are root-derived, with Hebrew words of non-Semitic origin, which are morphologically simple and resemble base-words in European languages. Using RSVP, TL priming, and form-priming manipulations, we show that Hebrew readers process Hebrew words which are morphologically simple similar to the way they process English words. These words indeed reveal the typical form-priming and TL priming effects reported in European languages. In contrast, words with internal structure are processed differently, and require a different code for lexical access. We discuss the implications of these findings for current models of visual word recognition.}

abstract = {Summary
As of July 31, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 had infected almost 200 million people worldwide. The growing burden of survivorship is substantial in terms of the complexity of long-term health effects and the number of people affected. Persistent symptoms have been reported in patients with both mild and severe acute COVID-19, including those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Early reports on the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) indicate that fatigue, dyspnoea, cough, headache, loss of taste or smell, and cognitive or mental health impairments are among the most common symptoms. These complex, multifactorial impairments across the domains of physical, cognitive, and mental health require a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach to management. Decades of research on the multifaceted needs of and models of care for patients with post-intensive care syndrome provide a framework for the development of PASC clinics to address the immediate needs of both hospitalised and non-hospitalised survivors of COVID-19. Such clinics could also provide a platform for rigorous research into the natural history of PASC and the potential benefits of therapeutic interventions.}

The amplitude of the N400 effect in event-related brain potentials is inversely correlated with the degree of fit of a word's meaning into a semantic representation of the preceding discourse. This study reports a double dissociation in the latency characteristics of the N400 effect depending on task demands. When participants silently read words in a sentence context, without issuing a relevant overt response, greater temporal alignment over recording sites occurs for N400 onsets than peaks. If however a behavior is produced – here pressing a button in a binary probe selection task – exactly the opposite pattern is observed, with stronger alignment of N400 peaks than onsets. The peak amplitude of the N400 effect correlates best with the latency characteristic showing less temporal dispersion. These findings suggest that meaning construction in the brain is subtly affected by task demands, and that there is complex functional integration between semantic combinatorics and control systems handling behavioral goals.}

abstract = {Objective
Evidence suggests that famous face naming may be a cognitive ability especially sensitive to the early pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that those at risk for AD may demonstrate a Ribot temporal gradient (RTG), characterized by better performance for naming remote famous faces than for naming recent famous faces. Reductions in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and gray matter volume (GMV) have been implicated in the neuropathological cascade of AD and show utility as biomarkers of AD risk. We examined whether a RTG during famous face naming was associated with lower CBF and/or GMV among a group of cognitively normal older adults.
Methods
Voxel-wise independent samples t-tests were employed to contrast resting CBF values between those who exhibited a RTG (RTG+) during a famous face naming task and those who did not (RTG-) among a sample of 52 cognitively normal older adults (25 RTG-, 27 RTG+; mean age = 73). Groups were also compared on GMV using a voxel-wise general linear model.
Results
Significant group differences in CBF and GMV were found, whereby the RTG+ group demonstrated reduced CBF and GMV within medial temporal lobe regions (hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus), relative to the RTG- group.
Conclusions
This represents the first study to show that cognitively intact older adults who demonstrate a RTG during famous face naming exhibit vascular dysregulation and structural changes similar to that seen in AD risk. Findings suggest that famous face naming ability may be particularly sensitive to the very early brain changes associated with AD.}

A recent study identifies language issues as an underestimated danger. Dutch Labour Inspectorate records identify procedures and communication as an important causal factor area for major accidents. Accident investigation method taxonomies that are frequently used in The Netherlands, were investigated on the content related to language issues. Language issues are found to be either present less than proportional with observed accident rates or not present at all in frequently applied accident investigation classification systems. Hence a new taxonomy problem was found in Dutch accident data. Language issues need more attention in accident investigation methods.}

To overcome these obstacles, researchers have developed and are currently evaluating different multi-tiered systems of support that are specific to the settings, service delivery models, and curricula in early childhood education. Given the rate at which departments of education and accreditation agencies are presently creating system-wide tiered support systems for early childhood education, we conducted a review of the available literature on multi-tiered systems of support in early childhood education to provide stakeholders with guidance on development and implementation. Our findings indicate that tiered support systems targeting social–emotional development were most successful. Methodologically rigorous designs evaluating tiered support systems targeting literacy and language outcomes found marginal evidence of effects.

In this paper we further investigate on the role of the text representation, i.e. how different ways of representing the input text can affect the accuracy of the proposed system.

Geriatric syndromes are conditions that are highly prevalent, multifactorial, and associated with substantial morbidity and poor outcomes in the elderly. Geriatricians agree on its definition, but the lists of geriatric syndromes vary based on the purpose. The aim of this article is to attempt to reach a consensus on the list of geriatric syndromes within the Asian-Pacific geriatric societies.
Methods
We surveyed Asian-Pacific expert geriatricians using a questionnaire that asked whether each country's geriatric society recognized the presented items as a geriatric syndrome.
Results
Expert geriatricians from 10 Asian-Pacific nations/regions completed the questionnaire. Dementia, incontinence, delirium, falls, hearing impairment, visual impairment, sarcopenia, malnutrition, and frailty were agreed on as geriatric syndromes by all 10 respondents. Immobility, gait disturbance, and pressure ulcers were included as geriatric syndromes by 90% of the respondents while osteoporosis, failure to thrive, sleep disorder, and functional dependency were included by 80%. Less than 50% of the respondents included self-neglect, anorexia, and emesis as geriatric syndromes.
Conclusions
Dementia, incontinence, delirium, falls, hearing impairment, visual impairment, sarcopenia, malnutrition, frailty, immobility, gait disturbance, and pressure ulcers were included as geriatric syndromes by at least 90% of the respondents. These lists seem to be consented to be geriatric syndromes in Asian-Pacific geriatric societies. These lists are generally similar to the lists of geriatric syndromes provided by professors from the western world, but with some differences.}

However, most of these studies have been done in children older than 2 years of age. Obtaining volumetric measures in infants is considerably more difficult, as structures are less well defined and largely unmyelinated, making segmentation challenging. Moreover, it is still unclear whether individual anatomic variation across development, in healthy, normally developing infants, is reflected in the configuration and function of the mature brain and, as importantly, whether variation in infant brain structure might be related to later cognitive and linguistic abilities. In this longitudinal study, using T1 structural MRI, we identified links between amygdala volume in normally developing, naturally sleeping, 6-month infants and their subsequent language abilities at 2, 3 and 4 years. The images were processed and manually segmented using Cardviews to extract volumetric measures. Intra-rater reliability for repeated segmentation was 87.73% of common voxel agreement. Standardized language assessments were administered at 6 and 12 months and at 2, 3 and 4 years. Significant and consistent correlations were found between amygdala size and language abilities. Children with larger right amygdalae at 6 months had lower scores on expressive and receptive language measures at 2, 3, and 4 years. Associations between amygdala size and language outcomes have been reported in children with autism. The findings presented here extend this association to normally developing children, supporting the idea that the amygdalae might play an important but as yet unspecified role in mediating language acquisition.}

The study methods were varied, and included reflective techniques (e.g., questionnaires, journals, and thought listing) and momentary techniques (e.g., experience sampling method, think alouds). The studies were mainly grounded in sociocultural theory or metacognition. Generally, studies found that self-talk functioned to help children to regulate task engagement and cope with social challenges. Self-talk was also highly malleable: it was moderated across studies by internal and external factors including age, gender, ability, creativity, anxiety, and interactions with teachers and classmates. Suggestions for theory, methodology, and practice are discussed.}

The children underwent language testing and MRI scans at 1.5 T. Brain tissue was segmented and frontotemporal volumes were computed. Higher mean language scores were significantly associated with larger inferior frontal gyrus, temporal lobe, and posterior superior temporal gyrus gray matter volumes in the epilepsy group and in the children with epilepsy with average language scores. Increased total brain and dorsolateral prefrontal gray and white matter volumes, however, were associated with higher language scores in the healthy controls. Within the epilepsy group, linguistic deficits were related to smaller anterior superior temporal gyrus gray matter volumes and there was a negative association between language scores and dorsolateral prefrontal gray matter volumes. These findings demonstrate abnormal development of language-related brain regions, and imply differential reorganization of brain regions subserving language in children with epilepsy with normal linguistic skills and in those with impaired language.}

abstract = {The present study aimed to examine the factor structure of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein & Fink, 1998), highlight rates of abuse and neglect among Burundian adolescents, compare these rates with those found in high-income nations, and examine the cumulative effect of multiple types of abuse and neglect on depression and PTSD symptoms. Participants were 231 adolescents and youth (M=14.9, SD=1.99, 58.4% female) from five provinces of Burundi, a country in Central Africa affected by war and political violence. Translation and back-translation of the CTQ was carried out to obtain an adaptation of CTQ in Kirundi, the native language of Burundi. With the exception of one item on ‘molestation’ in the factor of sexual abuse, the five-factor structure of CTQ was obtained comprising latent factors, namely emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and emotional and physical neglect. The rate of abuse and neglect ranged from 14.7-93.5% with more than 37% reporting 4 or more types of abuse and neglect experiences. Emotional abuse and neglect, and physical neglect were 2–3 times higher among Burundian adolescents when compared with studies from high-income countries using the CTQ. A cumulative effect of multiple types of abuse and neglect was found, such that, those with 4 or more types of maltreatment were higher on symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress. Findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive, standardized, and validated measures and norms for gauging childhood maltreatment in Burundi and related need for preventative interventions on childhood maltreatment.}

abstract = {Though accumulating evidence indicates that the striatum is recruited during language processing, the specific function of this subcortical structure in language remains to be elucidated. To answer this question, we used Huntington's disease as a model of striatal lesion. We investigated the morphological deficit of 30 early Huntington's disease patients with a novel linguistic task that can be modeled within an explicit theory of linguistic computation. Behavioral results reflected an impairment in HD patients on the linguistic task. Computational model-based analysis compared the behavioral data to simulated data from two distinct lesion models, a selection deficit model and a grammatical deficit model. This analysis revealed that the impairment derives from an increased randomness in the process of selecting between grammatical alternatives, rather than from a disruption of grammatical knowledge per se. Voxel-based morphometry permitted to correlate this impairment to dorsal striatal degeneration. We thus show that the striatum holds a role in the selection of linguistic alternatives, just as in the selection of motor and cognitive programs.}

However, attempts to characterize a pattern of language abnormalities in patients with basal ganglia lesions proved unfruitful. We conducted a comprehensive review of language disturbances after vascular lesions in the BG. Literature search in Medline and LILACS (1966–2016) and PsychINFO (last 25years) was conducted, and returned 145 articles, with 57 eligible for the review yielding data on 303 patients. We report the clinical and neuroimaging features of these cases. Results showed that aphasias caused by BG lesions are heterogeneous with weak clinicoanatomical correlations. Data derived from follow-up and flow/metabolism studies suggest that subcortical aphasia caused by BG lesions involves hypoperfusion in the cortical territories of the middle cerebral/internal carotid arteries (MCA/ICA) and their branches.}

However, these correlations have not all been explored together in prospective longitudinal studies. The goal of the current research was to compare how early speech perception and cognitive skills predict later language outcomes using a within-participant design. To achieve this goal, we tested 97 5- to 7-month-olds on two speech perception tasks (stress pattern preference, native vowel discrimination) and two cognitive tasks (visual recognition memory, A-not-B) and later assessed their vocabulary outcomes at 18 and 24 months. Frequentist statistical analyses showed that only native vowel discrimination significantly predicted vocabulary. However, Bayesian analyses suggested that evidence was ambiguous between null and alternative hypotheses for all infant predictors. These results highlight the importance of recognizing and addressing challenges related to infant data collection, interpretation, and replication in the developmental field, a roadblock in our route to understanding the contribution of domain-specific and domain-general skills for language acquisition. Future methodological development and research along similar lines is encouraged to assess individual differences in infant speech perception and cognitive skills and their predictability for language development.}

Results indicated that both intervention programs significantly improved posttest word reading to a similar extent, irrespective of word type and word structure. Nevertheless, only the phonological training program yielded a significantly better effect on the posttest L2 word reading than the regular instruction. Irrespective of word structure and group, the participants as a whole performed better in posttest real word than in pseudo-word reading. However, the phonological training displayed a significant better impact on pseudo-word than on real word reading, irrespective of word structure and test-time.

The aim of the study was to explore prevalence, interrelations and accuracy of assessing psychopathology, intelligence, and executive functions (EF) in preschool children with ADHD (age 2.1–6.5 years).
Method
We prospectively investigated 115 preschool outpatient children (91 boys, 24 girls, aged 4.3±1.0 years) with the clinical diagnosis of ADHD. Assessment included clinical history, background, psychosocial problems (CBCL, C-TRF), ADHD (DISYPS external ratings), cognitive performance (WPPSI-III, K-ABC), and executive functions (BRIEF-P, NEPSY).
Results
We found a high frequency of dysexecutive problems in up to 64 % in the parental BRIEF-P assessments, up to 62 % in the BRIEF-P teachers’ assessments, and 62 % in the NEPSY functional assessments. Parental and teachers’ BRIEF-P scores were only correlated in one subscale, inhibition, and NEPSY and BRIEF-P were not correlated at all. It was found that 42.5 % of the children with noticeable findings had agreeing results in all three, and another 45 % in two tests.
Conclusions
About 2/3 of the ADHD preschool children had detectable EF dysfunctions. In order to assess dysexecutive problems, multi-method testing is mandatory.
Résumé

Nous avons étudié la prévalence, les interactions et la précision d’analyse des contraintes psychosociales, la capacité intellectuelle et des fonctions exécutives chez les enfants préscolaires âgés de 2,1 à 6,5 ans.
Méthode
Nous avos examinés prospectivement 115 enfants pris en charge ambulatoire à cause de trouble du déficit de l’attention/hyperactivité (TDAH) (91 garçons, 24 filles, agés de 4,3±1,0 ans). L'examen comprenait une évaluation de l’histoire clinique, du contexte familial, des contraintes psychosociales (CBCL, C-TRF), de la TDAH (DISYPS), de l’intelligence (WPPSI-III, K-ABC), et des fonctions exécutives (BRIEF-P, NEPSY).
Résultats
Le nombre d’ enfants affectés par des troubles des fonctions exécutives montait jusqu’à 64 % (BRIEF-P, parents) et 62 % (BRIEF-P, einseignants), et 62 % (NEPSY, examen fonctionnel). Les examens BRIEF-P des parents et des enseignants n’étaient correlés que dans un essai secondaire, l’inhibition, et NEPSY et BRIEF-P n’étaient pas correlés. Parmi les enfants affectés notablement par des troubles des fonctions exécutives, 42,5 % avaient des résultats concordants parmi trois et 45 % parmi deux examens.

School achievement in English was established based on formal grades students received at the end of the academic year. The results revealed that computer anxiety and achievement in English were inversely related. High achievement students in English used computers (both online and offline) more than low achievement students. Computer ownership was also significantly related to students’ success in English.

Children in the school we examined learn Indian numerals between first and third grades. In third grade, they switch to a new set of numerals (i.e., Arabic numbers). Participants in this study performed a numerical Stroop-like task in which they assessed the numerical value or physical size of stimuli varying along these two dimensions. Each participant saw either Arabic or Indian numerals. The results of the size congruity effect in the physical task, for both Indian and Arabic numerals, suggest that studying two sets of numerals interferes with the acquisition of an automatic association of a numerical symbol and magnitude. This is true both for the first learned set of numerals (i.e., Indian numerals) and for the second one (i.e., Arabic numerals). Furthermore, we found an absence of the distance effect, which further supports this conclusion. This learning program gave us the unique opportunity to examine the connection between symbolic sets and the mental representation of numbers in a novel fashion.}

Mean Language Index (LI; 91±15) and Motor Index (MI; 94±17) were significantly lower than the Cognitive Index (CI; 102±15, p<.01). For the majority (53%) of infants, language development was their weakest domain; for another 39%, motor skills were the weakest area of development. Almost one-quarter (22%) of this cohort had mildly delayed language and motor skills, while 7% had significantly delayed language and motor skills. Regression models revealed severely abnormal head ultrasound significantly predicted MI, LI, and CI. Oxygen dependence at discharge predicted CI, LI, and race/ethnicity predicted LI, MI. Results support the addition of the Language Index to the newly revised Bayley-III Scales.

We expected that biased self-evaluation of school competence would be related to biased self-evaluation of social competence and that biased self-evaluation in each domain will be related to the variables in both domains. The sample comprised 406 children (214 girls) whose mean age at Time 1 was 11years and 6months (SD=7.64months). Results partially confirmed the hypothesis in the school domain, but not in the social domain. In the school domain, a positive bias at Time 1 was associated with better self-regulation three years later, fewer feelings of school alienation and higher school achievement. In the social domain, a negative bias was linked positively with the preference for avoiding social relations and with peers' rejection. Unexpectedly, a negative bias of self-evaluation of social competence was linked to better self-regulation. Furthermore, unlike previous research (Larouche, Galand, & Bouffard, 2008), the positive association between biased self-evaluations of school and social competences was not confirmed. The discussion highlights the importance of broadening the examination of the impact of biased self-evaluation of competence in various domains and the factors associated with their development.}

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of an intensive 10-week course of articulation therapy on articulation errors in cleft lip and palate patients who have Velopharyngeal Insufficiency (VPI), non-oral and passive cleft speech characteristics.
Methods
Five children with cleft palate (+/-cleft lip) with VPI and non-oral and passive cleft speech characteristics underwent 40 intensive articulation therapies over 10 weeks in a single case experimental design. The percentage of non-oral CSCs (NCSCs), passive CSCs (PCSCs), stimulable consonants (SC), correct consonants in word imitation (CCI), and correct consonants in picture naming (CCN) were captured at baseline, during intervention and in follow up phases. Visual analysis and two effect size indexes of Percentage of Nonoverlapping Data and Percentage of Improvement Rate Difference were analyzed.
Results
Articulation therapy resulted in visible decrease in NCSCs for all 5 participants across the intervention phases. Intervention was effective in changing percentage of passive CSCs in two different ways; it reduced the PCSCs in three cases and resulted in an increase in PCSCs in the other two cases. This was interpreted as intervention having changed the non-oral CSCs to consonants produced within the oral cavity but with passive characteristics affecting manner of production including weakness, nasalized plosives and nasal realizations of plosives and fricatives. Percent SC increased throughout the intervention period in all five patients. All participants demonstrated an increase in percentage of CCI and CCN suggesting an increase in the consonant inventory. Follow-up data showed that all the subjects were able to maintain their ability to articulate learned phonemes correctly even after a 4-week break from intervention.
Conclusion
This single case experimental study supports the hypothesis that speech intervention in patients with VPI can result in an improvement in oral placements and passive CSCs.}

The patient underwent awake brain surgery. Stimulation of other portions of the exposed cortex did not cause language switching as did not stimulation of the left inferior frontal gyrus, where we evoked a speech arrest. Stimulation effects on language switching were selective, namely, interfered with counting behaviour but not with object naming. The coordinates of the positive site were combined with functional and fibre tracking (DTI) data. Results showed that the language switching site belonged to a significant fMRI cluster in the left superior temporal gyrus/supramarginal gyrus found activated for both L1 and L2, and for both the patient and controls, and did not overlap with the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). This area, also known as Stp, has a role in phonological processing.

In such cases diagnosis is difficult because emotional awareness (limiting reporting of emotional changes) may be affected. The present study sought to clarify the mechanisms of altered emotion experience after right MCA stroke. It was predicted that after right MCA stroke the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region concerned with emotional awareness, would show reduced neural activity. Brain activity during presentation of emotional stimuli was measured in 6 patients with stable stroke, and in 12 age- and sex-matched nonlesion comparisons using positron emission tomography and the [15O]H2O autoradiographic method. MCA stroke was associated with weaker pleasant experience and decreased activity ipsilaterally in the ACC. Other regions involved in emotional processing including thalamus, dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex showed reduced activity ipsilaterally. Dorsal and medial prefrontal cortex, association visual cortex and cerebellum showed reduced activity contralaterally. Experience from unpleasant stimuli was unaltered and was associated with decreased activity only in the left midbrain. Right MCA stroke may reduce experience of pleasant emotions by altering brain activity in limbic and paralimbic regions distant from the area of direct damage, in addition to changes due to direct tissue damage to insula and basal ganglia. The knowledge acquired in this study begins to explain the mechanisms underlying emotional changes following right MCA stroke. Recognizing these changes may improve diagnoses, management and rehabilitation of right MCA stroke victims.}

abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has gained relevance in recent years as an alternative treatment for neuropsychiatric conditions. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the use of tDCS in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Both electronic and manual searches were conducted to identify studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals addressing the use of tDCS in ASD population. A total of 16 studies fulfilled the criteria to be included in the review. Studies were conducted both in child and adult population. Anodal stimulation on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was the most commonly chosen methodology. Outcomes addressed ASD symptoms and neuropsychological functions. Meta-analytic synthesis identified improvements in social, health, and behavioral problem domains of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist. Limitations included high heterogeneity in the methodology and low-efficacy study designs (pre-post and single-case studies). Recent controlled trials shed promising results for the use of tDCS in ASD. A standardized stimulation protocol and a consensus in the measures used in the evaluation of the efficacy are imperative.}

abstract = {Purpose
The present study employed nonword repetition and nonword identification tasks to explore the phonological working memory (PWM) abilities and its interaction with speech motor control in school-aged children who do and do not stutter.
Method
Participants were 17 children who stutter (CWS) (Age range = 7–12) and 17 age and gender-matched children who do not stutter (CWNS). For the nonword repetition task, the participants repeated sets of 2-, 3-, and 4-syllable nonwords (n = 12 per set). The participants silently identified a target nonword from a subsequent set of three nonwords (n = 12 per 2-, 3- and 4-syllable length) for the nonword identification task. The performance of CWS on the nonword repetition task was compared with the CWNS for the mean number of accurate repetitions, number of trials taken, number of accurate repetitions on initial trial, and number of fluent repetitions across the three-syllable conditions for the tasks. For the nonword identification task, the number of nonwords identified accurately by the two groups were subjected to analysis.
Results
CWS were significantly less accurate on the initial production of nonwords and required significantly more number of attempts to repeat the nonword accurately. Further for the nonword identification task, CWS were significantly less accurate than CWNS in correctly identifying the target nonword.
Conclusions
The present findings suggest that, in addition to limitations in PWM capacity, an unstable speech motor control system in CWS may lead to dysfluent speech.}

Results of the repeated measures correlation analyses revealed specific longitudinal associations among enhancements in auditory-visual connection skills, pitch discrimination, and components of phonological processing. Moreover, the development of melodic auditory-visual integration appeared to be a relevant indicator of improvements in reading precursor skills. These findings might point to shared integration mechanisms underlying musical and reading development in young readers, which possibly originate in the emergent capability of prosodic reading.}

Analyses provided strong evidence for a specific link between serial order WM and both vocabulary measures, with a particularly important link with the rare noun subtask and the absence of link with verbs. These results suggest that the link between lexical abilities and verbal WM in young children is robust and not inflated by the WM demands of specific vocabulary tasks.}

Often, there is a mismatch between parents and children in terms of language, particularly in the early post-adoption period. There is a gap in the literature regarding parent experiences of this phase of their lives. Changing patterns in international adoption have led to an increase in adoptions of toddlers and older children. Due to institutional care, these toddlers and older children often lack exposure to their native language which may lead to language delay. When they are brought home, they are immersed in English. As well beginning to acquire English, these children are also forming an attachment with their parents. While research has investigated speech and language skills in this population, there is a lack of literature exploring the experiences of parents regarding communicating with toddlers who are adopted internationally in the early months following adoption. This is a qualitative study where interviews and thematic analysis were used to explore the experiences of 12 parents of 12 toddlers who were adopted internationally. Three main themes: ‘Getting ready’, ‘Support’, and ‘Challenges’ emerged from the data. The results highlight the ways in which adoptive parents facilitated communication with their toddlers, supporting their acquisition of English. The results also reveal gaps in service provision for this population. Results also illustrate the proactive way in which parents dealt with challenges, even in the presence of limited support services. Gaps in service provision where intense focus pre-adoption was followed by a lack of support post-adoption were identified by parents. The dual needs of developing attachment and common language development strategies were also described by parents. The study demonstrates the need for pre- and post-adoptive speech and language services for this client group. It highlights the importance of the role of speech and language pathology in working with parents of toddlers and children who were adopted internationally. This role is in health promotion and prevention, as well as providing a service to this population as part of a multidisciplinary team, post-adoption.}

abstract = {Learning to read is thought to involve the recruitment of left hemisphere ventral occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) by a process of “neuronal recycling”, whereby object processing mechanisms are co-opted for reading. Under the same theoretical framework, it has been proposed that the visual word form area (VWFA) within OTC processes orthographic stimuli independent of culture and writing systems, suggesting that it is universally involved in written language. However, this “script invariance” has yet to be demonstrated in monolingual readers of two different writing systems studied under the same experimental conditions. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined activity in response to English Words and Chinese Characters in 1st graders in the United States and China, respectively. We examined each group separately and found the readers of English as well as the readers of Chinese to activate the left ventral OTC for their respective native writing systems (using both a whole-brain and a bilateral OTC-restricted analysis). Critically, a conjunction analysis of the two groups revealed significant overlap between them for native writing system processing, located in the VWFA and therefore supporting the hypothesis of script invariance. In the second part of the study, we further examined the left OTC region responsive to each group's native writing system and found that it responded equally to Object stimuli (line drawings) in the Chinese-reading children. In English-reading children, the OTC responded much more to Objects than to English Words. Together, these results support the script invariant role of the VWFA and also support the idea that the areas recruited for character or word processing are rooted in object processing mechanisms of the left OTC.}

A recurrent claim is that linguistic properties at interfaces are inherently more “complex” than linguistic properties internal to a specific domain (syntax, phonology, semantics) due to the integration of different levels of linguistic knowledge/analysis. Even within interfaces, not all interfaces are created equal; some have been claimed to be even more complex, vulnerable, or more problematic than others. Slabakova (2008) claims that properties at the syntax–semantics interface are largely unproblematic in adult L2 acquisition, but functional morphology (the morphology–syntax interface), by contrast, is the bottleneck of acquisition. Drawing on the distinction between internal and external interfaces, Tsimpli and Sorace (2006) and Sorace and Serratrice (2009) have also argued that the syntax–semantics interface (an internal interface) is eventually acquired at the near-native level, while, the syntax–discourse interface (an external interface) presents prolonged difficulty in both L2 acquisition and L1 attrition. In this article I question these recent claims about vulnerability of specific interfaces based on empirical evidence from recent studies on incomplete acquisition in L2 and heritage language acquisition. I discuss examples of grammatical properties involving multiple interfaces and show how the concept of internal and external interfaces is problematic.}

To describe the relationship between caregivers’ oral health literacy (OHL) and the oral health status of their children in an Asian population.
Methods
A random sample of 301 child/caregiver dyads was recruited from kindergartens in Hong Kong. Two locally-developed and validated OHL assessment tasks were administered to caregivers with Hong Kong Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Dentistry-30 (HKREALD-30) assessing word recognition and Hong Kong Oral Health Literacy Assessment Task for Paediatric Dentistry (HKOHLAT-P) assessing comprehension. Their children's oral health status was assessed [dental caries experience – decayed, missing, filled teeth index – (dmft) and oral hygiene status – Visible Plaque Index (VPI)].
Results
Caregivers’ literacy was associated with children's oral health status. The HKOHLAT-P had a stronger association with children's oral health than HKREALD-30. HKOHLAT-P and HKREALD-30 remained associated with dmft in the adjusted negative binomial regression models (accounting for socio-demographics), Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) 0.97, p=0.02, and 0.96, p=0.03, respectively. In the adjusted model, HKOHLAT-P was associated with VPI (IRR 0.90, p<0.05), but no association between HKREALD-30 and VPI was evident.
Conclusion
The main conclusion of this study was that caregiver oral health literacy was associated with their child's oral health status. A comprehension instrument had a more robust association with children's oral status than a word recognition instrument.
Practice implications
This study has implications for general public health education for designing community-level interventions.}

From 40 fMRI studies we extracted two strands of reasoning: models investigating universal mechanisms for the formation of cultural groups and habits and, models assessing differences in characteristics among cultural groups. Both strands simplify culture as an inflexible set of traits and specificities. We question this rigid understanding of culture and highlight its hidden evaluative nature.}

Classroom self-regulation explained a moderate proportion of the kindergarten math and literacy gaps, but only among children from economically disadvantaged families. After accounting for classroom self-regulation, executive function skills explained a more substantial proportion of kindergarten achievement gaps for children from economically disadvantaged families and Spanish-speaking ELLs. Moreover, although executive function skills continued to explain achievement gaps in third grade for both groups, effect sizes were small. Results highlight the independent contribution of classroom self-regulation and individual executive function skills for school readiness gaps in kindergarten among children from economically disadvantaged families and suggest that improving executive function abilities prior to kindergarten could be effective for attenuating initial achievement gaps.

In this study, we compare brain mechanisms of Spanish word learning in Chinese and English speakers using two learning conditions: speech-based learning and handwriting-based learning. The behavioral data suggest an advantage for learning that uses handwriting over speech-based learning across all participants. Furthermore, brain imaging data reveal that English speakers show greater functional connectivity among phonological regions in the handwriting condition than the speech-based condition during a silent phonological recall task. This suggests that, for English speakers specifically, handwriting further enhanced the phonological network. Interestingly, Chinese speakers showed an opposite pattern, with greater functional connectivity among phonological regions in the speech-based condition than the handwriting condition. Moreover, it was found that Chinese speakers with higher reading skills in their native L1 tended to engage the right fusiform to a greater degree by connecting to phonological regions in the handwriting condition. Thus, the handwriting-based learning engaged visuo-orthographic regions to a greater degree in highly skilled Chinese speakers. In summary, the current findings suggest that handwriting facilitates lexical learning by enhancing orthographic involvement in Chinese speakers, while the handwriting condition enhanced phonological involvement in English speakers. This difference between Chinese and English speakers might be due to different L1 learning experience.}

The contrastive syllable stress elicited two consecutive MMNs in both language groups, but English speakers demonstrated larger responses to stress patterns than Mandarin speakers. Correlations between the amplitude of ERPs and continuous changes in the running intensity and pitch of speech assessed how well each language group’s brain activity tracked these salient acoustic features of lexical stress.

In the second experiment, we manipulated the phonology of misspelled stimuli and observed that ERN magnitudes were larger when misspelled words altered the phonology of their correctly spelled counterparts than when they preserved it. Thus, when an error is made in a decision about spelling, the brain processes indexed by the ERN reflect both phonological and orthographic input to the decision process. In both experiments, ERN effect sizes were correlated with assessments of lexical knowledge and reading, including offline spelling ability and spelling-mediated vocabulary knowledge. These results affirm the interdependent nature of orthographic, semantic, and phonological knowledge components while showing that spelling knowledge uniquely influences the ERN during spelling decisions.

In Experiment 1, 51 4-year-olds were exposed to a total of three short stories with contrastive words presented in three conditions, namely with prominence in both speech and gesture, prominence in speech only, and nonprominent speech. Results of a recall task showed that (a) children remembered more words when exposed to prominence in both speech and gesture than in either of the other two conditions and that (b) children were more likely to remember information related to those words when the words were associated with beat gestures. In Experiment 2, 55 5- and 6-year-olds were presented with six narratives with target items either produced with prosodic prominence but no beat gestures or produced with both prosodic prominence and beat gestures. Results of a comprehension task demonstrated that stories told with beat gestures were comprehended better by children.

Fifty participants (age range: 15–19-years-old) were recruited from one mainstream secondary school and 20 participants (age range: 17–24-years-old) were recruited from two secondary schools for students with PD. They were asked to perform three consecutive handwriting tasks: copying 90 characters using the computerized CHAT, an English passage copying task, and a Chinese passage copying task. The data indicated that students with PD were significantly slower in copying both Chinese and English characters in passages when compared to the typical students. Significant differences in the measures of writing speed, air/ground time ratio, standard deviation of speed, standard deviation of size per character, and number of stroke errors measured by the CHAT were found between the two groups of students. Further analysis on the data of typical students indicated no significant difference in handwriting speed among students of different classes (i.e. arts or science) on copying Chinese and English passages, and on individual Chinese words (from CHAT). The academic results of students also showed no significant correlation with their handwriting speed measured by the three writing tasks. To conclude, the CHAT system was able to identify a number of characteristics of handwriting on students with and without PD. It was suggested that the CHAT should further be developed into an objective evaluation tool to explore the handwriting characteristics of the students with a wider range of disabilities in the future, and to make recommendations to arrange special examination arrangements (SEA) for students with physical disabilities or other special needs.}

abstract = {Do typological properties of language, such as agglutination (i.e., the morphological process of adding affixes to the lexeme of a word), have an impact on the development of visual word recognition? To answer this question, we carried out an experiment in which beginning, intermediate, and adult Basque readers (n=32 each, average age=7, 11, and 22years, respectively) needed to read correctly versus incorrectly inflected words embedded in sentences. Half of the targets contained high-frequency stems, and the other half contained low-frequency stems. To each stem, four inflections of different lengths were attached (-a, -ari, -aren, and -arentzat, i.e., inflectional sequences). To test whether the process of word recognition was modulated by the knowledge of word structure in the language, half of the participants’ native language was Basque and the other half’s native language was Spanish. Children showed robust effects of frequency and length of inflection that diminished with age. In addition, the effect of length of inflection was modulated by the frequency of the stem and by the native language. Taken together, these results suggest that word recognition develops from a decoding strategy to a direct lexical access strategy and that this process is modulated by children’s knowledge of the inflectional structure of words from the beginning of their reading experience.}

Yiddish, a minority language, is the native tongue of most hotline speakers and marks their communal affiliation within the ultra-Orthodox world. We explore the instrumentalities of one Yiddish hotline in order to ascertain features that facilitate its role as a membering medium for its community. We show how participants use this medium to index who is – and who is not – a community member via language decisions that reflect language ideologies and maintain community boundaries; interviewees index their membership by linguistically accommodating interviewers; and hosts, on occasion, change language to ostracize an interviewee. We also explore the problematic status of Modern Hebrew for this community.}

abstract = {Purpose
The main aim of this experiment was to investigate the perception of Foreign Accent Syndrome in comparison to speakers with an authentic foreign accent.
Method
Three groups of listeners attributed accents to conversational speech samples of 5 FAS speakers which were embedded amongst those of 5 speakers with a real foreign accent and 5 native speaker controls. The listening panels differed in their familiarity with foreign accented speech and speech pathology.
Results
The findings indicate that listeners’ perceptual responses to the three groups of speakers were essentially different at all levels of analysis. The native speaker controls were unequivocally recognized as native speakers of Dutch while the speakers with a real foreign accent were very reliably assessed as non-native speakers. The speakers with Foreign Accent Syndrome, however, were in some sense perceived as foreign and in some sense as native by listeners, but not as foreign as speakers with a real foreign accent nor as native as real native speakers. These results are accounted for in terms of a misinterpretation of markers of speech pathology as markers regional affiliation.
Conclusions
The findings of the experiment are consistent with the idea that the very nature of the foreign accent is different in both groups of speakers, although it cannot be fully excluded that the foreign impression in the two groups is one of degree. Learning outcomes: Readers are able to: (1) define Foreign Accent Syndrome as a motor speech disorder and identify the different subtypes of FAS, (2) describe the most important differences in listeners’ perceptual reactions to FAS and real foreign accents, and (3) discuss the findings of the present study in relation to other studies investigating accent attribution in FAS.}

abstract = {We report on a time-frequency analysis of electroencephalographic activity as native speakers (NSs) and non-native speakers (NNSs) resolve anaphoric reference at the recursive edge of embedded clauses in multi-clausal filler-gap dependencies. The fillers in these wh-dependencies involve lexically selected noun complements (Comp): quelle décision à propos de lui/à son sujet ‘which decision about him’ or unselected NP-modifiers (Mod): quelle décision le concernant ‘which decision regarding him’; they also involve the lexical encoding of antecedent gender (lui/elle ‘3p.sing.masc/fem’) or not (son ‘3p.sing.gen’) in a pronoun. We propose that NNSs adapt to processing a non-native language by directing more resources toward computing lexically encoded properties than toward inferences that go beyond lexical information. At the recursive clause edge, a population-wide asymmetry between conditions arose at 15–16Hz in induced power: Lexical selection and gender specification led to diminished power for Comp son vs. Mod le/la and for specified lui/elle vs. unspecified son in Comps. This was also found at 17–22Hz in induced power in NSs whereas asymmetries were reversed in NNSs, with computations of lexically encoded properties demanding greater power. At 41–44Hz in induced power, group differences emerged: More power was directed at gender-specified le/la and lui/elle in NNSs, but at unspecified son in NSs. These asymmetries suggest that non-native processing seems characterized by resources directed toward lexically encoded properties in computations.}

We sought to determine if the MTL plays a role in single-word decoding in healthy, normal skilled readers. The experiment follows from the implications of the dual-process model of single-word decoding, which provides distinct predictions about the nature of MTL involvement. The paradigm utilized word (regular and irregularly spelled words) and pseudoword (phonetically regular) stimuli that differed in their demand for non-lexical as opposed lexical decoding. The data clearly showed that the MTL system was not involved in single word decoding in skilled, native English readers. Neither the hippocampus nor the MTL system as a whole showed significant activation during lexical or non-lexical based decoding. The results provide evidence that lexical and non-lexical decoding are implemented by distinct but overlapping neuroanatomical networks. Non-lexical decoding appeared most uniquely associated with cuneus and fusiform gyrus activation biased toward the left hemisphere. In contrast, lexical decoding appeared associated with right middle frontal and supramarginal, and bilateral cerebellar activation. Both these decoding operations appeared in the context of a shared widespread network of activations including bilateral occipital cortex and superior frontal regions. These activations suggest that the absence of MTL involvement in either lexical or non-lexical decoding appears likely a function of the skilled reading ability of our sample such that whole-word recognition and retrieval processes do not utilize the declarative memory system, in the case of lexical decoding, and require only minimal analysis and recombination of the phonetic elements of a word, in the case of non-lexical decoding.}

Latent profile analysis was used to identify four groups of students with distinct academic performance and well-being profiles. Students from two groups, namely the low-performance and negative academic well-being groups, were more prone to school dropout, whereas students from the high-performance and average-performance groups were less likely to abandon secondary education. Implications for research on learning difficulties are discussed, as the results demonstrate strong relations between mathematics, reading and spelling in this age group.}
