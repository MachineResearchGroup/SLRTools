abstract = {Predicting human mobility is an important trajectory mining task for various applications, ranging from smart city planning to personalized recommendation system. While most of previous works adopt GPS tracking data to model human mobility, the recent fast-growing geo-tagged social media (GTSM) data brings new opportunities to this task. However, predicting human mobility on GTSM data is not trivial because of three challenges: 1) extreme data sparsity; 2) high order sequential patterns of human mobility and 3) evolving preference of users for tagging.In this paper, we propose ACN, an attentive convolutional network model for predicting human mobility from sparse and complex GTSM data. In ACN, we firstly design a multi-dimension embedding layer which jointly embeds key features (i.e., spatial, temporal and user features) that govern human mobility. Then, we regard the embedded trajectory as an "image" and learn short-term sequential patterns as local features of the image using convolution filters. Instead of directly using convention filters, we design hybrid dilated and separable convolution filters to effectively capture high order sequential patterns from lengthy trajectory. In addition, we propose an attention mechanism which learns the user long-term preference to augment convolutional network for mobility prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available GTSM datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The results demonstrate that ACN consistently outperforms existing state-of-art mobility prediction approaches on a variety of common evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Deployments of battery-powered IoT devices have become ubiquitous, monitoring everything from environmental conditions in smart cities to wildlife movements in remote areas. How to manage the life-cycle of sensors in such large-scale deployments is currently an open issue. Indeed, most deployments let sensors operate until they fail and fix or replace the sensors post-hoc. In this paper, we contribute by developing a new approach for facilitating the life-cycle management of large-scale sensor deployments through online estimation of battery health. Our approach relies on so-called V-edge dynamics which capture and characterize instantaneous voltage drops. Experiments carried out on a dataset of battery discharge measurements demonstrate that our approach is capable of estimating battery health with up to $80%$ accuracy, depending on the characteristics of the devices and the processing load they undergo. Our method is particularly well-suited for the sensor devices, operating dedicated tasks, that they have constant discharge during their operation.},

abstract = {Edge computing is one of the revolutionary technologies that enable high-performance and low-latency modern applications, such as smart cities, connected vehicles, etc. Yet its adoption has been limited by factors including high cost of edge resources, heterogeneous and fluctuating demands, and lack of reliability. In this paper, we study resource provisioning in edge computing, taking into account these different factors. First, based on observations from real demand traces, we propose a time-varying stochastic model to capture the time-dependent and uncertain demand and network dynamics in an edge network. We then apply a novel robustness model that accounts for both expected and worst-case performance of a service. Based on these models, we formulate edge provisioning as a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem. The problem is NP-hard even in the deterministic case. Leveraging the multi-stage structure, we apply nested Benders decomposition to solve the problem. We also describe several efficiency enhancement techniques, including a novel technique for quickly solving the large number of decomposed subproblems. Finally, we present results from real dataset-based simulations, which demonstrate the advantages of the proposed models, algorithm and techniques.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of science and technology, how to accurately identify the same vehicle under different cameras is of great significance to smart city construction. At present, most of the vehicle re-identification methods only use global features, and often neglect the local features that often play an important role in it. To overcome this problem, we propose a multi-scale feature network with an attention module to integrate global and local features. Multi-scale feature fusion to reduce the loss of information caused by network deepening obtained more feature information, and enables the network to learn multi-level feature information. The attention module can make the network pay more attention to the discriminative features of the vehicle, such as windshield stickers and scratches on the vehicle. At the same time, we weighted the local features considerations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and we achieve state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets, including VeRi-776 [1-3] and VRIC [4].},

The aim is to improve welfare and security of a society, e.g. a "smart" city. Even though adaptive ICT systems technically enable everyone to participate both as service consumer and provider without running the required technical infrastructure by oneself, uncertain knowledge on enforcement of legal, business, and social requirements impedes taking advantage of adaptive ICT systems. Not only IT risks on confidentiality and accountability are undecidable due to lack of control with the current trust infrastructure but also IT risks on integrity and availability due to lack of transparency. Reasons are insufficient quantification of IT risk as well as unacceptable knowledge on cause-and-effect relationships and accountability. This work introduces adaptive identity management to improve control and transparency for a trustworthy spontaneous information exchange as the critical activity of adaptive ICT systems.},

abstract = {We are now living in the significant era where technologies are advancing very quickly. Among the leading technologies, Internet of Things or IoT in short is standing at the peak of inflated expectation in the Gartner Hype Cycle [1]. The application of IoT has evolved from home appliances in the smart home environment such as smart tv, smart refrigerator, smart door and has grown into smart building, smart city, smart healthcare, smart industry. We could imagine that everything could go online to cut cost, add value to businesses and increase users convenience. The prediction has been made [2] that there will be 50 Billion IoT devices by 2020.Along the new revolution there has also been threats that significantly warned us if we didn't take security into account some bad things could happen, such as Mirai botnet [3] attacked dyn DNS server by using vulnerable IoT devices which turned smart devices became exploitable or vulnerable devices and named as the weakness link of the network. At the same time another hype among technology communities of using Blockchain Technology to secure the Internet of Things is getting mainstream.Blockchain is not a silver bullet to secure Internet of Things, in this paper we will propose an architecture model of using a Blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric to secure the Internet of Things network in a smart classroom scenario and integrated with The Thing Networks (TTN) cloud server and demonstrates the opportunities and challenges of this concept by taking security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation to evaluate the concept.},

abstract = {Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) have been widely used for Bayesian sampling from certain probability distributions, incorporating derivatives of the log-posterior. With the derivative evaluation of the log-posterior distribution, SGLD methods generate samples from the distribution through performing as a thermostats dynamics that traverses over gradient flows of the log-posterior with certainly controllable perturbation. Even when the density is not known, existing solutions still can first learn the kernel density models from the given datasets, then produce new samples using the SGLD over the kernel density derivatives. In this work, instead of exploring new samples from kernel spaces, a novel SGLD sampler, namely, Randomized Measurement Langevin Dynamics (RMLD) is proposed to sample the high-dimensional sparse representations from the spectral domain of a given dataset.Specifically, given a random measurement matrix for sparse coding, RMLD first derives a novel likelihood evaluator of the probability distribution from the loss function of LASSO, then samples from the high-dimensional distribution using stochastic Langevin dynamics with derivatives of the logarithm likelihood and Metropolis–Hastings sampling. In addition, new samples in low-dimensional measuring spaces can be regenerated using the sampled high-dimensional vectors and the measurement matrix. The algorithm analysis shows that RMLD indeed projects a given dataset into a high-dimensional Gaussian distribution with Laplacian prior, then draw new sparse representation from the dataset through performing SGLD over the distribution. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm using real-world datasets. The performance comparisons on three real-world applications demonstrate the superior performance of RMLD beyond baseline methods.},

abstract = {Smart cities are generally equipped with Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMS) as public infrastructure to have an overall perception of the air quality. However, the spatial density of the samples from the available public AQMS infrastructure is low, with a high cost of deployment and maintenance. Due to the spatial variation of the air quality and sparse deployment of AQMSs within a city, it is impossible to reliably obtain the air quality of a location far from a deployed AQMS. This paper provides a framework called AQuaMoHo that augments this existing system with a low-cost alternative that can even help the residents of a city to accurately monitor the air quality at any location in the town. AQuaMoHo relies on a low-cost thermo-hygrometer (THM) along with a GPS to populate various meteorological and demographic features, which are then used to predict the air quality reliably from any location. From a thorough study over two different cities, we observe that the proposed framework can significantly help annotate the air quality data at a personal scale.},

abstract = {Informative representation of road networks is essential to a wide variety of applications on intelligent transportation systems. In this article, we design a new learning framework, called Representation Learning for Road Networks (RLRN), which explores various intrinsic properties of road networks to learn embeddings of intersections and road segments in road networks. To implement the RLRN framework, we propose a new neural network model, namely Road Network to Vector (RN2Vec), to learn embeddings of intersections and road segments jointly by exploring geo-locality and homogeneity of them, topological structure of the road networks, and moving behaviors of road users. In addition to model design, issues involving data preparation for model training are examined. We evaluate the learned embeddings via extensive experiments on several real-world datasets using different downstream test cases, including node/edge classification and travel time estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed RN2Vec robustly outperforms existing methods, including (i) Feature-based methods: raw features and principal components analysis (PCA); (ii) Network embedding methods: DeepWalk, LINE, and Node2vec; and (iii) Features + Network structure-based methods: network embeddings and PCA, graph convolutional networks, and graph attention networks. RN2Vec significantly outperforms all of them in terms of F1-score in classifying traffic signals (11.96% to 16.86%) and crossings (11.36% to 16.67%) on intersections and in classifying avenue (10.56% to 15.43%) and street (11.54% to 16.07%) on road segments, as well as in terms of Mean Absolute Error in travel time estimation (17.01% to 23.58%).},

abstract = {The concept of event processing is established as a generic computational paradigm in various application fields, ranging from data processing in Web environments, over maritime and transport, to finance and medicine. Events report on state changes of a system and its environment. Complex Event Recognition (CER) in turn, refers to the identification of complex/composite events of interest, which are collections of simple events that satisfy some pattern, thereby providing the opportunity for reactive and proactive measures. Examples include the recognition of attacks in computer network nodes, human activities on video content, emerging stories and trends on the Social Web, traffic and transport incidents in smart cities, fraud in electronic marketplaces, cardiac arrhythmias, and epidemic spread. In each scenario, CER allows to make sense of Big event Data streams and react accordingly. The goal of this tutorial is to provide a step-by-step guide for realizing CER in the Big Data era. To do so, it elaborates on major challenges and describes algorithmic toolkits for optimized manipulation of event streams characterized by high volume, velocity and/or lack of veracity, placing emphasis on distributed CER over potentially heterogeneous (data variety) event sources. Finally, we highlight future research directions in the field.},

abstract = {Advances of IoT facilitates leverage of heterogeneous sensing data over the Internet, such as remote sensing data, traffic data and SNS data. Integrated analysis of IoT data is crucial part for urban emergency management in smart cities in order to predict various social events co-occurring with a natural disaster event. Discovering of spatiotemporal co-occurrence patterns is a task of integrated analysis of IoT data and has received a lot of attention. However, such spatiotemporal co-occurrence patterns can fail to capture local events that occur in limited regions and limited time intervals.In this paper, we consider the problem of mining spatiotemporal co-occurrence patterns from IoT sensing data, each of which is annotated with a valid spatial and temporal region. Our idea is to incorporate spatiotemporal clustering with the frequent itemset (pattern) discovery process to reduce spatiotemporal bias of event distributions and we repeat this process in greedy approach in order to capture patterns with difference scales. By this way, our algorithm improves accuracy of the frequent itemsets. We applied our method to discovery and prediction of traffic disaster events co-occurring with torrential rain events in Kansai area, Japan. Our experimental result shows 31% improvement of prediction performance on F-measure against a baseline.},

However, it is difficult to share local data directly because those data may contain private information, such as a picture with a user's face or lifelog data. Therefore, this paper provides a way of preserving privacy in interconnected IoT devices by sharing only learners from each device without sharing the original data directly.

abstract = {Sensor networks have become ubiquitous -- being present from personal smartphones to smart cities deployments -- and are producing large volumes of data at increasing rates. Distributed event stream processing systems, in its turn, are a specific kind of systems that help us to parallelize event processing. Therefore, they provide us capabilities to produce quick insights and decisions, in near real-time, on top of multiple data streams. However, current systems for large scale processing do not focus on Internet of Things and Sensor Network workloads, which makes the performance decrease quickly as the workload size increases. In order to process large scale events with acceptable latency percentiles and high throughput, special systems are needed, such as distributed event stream processing systems. In this work, we propose an architecture for Internet of Things data workloads, in a combination of sensor networks data sources and distributed event stream processing systems, focused on smart grid data profiles. In our evaluations, the system was able to process up to 45K messages per second using 8 processing nodes, while providing stable latencies for micro-batches above 30 seconds.},

abstract = {There is growing conviction that the future of computing depends on our ability to exploit big data on theWeb to enhance intelligent systems. This includes encyclopedic knowledge for factual details, common sense for human-like reasoning and natural language generation for smarter communication. With recent chatbots conceivably at the verge of passing the Turing Test, there are calls for more common sense oriented alternatives, e.g., the Winograd Schema Challenge. The Aristo QA system demonstrates the lack of common sense in current systems in answering fourth-grade science exam questions. On the language generation front, despite the progress in deep learning, current models are easily confused by subtle distinctions that may require linguistic common sense, e.g.quick food vs. fast food. These issues bear on tasks such as machine translation and should be addressed using common sense acquired from text. Mining common sense from massive amounts of data and applying it in intelligent systems, in several respects, appears to be the next frontier in computing. Our brief overview of the state of Commonsense Knowledge (CSK) in Machine Intelligence provides insights into CSK acquisition, CSK in natural language, applications of CSK and discussion of open issues.

abstract = {The immense stream of data from mobile devices during recent years enables one to learn more about human behavior and provide mobile phone users with personalized services. In this work, we identify clusters of users who share similar mobility behavioral patterns. We analyze trajectories of semantic locations to find users who have similar mobility “lifestyle,” even when they live in different areas. For this task, we propose a new grouping scheme that is called Lifestyle-Based Clustering (LBC). We represent the mobility movement of each user by a Markov model and calculate the Jensen–Shannon distances among pairs of users. The pairwise distances are represented by a similarity matrix, which is used for the clustering. To validate the unsupervised clustering task, we develop an entropy-based clustering measure, namely, an index that measures the homogeneity of mobility patterns within clusters of users. The analysis is validated on a real-world dataset that contains location-movements of 50,000 cellular phone users that were analyzed over a two-month period.},

abstract = {Realtime parking availability information is of great importance to help drivers to find a parking space faster and thus to reduce parking search traffic. While there are limited realtime parking availability systems in a city due to the expensive cost of sensor device and maintaining realtime parking information. In this paper, we estimate the realtime parking availability throughout a city using historical parking availability data reported by a limited number of existing sensors of parking lots and a variety of datasets we observed in the city, such as meteorology, events, map mobility trace data and navigation data from Baidu map, and POIs. We propose a deep-learning-based approach, called Du-Parking, which consists of three major components modeling temporal closeness, period and current general influence, respectively. More specifically, we employ long short-term memory (LSTM) to model the temporal closeness and period, and meanwhile using two fully-connected layers to model the current general factors. Our approach learns to dynamically aggregate the output of the three components, to estimate the final parking availability of given parking lot. Using the proposed approach, we have provided the realtime parking availability information in Baidu map app, in nine cities in China. We evaluated our approach in Beijing and Shenzhen. The results show the advantages of our method over two categories of baselines, including linear interpolations, and the well-known classification model like GBDT.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has an ever increasing impact on today's society. It has penetrated all aspects of human life that utilize smart solutions and serves as an ecosystem. IoT provides inexpensive way to interconnects various things and objects together towards delivering smarter services, e.g., smart home applications, smart cities, and smart cars. Meanwhile, however, cyber attacks have also increased along with all these developments. Due to resource constraints, IoT-enabled devices are considered as a potential major victim vulnerable to exploitation by attackers that can setup an IoT botnet and launch a large scale cyber attack, e.g., DDoS attacks. When such attacks occur, it is an extremely difficult task to track down or trace back the root cause. It is also a challenging task to identify where the attacks happened, for example, in which location the anomalies are located (i.e., the compromised IoT devices). To address this issue, the paper presents IoTDePT -- a framework of threat detection and identification that aims to detect and identify malware threats in an IoT environment at a fine-grained level. Clearly, detecting the malware threats and pinpointing the exact geographical locations of the compromised IoT devices that propagated the threats. Two potential use cases of darknet have been exemplified to illustrate the usage of our proposal. The preliminary results show that the proposed approach can successfully detect the malware threats, while achieving accuracy in pinpointing a compromised device's location.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in smart buildings are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, making buildings more livable, energy efficient, and sustainable. These devices sense the environment and generate multivariate temporal data of paramount importance for detecting anomalies and improving the prediction of energy usage in smart buildings. However, detecting these anomalies in centralized systems is often plagued by a huge delay in response time. To overcome this issue, we formulate the anomaly detection problem in a federated learning setting by leveraging the multi-task learning paradigm, which aims at solving multiple tasks simultaneously while taking advantage of the similarities and differences across tasks. We propose a novel privacy-by-design federated learning model using a stacked long short-time memory (LSTM) model, and we demonstrate that it is more than twice as fast during training convergence compared to the centralized LSTM. The effectiveness of our federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets generated by the IoT production system at General Electric Current smart building, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods in both classification and regression tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing the overall training cost without compromising the prediction performance.},

Mining such data to extract meaningful patterns that are reflective of collective user activities and behavior can benefit mobile network resource management as well as the design and operations of mobile applications and services. However, diverse feature distributions inherent in such data make such a task challenging. In this paper we advocate an approach based on advanced machine learning algorithms to transform original data matrices into a feature distributional similarity graph and extract latent patterns from complex structures of geoMobile data. Our analysis is further aided with a visualization technique.

abstract = {We continue to see increasingly widespread deployment of IoT devices, with apparent intent to embed them in our built environment likely to accelerate if smart city and related programmes succeed. In this paper we are concerned with the ways in which current generation IoT devices are being designed in terms of their ill-considered dependencies on network connectivity and services. Our hope is to provide evidence that such dependencies need to be better thought through in design, and better documented in implementation so that those responsible for deploying these devices can be properly informed as to the impact of device deployment (at scale) on infrastructure resilience. We believe this will be particularly relevant as we feel that commodity IoT devices are likely to be commonly used to retrofit "smart" capabilities to existing buildings, particularly domestic buildings.To the existing body of work on network-level behaviour of IoT devices, we add (i) a protocol-level breakdown and analysis of periodicity, (ii) an exploration of the service and infrastructure dependencies that will implicitly be taken in "smart" environments when IoT devices are deployed, and (iii) examination of the robustness of device operation when connectivity is disrupted. We find that many devices make use of services distributed across the planet and thus appear dependent on the global network infrastructure even when carrying out purely local actions. Some devices cease to operate properly without network connectivity (even where their behaviour appears, on the face of it, to require only local information, e.g., the Hive thermostat). Further, they exhibit quite different network behaviours, typically involving significantly more traffic and possibly use of otherwise unobserved protocols, when connectivity is recovered after some disruption.},

abstract = {The process of automatic generation of a road map from GPS trajectories, called map inference, remains a challenging task to perform on a geospatial data from a variety of domains as the majority of existing studies focus on road maps in cities. Inherently, existing algorithms are not guaranteed to work on unusual geospatial sites, such as an airport tarmac, pedestrianized paths and shortcuts, or animal migration routes, etc. Moreover, deep learning has not been explored well enough for such tasks.This paper introduces COLTRANE, ConvolutiOnaL TRAjectory NEtwork, a novel deep map inference framework which operates on GPS trajectories collected in various environments. This framework includes an Iterated Trajectory Mean Shift (ITMS) module to localize road centerlines, which copes with noisy GPS data points. Convolutional Neural Network trained on our novel trajectory descriptor is then introduced into our framework to detect and accurately classify junctions for refinement of the road maps. COLTRANE yields up to 37% improvement in F1 scores over existing methods on two distinct real-world datasets: city roads and airport tarmac.},

As a result, the authors find that names as subjects and objects in English language texts alone do not introduce human bias to the sentences' sentiment values.

Unfortunately current continuous query languages (CQL) lack the features and constructs needed to support the more advanced applications. For example recursive queries are now part of SQL, Datalog, and other query languages, but they are not supported by most CQLs, a fact that caused a significant loss of expressive power, which is further aggravated by the limitation that only non-blocking queries can be supported. To overcome these limitations we have developed an a dvanced st ream r easo ning system ASTRO that builds on recent advances in supporting aggregates in recursive queries. In this demo, we will briefly elucidate the formal Streamlog semantics, which combined with the Pre-Mappability (PreM) concept, allows the declarative specification of many complex continuous queries, which are then efficiently executed in real-time by the portable ASTRO architecture. Using different case studies, we demonstrate (i) the ease-of-use, (ii) the expressive power and (iii) the robustness of our system, as compared to other state-of-the-art declarative CQL systems.},

abstract = {Large volumes of event data are becoming increasingly available in a wide variety of applications, such as healthcare analytics, smart cities and social network analysis. The precise time interval or the exact distance between two events carries a great deal of information about the dynamics of the underlying systems. These characteristics make such data fundamentally different from independently and identically distributed data and time-series data where time and space are treated as indexes rather than random variables. Marked temporal point processes are the mathematical framework for modeling event data with covariates. However, typical point process models often make strong assumptions about the generative processes of the event data, which may or may not reflect the reality, and the specifically fixed parametric assumptions also have restricted the expressive power of the respective processes. Can we obtain a more expressive model of marked temporal point processes? How can we learn such a model from massive data?In this paper, we propose the Recurrent Marked Temporal Point Process (RMTPP) to simultaneously model the event timings and the markers. The key idea of our approach is to view the intensity function of a temporal point process as a nonlinear function of the history, and use a recurrent neural network to automatically learn a representation of influences from the event history. We develop an efficient stochastic gradient algorithm for learning the model parameters which can readily scale up to millions of events. Using both synthetic and real world datasets, we show that, in the case where the true models have parametric specifications, RMTPP can learn the dynamics of such models without the need to know the actual parametric forms; and in the case where the true models are unknown, RMTPP can also learn the dynamics and achieve better predictive performance than other parametric alternatives based on particular prior assumptions.},

abstract = {Cloud computing systems have become not only popular, but extensively used. They are supported and exploited by both industry and academia. Cloud providers have diversified and so did the software offered by their systems. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds are now available from single virtual machine use cases, such as a personal server, to specialized high performance or machine learning engines. This popularity has been brought by the low-cost and risk-free feature of renting computing resources instead of buying them, in a large, one-time investment. Furthermore, clouds permit their clients the use of elasticity.Elasticity is the most relevant feature of cloud computing. It refers to the clients' ability to easily change the number of rented resources in a live environment. This permits the entire system to handle differences in load. Most cloud clients serve web applications or services to third parties. In these cases, load differences can be correlated to the number of users for the service and elasticity is used to handle differences in what is called user load. Most of the scientific literature approaches elasticity looking solely at user load. To give a clearer understanding, the majority of cloud frameworks in use today work as follows: they start a number of worker nodes, and tasks are assigned to them for execution. Only when the user load changes, the number of workers is adjusted, if any.In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, where the number of workers depends on the actual requirements coming from the different execution steps of an application. We show such an idea can be achieved for several workflows from different fields and that it can bring significant benefits to execution time and cost.},

abstract = {Automated data collection in urban transportation systems produces a large volume of passenger data. However, quite a few of the data are still incomplete, limiting the insight into passenger mobility. The unavailability of destination information in entry-only passenger data is a very common issue. Traditional approaches for estimating passenger destinations rely on heuristics that can recover only some of the missing destinations. To deal with the remaining incomplete data, this paper, for the first time, proposes a second-order inference methodology to leverage semi-supervised self-training to infer the missing destinations. The methodology involves the design of a base learner to predict the missing destinations based on the statistics of a selected similarity-based "training set", and the design of a selection strategy to select new data with high prediction confidence to update the training set. To further improve the inference, we incorporate personal history priors to modify the base learner. We evaluate our designs using two data sources: a real-data inspired traffic-passenger behavior simulation in the city of Porto, Portugal, and the real bus Automated Fare Collection (AFC) data collected from the same city. The experimental results show that compared to baseline methods that do not use self-training, our approach significantly improves the inference performance and achieves notably high accuracies.},

Extraction of relevant features is challenging and known to be one of the key issues in many applications where the visual pattern recognition is applied (object recognition and tracking, image identification, multimedia document categorization, indexing and retrieval, deep learning based visual feature coding, video surveillance, robotic, activity recognition). Furthermore the extraction features from a big volume of image and video data is time and resources consuming. In the context of the ITEA2 project H4H/PerfCloud ( Performance in the Cloud) we have developed parallel OpenMP threads video engine search. To scale the extraction of visual features from a large volume of streaming visual content, we have developed a framework based on OpenMP and MPI one-sided communication where the computation and communication are overlapped thanks to the RDMA approach.},

abstract = {The emerging 5G mobile network is a prominent technology for addressing networking related challenges of Internet of Things (IoT). The forthcoming 5G is expected to allow low-power massive IoT devices to produce high volumes of data that can be transmitted over ultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communication services. However, IoT systems encounter several security and privacy issues to prevent unauthorized access to IoT nodes. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel blockchain-based architecture that leverages Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) for securing IoT transactions. A novel security appliance is introduced in a form of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) for improving the scalability and performance of IoT networks. Then, we introduce a novel consensus algorithm to detect and report suspected IoT nodes and mitigate malicious traffic. We evaluate and compare our proposed solution against three well-known consensus algorithms, i.e., Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET), and Proof of Stake (PoS). We demonstrate that the proposed solution provides substantially lower latency and higher throughput as well as trustworthy IoT communication.},

abstract = {OpenStreetMap (OSM) is currently the richest publicly available information source on geographic entities (e.g., buildings and roads) worldwide. However, using OSM entities in machine learning models and other applications is challenging due to the large scale of OSM, the extreme heterogeneity of entity annotations, and a lack of a well-defined ontology to describe entity semantics and properties. This paper presents GeoVectors - a unique, comprehensive world-scale linked open corpus of OSM entity embeddings covering the entire OSM dataset and providing latent representations of over 980 million geographic entities in 180 countries. The GeoVectors corpus captures semantic and geographic dimensions of OSM entities and makes these entities directly accessible to machine learning algorithms and semantic applications. We create a semantic description of the GeoVectors corpus, including identity links to the Wikidata and DBpedia knowledge graphs to supply context information. Furthermore, we provide a SPARQL endpoint - a semantic interface that offers direct access to the semantic and latent representations of geographic entities in OSM.},

abstract = {Trajectory recovery can benefit many applications such as migration pattern studies of animal and finding hot routes in the urban city. It is necessary to recover trajectory with limited trajectory points to utilize collected trajectory data in a reasonable and efficient way and to provide the better location based service for users. However, the trajectory data involves complex and nonlinear spatial-temporal impacts which cannot be captured by traditional trajectory recovery methods. Moreover, the existing methods consider little about the correlations between trajectory and traffic pattern in the urban city. The superiority of deep neural network makes it possible to recover trajectory with low data quality. We propose a Multi-Task Representation Learning Network (MRL-Net) framework which models the complex nonlinear spatial-temporal correlations in trajectory data with representation learning technique and capture the dependencies of trajectory points with recurrent neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper to address the trajectory recovery problem with representation learning and multi-task learning. Experiments on real-world trajectory data show that our model is superior to state-of-the-art methods.},

At the same time, the inherent safety and privacy risks associated with drone-based applications call for appropriate testing and monitoring tools. In this paper, we present a simulation environment and digital twin support for a platform that allows the managed execution of drone-based applications on top of a shared drone infrastructure. On the one hand, the simulation environment makes it possible to perform a wide range of tests regarding the operation of both the platform itself and the applications that run on top of it, before deploying them in the real world. On the other hand, after deployment, a digital twin of the drone is used to detect deviations of the application from the expected behavior, which, in turn, can serve as an indication of bugs that remained undetected during the simulation tests or malfunctions that occur at runtime. We discuss the most important elements of our approach and the simulation and digital twin components of the proposed system. Also, we provide a functional evaluation of our work by presenting its capabilities regarding both offline testing and runtime checking through indicative use cases.},

abstract = {Bike-sharing systems have become an established reality in cities all across the world and are a key component of the Smart City paradigm. However, the unbalanced traffic patterns during rush hours can completely empty some stations, while filling others, and the service becomes unavailable for further users. The traditional approach to solve this problem is to use rebalancing trucks, which take bikes from full stations and deposit them at empty ones, reducing the likelihood of system outages. Another paradigm that is gaining steam is gamification, i.e., incentivizing users to fix the system by influencing their behavior with rewards and prizes. In this work, we combine the two efforts and show that a joint optimization considering both rebalancing and incentives results in a higher service quality for a lower cost than using simple rebalancing. We use simulations based on the New York CitiBike usage data to validate our model and analyze several schemes to optimize the bike-sharing system.},

abstract = { The significant advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) have led to IoT applications being widely used in various scenarios ranging from smart city, smart farming, to Industrial IoT (IIoT) solutions. With the explosion of IoT application development, IoT middleware platforms are increasingly being used for hosting such IoT applications. This has given rise to the need for developing benchmarking solutions to analyze and test the performance of different middleware platforms that host these IoT applications. To develop such benchmarks, there are a number of key components that are needed. One of these components is an IoT dataset. To generate such datasets, representing IoT application requirements in a general and formal way is important. In this paper, we propose a framework to model the IoT Applications Requirements and enable Data Generation(ARDG-IoT). The framework supports a formal way to capture IoT application requirements and use these requirements to generate IoT data that can be used to create benchmarks for different IoT middleware platforms. ARDG-IoT consists of our proposed model, IoTSySML, which captures the application requirements, and an IoT data simulator tool, which is used to generate IoT data. We present an evaluation of the framework using a real world Industrial IoT application case study.},

abstract = {Ambient air pollution in urban areas is a significant health hazard, with over 4.2 million deaths annually attributed to it. A crucial step in tackling these challenge is to measure air quality at a fine spatiotemporal granularity. A promising approach for several smart city projects, called drive-by sensing, is to leverage vehicles retrofitted with different sensors (pollution monitors, etc.) that can provide the desired spatiotemporal coverage at a fraction of the cost. However, deploying a drive-by sensing network at a city-scale to optimally select vehicles from a large fleet is still unexplored. In this paper, we propose Modulo -- a system to bootstrap drive-by sensing deployment by taking into consideration a variety of aspects such as spatiotemporal coverage, budget constraints. Modulo is well-suited to satisfy unique deployment constraints such as colocations with other sensors (needed for gas and PM sensor calibration), etc. We compare Modulo with two baseline algorithms on real-world taxi and bus datasets. Modulo significantly outperforms the baselines when a fleet comprises of both taxis and fixed-route vehicles such as public transport buses. Finally, we present a real-world case study that uses Modulo to select vehicles for an air pollution sensing application.},

abstract = {Smart cities can be viewed as large-scale Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) where different sensors and devices record the cyber and physical indicators of the city systems. The collected data are used for improving urban life by offering services such as accurate electric load forecasting, and more efficient traffic management. Traditional monitoring for electricity and transportation networks generally do not provide full observability due to their limited coverage as well as high implementation and maintenance costs. For example, continuous traffic data collection is mostly limited to major highways only in big cities, whereas local roadways are usually covered once or twice a year. Also, there are no high-fidelity and real-time electric monitoring systems in all parts of power distribution networks. Combining the limited data from each of the urban systems together (e.g., electricity, transportation, environment, etc.) provides a better picture of the energy flow in a city. Furthermore, a city should be considered as a collection of the layers of tangled infrastructure networks, which connects people, places, and resources. Therefore, the study of traffic or electricity consumption forecasting should go beyond the transportation and electricity networks and merge with each other and even with other city networks such as environmental networks. As such, this article proposes a Bayesian spatiotemporal Gaussian Process model that employs the most informative spatiotemporal interdependency among different interconnected networks (in this case, electricity, transportation, and weather). The proposed load forecasting method is compared with other state-of-the-art methods using real-life data obtained from the City of Tallahassee in Florida. Results show that the proposed Bayesian spatiotemporal Gaussian Process model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {There have been significant advances in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) recently, which have not always considered security or data security concerns: A high degree of security is required when considering the sharing of medical data over networks. In most IoT-based systems, especially those within smart-homes and smart-cities, there is a bridging point (fog computing) between a sensor network and the Internet which often just performs basic functions such as translating between the protocols used in the Internet and sensor networks, as well as small amounts of data processing. The fog nodes can have useful knowledge and potential for constructive security and control over both the sensor network and the data transmitted over the Internet. Smart healthcare services utilise such networks of IoT systems. It is therefore vital that medical data emanating from IoT systems is highly secure, to prevent fraudulent use, whilst maintaining quality of service providing assured, verified and complete data. In this article, we examine the development of a Cognitive Fog (CF) model, for secure, smart healthcare services, that is able to make decisions such as opting-in and opting-out from running processes and invoking new processes when required, and providing security for the operational processes within the fog system. Overall, the proposed ensemble security model performed better in terms of Accuracy Rate, Detection Rate, and a lower False Positive Rate (standard intrusion detection measurements) than three base classifiers (K-NN, DBSCAN, and DT) using a standard security dataset (NSL-KDD).},

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that utilizes computing and storage resources of edge devices. Compared with traditional cloud computing, edge computing migrates data computation and storage to the edge devices. Recently many technical breakthroughs have been made in edge computing. This survey reviews existing research on edge computing with a focus on the three mainstream dimensions: resource allocation, data fusion and security. We present specific techniques of the three dimensions and how they can contribute to the improvement of edge computing. Emerging and prospective application fields that would benefit from edge computing are also discussed.},

Traditional urban function research using government administrative zoning systems is often conducted in a coarse resolution with fixed split, and ignore the reshaping of zones by city growth. To solve this problem, we propose a two-stage framework in order to represent the high-definition distribution of urban function across the city, by analyzing continuous human traces extracted from the dense, widespread, and full-time cellular data. At the representation stage, we embed the locations of base stations by modeling the user movements with staying and transfer events, along with the consideration of dynamic trip purposes in continuous human traces. At the annotation stage, we first divide the city into the finest unit zones and each covers at least one base station. By clustering the base stations, we further group the unit zones into functional zones. Last, we annotate functional zones based on the local point-of-interest (POI) information. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed high-definition function study in two tasks: (i) in-zone crowd flow prediction, and (ii) zone-enhanced POI recommendation. The results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method with both the effectiveness of city split and the high-quality function annotation.},

abstract = {The paths leading to future networks are pointing towards a data-driven paradigm to better cater to the explosive growth of mobile services as well as the increasing heterogeneity of mobile devices, many of which generate and consume large volumes and variety of data. These paths are also hampered by significant challenges in terms of security, privacy, services provisioning, and network management. Blockchain, which is a technology for building distributed ledgers that provide an immutable log of transactions recorded in a distributed network, has become prominent recently as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and is revolutionizing data storage and processing in computer network systems. For future data-driven networks (DDNs), blockchain is considered as a promising solution to enable the secure storage, sharing, and analytics of data, privacy protection for users, robust, trustworthy network control, and decentralized routing and resource managements. However, many important challenges and open issues remain to be addressed before blockchain can be deployed widely to enable future DDNs. In this article, we present a survey on the existing research works on the application of blockchain technologies in computer networks and identify challenges and potential solutions in the applications of blockchains in future DDNs. We identify application scenarios in which future blockchain-empowered DDNs could improve the efficiency and security, and generally the effectiveness of network services.},

abstract = {The rising of deep learning has facilitated the development of single image super-resolution (SISR). However, the growing burdensome model complexity and memory occupation severely hinder its practical deployments on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we propose a novel joint-distillation (JDSR) framework to boost the representation of various off-the-shelf lightweight SR models. The framework includes two stages: the superior LR generation and the joint-distillation learning. The superior LR is obtained from the HR image itself. With less than $300$K parameters, the peer network using superior LR as input can achieve comparable SR performance with large models, e.g., RCAN, with 15M parameters, which enables it as the input of peer network to save the training expense. The joint-distillation learning consists of internal self-distillation and external mutual learning. The internal self-distillation aims to achieve model self-boosting by transferring the knowledge from the deeper SR output to the shallower one. Specifically, each intermediate SR output is supervised by the HR image and the soft label from subsequent deeper outputs. To shrink the capacity gap between shallow and deep layers, a soft label generator is designed in a progressive backward fusion way with meta-learning for adaptive weight fine-tuning. The external mutual learning focuses on obtaining interaction information from a peer network in the process. Moreover, a curriculum learning strategy and a performance gap threshold are introduced for balancing the convergence rate of the original SR model and its peer network. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposal improves the performance of recent lightweight SR models by a large margin, with the same model architecture and inference expense.},

abstract = {With growing urbanization, being able to track urban change is important to plan cities better. Land-use classification of satellite data has been actively used for this purpose. We augment this analysis through the use of crowd-sourced data about the road network in cities, obtained through the Open Street Maps platform. We develop several indicators to quantify the spatial layout of cities and how different localities have changed over time. We apply our methods to study seven Indian cities (Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai) and relate our findings with that of other studies. Our contribution lies in synthesizing two freely available datasets of satellite imagery and road information to develop a series of standardized indicators for different aspects of urbanization, which can serve to compare various cities with one another and to track change happening in the cities over time.},
