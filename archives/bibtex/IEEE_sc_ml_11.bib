abstract={In this paper, we study the challenging problem of how to balance taxi distribution across a city in a dynamic ridesharing service. First, we introduce the architecture of the dynamic ridesharing system and formally define the performance metrics indicating the efficiency of the system. Then, we propose a hybrid solution involving a series of algorithms: the Correlated Pooling collects correlated rider requests, the Adjacency Ride-Matching based on Demand Learning assigns taxis to riders and balances taxi distribution locally, the Greedy Idle Movement aims to direct taxis without a current assignment to the areas with riders in need of service. In the experiment, we apply city-scale data sets from the city of Chicago and complete a case study analyzing the threshold of correlated rider requests and the average online running time of each algorithm. We also compare our hybrid solution with multiple other methods. The results of our experiment show that our hybrid solution improves customer serving rate without increasing the number of taxis in operation, allows both drivers to earn more and riders to save more per trip, and all with a small increase in calling and extra trip time.},

abstract={With the development of information and communication technology, the situation of communication frauds is becoming more and more serious, how to identify fraudulent telephone accurately and effectively has become an urgent task in telecom operation at present. Affected by the power law distribution, existing machine learning methods are used to identify the unbalanced distribution data set of positive and negative samples with low recognition accuracy. This paper proposes ADASYN+RF model. First of all, for the problem of unbalanced data sets, this paper chooses the ADASYN(Adaptive Synthetic Sampling) algorithm to rebalance the original data set. Secondly, we choose the random forest algorithm is employed to train the new data set to avoid overfitting. Finally, two groups of comparative experiments are carried out respectively, and the results show that: (1) For the processing of biased data, the ADASYN algorithm used in this paper is more advantageous than the traditional SMOTE algorithm;(2) Compared with Nonintegrated learning model, the accuracy, recall rate and F1 value of the ADASYN+RF model are significantly improved.},

abstract={In this paper we tackle the problem of vehicle re-identification in a camera network utilizing triplet embeddings. Re-identification is the problem of matching appearances of objects across different cameras. With the proliferation of surveillance cameras enabling smart and safer cities, there is an ever-increasing need to re-identify vehicles across cameras. Typical challenges arising in smart city scenarios include variations of viewpoints, illumination and self occlusions. Most successful approaches for re-identification involve (deep) learning an embedding space such that the vehicles of same identities are projected closer to one another, compared to the vehicles representing different identities. Popular loss functions for learning an embedding (space) include contrastive or triplet loss. In this paper we provide an extensive evaluation of these losses applied to vehicle re-identification and demonstrate that using the best practices for learning embeddings outperform most of the previous approaches proposed in the vehicle re-identification literature. Compared to most existing state-of-the-art approaches, our approach is simpler and more straightforward for training utilizing only identity-level annotations, along with one of the smallest published embedding dimensions for efficient inference. Furthermore in this work we introduce a formal evaluation of a triplet sampling variant (batch sample) into the re-identification literature.},

abstract={Low power wide area networks support the success of long range Internet of things applications such as agriculture, security, smart cities and homes. This enormous popularity, however, breeds new challenging problems as the wireless spectrum gets saturated which increases the probability of collisions and performance degradation. To this end, smart spectrum decisions are needed and will be supported by wireless technology recognition to allow the networks to dynamically adapt to the ever changing environment where fair co-existence with other wireless technologies becomes essential. In contrast to existing research that assesses technology recognition using machine learning on powerful graphics processing units, this work aims to propose a deep learning solution using convolutional neural networks, cheap software defined radios and efficient embedded platforms such as NVIDIA's Jetson Nano. More specifically, this paper presents low complexity near-real time multi-band sub-GHz technology recognition and supports a wide variety of technologies using multiple settings. Results show accuracies around 99%, which are comparable with state of the art solutions, while the classification time on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano remains small and offers real-time execution. These results will enable smart spectrum management without the need of expensive and high power consuming hardware.},

abstract={The interest in developing smart cities has increased dramatically in recent years. In this context an intelligent transportation system depicts a major topic. The forecast of traffic flow is indispensable for an efficient intelligent transportation system. The traffic flow forecast is a difficult task, due to its stochastic and non linear nature. Besides classical statistical methods, neural networks are a promising possibility to predict future traffic flow. In our work, this prediction is performed with various recurrent neural networks. These are trained on measurements of induction loops, which are placed in intersections of the city Hagen. We utilized data from beginning of January to the end of July in 2018. Each model incorporates sequences of the measured traffic flow from all sensors and predicts the future traffic flow for each sensor simultaneously. A variety of model architectures, forecast horizons and input data were investigated. Most often the vector output model with gated recurrent units achieved the smallest error on the test set over all considered prediction scenarios. Due to the small amount of data, generalization of the trained models is limited.},

abstract={Intelligent image processing based on deep learning is a recently emerging artificial Intelligence method which is critical in the next generation computing systems. Key-speaker detection using image processing aims to find the speaker who plays the most important role in complex multi-person scenes. However, existing speaker detection methods just judge whether there is somebody talking. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a novel key-speaker detection approach named Speaker Pose-Attention deteCtion modEl (SPACE). This approach extracts the space information and analyze peoples attention gathering to find the key-speaker. The method consists of two main parts. The first part is our proposed Importance Detection Model (IDM) using human pose estimation and an effective evaluation strategy to find candidates of important speaker. The second part consists of Pose-Attention Graph (PAG) and link analysis algorithm. The PAG represents peoples attention graph. The link analysis algorithm analyzes the connectivity of this graph to find the key-speaker. Due to the lack of available key-speaker detection datasets, a self-collected dataset containing speech and meeting scenes has been built to estimate SPACE model. The experimental results show that the proposed method can obtain the best detection accuracy compared with other existing methods.},

abstract={The researches on text classification range from traditional machine learning methods which depend on handcrafted features to recent deep learning models which learn complex and non-linear relationships automatically. While neural models have been proven to be effective for text classification, they operate like a black box and offer no interpretability for humans. In this paper, we study the state-of-the-art text classification model fastText and propose a mathematical approach to interpret the behavior of fastText into a score matrix. By decomposing the output of fastText into the sum of word-level importance scores, we can observe how each word contributes to the final prediction and understand the inner implementation of fastText. What is more, inspired by the idea of score matrix, we have also proposed two frequency matrix based methods which are totally obtained from simple statistics but achieve reasonable performance under certain conditions. At last, we perform extensive experiments on various benchmarking text classification datasets to offer clear explanations about how fastText makes predictions with the score matrix, and we provide a comprehensive analysis on frequency matrix based methods. The deep investigation into fastText helps us understand the decision making process as well as provides heuristic ideas on how to design more effective text classification models in the future.},

abstract={Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted much interest in its wide applications, such as smart healthcare, home automation, transportation, and smart city. In these IoT-based systems, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are highly used to gather information needed by smart environments. However, due to huge heterogeneous data coming from different sensing devices, IoT-enabled WSNs face different challenges, such as high communication delay, low throughput, and poor network lifetime. In this article, a deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL)-based intelligent routing scheme is proposed for IoT-enabled WSNs that significantly reduce delay and increase network lifetime. The proposed algorithm divides the whole network into different unequal clusters depending on the current data load present in the sensor node that significantly prevents immature death of the network. An extensive experiment on the proposed algorithm is performed using ns3. The experimental results are compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of the number of alive nodes, packet delivery, energy efficiency, and communication delay in the network.},

We choose spectral representations and features for speech as those concepts associate with the core topics in DSP such as FFT and autoregressive spectra.

abstract={The Internet of Things [IoT] promises to revolutionize the way we interact with our surroundings. Smart cars, smart cities, smart homes are now being realized with the help of various embedded devices that operate with little to no human interaction. However these embedded devices bring forth a plethora of security challenges as most manufacturers still assign higher importance to the three Ps (prototyping, production and performance) than security. This inherent flaw has manifested itself in the form of various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks orchestrated with the help of unsolicited IoT devices on the Internet. We are even seeing massive throughputs without the need for amplifications affecting large scale infrastructures on the Internet. Thus, understanding the nature of these attacks and quickly identifying infected devices becomes imperative to combat this situation. In this paper we present a model to classify unsolicited IoT devices in enterprises using machine learning (ML). Namely IP header information from darknet data is collected for analysis. We then consider multiple supervised ML algorithms to classify these Layer 3 headers. We evaluate these algorithms and compare their performances in terms of accurately identifying activities of malicious IoT devices on the Internet. Our results show that Random Forest and Gradient Boosting have high recall and precision scores whereas NaiveBayes has the worst performance. We believe our model can be used by enterprises as a part of their intrusion detection system to quickly identify infected IoT devices within their own environment as well as identify scanning activities directed towards them.},

abstract={Low-rank minimization aims to recover a matrix of minimum rank subject to linear system constraint. It can be found in various data analysis and machine learning areas, such as recommender systems, video denoising, and signal processing. Nuclear norm minimization is a dominating approach to handle it. However, such a method ignores the difference among singular values of target matrix. To address this issue, nonconvex low-rank regularizers have been widely used. Unfortunately, existing methods suffer from different drawbacks, such as inefficiency and inaccuracy. To alleviate such problems, this article proposes a flexible model with a novel nonconvex regularizer. Such a model not only promotes low rankness but also can be solved much faster and more accurate. With it, the original low-rank problem can be equivalently transformed into the resulting optimization problem under the rank restricted isometry property (rank-RIP) condition. Subsequently, Nesterov's rule and inexact proximal strategies are adopted to achieve a novel algorithm highly efficient in solving this problem at a convergence rate of O(1/K), with K being the iterate count. Besides, the asymptotic convergence rate is also analyzed rigorously by adopting the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) inequality. Furthermore, we apply the proposed optimization model to typical low-rank problems, including matrix completion, robust principal component analysis (RPCA), and tensor completion. Exhaustively empirical studies regarding data analysis tasks, i.e., synthetic data analysis, image recovery, personalized recommendation, and background subtraction, indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract={Information and communication technologies have been widely used to achieve the objective of smart city development. A smart air quality sensing and forecasting system is an important part of a smart city. One of the major challenges in designing such a forecast system is ensuring high accuracy and an acceptable computation time. In this paper, we show that it is possible to accurately forecast fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations with low computation time by using different clustering techniques. An Internet of Things framework comprising of Airbox devices for PM2.5 monitoring has been used to acquire the data. Our main focus is to achieve high forecasting accuracy with reduced computation time. We use a hybrid model to do the forecast and a grid based system to cluster the monitoring stations based on the geographical distance. The experiments and evaluation is done using Airbox devices data from 557 stations deployed all over Taiwan. We are able to demonstrate that a proper clustering based on geographical distance can reduce the forecasting error rate and also the computation time. Also, in order to further evaluate our system, we have applied wavelet-based clustering to group the monitoring stations. A final comparative analysis is done for different clustering schemes with respect to accuracy and computational time.},

abstract={We develop a novel end-to-end trainable feature selection-forecasting (FSF) architecture for predictive networks targeted at the Internet of Things (IoT). In contrast with the existing filter-based, wrapper-based and embedded feature selection methods, our architecture enables the automatic selection of features dynamically based on feature importance score calculation and gamma-gated feature selection units that are trained jointly and end-to-end with the forecaster. We compare the performance of our FSF architecture on the problem of forecasting IoT device traffic against the following existing (feature selection, forecasting) technique pairs: Autocorrelation Function (ACF), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Recurrent Feature Elimination (RFE) and Ridge Regression methods for feature selection, and Linear Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), 1 Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Logistic Regression for forecasting. We show that our FSF architecture achieves either the best or close to the best performance among all of the competing techniques by virtue of its dynamic, automatic feature selection capability. In addition, we demonstrate that both the training time and the execution time of FSF are reasonable for IoT applications. This work represents a milestone for the development of predictive networks for IoT in smart cities of the near future.},

abstract={This study aims to explore the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for estimating the relationship between accidents and other variables with a small dataset. ANNs have not been used to explore relationships between variables, especially for road accidents which have small datasets. Analysis of road traffic accidents is often hampered due to insufficient datasets. Especially, for the cases when specific highway facilities are considered. This issue is also gaining importance for analyzing traveler behavior with the advent of new technologies and implementation of concepts of smart cities. The accident sites selected for this study comprise of unsignalized intersections in Penang State of Malaysia. Accidents in Malaysia have become a major concern for the authorities. However, the data collection is a major issue hindering its analysis because of limited datasets. The safe operation of traffic on unsignalized intersections mainly depends on drivers' judgement and decision making. Hence, the safety considerations on such locations are peculiar in comparison to other facilities. These facts led to carrying out the study for these sites. Two types of ANNs were used i.e. Multilayer Feedforward (MLFF) and linear. In addition, regression model and Mann-Whitney test were also used to compare the results from ANNs. It was found that regression model as well as Mann-Whitney test gave inconclusive results for the available dataset. On the other hand, ANNs were able to approximate the relationship in conformity to the previous studies. It was found that major road width and near-to-far-volume ratio increases the accidents while near-to-far-gap ratio reduces the accidents. The accuracy of ANNs was also better than regression model with an average error of less 40% for ANNs compared to 46% by regression model. However, larger datasets are expected to give better accuracies for regression as well as ANNs.},

abstract={Nowadays, big cities are facing many challenges with respect to traffic congestion, climate change, air and water pollution, among others. Thus, smart cities are intended to improve the life quality of the citizens, tackling such issues with the integration of information and communication technologies to reduce the impact and achieve a well-being state of citizens. In this work, a model to predict the traffic congestion applying a support vector machine method is proposed. In addition, a crowdsourcing approach based on mining the Twitter social networks collecting events associated with the traffic is also proposed. The main contribution of this research is focused on providing a methodology that characterizes the traffic congestion analyzing crowd-sensed data from a geospatial perspective. This approach was implemented over the Mexico City as a case study, in order to forecast possible future traffic events in the city, in which the citizens share their particular situation to discover alternatives routes for avoiding the traffic congestion. Future works are oriented towards designing mobile applications in order to introduce the proposed approach and integrate information from multiple platforms and navigation systems.},

abstract={The persistent problem circulating around various university canteens has always been about high crowd density during lunch hours. To efficiently tackle this issue, a platform called “vCanteen” has been developed that integrates an online food ordering system, a virtual queuing system, together with a machine learning-based crowd estimation system. vCanteen aims at reducing queuing time when ordering food, and allowing users to know the estimated crowd density in a university canteen in real-time. The crowd estimation system has been developed using a multi-column convolutional neural network (MCNN). This paper discusses the vCanteen prototype that was developed and tested at the canteen in the Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. The description of the crowd estimation system is provided in details including error evaluation and lessons learned.},

abstract={Model protection is vital when deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for commercial services, due to the massive costs of training them. In this work, we propose a selective encryption (SE) algorithm to protect CNN models from unauthorized access, with a unique feature of pro-viding hierarchical services to users. Our algorithm firstly selects important model parameters via the proposed Probabilistic Selection Strategy (PSS). It then encrypts the most important parameters with the designed encryption method called Distribution Preserving Random Mask (DPRM), so as to maximize the performance degradation by encrypting only a very small portion of model parameters. We also design a set of access permissions, using which different amount of most important model parameters can be decrypted. Hence, different levels of model performance can be naturally provided for users. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could effectively protect the classification model VGG19 by merely encrypting 8% parameters of convolutional layers. We also implement the proposed model protection scheme in the denoising model DnCNN, showcasing the hierarchical denoising services.},

abstract={The grid denotes the electric grid which consists of communication lines, control stations, transformers, and distributors that aids in supplying power from the electrical plant to the consumers. Presently, the electric grid constitutes humongous power production units which generates millions of megawatts of power distributed across several demographic regions. There is a dire need to efficiently manage this power supplied to the various consumer domains such as industries, smart cities, household and organizations. In this regard, a smart grid with intelligent systems is being deployed to cater the dynamic power requirements. A smart grid system follows the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) model, in which Information Technology (IT) infrastructure is integrated with physical systems. In the scenario of the smart grid embedded with CPS, the Machine Learning (ML) module is the IT aspect and the power dissipation units are the physical entities. In this research, a novel Multidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (MLSTM) technique is being proposed to predict the stability of the smart grid network. The results obtained are evaluated against other popular Deep Learning approaches such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), traditional LSTM and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The experimental results prove that the MLSTM approach outperforms the other ML approaches.},

abstract={Recent interest in machine-learning based methods has produced many sophisticated models for performance modeling and optimization. These models tend to be sensitive to parameters of the underlying architecture and hence yield the highest prediction accuracy when trained on the target platform. Training a classifier, however, is a fairly involved process and requires knowledge of statistics and machine learning that the end users of such models may not possess. This paper presents a new framework for automatically generating machine-learning based performance models. A tool-chain is developed that provides automated mechanisms for sample generation, dynamic feature extraction, feature selection, data labeling, validation and hyper parameter tuning. We describe the design and implementation of this system and demonstrate its efficacy by developing a learning heuristic for register allocation in GPU kernels. Results show that auto-generated models can predict register thresholds that lead to integer factor performance improvements over kernels produced by state-of-the-art optimizing compilers.},

Software Defined Network (SDN) is novel network structure based on the idea of separation of control plane and data plane. SDN allows us to program and monitor networks, and decide how to forward a packet, so it provides a new solution to defend DDoS attack. This paper proposes a multi-SDN Based cooperation scheme to defend DDoS attack. We adopt machine learning to detect DDoS attack, and design a protocol to enable communication among controllers. This protocol can achieve two goals, one is to build and maintain an independent network among controllers of different SDN, and the other is to enable attack information exchange among controllers, so they can find attacker and mitigate DDoS attack. The experimental results show that the proposed protocol can achieve high detection accuracy, find attackers accurately and mitigate DDoS attack traffic effectively with a relatively low cost and latency.},

We envision sensor data abstraction as an interface between sensor data and machine learning applications for highly automated vehicles (HAD). For this purpose, we review the primary sensor modalities, camera, lidar, and radar, published in autonomous-driving related datasets, examine single sensor abstraction and abstraction of sensor setups, and identify critical paths towards an abstraction of sensor data from multiple perception configurations.},

abstract={Public AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) is a promising next-generation computing paradigm that attracts resource-limited mobile users to outsource their machine learning tasks. However, the time delay between cloud/edge servers and end users makes it hard for real-time mobile artificial intelligence applications. In this paper, we propose a real-time mobile facial expression tracking framework combining AIaaS and mobile local auxiliary computing, including facial expression tracking and the corresponding task offloading. Mobile facial expression tracking estimates the facial expression of the current frame with the help of sparse optical flow and neural network. Task offloading utilizes neural network to dynamically estimate the moment of task offloading. According to the experimental results in a real-world environment, the proposed framework successfully fulfills the mobile real-time facial expression tracking requirements with high accuracy. Moreover, compared to its benchmark, it effectively reduces the power consumption of mobile devices and the potential service cost for AIaaS.},

In the scope of the AAL APH-ALARM project, our main aim is to extend communication support for users with speech and language difficulties (mainly aphasics) in the bedroom environment. We propose a system for supporting communication based on gesture recognition using non-invasive compact sensors worn by the user or deployed in the environment (e.g., bed).

Initial results suggest that gesture recognition to enhance communication for people with speech and language impairments is viable, even when in bed.},

abstract={Urban traffic passenger flows prediction has always been a great challenge in transportation field. Efficiently and correctly predicting the future flows of various regions can improve traffic resources scheduling and reduce the possibility of accidents. However, factors which affect the change of traffic passenger flows are complex, including interlaced lines and stations in large areas, diversified traveling demands for people, accidents and bad weathers. So the predicting algorithms or models should be more sensitive to multiply elements and their effecting patterns. Recently, deep learning performs the excellent ability to extract high dimensional spatial-temporal characters in regression and classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a new modeling method for urban traffic passenger flows. Instead of the grid matrices, we quantify the relationship between stations and represent it by a undirected graph. Then we sort the stations by their passenger flows and construct the two-channels graph flows matrices as the input of deep convolutional neural networks. To increase the temporal information of inputs, we also combine the input matrices with recent historical samples. In addition, we add date markers to correct the final prediction flows to further improve the accuracy. Finally we evaluate our model with the real Beijing subway data and compare with other traditional models on short-term passenger flows prediction tasks. Experiments show that our model including multidimensional flows graph matrices and the deep learning model can significantly improve the prediction accuracy.},

The region-of-interest of the road segment is automatically extracted as a one-time operation, and the density is estimated using an ensemble of background subtraction and variants of convolutional neural networks. The architecture is scalable as the processing is entirely decentralized on the edge computing device installed at every intersection. We demonstrate that our technique is resilient to low resolution videos, long fields of view and chaotic traffic conditions with high occlusion.

It is enabling its citizens to be more responsive to change as and when it happens providing a wealth of timely data. The challenge for society in this era of digital transformation, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning is to use its opportunities not only to improve the quality of life but also its purpose. The UAE aims to be a successful smart city by harnessing digital innovation in all its endeavors. The UAE's National Agenda 2021 where four among six of the indicators embrace World Class Healthcare, Safe Public and Fair Judiciary, Cohesive Society and Preserved Identity, Sustainable Environment and Infrastructure. In line with this the research study is carried with an objective to study and gain insights to the approach prevalent in the region by medical practitioners in prescribing and by pharmacies in dispensing medication. Few of the challenges faced by patients and pharmacists when reading doctor's illegible prescriptions and the functioning of the pharmacies for dispensing medication to patients post doctors consultation is a cumbersome time taking practice. The study adapts a survey-based approach bagged by case-based analysis to strengthen its findings. The survey involved patients strictly over the age of twenty and major community pharmacies in the UAE. The prime aspects of the study focus on context control, awareness, security and trust processing perspectives under quality health care. On analysis of the data collated surfaced significant associations noticeable under context control wherein the current increase in wait time at pharmacies by patients, errors made in reading handwritten prescriptions and trusting the process of an online pharmacy. The results of this study indicate that retail pharmacists and patients are willing to switch to an online system of prescribing and buying medical necessities. The analysis of the study suggests a proposed model that will allow doctors to prescribe medication online to patients post consultation referred to as e-prescription that is integrated with an online pharmacy referred to as e-pharmacy that enables dispensing of medication after insurance approvals by the nearest pharmacy at the doorstep of the patient using a location based service in an effort to reduce patient waiting time at pharmacy and also evades prescription reading errors a practice of the past. Thus, propelling the UAE's effort in achieving the national agenda 2021.},

In particular, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have been trendy research subjects for almost a decade now. They offer a wide range of potential applications, including energy efficiency and Intelligent Transportation Systems, two key elements for Smart Cities. All these developments seem to put AI in a favorable position to build Sustainability. However, AI's own ecological impact and carbon footprint is disastrous and drastic changes must be done if this technology is to be used in a sustainable future.

abstract={This paper discusses how usage patterns and preferences of inhabitants can be learned efficiently to allow smart homes to autonomously achieve energy savings.

The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to existing algorithms regarding completeness/correctness of the results, run times as well as memory consumption and elaborates on the shortcomings of the different solutions. We also propose a recommender system based on the developed algorithm. This recommender provides recommendations to the users to reduce their energy consumption. The recommender system was deployed to a set of test homes. The test participants rated the impact of the recommendations on their comfort. We used this feedback to adjust the system parameters and make it more accurate during a second test phase. The historical dataset provided by digitalSTROM contained 33 homes with 3521 devices and over 4 million events. The system produced 160 recommendations on the first phase and 120 on the second phase. The ratio of useful recommendations was close to 10%.},

abstract={Data mashup is a Web technology that combines information from multiple sources into a single Web application. Mashup applications support new services, such as environmental monitoring. The different organizations utilize data mashup services to merge data sets from the different Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) context-based services in order to leverage the performance of their data analytics. However, mashup, different data sets from multiple sources, is a privacy hazard as it might reveal citizens specific behaviors in different regions. In this paper, we present our efforts to build a cognitive-based middleware for private data mashup (CMPM) to serve a centralized environmental monitoring service. The proposed middleware is equipped with concealment mechanisms to preserve the privacy of the merged data sets from multiple IoMT networks involved in the mashup application. In addition, we presented an IoT-enabled data mashup service, where the multimedia data are collected from the various IoMT platforms, and then fed into an environmental deep learning service in order to detect interesting patterns in hazardous areas. The viable features within each region were extracted using a multiresolution wavelet transform, and then fed into a discriminative classifier to extract various patterns. We also provide a scenario for IoMT-enabled data mashup service and experimentation results.},

abstract={Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, which are extremely powerful to deal with massive training data by using tens of millions of parameters. However, CNNs often cost significant memory and computation consumption, which prohibits their usage in resource-limited environments such as mobile or embedded devices. To address the above issues, the existing approaches typically focus on either accelerating the convolutional layers or compressing the fully-connected layers separatedly, without pursuing a joint optimum. In this paper, we overcome such a limitation by introducing a holistic CNN compression framework, termed LRDKT, which works throughout both convolutional and fully-connected layers. First, a low-rank decomposition (LRD) scheme is proposed to remove redundancies across both convolutional kernels and fullyconnected matrices, which has a novel closed-form solver to significantly improve the efficiency of the existing iterative optimization solvers. Second, a novel knowledge transfer (KT) based training scheme is introduced. To recover the accumulated accuracy loss and overcome the vanishing gradient, KT explicitly aligns outputs and intermediate responses from a teacher (original) network to its student (compressed) network. We have comprehensively analyzed and evaluated the compression and speedup ratios of the proposed model on MNIST and ILSVRC 2012 benchmarks. In both benchmarks, the proposed scheme has demonstrated superior performance gains over the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the proposed compression scheme for the task of transfer learning, including domain adaptation and object detection, which show exciting performance gains over the state-of-the-arts. Our source code and compressed models are available at https://github.com/ShaohuiLin/LRDKT.},

abstract={Distributed machine learning (DML) systems equipped with multiple computing nodes have been widely adopted to accelerate large model training in the industry. To maximize resource utilization, a critical problem is how to schedule the communication of DML jobs efficiently. However, previous approaches work well only when a job can use the network resources exclusively. Training multiple jobs in shared cluster without scheduling will bring significant performance degradation since network contention. In this paper, we propose JCS, a job-aware communication scheduler to overcome the above problems. JCS profiles the priority with a novel metric among jobs and schedule communication of jobs according to both computation and communication information. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we perform extensive simulations with DML job traces. The simulation results show that our algorithm can reduce average job completion time by 19%, 39% and 46% over RRSP, SCF and LCoF.},

year={2021},
volume={},

pages={1-12},
abstract={Network representation learning (NRL) has far-reaching effects on data mining research, showing its importance in many real-world applications. NRL, also known as network embedding, aims at preserving graph structures in a low-dimensional space. These learned representations can be used for subsequent machine learning tasks, such as vertex classification, link prediction, and data visualization. Recently, graph convolutional network (GCN)-based models, e.g., GraphSAGE, have drawn a lot of attention for their success in inductive NRL. When conducting unsupervised learning on large-scale graphs, some of these models employ negative sampling (NS) for optimization, which encourages a target vertex to be close to its neighbors while being far from its negative samples. However, NS draws negative vertices through a random pattern or based on the degrees of vertices. Thus, the generated samples could be either highly relevant or completely unrelated to the target vertex. Moreover, as the training goes, the gradient of NS objective calculated with the inner product of the unrelated negative samples and the target vertex may become zero, which will lead to learning inferior representations. To address these problems, we propose an adversarial training method tailored for unsupervised inductive NRL on large networks. For efficiently keeping track of high-quality negative samples, we design a caching scheme with sampling and updating strategies that has a wide exploration of vertex proximity while considering training costs. Besides, the proposed method is adaptive to various existing GCN-based models without significantly complicating their optimization process. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.},

abstract={The current work intends to study the performance of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory(HTM) theory for automated classification of text as well as documents. HTM is a biologically inspired theory based on the working principles of the human neocortex. The current study intends to provide an alternative framework for document categorization using the Spatial Pooler learning algorithm in the HTM Theory. As HTM accepts only a stream of binary data as input, Latent Semantic Indexing(LSI) technique is used for extracting the top features from the input and converting them into binary format. The Spatial Pooler algorithm converts the binary input into sparse patterns with similar input text having overlapping spatial patterns making it easy for classifying the patterns into categories. The results obtained prove that HTM theory, although is in its nascent stages, performs at par with most of the popular machine learning based classifiers.},

abstract={OpenMP allows developers to harness the power of shared memory multiprocessing in C and C++ applications, but the performance gained with OpenMP is highly sensitive to the underlying hardware, making performance portability across different hardware architectures fragile. For example, in mapping a parallel for loop to hardware, OpenMP 4 offers commands for exploiting vector instructions (simd directives) and automatic GPU offloading (target directives), as well as schedule directives for CPU load balancing. These benefits come with a cost. A developer has to be well aware of the architecture details, and the application, and must iteratively tune to determine the best combination of pragma directives delivering higher performance for the given target architecture. Hence in this paper we introduce Rigel, a framework that automates these decisions to arrive at optimized OpenMP annotated code. Given a code segment with inherent parallelism, our framework uses separate machine learning classification models to predict the anticipated benefit of each optimization. Both Vector Classification and GPU Offloading Classification models perform with average accuracies of 83%. Succeeding the classification process, code segments are optimized accordingly. Our results show that GPU offloading optimization lead to an average speedup of 8x over default non-optimized CPU parallel execution (pragma omp parallel for) and average Vector optimization speedup is 6x compared to LLVM Clang 4.0 auto-vectorization. Furthermore Scheduling mechanism selection process results in overall accuracy of 90%.},

While the correlation between the player's skill and in-game data has already been covered in many papers, there are very few works related to analysis of eSports athlete's skill through his/her physical behavior. We propose the smart chair platform which is to collect data on the person's behavior on the chair using an integrated accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer. We extract the important game events to define the players' physical reactions to them. The obtained data are used for training machine learning models in order to distinguish between the low-skilled and high-skilled players.

abstract={With the Internet and mobile communications becoming an indispensable part of people's daily lives, online transactions have become one of the most common payment methods. However, transaction fraud incidents also occur frequently, causing a larger number of economic losses. Therefore, transaction fraud detection is significant. The methods of machine learning are often used to detect fraudulent transactions from a larger amount of transaction data. However, the class imbalance problem reduces the performance of these methods. There are mainly four factors causing this problem: imbalanced class distribution, sample size, class separability and within-class concept. The existing improvement strategies for class imbalance mainly focus on the first factor but omit other three ones. This paper considers the four factors to propose a comprehensive model called clustering tree. Constructing a clustering tree includes two steps: 1) we first select a clustering algorithm considering the class separability; and then 2) we use this clustering algorithm to construct a tree that can be used to determine if an incoming transaction is illegal. The root node of this tree contains all samples, and we consider both the imbalanced class distribution and the within-class concept when samples are hierarchically divided into sub-nodes during the constructing process. We compare the proposed method with five state-of-the-art ones on two real transaction datasets, and the experimental results show that our method works better.},

abstract={A critical concern for IoT (Internet of Things) networks is how to operate a large number of sensors in an energy-efficient manner. Energy consumption caused by operating these sensors cannot be overlooked, especially for long-term IoT network operation. Inactivating some of the unneeded sensors during the operation is one of the feasible solutions. Recent studies have mainly focused on selecting the unneeded sensors in a duty-cycled manner based on the sensor's geographic location or the sensor's communication status. These studies involve obtaining some of the user's private information, moreover, anomaly detection performance, a significant criterion regarding IoT network operation performance has not been considered. In this paper, we develop a novel activation/inactivation strategy for long-term IoT network operation. In this strategy, a machine learning model is adopted to adaptively select the unneeded sensors to be inactivated during network operation. Moreover, to maintain high sensor data processing performance during long-term operation, by only using the basic sensor data (e.g., temperature and humidity), our proposal selects the unneeded sensor candidates which are periodically updated. Numerical experiments conducted in two IoT network environments over seven-month operation verify the effectiveness of our proposal.},

In this paper, we reveal the relationship between user behavior and encrypted video surveillance traffic. We show that different user behaviors have different traffic patterns. We propose some new features for encrypted video surveillance traffic, and we can infer the basic life behavior of users from these features. We exploit eight basic activities of daily living: watching TV, reading books, styling hair, open or close door, sweeping the ground, dressing, drinking and moving, which can cover the basic behavior of human beings. First, we show how attackers carry out an attack. We demonstrate it is easy for attackers to steal users' privacy by encrypted video surveillance traffic. Then, we extract the features of network traffic rate distribution and network traffic rate changes in the time domain and the frequency domain. Finally, we explore the validity of the features. And we utilize six typical machine learning algorithms to score these features. The experiment shows that we can identify the user's behavior with 94% accuracy.},

abstract={Accurate traffic forecasting is important to enable intelligent transportation systems in a smart city. This problem is challenging due to the complicated spatial, short-term temporal and long-term periodical dependencies. Existing approaches have considered these factors in modeling. Most solutions apply CNN, or its extension Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) to model the spatial correlation. However, the convolution operator may not adequately model the non-Euclidean pair-wise correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-based Periodic-Temporal neural Network (APTN), an end-to-end solution for traffic foresting that captures spatial, short-term, and long-term periodical dependencies. APTN first uses an encoder attention mechanism to model both the spatial and periodical dependencies. Our model can capture these dependencies more easily because every node attends to all other nodes in the network, which brings regularization effect to the model and avoids overfitting between nodes. Then, a temporal attention is applied to select relevant encoder hidden states across all time steps. We evaluate our proposed model using real world traffic datasets and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract={Electroencephalography (EEG) classification is an essential component of Brain Computer Interface (BCI), which allows to communicate from the human mind to computer, and thus to communicate even for subjects with physical disabilities. There are various classes of classification methods related to EEG-BCI. Researchers have classified these types into four fundamental categories. The first is an adaptive classification approaches. The second is based on using matrices and tensor class of classification. The third is about the use of transfer learning, and final the fourth is about the use deep learning mechanisms. Given this background, this research framework provides a concise survey of adaptive classification methods employed for EEG based Brain Computer Interface. As indicated to, the adaptive classifiers, are dynamic classifiers where there parameters are incrementally re-evaluated and updated over time as new EEG data become available. In addition, the research frame has picked to establish an overall review to this specific category of classifier since, adaptive type of classifiers, have indicated to be superior to other static types of classifiers, as in reference to limited supervision or unsupervised adaptation, Lotte et. al.

abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been a promising technique to reduce the total system latency by allowing computations at distributed edge servers instead of centralized cloud servers. With the increasing computation capability of mobile devices, a device is also able to help other devices complete computing tasks. In this paper, we consider a dispersive task offloading scenario, where a device can arbitrarily divide one task into multiple subtasks to the MEC server or other devices. To facilitate the collaboration between multiple devices and the edge server for minimizing the total system latency, we formulate a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve this problem, we propose a comprehensive task scheduling (CTS) algorithm, where the limited resource of the edge server is allocated on demand of actual sizes of a task rather than on blocks. The CTS algorithm can effectively solve the above subtask offloading problem based on the matching theory. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that CTS can achieve the lowest latency as compared to the other baseline schemes under different network loads.},

abstract={Smart city construction is closely related to building energy consumption data analysis, and energy consumption prediction is helpful to guide urban power dispatching strategy. In general, the artificial neural network models used for energy consumption prediction are often based on the optimization of a single network, which has some shortcomings such as poor generalization ability and unstable fitting accuracy. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of BP neural network in building air conditioning energy consumption prediction, a per-column optimization prediction model is constructed in this paper. In order to avoid falling into the local minimum, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm are introduced to optimize the weight and threshold of the basic BP neural network to avoid the randomness of the parameters. Then, in order to improve the reliability and prediction accuracy of the model, the optimal prediction value is identified on the basis of the BP model prediction value based on the optimization algorithm. In addition, this paper makes an experimental study on the real air-conditioning energy consumption of a building in Laixi City, and the experimental results show the superiority of the model. The prediction accuracy is improved by about 79%, and the reliability of the algorithm is also improved. In the long run, the model can provide advance prediction for urban power dispatching and contribute to the construction of smart cities.},

Then, we design a federated knowledge distillation method to achieve high-quality small models with limited labeled data. Adaptive quantized federated learning can significantly speed up model training while retaining model accuracy. With a small fraction of data as labeled data, our federated knowledge distillation can reach a fixed accuracy achieved by supervised learning with the entire labeled data set.},

Minor shifts in peak demand have major implications in terms of savings for both consumers and utilities.

The framework incorporates smart meter technology, remote sensing and monitoring, Bluetooth technology, big data analytics, cloud computing technology, optimization algorithm, web-based information technology, and electricity pricing policies. Initial experiment was performed to verify potential benefits of the proposed framework. Particularly, a smart grid infrastructure and sensors were installed in a building to retrieve data.

Neural networks (NN)s are developed to learn and predict the building's comfort specifications, environmental conditions, and power consumption. Based on the predicted data, MPC provides optimal control inputs for the thermal and lighting systems to achieve the desired performance. In contrast to the existing building control frameworks, our proposed learning-based control method incorporates the occupant-related parameters in the control loop, which enhances the prediction accuracy and control performance. Our proposed learning-based MPC approach is implemented on a building, simulated in EnergyPlus software, and its performance is compared with that of a model-based building control framework. From the simulation results, our control method performs significantly better than the conventional MPC in maintaining residents' comfort and reducing energy consumption.},

abstract={Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a rather broad research area. While there exist solutions based on sensors and vision-based technologies, these solutions suffer from considerable limitations. Thus in-order to mitigate or avoid these limitations, device free solutions based on radio signals like home WiFi are considered. Recently, channel state information (CSI), available in WiFi networks have been proposed for fine-grained analysis. We are able to detect the human activities like Walk, Stand, Sit, Run, etc. in a Line of Sight scenario (LOS) and a Non Line of Sight (N-LOS) scenario within an indoor environment. We propose two algorithms - one using a support vector machine (SVM) for classification and another one using a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. While the former uses sophisticated pre-processing and feature extraction techniques the latter processes the raw data directly (after denoising with wavelets). We show that it is possible to characterize activities and / or human body presence with high accuracy and we compare both approaches with regards to accuracy and performance.},

abstract={Summary form only given. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Crisis informatics has emerged in recent years as an interdisciplinary field which leverages numerous cyberinfrastructure resources to gather data around unforeseen events, particularly preparation, mitigation, response, and recovery phases of disasters. This interdisciplinary field combines numerous facets of computing and social science knowledge discovery. However, it has never been applied to a modern smart city after a major disaster such as hurricane Harvey and Irma. Hurricane Harvey and Irma, offers a unique opportunity to leveraging existing diverse cyberinfrastructure devices as crisis informatics engines to enhance recovery efforts within the city, while providing a national and international framework for such activities in the future. Houston, and Miami are considered two of America's leading smart cities, particularly in terms of the wireless sensors spread throughout the city, with sensors measuring air quality, core infrastructure edifices, such as roads and bridges, as well as many wireless camera systems. Many of these cyberinfrastructure resources were not impacted by the hurricane, which means these assets are fertile repositories for situational data within the context of locating individuals, missing animals, assessing damage, and most importantly providing valuable analysis of the city's infrastructure. Traditionally, in such situations the emergency management community has utilized these tools in limited fashion, and only in an ad-hoc manner, while relying heavily on surveys, first-hand inspections of physical infrastructure. In this paper, we describe a framework which utilizing plan recognition, which treats vast volumes of data aggregated form of smartphone messages, time-series social media, and IoT device data into a comprehensive crisis informatics partial-order plans. In this paper, we describe a framework which utilizing plan recognition, which treats vast volumes of data aggregated form of smartphone messages, time-series social media, and IoT device data into a comprehensive crisis informatics partial-order plans. These partial-order plans are discrete events or actions which can be organized into a plan, without imposing a specific order. In fact, partial-order plans are considered as representative of multiple plan-instances, obtained imposing a specific order in the execution of the actions. Utilizing, machine learning algorithms to automatically recognition of several (partially or fully achieved), can develop data-driven crisis mapping for resource allocation, and spatial clustering that indicate geographical areas for search and rescue operations, which exhibited abnormally high activities during the disaster.},

abstract={Air pollution prediction for smart city applications has been attracted in artificial intelligence research to overcome problems to the health of citizen. Conventionally, environmental IoT data is gathered from monitoring station sensors then is sent to servers for centralized predictive model training at a whole region. That causes latency issues in data transmission from IoT devices to cloud servers. This paper describes federated learning paradigm approach for air pollution prediction model training on environmental monitoring sensor data. In the research, we design distributed learning framework that assists cooperative training among participants from different spatial areas such as cities and prefectures. At each area, Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN) are trained locally aiming to predict local Oxidant warning level while aggregated global model enhances distilled knowledge from all areas of a region. The research illustrates that designed common parts of CRNN can be fused globally meanwhile adaptive structure at predictive part of the deep neural network model can capture different environmental monitoring stations configuration at local areas. Some experiment results also hint methods to keep balance between federated learning synchronous training rounds and local deep neural network training epochs to maximize accuracy of the whole federated learning system. The results also prove that new participating areas can train and quickly obtain optimized local models by using transferred common global model.},

abstract={Obtaining a high-quality OCR output in smart cities, with human-in-the-loop, is an interesting problem for surveillance and other similar applications. Achieving high accuracy while reading license plates in the real world videos is cumbersome due to complexities like multiple vehicles, high-density traffic in spatial and temporal domains, varying camera angles and illumination, occlusions and multiple resolutions. We present a modular framework for OCR corrections in the chaotic Indian traffic videos that especially involve complex license plate patterns. Such patterns are obtained from a state-of-the-art deep learning model trained on video frames. Since such a model reads the text from videos (instead of images), we incorporate multi-frame consensus for generating suggestions in our framework. To ease the correction process, our human-interactive framework first breaks down the multi-vehicle videos into multiple clips, each containing a single vehicle from the video using an object detector and a tracker. Our framework then provides suggestions for an individual vehicle using multi-frame consensus. Our framework then selectively presents these extracted clips to the user to verify/correct the predictions with minimal human efforts via interactive suggestions. Such high-quality output can be used to continuously update a large database for surveillance and can be further used to improve the accuracy of deep models in the complex real-world scenarios.},

abstract={Many studies deal with the problem of ensuring safety and increasing the capacity of signal-controlled junctions of the road network (RN). The use of innovative developments in the field of computer vision to model intelligent transport systems (ITS) has been a steady trend in the framework of the development of smart cities. One of the less-studied issues is the optimal respecting the interests of drivers and pedestrians within pedestrian crossings when turning right. In our work, we focused on the problem of ensuring the minimum time of waiting and crossing signal-controlled intersections by pedestrians. We proposed to solve this problem based on adaptive traffic light control through the use of computer vision. To solve the problem, we trained two configurations of YOLOv3 neural networks based on the Darknet framework with additional modifications. The SORT tracker was used to track objects. In the zones adjacent to pedestrian crossings, we used a neural network to search for pedestrians intending to cross a section of the carriageway, which conflicts with turning vehicles. Based on the data on the presence of pedestrians and the information on the composition of the vehicle queue, we calculated the optimal time-sharing of the permissive traffic light interval.},

abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are one of the leading classification algorithms and have achieved big milestones such as GoogleNet and AlphaGo. Training of neural network is a time-consuming affair and is proportional to the depth of network and number of computations carried out in each layer. If the network is deep, the time taken is considerably high as it works sequentially on batches of dataset using Sequential Back-propagation (BP) Algorithm. This paper presents an acceleration technique DAPP Accelerating Training of DNN using Ping-Pong approach to reduce the training time using distributed local memory. DAPP exploits model parallelism without compromising the accuracy of the model. The proposed pipeline design concurrently works on consecutive set of batches to compute gradients at various layers, while eliminating the need for global memory. Simulation of DAPP is done on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using System-C. Additionally, this technique has been adapted for multi-core architectures. This generic methodology has been implemented for CNN, Vanilla RNN and LSTM networks. This design reduces training time by 40% for a 3 layer CNN, 92% for a 10 layer CNN, 38% for Vanilla RNN, and 40% for LSTM while maintaining the accuracy in all above networks.},

abstract={According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality in female premature death. Over the last decade, the increasing world-wide demand for early detection of breast cancer has resulted in necessity of new research avenues. The current work on the early detection of breast cancer, which mainly focus on the respective (independent) analysis of clinical document and medical images, ignoring the internal relevance internal interactions (relations) of images and reports, and has been proved to be somewhat effective in the experiment but not practical in the real world. In this paper, we propose fusion convolutional neural networks (f-CNNs) to extract and mine the semantic interactions of radiology images and reports. Our f-CNNs provides an end-to-end framework with convolutional architectures to exploit image representation, text composition, and the matching relations between the two modalities. More specifically, it consists of one image CNN encoding the image content and one matching CNN modeling the joint representation of image and sentence. The matching CNN composes different semantic fragments from words based on character-level representation and learns the inter-modal relations between image and the composed fragments at different levels, thus fully exploit the relations between image and sentence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed f-CNNs can effectively capture the information necessary for image and sentence matching. More specifically, our proposed f-CNNs significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches for disease classification on the datasets.},

abstract={The application of information and communications technology to support urban operational decision makers has received vast interest from industry and academia. This has helped to mature several fields of research within the smart city domain, such as the internet of things, cybernetics, and informatics. However, these fields of research remain siloed, which leads to a clear gap in the literature. The paper recognizes the mentioned gap manifesting in a new smart urban area in Wales, UK, and presents a platform which intends to demonstrate the benefits of exploiting the synergies between these fields of research. Following consultation with various stakeholders at the pilot site, the platform utilizes advanced sensing, analytics, interoperability, and visualization components to provide valuable human-machine interactions to facility managers in the district. Delivering this high value knowledge in a timely, engaging, and accessible manner through advanced decision support interfaces. The paper presents the platform's software architecture, before discussing the decision support interface, intelligent web services, and interoperability components in more detail. The solution's key contributions beyond existing internet of things platforms are the use of a 3D game engine, machine learning and optimization web services, and the integration across the knowledge value chain. This knowledge integration is achieved through semantic modelling of the buildings, urban environment, socio-technical systems, and smart devices in the district.},

abstract={Social urban sensing is a new paradigm which exploits human-carried or vehicle-mounted sensors to ubiquitously collect data for large-scale urban sensing. A challenge of such scenario is how to transmit sensed data in situations where the networking infrastructure is intermittent or unavailable.

It applies Situation awareness, Fuzzy logic and Machine Learning approaches to perform routing and decision-making process.

With Chameleon, we accelerate the runtime by 11 times and we show that general CNN techniques would improve the stylization process.

abstract={Quantitative analysis of brain volume is quite significant for the diagnosis of brain diseases. Accurate segmentation of essential brain tissues from 3D medical images is fundamental to quantitative brain analysis. Since manual segmentation is extremely tedious and time-consuming, there is a growing demand for automated segmentation. In this paper, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network including recursive residual blocks and a pyramid pooling module (RP-Net) for segmenting brain from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). RP-Net is an U-Net like the network that consists of a downsampling path and an upsampling path. Each path consists of four stages with a recursive residual block. All layers in RP-Net are implemented in a 3D manner. The pyramid pooling module is applied before a voxel-wise classification layer for obtaining both local and global context information. The RP-Net has been evaluated on WM, GM, and CSF segmentation with CANDI, IBSR18, and IBSR20 dataset. The experiments show that the RP-Net achieved mean dice similarity coefficients of 90.7% on CANDI, 90.49% on IBSR18 and 84.96% on IBSR20. The results demonstrate that our proposed method has achieved a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy compared to other reported approaches.},

abstract={Spectrum scarcity has surfaced as a prominent concern in wireless radio communications with the emergence of new technologies over the past few years. As a result, there is a growing need for better understanding of the spectrum occupancy with newly emerging access technologies supporting the Internet of Things. In this article, we present a framework to capture and model the traffic behavior of short-time spectrum occupancy for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications in the shared bands to determine the existing interference. The proposed capturing method utilizes a software-defined radio to monitor the short bursts of IoT transmissions by capturing the time-series data which is converted to power spectral density to extract the observed occupancy. Furthermore, we propose the use of an unsupervised machine learning technique to enhance conventionally implemented energy detection methods. Our experimental results show that the temporal and frequency behavior of the spectrum can be well captured using the combination of two models, namely, semi-Markov chains and a Poisson-distribution arrival rate. We conduct an extensive measurement campaign in different urban environments and incorporate the spatial effect on the IoT shared spectrum.},

abstract={The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart environments such as smart cities or smart home facilitate communication between various objects. Nevertheless, this technological advancement comes with security challenges of IoT devices. Thus, current attacks targeting IoT networks have become motivating factors in implementing security mechanisms. Such attacks come in the form of intrusion or anomalies. Anomaly detection mechanisms have been implemented to prevent confidential resources from malevolent users. Therefore, this paper presents a new anomaly-based approach for IoT networks which is implemented with a hybrid feature selection engine that only selects most relevant features; and the Random Forest algorithm which classifies each traffic as normal or anomalous. The performance was evaluated using IoTID20, one of the latest anomaly detection datasets collected in the IoT Environment. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves relatively high accuracy while detecting DoS (99.95%), MITM (99.97%), Scanning (99.96%) attacks.},

year={2021},
volume={},

pages={115-122},
abstract={Feature selection is vital to outlier detection for network traffic data containing many noise features. Existing methods often perform on pure categorical or numerical data, which cannot directly work on network traffic data containing categorical and numerical features. Meanwhile, these methods do not utilize domain knowledge summarized based on characteristics of existing outliers, leading to unsatisfying performance. This paper proposes a novel outlier detection method based on feature selection in network traffic data, termed ODNTD, which adopts domain knowledge in feature selection. ODNTD includes a three-stage process of decomposition-aggregation-decomposition. In decomposition, categorical and numerical data are separately outlier scored using value frequency and deep autoencoder. In aggregation, the two scores are merged by a dynamic aggregation strategy, and a set of outlier candidates is identified by a thresholding function. The re-decomposition performs coarse-grained and fine-grained selection in respective feature spaces of outlier candidates by machine learning with domain knowledge to obtain feature subsets. ODNTD repeats the stages until an empirical error no longer decreases. Summarily, ODNTD iteratively exchanges information between categorical and numerical data and implants domain knowledge into selection. Experiments show ODNTD averagely improves AUC than nine state-of-the-art competitors by 46.18% and reduces features by 52% on five real network traffic datasets.},

abstract={Business processes in the complex real-world environment are heterogeneous and challenging to monitor for any possible discrepancies. Businesses substantially rely on the efficiency of these processes to maintain the quality of services for their customers and wish to ensure that an executing business process is progressing in the desired manner. Although process mining techniques provide adequate information about the process execution, it is vital to maintain the quality of business processes through an automated process prediction system that analyses and provides constructive feedback for process improvement. Techniques in the literature can predict the future outcome of a business process, but they lack empirical information about the behaviour of an executing process instance as compared to the optimum process model. In this paper, we have proposed an online process prediction framework using features generated through process mining techniques. We used a heuristic miner algorithm to discover the process model and performed conformance analysis to generate features presenting the contextual behaviour of the process instance. We selected highly contributing features to predict the outcome of the real-world business process using several machine learning algorithms. Our experimental results showed high accuracy, recall, and F-measure. We compared our technique with a similar technique from literature and showed that our solution is more reliable in process outcome prediction.},

abstract={With the continuous development of biomedical, the scale of data has also continued to increase, which makes it difficult for researchers to extract information manually. In order to satisfy the researcher's information requirement, information retrieval techniques for the biomedical field have been resolved. Learning to rank is the field of machine learning and information retrieval combination, it has been shown to improve the retrieval efficiency to a large extent. This paper proposes a query optimization technology based on learning to rank. By using learning to rank for technical research on optimizing, a model combining query improvement and query expansion is proposed. Based on the improvement of the query, our method uses LTR to reorder the query expansion words, so that the original query can retrieve the document with higher accuracy. Only by biological field resources, the query expansion can obtain extended words, but it can not accurately describe the degree of relevance between extended words and query words. Introduce LTR methods can fully consider the relevance of extended words and original queries. Improve the inaccurate problem of single-extension. The experimental results show that compared with traditional algorithms, this algorithm improves retrieval efficiency by 3.31% on average.},

abstract={Advanced wireless communication network testbeds are now widely being deployed around European and cross-continental. This represents an interesting opportunity for vertical industry and academia to perform experimentation and validation before a real deployment.

On top of this platform, we designed and deployed a smart city safety system as a vertical use case, exploring 5G capabilities through a combination of NFV and machine learning to provide end-to-end communication and low latency smart city service. This safety system helps detecting criminals along the city and sending a notification to the security center. A Virtual Network Function (VNF) has been developed to enable video transcoding, face detection and recognition at the cloud or the edge of the network. The validation of the overall system is performed through the deployment of the use case indoor (Smart Internet Lab) and outdoor (Millennium Square Bristol). We show the VNF specification and present a quantitative analysis in terms of bandwidth, response time, processing time and transmission speed in terms of Quality of Experience (QoE).},

In this paper, we propose a clustering method to analyze textual data employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithms k-means and hierarchical clustering. We assess different vector representation methods for text, similarity metrics, and the number of clusters that best matches the data. We evaluate the methods using a real database of a public record service of security occurrences.

abstract={The reliability of existing Cyber-Physical Systems(CPSs) developed on the basis of deep neural networks is not guaranteed, because deep models have been proved vulnerable to adversarial attacks with imperceptible perturbations. Considering that deep 3D models have potential applications to a wide variety of CPSs with safety-critical requirements, such as autonomous driving systems, we explore the robustness of deep 3D object detection models under adversarial point cloud perturbations in this paper. A novel method to generate 3D adversarial examples is developed from point cloud perturbations, which are common in practice due to the inherent characteristics of the LiDAR data produced by the 3D sensors. The method has the ability to successfully attack deep 3D models in most cases, and thereby gives rise to a great real-world concern about object detection models due to their vulnerability to physical-world attacks in the form of point cloud perturbations. We conduct a thorough robustness evaluation of popular deep 3D object detectors in an adversarial setting on the KITTI dataset. Experimental results show that current deep 3D object detection models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, and their performances are decreased to a large extent in the presence of adversarial point clouds generated by the proposed method.},

pages={2759-2766},
abstract={Training deep neural networks has large memory requirements to store the activation maps for the forward pass of all layers to be able to compute the gradients during the backward pass. When training networks on the edge, large models may either not fit in the memory or may run with very small batch sizes. Checkpointing has been proposed as a solution, whereby during the forward pass the activation maps from only some of the layers are stored as checkpoints, and the rest are recomputed during the backward pass starting from the closest checkpoint. However, checkpointing in practice requires a careful choice of the set of layers to checkpoint. In this paper we empirically evaluate checkpointing for different networks. We then establish an analytical approach to estimate the memory requirement of each layer (using a linear regression model) in a network and thereby identify the layers which have to be checkpointed. Through this method we were able to reduce memory consumption of MobileNet and ResNet-18 architectures by a factor of 2.6 and 1.8 respectively. Finally, the networks are tested on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B board. For MobileNet using our approach for checkpointing, we could increase the batch-size from 4 to 12.},

The main tool exploits the concept of proximity marketing and covers the essential experience through the airport onto the flight, but also allows travelers to spend their waiting time by discovering the facilities of the airport, supported by a recommendation system using machine learning. The system provides also the airport planners an aggregated and anonymized view, like heat maps, of travelers behavior that highlight bottlenecks in the infrastructure, or highlight situations that require intervention, such as emergencies.

abstract={In Human Activity Recognition (HAR), supervised Machine Learning methods are predominantly used, making availability of datasets a major issue for research in the field. In particular, the majority of available datasets are collected under controlled conditions. Consequently, models trained under similar circumstances, generally exhibit a significant decrease in recognition accuracy when they are moved to final deployment in the wild, within unconstrained settings. This paper presents a new dataset for HAR, collected in free-living and unconstrained conditions. 10 subjects were recruited for the purpose of data collection. Data was recorded over a 6 week period using a smartphone app, and a wristband activity monitor. During the first and last week of observation, participants also wore an ActivPAL" activity logger. The data collected have been partially self-labeled by participants, by means of the mobile app provided for data collection. The dataset collected can be used to evaluate HAR algorithm and models in real-world unconstrained settings. Together with the description of the dataset, this work presents some preliminary results, obtained cross-validating a model trained on the publicly available Extrasensory dataset, and testing its performance on our newly collected dataset. Results obtained highlighted high cross-subject variability when testing on new subjects, with a balanced accuracy varying between 53.33% and 90.01%, with an average balanced accuracy of 71.73%.},

abstract={Energy-aware datacenter operation is gaining attention in the recent years, having witnessed the increased deployments and usage of cloud datacenters resulting in significant amount of carbon footprints to directly affect environmental sustainability. Since providers tend to record user behaviors and cloud jobs profiles, analyzing cloud trace logs can provide insightful inferences to move towards datacenter sustainability. This paper investigates the trace logs of real datacenter workload arrival trend in order to characterize the resource request trend of users. Furthermore, anticipated resource request trends in terms of the requested level of CPU and memory resources are forecasted. A novel prediction model, named LSTMtsw, is proposed based on recurrent neural networks of deep learning, which exploits historical data in combination with the current job arrival trend to predict the future resource request trend of users. By the way of constructing sliding windows of historical data, the proposed model effectively reduces the number of iterations involved in the prediction process, and predicts the future trend with reduced error percentage. In addition, the proposed LSTMtsw model integrates an effective mechanism for controlling the prediction effect to achieve energy conservation without degrading the service quality. Experiments conducted on 600 hours of cloud trace logs demonstrate the efficiencies of the proposed model in outperforming the existing BPNN and LSTM models in terms of the achieved prediction accuracy whilst predicting the future resource demands of users.},

These technologies are widely used to creates a system for automation of different tasks. In this technology driven society there is a need of creation of a system to automate the process of irrigation of crops to help farmers. The currently used system includes a lot of human efforts, money and time which will not be required after the development of an automated irrigation system. In this there is a need of creating a system which can collect data then analyze that date and generate results in real time. also, the overall cost should be low enough so that a farmer can afford it. In this paper we are focusing on creating a low-cost smart device which can be used to collect the data of moisture in soil at different places, pH and temperature of soil. We focus of creating a device with Arduino along with some sensors and modules to collect these data at different places in farm. After collecting this data this device will send this data to server with the help of a Wi-Fi module attached to the device. At the same time, we are using an Artificial Neural Network model for the analysis of this data for generating high accuracy results. Finally based on the results the device triggers a valve to automatically start and stop the flow of water in the farm.},

abstract={Smart City deployments typically have thousands to even hundreds of thousands of Surveillance cameras. Rapid advancements in computer vision techniques due to Deep Neural Networks enable using these camera feeds for performing non-trivial analytics. Tracking a moving object of interest using a large network of cameras, also known as object reidentification, is one such analytic that empowers city administration with capabilities such as finding missing people or prioritizing emergency vehicles. We have built Anveshak, a framework for distributed wide-area tracking. Anveshak fills in the shortcomings of existing Big Data and Deep Learning frameworks by - exposing an intuitive and composable programming model; automating application deployment and orchestration across edge, fog and cloud resources and providing knobs to the user for managing the application performance. The knobs lend the application the ability to scale potentially to thousands of cameras. In this proposal we have designed two representative applications; missing person tracking and priority signalling for emergency vehicles.

abstract={The recent technological advancements are focusing on developing the smart systems to facilitate the subscribers and to improve their lifestyle. The machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence are becoming the elementary tools, which are used i n the establishment of smart cities and smart buildings across the globe. In this context, automatic speech recognition based system is devised. It can be effectively integrated in smart spaces like buildings, offices, homes, etc. The system digitally processes the acquired speech command and extracts its Perceptual Linear Predictive Coding Coefficients (PLPCC). IN next step a comparison of the extracted parameters is made with the templates in order to recognize the incoming command. The command recognition is achieved with a specifically developed voting based classifier. The classification algorithm is described. A method to characterize the developed classifier is also discussed. On the detection of a command the embedded controller is piloted by a specific flag. The front-end controller decodes this flag and performs a desired action by piloting a specific actuator. A system prototype is realized. Preliminary, its application is demonstrated as a speech driven curtain controller. The front end controller is implemented with an Arduino board and motors are employed as curtain drivers. The prototype functionality is successfully tested and results are presented.},

abstract={Application of social networks data mining in strengthening college ideological environment is studied in this manuscript. In the actual application of machine learning, the number of features is often large, and there may be irrelevant features, and there may also be interdependence between the features. However, a large amount of the above classification work is based on a single-dimensional complex network, with this basis, this paper defines the novel mining algorithm. The model is applied into the scenarios and the experimental results are also tested.},

abstract={With the explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and various emerging network technologies, IoT-enabled smart cities are further refined into health smart cities. For example, IoT devices can automatically recognize emotional states through collected facial expressions, which can further serve mental health assessment, human–computer interaction, etc. On the other hand, existing facial expression recognition algorithms emphasize the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), and it is difficult for resource-constrained IoT devices to provide sufficient computing resources to optimize parameters for DNN-based structures. To solve the challenge of resource constraints, we propose the hierarchical emotion recognition system enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). Specifically, MEC nodes provide IoT devices with short-delay and high-performance computing services, satisfying the requirements of training DNN-based algorithms. Moreover, our proposed emotion recognition system leverages a pretrained feature extraction module on the remote cloud to accelerate optimization and provides a localization module for specific tasks of IoT devices. In addition to evaluating the accuracy and efficiency, we also clarify that the DNN-based emotion recognition system exposes obvious vulnerability to perturbation. Due to the uncertainty of the environment, it is common for facial expressions collected by IoT devices to be accompanied by perturbation. To address this issue, we propose the proactive perturbation-aware defense mechanism. It has been demonstrated that the newly proposed defense mechanism can maintain state-of-the-art performance on the publicly available LIRIS-CSE dataset while defending against known and unknown perturbation. This can promote the deployment of our proposed MEC-enabled hierarchical emotion recognition system and defense mechanism in real-world scenarios.},

Transportation systems are using various technologies to allow users to adapt and make different decisions towards transportation modes. Modification and improvement of these systems affect the commuters' perspective and social welfare. In this study, the effect of road flow equilibrium on commuters' utilities with different types of transportation modes will be discussed. A simple network with two modes of transportation will be illustrated and three different cost policies were considered to test the efficiency of reinforcement learning in commuters' daily trip decision-making regarding time and mode.

pages={596-601},
abstract={Through accurate power load prediction, the smart grid can provide more efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly power services than the traditional power grid. In recent years, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have received more and more attention in power load prediction because traditional machine learning models cannot capture the time dependencies that often exist in power load data. However, due to the self-connection of the hidden layer, the vanishing gradient problem is very easy to occur with the increasing depth of the simple RNN, which leads to the decline of the prediction accuracy. In order to solve this problem, this paper adopts the recently developed RNN architecture called Clock-Work RNN (CW-RNN) on the task of one day ahead prediction. The research focuses on the construction strategy of recurrent connection matrix related to the hidden layer in CW-RNN. An improved CW-RNN named CW-RNN-SCR adopts the strategy of connecting adjacent modules into a simply closed ring, which not only improves the prediction accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters required for training. Experimental results show that the improved CW-RNN can achieve better performance than the traditional RNN architectures.},

abstract={A new scalable parallel math library, dMath, is presented that demonstrates leading scaling when using intranode, internode, and hybrid-parallelism for deep learning (DL). dMath provides easy-to-use distributed primitives and a variety of domain-specific algorithms. These include matrix multiplication, convolutions, and others allowing for rapid development of scalable applications, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), whereas previously one was restricted to libraries that provided effective primitives for only a single GPU, like Nvidia's cuBLAS and cuDNN or DNN primitives from Nervana's neon framework. dMath enables a wide range of developers to utilize parallel and distributed hardware easily. Data is stored persistently on the GPU hardware, avoiding costly transfers between host and device. Advanced memory management techniques are utilized, including caching of transferred data and memory reuse through pooling. dMath delivers performance, portability, and productivity to its specific domain of support. dMath's caching approach addresses one of the key drawbacks of GPUs, which is to keep data sets cached and to avoid overheads of the CPU-GPU memory interface wherever possible.},
