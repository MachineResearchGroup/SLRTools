abstract = {Natural language processing technologies, such as topic models, have been proven to be effective for scholarly recommendation tasks with the ability to deal with content information. Recently, venue recommendation is becoming an increasingly important research task due to the unprecedented number of publication venues. However, traditional methods focus on either the author’s local network or author-venue similarity, where the multiple relationships between scholars and venues are overlooked, especially the venue–venue interaction. To solve this problem, we propose an author topic model–enhanced joint graph modeling approach that consists of venue topic modeling, venue-specific topic influence modeling, and scholar preference modeling. We first model the venue topic with Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Then, we model the venue-specific topic influence in an asymmetric and low-dimensional way by considering the topic similarity between venues, the top-influence of venues, and the top-susceptibility of venues. The top-influence characterizes venues’ capacity of exerting topic influence on other venues. The top-susceptibility captures venues’ propensity of being topically influenced by other venues. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that our proposed joint graph modeling approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Adaptive traffic signal control plays a significant role in the construction of smart cities. This task is challenging because of many essential factors, such as cooperation among neighboring intersections and dynamic traffic scenarios. First, to facilitate the cooperation of traffic signals, existing work adopts graph neural networks to incorporate the temporal and spatial influences of the surrounding intersections into the target intersection, where spatial-temporal information is used separately. However, one drawback of these methods is that the spatial-temporal correlations are not adequately exploited to obtain a better control scheme. Second, in a dynamic traffic environment, the historical state of the intersection is also critical for predicting future signal switching. Previous work mainly solves this problem using the current intersection's state, neglecting the fact that traffic flow is continuously changing both spatially and temporally and does not handle the historical state.In this paper, we propose a novel neural network framework named DynSTGAT, which integrates dynamic historical state into a new spatial-temporal graph attention network to address the above two problems. More specifically, our DynSTGAT model employs a novel multi-head graph attention mechanism, which aims to adequately exploit the joint relations of spatial-temporal information. Then, to efficiently utilize the historical state information of the intersection, we design a sequence model with the temporal convolutional network (TCN) to capture the historical information and further merge it with the spatial information to improve its performance. Extensive experiments conducted in the multi-intersection scenario on synthetic data and real-world data confirm that our method can achieve superior performance in travel time and throughput against the state-of-the-art methods.},

First, the original MR brain image is preprocessed to extract the grey matter density of the whole brain as the imaging features. To reduce the feature dimension, t-test is then used to select the most relevant features for classification. Finally, we apply the KDA to classify the selected features into two classes. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using 427 T1-weighted MR brain images from ADNI which includes 198 subjects of Alzheimer disease (AD) and 229 normal controls (NC).

If the virtual power plant consists of members from a local vicinity like an energetic neighborhood, e.g. an industrial estate, schedules can easily be assigned to specific entities in the neighborhood. Patterns of generation and consumption can be derived from collected schedules and from the aggregated information therein. We present a fully decentralized, agent-based optimization algorithm for orchestration of generation and consumption that works with encrypted schedules and thus masks the sent data, preventing machine learning methods from deriving information on other agents. We demonstrate the feasibility of still being able to conduct optimization for energy scheduling when using order preserving encryption.},

People can see attractive scenery, hear marvelous voice, smell fragrant flavor, touch soft objects and taste delicious food. All these feelings can be generalized by 'Modality'. As there are heterogeneous modalities, the way to learning from multiple such modalities become an emerging research topic. Multimodal machine learning has a wide range of applications while it still has many challenges. Challenges can be included in five categories: Representation, Translation, Alignment, Fusion, Co-learning. In this paper, we focus on the representation and fusion problem of multimodal and solve a practical problem of urban functional area classification. In this paper, we propose a scalable interaction model based on Squeeze-and-Excitation block to fuse image modality from remote sensing images and temporal modality from user visit sequence. Crucially, our model produces improvements over typical multimodal methods.},

The proposed system addresses the challenges related to GPS outage, unknown schedule and stoppages of buses, and unavailability of real time traffic information along the bus-route. The system is evaluated using multiple-trip data collected over a 32 kilometer long route during the peak and off-peak hour traffic conditions. The bus-stop detection accuracy of 75% (6 out of 8 bus-stops are accurately detected) could be achieved using an arbitrary set of trips conducted over the route. The arrival time prediction error of 7% (5 minutes) has been reported. The scalability assessment of the system shows that it can support the transit of more than ten thousand buses and over one million subscribers/commuters.},

abstract = {With the ongoing development of sensor devices and network techniques, big data are being generated from the cyber-physical systems. Because of sensor equipment occasional failure and network transmission unreliability, a large number of low-quality data, such as noisy data and incomplete data, is collected from the cyber-physical systems. Low-quality data pose a remarkable challenge on deep learning models for big data feature learning. As a novel deep learning model, the deep computation model achieves superior performance for big data feature learning. However, it is difficult for the deep computation model to learn dependable features for low-quality data, since it uses the nonlinear function as the encoder. In this article, a dependable deep computation model is proposed for feature learning on low-quality big data in cyber-physical systems. Specially, a regularity is added into the objective function of the deep computation model to obtain reliable features in the intermediate-level representation space. Furthermore, a learning algorithm based on the back-propagation strategy is devised to train the parameters of the proposed model. Finally, experiments are conducted on three representative datasets and a real dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the dependable deep computation model for low-quality big data feature learning. Results show that the proposed model achieves a remarkable result for the tasks of classification, restoration, and prediction, proving the potential of this work for practical applications in cyber-physical systems.},

abstract = {Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and ubiquitous smart devices help serve end-users efficiently and optimally through providing emerging edge-deployed services. Meanwhile, heavy and time-varying traffic loads are produced in the edge network, so that an efficient traffic forwarding mechanism is required. In this paper, we propose a parallel and distributed learning approach, DeepHop, to adapt to the volatile environments and realize hop-by-hop routing. The Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) is used to alleviate the edge network congestion and maximize the utilization of network resources. DeepHop determines the routing among edge network nodes for heterogeneous types of traffic according to the current workload and capability. By joining with an attention mechanism, DeepHop obtains the semantics from the elements of the network state to help the agents learn the importance of each element on routing. Experiment results show that DeepHop achieves the increase of successfully transmitted packets by 15% compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Besides, DeepHop with an attention mechanism reduces convergence time by nearly half compared with the common-used structures of neural networks.},

abstract = {The adoption of digital technology in both learning and teaching process, and the evolution of information technologies are opening new perspectives for the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Thus, these technologies can facilitate the assistance of learners working on complex learning situation by using AR and enable the implementation of VR trainings, thus improving their efficiency. However, integrating these new tools into the existing learning processes remains complex, due to the technological aspects and the data continuum to be implemented, through the identification of use cases and the associated gains and by the diversity actors and experts to involve in this process: the expert of the main field, the designer and the IT developer. In this paper we aim to develop an AR application by following a developing process that will led to the planned results. The proposed application will be dictated for learners in higher education context, especially newbies that will practice their first experiment in the laboratory e.g." biology, chemistry" by giving them an interactive environment to understand the safety procedure followed during experiments in laboratories.},

abstract = {Store site recommendation aims to predict the value of the store at candidate locations and then recommend the optimal location to the company for placing a new brick-and-mortar store. Most existing studies focus on learning machine learning or deep learning models based on large-scale training data of existing chain stores in the same city. However, the expansion of chain enterprises in new cities suffers from data scarcity issues, and these models do not work in the new city where no chain store has been placed (i.e., cold-start problem). In this article, we propose a unified approach for cold-start store site recommendation, Weighted Adversarial Network with Transferability weighting scheme (WANT), to transfer knowledge learned from a data-rich source city to a target city with no labeled data. In particular, to promote positive transfer, we develop a discriminator to diminish distribution discrepancy between source city and target city with different data distributions, which plays the minimax game with the feature extractor to learn transferable representations across cities by adversarial learning. In addition, to further reduce the risk of negative transfer, we design a transferability weighting scheme to quantify the transferability of examples in source city and reweight the contribution of relevant source examples to transfer useful knowledge. We validate WANT using a real-world dataset, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model over several state-of-the-art baseline models.},

abstract = {3D Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has received increasing attention in various applications (e.g., human-computer interaction and driver fatigue detection), as it can enable the machines to understand human intentions or emotions more accurately. However, the current use of 2D projection geometric features has presented limitations when distinguishing facial expressions. To address the above problem, we propose a novel solution by fusing normal vector and curvature features on a mesh. More specifically, we are the first to extract the azimuth and elevation information obtained by the triangle facet normal projection (i.e., mesh-AE descriptor). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to fuse normal and curvature information on a 3D mesh rather than using 2D projected facial attribute maps for 3D FER. Then, we use the proposed two types of features (mesh-AE descriptor and mesh-H descriptor) to train a two-channel convolutional neural network. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has greatly increased the efficiency of training. Finally, a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to identify six types of facial expressions. The experimental results demonstrate the well-designed system can realize accurate and generalized 3D FER.},

abstract = {Smart Car is an automobile with an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that can provide a more enjoyable driving experience as well as active safety features. The aim of these systems is to ensure road safety and reduce the risk of road accidents. For these purposes, a driver assistance system must be context-sensitive by monitoring the car and its environment in real time besides sensing, analyzing, predicting and reacting according to the following contextual situation: the vehicle state, the driver state, and the physical environment surrounding them. This paper presents a comparative and statistical study of the research published in the last three years on context-based driver assistance systems, depending on variant criteria such as: the context, the algorithms used, and the technologies adopted. We provide an overview of the results of this survey and the algorithms based on, the sensors used, and categories of context studied. We also propose a model that classifies the different contexts and their features based on the literature review.},

abstract = {Advanced video analytic systems, including scene classification and object detection, have seen widespread success in various domains such as smart cities and autonomous systems. With an evolution of heterogeneous client devices, there is incentive to move these heavy video analytics workloads from the cloud to mobile devices for low latency and real-time processing and to preserve user privacy. However, most video analytic systems are heavyweight and are trained offline with some pre-defined latency or accuracy requirements. This makes them unable to adapt at runtime in the face of three types of dynamism --- the input video characteristics change, the amount of compute resources available on the node changes due to co-located applications, and the user's latency-accuracy requirements change. In this paper we introduce ApproxDet, an adaptive video object detection framework for mobile devices to meet accuracy-latency requirements in the face of changing content and resource contention scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce a multi-branch object detection kernel, which incorporates a data-driven modeling approach on the performance metrics, and a latency SLA-driven scheduler to pick the best execution branch at runtime. We evaluate ApproxDet on a large benchmark video dataset and compare quantitatively to AdaScale and YOLOv3. We find that ApproxDet is able to adapt to a wide variety of contention and content characteristics and outshines all baselines, e.g., it achieves 52% lower latency and 11.1% higher accuracy over YOLOv3.

abstract = {Crowd density estimation is an important task in the surveillance camera system, it serves in security, traffic, business etc. At the present, the trend of monitoring is moving from individual to crowd, but traditional counting techniques will be inefficient in this case because of issues such as scale, clutter background and occlusion. Most of the previous methods have focused on modeling work to accurately estimate the density map and thus infer the count. However, with non-human scenes, which have many clouds, trees, houses, seas etc, these models are often confused, resulting in inaccurate count estimates. To overcome this problem, we propose the "Weighted Sum of Regressors and Human Classifier" (WSRHC) method. Our model consists of two main parts: human -- non-human classification and crowd counting estimation. First of all, we built a Human Classifier, which filters out negative sample images (non-human images) before entering into the regressors. Then, the count estimation is based on the regressors. The difference between regressors is the size of the filters. The essence of this method is the count depends on the weighted average of the density map obtained from these regressors. This is to overcome the defects of the previous model, Switching Convolutional Neural Network (Switch-CNN) select the count as the output of one of the regressors. Multi-Column Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) combines the count and the weight of the Regressors by fixed weights from MCNN, while our approach is adapted for individual images. Our experiments have shown that our method outperform Switch-CNN, MCNN on ShanghaiTech dataset and UCF_CC_50 dataset.},

abstract = {Due to the fast growth of the Internet and social network, a massive amount of data has been generated and move to the cloud. With the ability to separate the control and data plane, SDN (Software Defined Network) provide an emerging solution for data transportation management tasks in the data center. In recent years, more literature focused on using SDN to manage data center network. It has been shown that SDN switch can support fine-grained rule matching with more than 12-tuple flow. However, Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM), which used to store the flow table in SDN switch, has limited capacity and power-hungry. The performance of the data center throughput would reduce dramatically due to flow table overflow. Previous literature proposed two kinds of solutions, rule replacement and rule caching. In this paper, we propose a new rule caching method based on Long short-term memory (LSTM) to improve the cache hit ratio in SDN switches. From the experiment result, we surprisingly find that the deep learning based prefetching model can predict future flow rules with high accuracy. And then improve the cache hit ratio on TCAM compare with the famous FIFO and LRU cache.},

abstract = {Thanks to online social networks services such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc...., users have the opportunity to communicate easily without constraints by providing them with free and open platforms. Because of their crucial role in spreading information between users, these platforms have become an integral part of everyday life. Privacy and security are major concerns for many social media users. When users share information (such as data, photos etc....) with their friends, they are not always safe; they can make their friends easy targets attacked by malicious users who try with multiple methods to access their personal data. Unfortunately, with the continued expansion of a user's social network, privacy settings alone are often insufficient to protect the user's profile. In this paper, we have proposed a new approach to limit the spread and dissemination of spam content and malicious profiles in social networks. In another way, prohibit the creation of malicious profiles by automated robots as well as the falsification of identity when publishing spam content in social networks. Given that when using online social networking services, users trust them to process their information; have seen that it is necessary not to neglect this part; but rather to make a set of changes that will be consistent with our proposal to strengthen the protection of personal data of users of these platforms.},

abstract = {Smart grid (SG) promises an efficient system that provides effective monitoring, timely statuses and vital automation capabilities across generation, transmission and distribution spectrum of the power grid. SG applications have stringent and unique latency and bandwidth requirements. 4G LTE and the evolving 5G promises to support a wide range of applications in the SG. This research analyses the performance of 4G LTE and 5G networks in supporting big data analytics for SG in developing countries. In order to evaluate the technical practicality of using wireless cellular networks provided by local mobile operators, a comparative analysis of three 4G LTE networks operators on wide area network (WAN) application and an emulated future 5G networks is carried out in Nigeria. The latency (λ), throughput (τ) and packet loss rate (ψ) for the three local networks providers (denoted as OP1, OP2, OP3), and the emulated 5G networks (denoted as EFN1, EFN2, EFN3) were used for the experimentation using OMNET++ simulation tool. The obtained results indicate that OP2 is a better choice for WAN SG applications when the communication radius is below 1600m and OP3 is a preferable choice when communication radius grows up to 2400m and beyond. While on the other hand, the results obtained for the 5G networks show that, on average, EFN2 is a better choice for WAN SG applications when the communication radius is lesser than 1600m and EFN3 is a preferable choice when the communication radius extend beyond 2400m.},

abstract = {People with limited mobility in the U.S. (defined as having difficulty or inability to walk a quarter of a mile without help and without the use of special equipment) face a growing informational gap: while pedestrian routing algorithms are getting faster and more informative, planning a route with a wheeled device in urban centers is very difficult due to lack of integrated pertinent information regarding accessibility along the route. Moreover, reducing access to street-spaces translates to reduced access to other public information and services that are increasingly made available to the public along urban streets. To adequately plan a commute, a traveler with limited or wheeled mobility must know whether her path may be blocked by construction, whether the sidewalk would be too steep or rendered unusable due to poor conditions, whether the street can be crossed or a highway is blocking the way, or whether there is a sidewalk at all. These details populate different datasets in many modern municipalities, but they are not immediately available in a convenient, integrated format to be useful to people with limited mobility. Our project, AccessMap, in its first phase (v.1) overlayed the information that is most relevant to people with limited mobility on a map, enabling self-planning of routes. Here, we describe the next phase of the project: synthesizing commonly available open data (including streets, sidewalks, curb ramps, elevation data, and construction permit information) to generate a graph of paths to enable variable cost-function accessible routing.},

abstract = {Searching code in a large-scale codebase using natural language queries is a common practice during software development. Deep learning-based code search methods demonstrate superior performance if models are trained with large amount of text-code pairs. However, few deep code search models can be easily transferred from one codebase to another. It can be very costly to prepare training data for a new codebase and re-train an appropriate deep learning model. In this paper, we propose AdaCS, an adaptive deep code search method that can be trained once and transferred to new codebases. AdaCS decomposes the learning process into embedding domain-specific words and matching general syntactic patterns. Firstly, an unsupervised word embedding technique is used to construct a matching matrix to represent the lexical similarities. Then, a recurrent neural network is used to capture latent syntactic patterns from these matching matrices in a supervised way. As the supervised task learns general syntactic patterns that exist across domains, AdaCS is transferable to new codebases. Experimental results show that: when extended to new software projects never seen in the training data, AdaCS is more robust and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep code search methods.},

New technologies are coming into the spotlight while potentials for transformation are growing under the surface, leading to the omnipresence of challenges across various fields. Under such circumstances, media and auto companies are both aware of an imminent change. The smart ring developed by our team can be applied to the driver fatigue detection system in industrial production— which helps media companies to access the vehicle networking system by monitoring the fatigue status of drivers, as well as their physiological changes when listening to the news. The vehicle networking system recommends personalized contents for users based on their portraits, using algorithm not only considers their interests and browsing behaviors, but also takes physiological and psychological responses of vehicle users when listening to the news as a key dimension based on the smart ring; therefore, it enables integration of online behavioral and offline physiological data, as such making up for where traditional algorithms fall short. Through intelligent interaction of media contents and human physiological signals, it changes the existing process of news production, manufacturing, distribution, collection, and feedback, and thus will become a model of the future smart recommendation system for in-vehicle infotainment. At present, research findings have been applied to two vehicle types of an auto company, which will come into the market in the first half of this year.},

abstract = {Deep learning techniques have shown significant success in cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS). As an instance of deep learning models, generative adversarial nets (GAN) model enables powerful and flexible image augmentation, image generation, and classification, thus can be applied to real-world CPSS settings. GAN model training needs a large collection of cyber-physical-social data originating from various CPSS devices. Numerous prevailing GAN models depend on a tacit assumption that several cyber-physical-social data providers present a reliable source to collect training data, which is seldom the case in real CPSS. The existing GAN models also fail to consider multi-dimensional latent structure. In our work, we put forward a novel blockchain-enabled tensor-based conditional deep convolutional GAN (TCDC-GAN) model for cyber-physical-social systems. The blockchain is employed to develop a decentralized and reliable cyber-physical-social data-sharing platform between numerous cyber-physical-social data providers, such that the training data and the model are documented on a ledger that is distributed. Furthermore, a tensor-based generator and a tensor-based discriminator are well designed by employing the tensor model. The results of extensive simulation experiments show the efficacy of the proposed TCDC-GAN model. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, our model gains superior estimation performance.},

abstract = {Nowadays, geographic entity relationship extraction systems generally rely on artificial feature extraction. These features either require complex and complete data sets, or cannot describe deep features such as semantics. And data sets that can be used for geographic relationship extraction are scarce. To tackle these problems, this paper uses distant supervision to map existing knowledge bases into rich unstructured data which contributes to a large amount of training data. In training, this paper uses the deep residual network to extract more abstract and deeper features. Then the piecewise max pooling and selective attention mechanisms are used to further improve the accuracy of the model. Finally, the experimental results show that the deeper network and the piecewise max pooling significantly improve the extraction results.},

abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are an emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm marked by low-power and long-distance communication. Among them, LoRa is widely deployed for its unique characteristics and open-source technology. By adopting the Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, LoRa enables low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) communication. However, the standard demodulation method does not fully exploit the properties of chirp signals, thus yields a sub-optimal SNR threshold under which the decoding fails. Consequently, the communication range and energy consumption have to be compromised for robust transmission. This paper presents NELoRa, a neural-enhanced LoRa demodulation method, exploiting the feature abstraction ability of deep learning to support ultra-low SNR LoRa communication. Taking the spectrogram of both amplitude and phase as input, we first design a mask-enabled Deep Neural Network (DNN) filter that extracts multi-dimension features to capture clean chirp symbols. Second, we develop a spectrogram-based DNN decoder to decode these chirp symbols accurately. Finally, we propose a generic packet demodulation system by incorporating a method that generates high-quality chirp symbols from received signals. We implement and evaluate NELoRa on both indoor and campus-scale outdoor testbeds. The results show that NELoRa achieves 1.84-2.35 dB SNR gains and extends the battery life up to 272% (~0.38-1.51 years) in average for various LoRa configurations.},

However, as more occupancy data is collected at an increasingly fine-grained level, possibilities of potential privacy breaches also increase. In this paper, we propose an attack in which the adversary associates an individual with the occupancy sensor by combining the occupancy data with other public information that could easily be obtained online. We conduct an experiment using real-world data to demonstrate that the proposed attack is not only feasible, but the adversary can efficiently identify a small set of sensor IDs that contains the ID of interest given a relatively small amount of additional information. We also summarize a number of mitigation strategies against the proposed attack.},

abstract = {Crowd mobility has been paid attention for the Internet-of-things (IoT) applications. This paper addresses the crowd estimation problem and builds an IoT service to share the crowd estimation results across different systems. The crowd estimation problem is to approximate the crowd size in a targeted area using the observed information (e.g., Wi-Fi data). This paper exploits Wi-Fi probe request packets ("Wi-Fi probes" for short) broadcasted by mobile devices to solve this problem. However, using only Wi-Fi probes to estimate the crowd size may result in inaccurate results due to various environmental uncertainties which may lead to crowd overestimation or underestimation. Moreover, the ground-truth is unavailable because the coverage of Wi-Fi signals is time-varying and invisible. This paper introduces auxiliary sensors, stereoscopic cameras, to collect the near ground-truth at a specified calibration choke point. Two calibration algorithms are proposed to solve the crowd estimation problem. The key idea is to calibrate the Wi-Fi-only crowd estimation based on the correlations between the two types of data modalities. Then, to share the calibrated results across systems required by different stakeholders, our system is integrated with the FIWARE-based IoT platform. To verify the proposed system, we have launched an indoor pilot study in the Wellington Railway Station and an outdoor pilot study in the Christchurch Re:START Mall in New Zealand. The large-scale pilot studies show that stereoscopic cameras can reach minimum accuracy of 85% and high precision detection for providing the near ground-truth. The proposed calibration algorithms reduce estimation errors by 43.68% on average compared to the Wi-Fi-only approach.},

abstract = {Unauthorized parking on city streets is a major contributor to traffic congestion and road accidents in developing nations. Due to the large scale and density of this problem, citywide (manual) monitoring of parking violations has not been effective with existing practices. To this end, we present StreetHAWK: an edge-centric, automated, real-time, privacy-preserving system; which leverages the rear camera of a dashboard mounted smartphone, and performs visual scene and location analytics to identify potential parking violations. We realize this system by overcoming the challenges of: (i) small object identification in various non-standard setups by extensive training on a deep learning based convolution detection model; (ii) limited violation assessment range of 15 m (a constraint of the phone's single camera unit) by augmenting it with a short-term historian and GPS for meeting the 100 m measurement violation guideline; and (iii) erroneous mobile scene analysis instances by lightweight filtering techniques that piggyback on the mobility of the camera and multi-modal sensing clues. The evaluation results obtained from real-world datasets show that StreetHAWK: (i) has three times higher accuracy in identifying small sized objects than other competing embedded detectors; and (ii) localizes these objects from a moving vehicle with a worst-case error of less than 5 m. On-the-road experiments show that StreetHAWK, running at a speed of 5 frames per second (FPS) on a typical Android smartphone, was able to detect (on an average) 80% of the parking violations.},

abstract = {Citywide abnormal events, such as crimes and accidents, may result in loss of lives or properties if not handled efficiently. It is important for a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from public order maintaining, disaster control and people's activity modeling, if abnormal events can be automatically predicted before they occur. However, forecasting different categories of citywide abnormal events is very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors from different views: (i) dynamic intra-region temporal correlation; (ii) complex inter-region spatial correlations; (iii) latent cross-categorical correlations. In this paper, we develop a Multi-View and Multi-Modal Spatial-Temporal learning (MiST) framework to address the above challenges by promoting the collaboration of different views (spatial, temporal and semantic) and map the multi-modal units into the same latent space. Specifically, MiST can preserve the underlying structural information of multi-view abnormal event data and automatically learn the importance of view-specific representations, with the integration of a multi-modal pattern fusion module and a hierarchical recurrent framework. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, i.e., crime data and urban anomaly data, demonstrate the superior performance of our MiST method over the state-of-the-art baselines across various settings.},

abstract = {Energy consumption in the transportation sector accounts for 28.8% of the total value among all the industry sectors in the United States, reaching 28.2 quadrillion btu in 2017. Having an accurate evaluation of the vehicle fuel and energy consumption values is a challenging task due to numerous implicit influential factors, such as the variety of powertrain configurations, time-varying traffic and congestion patterns, and emerging new technologies, such as regenerative braking. In this paper, we propose to present a data-driven computational framework to evaluate the energy impact on the transportation system at different scales, leveraging the scalable high-performance transportation simulator, Mobiliti. Instead of using empirical energy models, we create a deep-neural-network mapping between the fuel and energy consumption rate with a variety of heterogeneous driving conditions based on dynamometer test datasets, real-world drive cycle survey datasets as well as real-world GPS probe datasets. For the dynamic driving behaviors, machine learning algorithms are applied over the real-world drive cycle datasets to identify the dominant features and to cluster the drive cycles into representative groups, which can be used to generate high-resolution random drive cycles using a Markov chain approach. Using Mobiliti, both urban-scale static evaluations and dynamic analysis at the trip level can be estimated with a significantly improved fidelity. We demonstrate this approach through case studies with different scales and varied penetrations of different vehicle types, such as conventional ICE vehicles, hybrid vehicles, and electric vehicles.},

abstract = {Crowd flow prediction is a vital problem for an intelligent transportation system construction in a smart city. It plays a crucial role in traffic management and behavioral analysis, thus it has raised great attention from many researchers. However, predicting crowd flows timely and accurately is a challenging task that is affected by many complex factors such as the dependencies of adjacent regions or recent crowd flows. Existing models mainly focus on capturing such dependencies in spatial or temporal domains and fail to model relations between crowd flows of distant regions. We notice that each region has a relatively fixed daily flow and some regions (even very far away from each other) may share similar flow patterns which show strong correlations among them. In this article, we propose a novel model named Double-Encoder which follows a general encoder–decoder framework for multi-step citywide crowd flow prediction. The model consists of two encoder modules named ST-Encoder and FR-Encoder to model spatial-temporal dependencies and daily flow correlations, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and show that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {High-quality trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles with various applications like driving safely and planning traffic trajectory in smart cities. In order to achieve high-precision trajectory prediction, not only the historical trajectory information of the target needs to be considered, but the influence of vehicle interaction on the future trajectory is also extremely important. However, (1) with the increase of the input historical trajectory sequence, it is cause the important information in the feature sequence to be overwritten or lost; (2) It is also a challenge to properly model the interaction between vehicles. In this paper, we propose a Self-Attention Convolutional Social pooling LSTM (SACS-LSTM) vehicle trajectory prediction model. It uses the self attention mechanism to make important information in the historical sequence not easily lost, and uses the self attention mechanism to improve the modeling accuracy of the convolutional social pooling layer for vehicle interaction information, so that the model can achieve the purpose of accurate modeling. We use the NGSIM data set to evaluate the model, and the results vertify that the predicted accuracy within 5s outperforms the baseline models.},

The machines on which are realized the 3D visualization have also evolved.

Demand has grown more in the field of computer graphics, virtual reality and communication. Acquiring 3D information's from real objects in a scene requires intricate calibration procedures every time the system is used.In addition, the use of these acquisition systems requires expertise by their users.

abstract = {Smart end-user devices are connected to the global ecosystem explosively and producing an enormous amount of network traffic at the backhaul. Moreover, Real-time applications such as remote surgery, self-driving cars, and other new technologies required high quality of user experience. To address the challenges Cloud Computing is extended to a new paradigm known as Dew Computing which brings cloud services and capabilities closer to end user devices based on proximity through a decentralized exchange of data and information. However, there is still a user requirement for Ultra-low latency and reliability so that, we introduced Cloud-Edge-Dew architecture to form adaptive local resource utilization and computational offloading during unreliable network to facilitate the collaboration between the various layer in the hierarchy. Moreover, smart end-user devices establish a peer communication or accessing the micro-services which are delivered from Dew Servers and Edge Server. As a result, our scheme provides a decentralize local computation which is more efficient in response time, availability and storage.},

abstract = {Due to the influence of the shooting angle of view and the flight height, the images taken by UAV often have complex backgrounds and contain a large number of small and unevenly distributed objects. In order to solve the problem that it is difficult to accurately locate and recognize small objects in UAV images under complex backgrounds, this paper proposes an multi-scale feature fusion algorithm D-A-FS SSD (Dilated-Attention-Feature Fusion SSD) based on the combination of dilated convolution and attention mechanism. In the process of feature extraction, the receptive field of the feature is expanded through the dilated convolution, which improves the network's feature expression of object distribution and scale difference information. And a attention network is used in our method to effectively suppresse the background information. In the multi-scale detection stage, our method fuses the low-level feature map responsible for detecting small objects with the high-level feature map which have much higher semantic information to improve the recognition accuracy of small objects. Experimental results show that our method effectively improves the accuracy of UAV image object detection.},

abstract = {In just a few years, diabetes has become an epidemic affecting 422 million people in world. This disease, with which one learns to live throughout one's life, is still frightened today. However, a properly supported diabetic can successfully live with his illness. This work involves the design of a device that allows the measurement of blood glucose in a non-invasive way from saliva. A device consisting of three stages, (sensors, amplifiers, filters), as well as a data acquisition process on the Arduino board and a transmission of these by a Bluetooth module, which will lead us to the implementation of our remote monitoring solution for diabetes, including the Android application performed in order to properly manage this disease and have an ongoing relationship with the attending physician to facilitate diagnosis.},
