abstract = {Based on the investigation of the development of fracturing monitoring at home and abroad, this paper studies the mechanism of fracturing fluid injection and fractures monitoring, and puts forward a remote fracturing monitoring and decision-making method suitable for conventional wells. Firstly, combined with the dynamic monitoring model of fracturing fluid, many parameters are optimized and analyzed. The velocity monitoring of fracturing fluid is realized by constructing the average velocity formula of fracturing fluid, and its approximate position is calculated. After analyzing the limitations of traditional models, the monitoring model of the unsteady friction resistance is established by summarizing the existing models and fitting the weight function by the gradient descent method. In this paper, the relationship between the pressure-time curve and crack is studied. Then the pressure curve is optimized by OPTICS algorithm improved by the adjacency list, and conduct the unsupervised learning about the stress data. By using computers, the pressure data can be clustered automatically. The classification is rapid and more accurate than the manual classification, which improves the intelligence and accuracy of data analysis, and realizes more accurate and intuitive monitoring of fractures than before. At the same time, the relationship between the city and well sites is analyzed in this paper. Combined with WITS acquisition and industrial Internet technology, the real-time data of the well site is remotely transmitted to the headquarters, which makes it possible to monitor fracturing in the city far from the well site, so that the combination of city and industry is no longer restricted by geographical location. It is beneficial to give full play to the role of industry in promoting urban development and promote the sustainable development of the city. Surface monitoring instruments have been fully utilized by using this method. This method of remote monitoring of fracturing promotes the development of intelligent city and provides a method for builders to ensure the construction safe and to make abnormal early warning of on-site fracturing.}

Although many prediction systems have been researched and modelled, many of them have neglected the different effects that air pollution has on each individual citizen. Hence, we present a novel context prediction model that includes context-aware computing concepts to merge an accurate air pollution prediction algorithm (using Long Short-Term Memory Deep Neural Network) with information from both surrounding pollution sources (e.g., bushfire incidents, traffic volumes) and user’s health profile. This model is then integrated into a tool called My Air Quality Index (MyAQI), which is further implemented and evaluated in a real-life use case set up in Melbourne Urban Area (Victoria, Australia). Results obtained with MyAQI show both that (i) high precision levels are reached (90–96%) when forecasting air quality situations in four air quality monitoring stations, and (ii) the proposed model is highly adaptable to users’ individual health condition effects under the same airborne pollutant levels.}

The multi-objective optimization concept facilitates the definition of any number of objective functions, versatile in their origin and properties, flexibly adaptable to area specifics or regional and communal priorities. The applied optimization for several domains at the lowest system level yields a comprehensive holistic solution optimal for the particular subsystem, as it is fitted for this subsystem according to its characteristics. The main advantage is the exploitation of cross-domain interactions and synergies and, therefore, the improved overall performance of the system. However, the cross-domain approach requires high-level modeling in order to overcome compatibility issues, which decreases the accuracy of domain-specific simulation and optimization compared to methods which apply detailed models. Based on the mathematical concept of multi-objective Pareto optimization, its adaptation, implementation and application in the context of Smart Cities are presented in detail. Several optimization formulations and methods are applied to the test scenario to demonstrate the concept, compare the results and evaluate the computational performance of the application. The ε-constraint method appears to be better suitable for heterogeneous domains, as the weighted sum method is highly sensitive to weight setting for heterogeneous objectives. The computational performance is very good in terms of computation time but meets numerical limitations for samples of around 500 buildings, leading to numerical infeasibility for samples of 1300 buildings. This is solved with the presented method for model aggregation. The tool is available on GitHub.}

This paper analyzes the temporal variations of public bike riding over the hours, the days and the months. A whole year of usage data (34,098,787 trips) are collected using Internet of Things(IoT) for the bikesharing system in Ningbo, China. Data Mining shows significant seasonal variations of bike rental amounts. The seasonal reductions of bike riders are explained mainly by three factors: nonpermanent residents leaving the city during the Chinese Spring Festival, uncomfortable high/low outdoor temperature, and rainy/snowy weather. Weather impact analysis suggests that rainfall decreases rental amounts significantly, with 1mm of daily rainfall expected to reduce daily rental amount by about 10%. The results also show significant day-of-the-week variations, with rental amounts in weekends 20-30% lower than in weekdays, indicating a clear commuter pattern of usage. The commuter pattern is further proven by the time of day variation with the double rental peaks of morning and afternoon. It should be noted that the total usage in either morning or afternoon rush hours only accounts for 60% of the total bike supply, which indicates that some bikes in the system may have been positioned in the wrong place at peak times. It is further shown that peak hour usage accounts for only 10∼12% of AADT (annual average daily traffic), much lower than the peak hour percentages for other modes, indicating insufficient bike supply and improper positioning of infrequently used bikes. These temporal characteristics imply that the bike turnover rate could increase further if the efficiency of the bike supply is improved with proper location and relocation of bikes. Understanding these temporal characteristics of bikesharing ridership could help the service provider and policy maker to improve the bikesharing services for building Smart City.}

These sensors collect a massive amount of data, which is eventually used in the efficient management of shared assets and resources. In this article, we provide a framework for topological based map building for autonomous robot navigation in smart cities supporting IoT-based technologies. The classical methods of topological based map building do not incorporate the real essence of topology but instead, an illustration is provided where the topology is considered to be a cluster of features. We analyzed the problem of map building from a pure robotic perspective by considering the shape of free-space into a robot navigation path. In the proposed framework, shape-based invariant features are extracted from the free-space, which are used in the construction of topological nodes for robot autonomous navigation. In the context of topological navigation, topology is considered as a structural representation of connecting nodes representing free-space shapes and edges that define their connectivity. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, real-time experiments are performed, which show improvements in autonomous navigation in terms of efficiency and maneuverability.}

abstract = {Future smart cities are expected to change radically the way people live, interact and move in urban environments. This will be possible thanks to the massive amount of data that will be generated by ubiquitously deployed sensor devices through the Internet of Things paradigm. Indeed, solutions able to improve the quality of urban mobility for citizens are of particular interests. As a matter of fact, they are a key objective for many municipal administrations as well as one of the priority themes of the European Commission. In this context, this work proposes an advanced smart urban routing service named SURF, which is specifically thought for pedestrians and cyclists willing to move inside a city. The system allows to retrieve the best route between a source location and a destination according to user-defined objective function (e.g., selecting the route with the best air quality or with the lowest average temperature). This is possible through the interaction with a federation of IoT testbeds, deployed worldwide. This paper comments on the implementation and the evaluation of the proposed system, focusing on both the backend (data retrieval and spatio/temporal data interpolation and forecasting operations) and the front-end (graphical user interface). We assess the performance of several spatial interpolation and temporal prediction models, to understand their relationship with the particular sensor measurements (air pollution, temperature, sound pressure level, etc.). We show through experiments that for what concerns spatial interpolation, Universal Kriging is generally able to perform well across all sensor measurements and can be selected as a generic interpolation strategy. As for temporal prediction, experiments highlight a tradeoff between model accuracy and look-ahead capability. We note that short and mid-term prediction methods show satisfactory performance across all sensor measurements. Finally, subjective and objective experiments demonstrate the positive impact of IoT-based solutions for smart routing on urban citizens.}

In order to share critical information among all the road-side units, we design a blockchain-based decentralized vehicular ad-hoc network that supports data immutability property. We have also designed an authentication protocol for the vehicle’s user and a consensus mechanism to validate transactions. Besides, a smart contract mechanism has also been proposed. Informal security analysis confirms anonymity property with other security requirements.

Although blockchain and machine learning technologies (especially deep learning and deep reinforcement learning) may provide the next promising use case for IIoT, they are working in an adversarial way to some extent. While blockchain facilitates the data collection that is critical for machine learning under the premise of data regulation rules like privacy protection, it may suffer from privacy leakage due to big data analytics with the help of machine learning. To make machine learning and blockchain useful and practical for diversified services in industrial sectors, it is of paramount importance to have a comprehensive understanding of the development of both technologies in the context of IIoT. To this end, in this paper we summarize and analyze the applications of blockchain and machine learning in IIoT from three important aspects, i.e., consensus mechanism, storage and communication. This survey provides a deeper understanding on the security and privacy risks of the key components of a blockchain from the perspective of machine learning, which is useful in the design of practical blockchain solutions for IIoT. In addition, we provide useful guidance for future research in the area by identifying interesting open problems that need to be addressed before large-scale deployments of IIoT applications are practicable.}

With the rapid growth and proliferation of social media platforms, there is a vast amount of user-generated content that can be used as source of information about cities. In this work, we propose a novel framework for events and incidents’ management in smart cities. Our framework uses text mining, text classification, named entity recognition, and stemming techniques to extract the intelligence needed from Arabic social media feeds, for effective incident and emergency management in smart cities. In our system, the data is automatically collected from social media feeds then processed to generate incident intelligence reports that can provide emergency situational awareness and early warning signs to rescue teams. The proposed framework was implemented and tested using datasets collected from Arabic Twitter feeds over a two-years span, and the obtained results show that Polynomial Networks and Support Vector Machines are the top performers in terms of Arabic text classification, achieving classification accuracy of 96.49% and 94.58% respectively, when used with stemming. The results also showed that the use of stemming led to a penalty in terms of response time, and that the richer the dataset/corpus used in terms of size and composition, the higher the classification accuracy will be.}

In effect, decision makers varying from government administrations to private sector have log started using information technology asa mean of to evolve cities, and maintain a consistent correlation between the population culture and the environment they live in, moreover, the solutions they came up with where specific to many problems but unique to each one, as efficient as it may seem to be.

As a result, these solutions make it possible to extract a great amount of data, which is used to turn future predictions more accurate. Nevertheless, the technical solutions are not designed to cover data from multiple sectors, and if so, they lack the possibility to be extended with new sector layers without going through a whole development processes that can turn the old system obsolete. Therefore, as a solution in this paper, to cover new aspects and facilitate addition of new layers of data types, we brought out an abstract layer to cover not only natural events (temperature, humidity, water level, noise) that occurs in the urban field of a city, but also, urban events for example: train arrivals, accidents (traffic, security infringements), population concentration variation, etc, we called it complex events.Furthermore, we also present the architecture of a system that is scalable and supports the variety of complex events, how it collects and broadcast it to external actors.}

However, such distributed systems, if not secured, may cause a major threat by disclosing sensitive information to untrusted or unauthorized entities. Also, there are various users and applications who prefer to work with all the systems in convenient ways using Single-Sign-On. This paper presents a concept for securing distributed applications and services in such data infrastructures for Smart Cities. The concept facilitates privacy, security and controlled access to all stakeholders and the respective components by establishing proper authorization and authentication mechanisms. The approach facilitates Single-Sign-On (SSO) authentication by a novel combination in the use of the state-of-the-art security concepts such as OAuth2 access tokens, OpenID Connect user claims and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). An implementation of this concept for the district Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London is shown in this paper and is also provided as an online demonstration.

Unattended supervision and data acquisition are the primary requirements of any smart city project which is fulfilled by wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the rigorous and rapidly changing metropolis tends to make the network unreliable. Reliability in the data is achieved through the application of fault tolerant protocols. All the literatures use the robust cluster-head (CH) as the basis for the protocol. This is unrealistic and could lead to unintended consequences upon CH node failure. In this paper, we propose a rational dynamic CH scheme, where the CH is prone to errors just like other nodes in the network. The LEACH protocol is modified to incorporate smart dynamic CH selection at the end of each round based on the residual energy and sensor readings. This ensures minimal energy waste and consolidates a green model for smart cities. An efficient dissemination scheme is proposed to facilitate the attainment of global view of the network among all the CHs at the end of r rounds. The proposed protocol gives better classification accuracy and reduced false alarm rates for varied probabilities of intermittent and permanent faults as compared to LEACH.}

Effective methods for traffic congestion prediction can help people make travel plans reasonably with Advanced Traveler Information Systems. Most of the existing methods for traffic congestion prediction was designed for a specific location. The parameters need to be modified when applying these methods to different locations. Other studies on the traffic network require sophisticated data pre-processing such as map matching. In this paper, we build a model named Relative Position Congestion Tensor and propose a Predictor for Position Congestion Tensor for traffic congestion prediction. First, we design a novel approach to construct congestion matrix on region traffic networks using the concept of relative locations for road nodes and convert matrices into three-dimensional spatio-temporal tensors. Then, we propose a method based on convolutional long-short term memory network to predict congestion at all locations of the road network in the near future. The experiments show that in all locations where congestion often occurs, the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline models including Linear Regression, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regression, Long-Short Term Memory and generally outperforms the Convolution-based deep Neural Network modeling Periodic traffic data. Furthermore, we study the internal structure of the Predictor for Position Congestion Tensor model to analyze the interpretability of the model for congestion prediction. The results show that the proposed model can accurately capture the temporal and spatial characteristics of traffic.}

The methodology of ISPC includes building thermal simulation and multi-objective optimization algorithm that interact with conventional machine-level controllers of HVAC systems, to define optimized setpoints considering current and forecasted operation conditions. The development of a reliable surrogate model, based on robust machine learning techniques, is a key feature to confer greenness to a building in order to promote sustainability in the built environment and finally to have a smart green building. It is showed that the proposed ISPC is capable of delivering a robust, energy- and cost-effective decision while being independent of the HVAC system. The implemented energy management, as a non-destructive retrofitting procedure, can be applied to both new and existing buildings and with any level of HVAC technology.}

Thus, this paper highlights the challenges that smart city is confronting in terms of semantic document exchange and proposes a novel Machine Natural Language Mediation (MNLM) framework which provides a sentence-based machine natural language (MNL) as a kind of mediation language, where each sentence as a compound concept is a set of atomic concepts to be compatible with all languages achieving a global semantic transformation. The MNL enables the sentence computer-readable and understandable through unique iid and eiid without semantic ambiguity, and simultaneously MNLM will eliminate the semantic inconsistency and improve the accurate meaning interpretation across conversational contexts.

This research presents a novel crime clustering model, CriClust+, for detecting Crime Series Pattern (CSP). The analysis is augmented using geometric projection with a dual-threshold model. The pattern prevalence information extracted from the model is encoded in similarity graphs. Clusters are identified by finding highly-connected subgraphs using adaptive graph size and Monte-Carlo heuristics in the Karger–Stein mincut algorithm. We propose two new interest measures: (i) Proportion Difference Evaluation (PDE), which reveals the propagation effect of a series and dominant series; and (ii) Pattern Space Enumeration (PSE), which reveals strong underlying correlations and defining features for a series. Our findings on experimental dataset based on a Gaussian distribution and expert knowledge recommendation reveal that, identifying CSP and statistically interpretable patterns could contribute significantly to strengthening public safety service delivery. Evaluation was conducted to investigate: (i) the reliability of the model in identifying all inherent series in a crime dataset; (ii) the scalability of the model with varying crime records volume; and (iii) unique features of the model compared to related research. The study also found that PDE and PSE of series clusters can provide valuable insight into crime deterrence strategies. This research presents considerable empirical evidence, which shows that the proposed crime clustering (CriClust+) model is promising and can assist in deriving useful crime pattern knowledge.}

Despite increasing efforts to maximize the vehicle flow in large cities, to provide greater accuracy to estimate the traffic jam and to maximize the flow of vehicles in the transport infrastructure, without increasing the overhead of information on the control-related network, still consist in issues to be investigated. Therefore, using artificial intelligence method, we propose a solution of inter-vehicle communication for estimating the congestion level to maximize the vehicle traffic flow in the transport system, called TRAFFIC. For this, we modeled an ensemble of classifiers to estimate the congestion level using TRAFFIC. Hence, the ensemble classification is used as an input to the proposed dissemination mechanism, through which information is propagated between the vehicles. By comparing TRAFFIC with other studies in the literature, our solution has advanced the state of the art with new contributions as follows: (i) increase in the success rate for estimating the traffic congestion level; (ii) reduction in travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the vehicle; and (iii) high coverage rate with higher propagation of the message, maintaining a low packet transmission rate.}

Sometimes these systems require a fast and short-term deployment of video cameras. In these cases, ad-hoc networks could be a low-cost and feasible option, but they have poor performance for video delivery. Thus, we propose a smart live video adaptive streaming technique in order to transport video streams from the cameras to the external road traffic monitoring servers. To achieve this goal, these networks need a thorough study in order to analyze video quality under their inherent constraints, given by their specific topologies (once deployed), video streaming protocol, nodes’ performance and routing protocols. From our results both in simulated and real scenarios, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal in these specific scenarios, validated with several performance metrics in terms of Quality of Service and video quality.}

abstract = {Local urban identity, culture and knowledge ecosystems continue to shape innovative capacity and technological acceptance despite global exchange in talent, trade and technology. This has important implications for the development and implementation of future smart cities. The last two decades of smart city research has presented smart cities as a generic, universal aspiration without taking into consideration such local cultural differences. Future smart cities have several tasks ahead of them. The first is selecting culturally appropriate technologies from the vast array of global technologies now on offer. The second task is adapting such technology and the third task is in managing the acceptance of such technology. The above process is not linear but must be iterative, with technology acceptance considered simultaneously alongside the selection and adoption of such technologies. This study integrates the substantial literature on Technology Acceptance Modelling into the smart city discourse to begin to address this need. It also further develops our understanding of technology acceptance using the Structural Equation Modelling Method. A new synthetic model is proposed consisting of twelve factors, which have been selected based on a targeted literature review. A survey-based method was used to develop and cross-validate the model sampling a diverse population from various Iranian cities. The result of the above process is a new model named the Urban Services Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM). The validated model includes key factors related to technology such as Self-Efficacy, Operation, Work Facilitation, Relative Advantage and Compatibility. The USTAM is a useful tool for the prediction of technology acceptance in the implementation of smart cities. The final model is significant for various reasons. Firstly, it is significant for ensuring that selected technology is appropriate to local cultural contexts. Secondly it is significant to ensure that integration of technologies at metropolitan scales is managed effectively. The final significant reason is that it is well-suited to helping developing economies participate in the smart city boom in a resource efficient manner. The proposed model can potentially help cities achieve this by guiding them in the selection of appropriate technologies. The proposed model is developed with specific reference to Iran and Bangladesh. The authors suggest that the model is useful for cities of different cultural identities and characteristics, who wish to initiate their own distinctive smart city strategies.}

This paper reviews recent published papers in the area of smart health starting from the years 2011 to 2017, and a structured analysis for different machine learning (ML) approaches that are applied in s-Health. The results show that the ML approach is used in many s-Health applications such as Glaucoma diagnosis, Alzheimer’s disease, bacterial sepsis diagnoses, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) readmissions, and cataract detection. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and deep learning models especially the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are the most commonly used machine learning approaches where they proved to get high evaluation performance in most cases.}

There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries.}

However, Fog computing is still nascent and requires strong groundwork to adopt as practically feasible, cost-effective, efficient and easily deployable alternate to currently ubiquitous cloud. Fog computing promises to introduce cloud-like services on local network while reducing the cost. In this paper, we present a novel resource efficient framework for distributed video summarization over a multi-region fog computing paradigm. The nodes of the Fog network is based on resource constrained device Raspberry Pi. Surveillance videos are distributed on different nodes and a summary is generated over the Fog network, which is periodically pushed to the cloud to reduce bandwidth consumption. Different realistic workload in the form of a surveillance videos are used to evaluate the proposed system. Experimental results suggest that even by using an extremely limited resource, single board computer, the proposed framework has very little overhead with good scalability over off-the-shelf costly cloud solutions, validating its effectiveness for IoT-assisted smart cities.}

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is more likely to be the target of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks due to the risk of a single point of failure. To better defend against DDoS attacks, we focus on tracing the source and propose a statistics-based traceback scheme using the advantages of the SDN architecture. We analyze the changes of flow through the Base Station (BS) nodes to calculate the eigenvalue and establish the anomaly tree. Then prune it with DDoS detection algorithm to get the attack path. Through the experiments, we obtain the optimal parameters to make the proposed scheme more flexible and effective. It shows that the scheme consumes fewer network resources and saves time than traditional ones while keeping the DDoS defense accuracy at a high level.}

In many cases, due to a wide range of financial or installation limitations, off-grid small scale micro power panels are favoured as modular systems to power lighting in gardens or to be integrated together to power small devices such as mobile phone chargers and distributed smart city facilities and services. Manufacturers and systems’ integrators have a wide range of options of micro-scale photo voltaic panels to choose from. This makes the selection of the right panel a challenging task and risky investment. To address this and to help manufacturers, this paper suggests and evaluates a novel approach based on integrating empirical lab-testing with short-term real data and neural networks to assess the performance of micro-scale photovoltaic panels and their suitability for a specific application in specific environment. The paper outlines the combination of lab testing power output under seasonal and hourly conditions during the year combined with environmental and operating conditions such as temperature, dust accumulation and tilt angle performance. Based on the lab results, a short in-situ experimental work is implemented and the performance over the year in the selected location in Kuwait is evaluated using deep learning neural networks. The findings of this approach are compared with simulation and long-term real data. The results show a maximum error of 23% of the neural network output when compared with the actual data, and a correlation values with previous work within 87.3% and 91.9% which indicate that the proposed approach could provide an experimental rapid and accurate assessment of the expected power output. Hence, supporting the rapid decision-making process for manufacturers and reducing investment risks.}

However, due to the limitation of energy storage both for sensing nodes and mobile chargers, not all the sensing nodes can be recharged in time by mobile chargers. Therefore, how to select appropriate sensing nodes and design the path for the mobile charger are the key to improve the system utility. This paper proposes an Intelligent Charging scheme Maximizing the Quality Utility (ICMQU) to design the charging path for the mobile charger. Comparing to the previous studies, we consider not only the utility of the data collected from the environment, but also the impact of sensing nodes with different quality. Quality Utility is proposed to optimize the charging path design. Besides, ICMQU designs the charging scheme for a single mobile charger and multiple mobile chargers simultaneously. For the charging scheme with multiple mobile chargers, the workload balance among different mobile chargers is also considered as well as the utility of the system. Extensive simulation results are provided, which demonstrates the proposed ICMQU scheme can significantly improve the utility of the system.}

abstract = {Foreseeing changes in how smart cities manage their resources and provide services to the residents; research, development and production in various relevant technology fields is accelerating. Taking advantage of recent advances and innovations in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), robotics and software; smart cities can optimize resources utilization and enhance operations in health, transportation, energy, and water services, as well as elevating the level of comfort of residents. Effectively and efficiently utilizing ICT and robotics in smart cities will result in reducing costs and resources consumption in addition to engaging more effectively and actively with the citizens. One of these technologies is the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which can provide many applications for smart cities and create a positive impact on the society. For example, UAVs can be used for environmental monitoring, traffic management, pollution monitoring, civil security control, and merchandise delivery. UAV applications among several others can provide cost-effective services to help achieve the objectives of smart cities. However, the integration of UAVs in smart cities is very challenging due to several issues and concerns such as safety, privacy and ethical/legal use. This paper reviews the potential applications integrating UAVs in smart cities, their implications, and the technical and non-technical issues facing such integration. It also discusses regulations and enabling technologies currently available and being developed that can be utilized to support such integration.}

abstract = {Smart cities are racing to create a more connected Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) that rely on collecting data from every possible sensor such as a smart utility meter or a smart parking meter. The use of more sensors resulted in generating a lot of information that maps the smart city environment conditions to more real time data points that needed to be shared and analyzed among smart city nodes. One possibility, to carry and share the collected data, is in autonomous vehicles systems, which use the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology. For example, in a Car-to-Parking-Meter or a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, short-range embedded sensors such as Bluetooth, Cameras, Lidar send the collected data to the vehicle’s Electronic Control Unit (ECU) or to a road side gateway for making collaborative decisions and react to the environment’s surrounding conditions. The goal of this research is to develop and test a DSRC based sensor-pooling protocol for vehicles to cooperatively communicate inclement weather or environment conditions. Five simulation experiments are setup using PreScan and Simulink to validate and study the scalability of the proposed solution. PreScan is an automotive simulation platform that is used for developing and testing Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). The research findings proved that the DSRC can be used to effectively stream the short range sensors’ collected data over a long distance communications link.}

This data is heterogeneous in nature which varies with respect to time and exhibits the properties of all essential V’s for big data. Therefore, to handle such an enormous amount of data, various big data processing techniques are required. To cope up with these issues, this paper presents a tensor-based big data management technique to reduce the dimensionality of data gathered from the Internet-of-Energy (IoE) environment in a smart city. The core data is extracted out of the gathered data by using tensor operations such as-matricization, vectorization and tensorization with the help of higher-order singular value decomposition. This core data is then stored on the cloud in the reduced form. After reducing the dimensionality of data, it is used for providing many services in smart cities; and its application to provide demand response (DR) services has been discussed in this paper. For this purpose, support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier is used to classify the end-users (residential and commercial) into normal, overloaded and underloaded categories from the core data. Once such users are identified to take part in DR mechanism, utilities then generate commands to handle their DR in order to alter load requirements so that the overall load is optimized. Results obtained on Open Energy Information and PJM dataset clearly indicate the supremacy of the proposed tensor-based scheme over the traditional scheme for DR management.}

This paper explores the strategic approaches of three MNEs from the ICT industry (IBM, Cisco, and Accenture) as suppliers of ‘smart city technologies’, rooted in an international business perspective. Based on qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews and documentation on firm activities related to smart cities, our study offers two contributions. First, the empirical analysis provides insight into how MNEs have developed resources and capabilities in the smart city realm from a multitude of smart city engagements globally, and shows how firm-specific strategies and programmes for smart cities (IBM Smarter Cities, Cisco Smart + Connected Communities, and Accenture Intelligent Cities) have facilitated this process. Second, it provides an actor-centric perspective on the (potential) role of business in the emergence and spread of technological innovations for urban development, helping to address the need for further insights into (smart) cities and stakeholder involvement in sustainability transitions.}

However, the data collected and processed by IoT systems especially the ones with centralized control are vulnerable to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties. Lastly, the experimental outcomes advocate that a multi-channel blockchain scales well as compared to a single-channel blockchain system.}

abstract = {With the increasing population density and relatively limited space and resources, cities are becoming more intelligent to provide adequate provision of services for the inhabitants. The utilization of the Internet-of-Things and Edge-of-Things technologies presents a significant foundation for the development of smart cities where intelligent transportation system is one of the most important applications. Due to the obvious advantages of reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions, electric vehicles are playing an increasingly important role in the intelligent transportation system. However, there is no shared framework for the interaction between electric vehicles and intelligent transportation system in smart cities. To handle this issue, this work proposes a practical framework to collect trajectory data of electric vehicles via edge devices and use a novel modified dynamic time warping method to analyze drivers’ preference. The analysis based on real data shows that a certain percentage of electric vehicle drivers have driving preference. That is, they tend to go through specific routes or locations during commuting. Furthermore, a few simulation experiments are conducted to compare the system performance between the time-of-use and load-of-use pricing strategies of the charging stations. The results demonstrate that the load-of-use pricing strategy can effectively divert the traffic flow and balance the load differences between different charging stations.}

In this context, many demand-side management programs are being developed to achieve flexibility from different loads like space heating. As space heating models for flexibility simulations are an interdisciplinary field of work, complex civil engineering thermal models need to be combined with complex electrical engineering control simulations in different software frameworks. Traditionally used methods have shortcomings in one of those two domains as the publications that provide complex control strategies for demand response are lacking complex thermal models and vice versa. Co-simulations overcome this problem but are computationally expensive and have compatibility limitations. Thus, the aim of this work is to develop a methodology for designing space heating/cooling models, intended for positive energy district- or smart city simulations, which provide high accuracy at low computational expense. This could be achieved by synthesizing neural network object models from IDA-ICE civil engineering models in Matlab. These machine learning models showed improvements of more than 30% in different error metrics and a simulation time reduction of more than 80% compared to other methods, making them suitable for use in microgrid simulations, including flexibility analyses.}

This paper conducts a scientometric review of the progressively synthesized network derived from 7840 bibliographic records from a topic search on SC in the period 1990–2019. Using CiteSpace, co-occurrence analysis of categories is conducted to explore the evolution of the disciplines engaged in SC research; co-word analysis of the keywords and document co-citation analysis associated with cluster analysis are further performed to reveal the development paths and research topics in terms of burst terms, text and citation-based clusters, citation structure, and pivotal points in the field. These scientometric techniques are combined to: (1) reveal the intellectual division of this developing field using a visual and comprehensive approach, (2) identify in chronological order the 10 core research sub-topics in this area with burst references and terms, (3) identify Internet of Things, big data, and fog computing as the most promising technologies for SC planning and development, and (4) conclude that smart sustainable cities and sustainable smart cities are the two emerging trends in the domain. Overall, this paper provides a visual, quantitative, and longitudinal large-scale review of the most recent literature on SC research, providing a broad overview and system thinking for researchers and practitioners with respect to SC.}

Since they are independent, it is not easy to correlate information from different systems and put it together to work in order to achieve application goals. The collaboration among different systems enables an agent to offer new functionalities (services or just information about the city) that cannot be provided by any of these systems working as individual entities.

In this sense, using historical information provided with the mentioned technologies, various forecasting tools have been incorporated into smart city environment in order to manage more effectively its essential components such as smart grids and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). For a further improvement in forecasting accuracy and hence in the management of these smart systems, recently, the information available in space has been also introduced in forecasting tools in addition to that in time. These advanced forecasting approaches, called spatio-temporal methods, have the capability of making use of all the available data collected from different locations. The potential benefits of these approaches have been underlined in various recent studies in the literature. In this paper, a comprehensive overview and assessment of forecasting approaches including both spatial and temporal information have been presented for the purpose of supporting the ongoing efforts for exploiting the available information in smart city applications. With this objective, the spatio-temporal forecasting methods presented in the literature are classified considering their implementation areas and model structures.

In the context of smart health, smart devices are employed to collect and transmit biomedical information to a medical server, allowing medical practitioners to give better and improved healthcare services. However, considering the sensitive nature of the medical data, any illegal access may have devastating effects on the patient's health condition. A lightweight privacy-preserving authentication and fine-grained access control scheme for smart health known as PAASH is proposed. In PAASH, a new ultraefficient certificateless signature scheme with compact aggregation is developed to achieve source authentication and data integrity. To achieve efficient user authorization and data confidentiality, a privacy-preserving access control technique using the developed aggregate signature and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is implemented. An analysis of PAASH reveals that it can provide desirable privacy and security measures in smart health. Moreover, the formal security demonstrated in the random oracle model (ROM) shows that PAASH is semantically secure under the intractability of the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP). The performance evaluation shows that PAASH is par excellence practically suitable for smart health.}

Urban big data and data-driven technologies have played an increasingly important role in building smart and resilient cities that can respond rapidly to these perturbations. However, many existing approaches had limited capabilities for processing big data, which has led to time-consuming and costly decision-making. Thus, we develop a real-time data-driven analytical and geo-visual system to enable smart and rapid responses to urban extreme events. The system is built on ArcGIS’s GeoEvent Server and Apache Spark and processes streaming data from social media with high speed, massive volume, and multiple modalities. The system employs online topic modeling and domain-adaptive sentiment analysis to track small-scale, undefined events, visualizes their spatial and semantic dynamics, and provides early alerts for crises and emergencies via an interactive online GIS platform. The proposed system has been applied during a large-scale hurricane and demonstrated effectiveness and agility in tracking and reporting emerging small-scale crises. The developed system can be applied in various urban scenarios to enable timely situation awareness and rapid response. This research contributes to the smart city safety and building rapidity of resilient cities.}

We also further describe solutions for each category in this paper. Furthermore, we show the applications of these solutions in an urban traffic data captured on two urban smart cities (e.g., Odense in Denmark and Beijing in China). The perspectives on open questions and research challenges are also mentioned and discussed that allow to obtain a better understanding of the intuition, limitations, and benefits for the various space–time series clustering methods.

abstract = {New cities exploit the smartness of the IoT-based architecture to run their vital and organizational processes. The smart response of pandemic emergency response services needs optimizing methodologies of caring and limit infection without direct connection with patients. In this paper, a hybrid Computational Intelligence (CI) algorithm called Moth-Flame Optimization and Marine Predators Algorithms (MOMPA) is proposed for planning the COVID-19 pandemic medical robot's path without collisions. MOMPA is validated on several benchmarks and compared with many CI algorithms. The results of the Friedman Ranked Mean test indicate the proposed algorithm can find the shortest collision-free path in almost all test cases. In addition, the proposed algorithm reaches an almost %100 success ratio for solving all test cases without constraint violation of the regarded problem. After the validation experiment, the proposed algorithm is applied to smart medical emergency handling in Egypt's New Galala mountainous city. Both experimental and statistical results ensure the prosperity of the proposed algorithm. Also, it ensures that MOMPA can efficiently find the shortest path to the emergency location without any collisions.}

VANET (vehicular ad hoc network) is one of the emergent transportation technologies that has a great impact on ensuring mainly traffic management and road safety in urban areas by effciently using data sharing among vehicles. To further increase the security and safety of passengers and drivers, ITSs are continually striving to make the fusion of emergent network technologies to provide more reliable and effcient services. Relating VANET to UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is an example of this fusion, where UAVs act as an assistant to vehicles aiming to extend the network connectivity while effciently avoiding obstacles (e.g., Buildings) and providing high data delivery ratios. However, VANET and UAV are still critical security subjects that must be addressed. Advanced Machine Learning (e.g., Deep Learning) techniques have recently been used to protect VANET and UAV communications against various cyber attacks that deteriorate the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of vehicular data. Thus, in this paper, we focus on reviewing related work on machine learning techniques for intrusion detection systems in VANET- and UAV-aided networks. We also highlight the main open research challenges in literature and provide hints for improving security in ITSs.}

Enormous video data from city surveillance cameras poses huge challenges of transmission, storage and analysis, which necessitates new video compression technologies. The fusion of video data generated from smart city could be used to support city management and urban policy. Based on the specific characteristics of surveillance video, which are successive pictures have very strong correlations and each picture can be divided into background and foreground, this work proposes a block-level background modeling (BBM) algorithm to support long-term reference structure for efficient surveillance video coding. A rate–distortion optimization for surveillance source (SRDO) algorithm is also developed to improve the coding performance. Experimental results show that the proposed BBM and SRDO can significantly improve the compression performance, which can effectively support diverse video applications in smart city.}

abstract = {Today car drivers struggle to find a free parking space for their cars. It is considered a big challenge specially in large cities and in rush hours. Many studies considered this problem and how it influences our life. This increases emissions and energy consumption and wastes people’s times as they try to find a free space for their cars. People normally become exhausted all over the day to reach their destination which causes stress and make them lose their temper. This would have a bad impact on the quality of life and economy. Based on the above, today people expect technology to address this problem and hence find a suitable solution to end the suffering of motorists. On the other hand, IoT is a promising platform for providing unusual applications for helping people and provide them a better way to manage their day’s lives. This work proposes a solution for a green intelligent parking system based on IoT. This solution is supported by proposing the game theory mathematical model. Game theory is used to model a reservation system of the proposed car parking solution. This work tackles the main problems facing car drivers to find available car parking spaces. These problems include: the parking fees, how far the car park from the car drivers destinations and hence the amount of walking, and the parking duration. Moreover, the proposed solution encourages companies and householders to offer their own parking stalls and/or driveways for renting in the unused times. From one hand, this will help on providing more parking lots specially in the dense traffic areas. On the other hand, the owners will get a revenue of their unused assets. Therefore, this work proposes a solution to parking problems by providing affordable parking lots based on the choice of the car driver that is relatively close to the destination. As a result of that, there will not be wasting of time or energy, frustration and panic will be reduced, fewer traffic jams, and consequently a green environment and a better quality of life.}

Especially, since industrial sewage is normally highly toxic, which could cause serious pollution in a city and lead to health problems of residents, it is critical to monitor and predictably maintain sewage treatment facilities in cities. This paper presents an intelligent sewage treatment system based on machine learning and Internet of Things sensors to assist to manage the sewage treatment in a fine chemical plant. The implemented system has operated for twenty months, acquired multi-dimension data such as temperatures in different treatment processes, operation parameters of devices, and real-time Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Since the change trend of outflow COD is highly related to operation status, this paper innovatively uses different types of temperature and water inflow data as model inputs and applies three algorithms to make prediction, which are Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. The experimental results show that GRU model performs better (MAPE = 10.18%, RMSE = 35.67, MAE = 31.16) than LSTM and SVR. This study can be extended to various sewage treatment scenarios in sustainable cities.}

This is why we propose using Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) to fill in gaps within data layer of V2X communication. By using SWT (Semantic Web Technologies) and Linked data, we plan to interconnect various data sources, in order to provide homogeneous way for connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) to access relevant information. Such information is currently contained in three distinctive type of sources. These are: Geo-stationary Static data sources (Maps, City models), Geostationary Dynamic data sources (IoT devices) and Non-geostationary Dynamic sources (Vehicles). Using SWT, our goal is to develop ontology(s), in such a way that in-vehicle algorithms can extract and process information about environment they are in, while taking into account available network bandwidth.}

abstract = {With the advent of advancements in the power sector, various new methods have been devised to meet modern society’s electricity needs. To cope with these large sets of electronic device’s current requirements, better energy distribution is needed. Smart Grid (SG) facilitates energy providers to distribute electricity efficiently to the user according to their particular requirements. Recent advancements enable SG to monitor, analyze, control and coordinate for the demand and supply of electricity efficiency and energy saving. SG also allows two-way real-time communication between utilities and customers using cloud and Fog enabled infrastructures. SG minimizes management and operations cost, electricity theft, electricity losses, and maximize user comfort by giving the user choice about their energy use. It also facilitates Renewable Energy Resources (RER) and electric vehicles. Blockchain is a promising technology, provides the necessary features to solve most of these issues. Current Issues include saving a large amount of data, deletion, tampering, and revision of data. It also eliminates the necessity of intermediaries. Inherent security, along with the distributed nature, makes it a perfect candidate for improving the overall services. The rules of the smart contract are automatically enforced upon execution. Smart contracts are enhanced in a way that per-unit price is calculated dynamically based upon RER and utilities generated energy units in the overall grid. The system is also automated in a way that electricity is transferred from one resident (or service) to another resident according to their requirements. The exchange of energy is done via a smart contract after checking the needs of each participant. Each participant defines their requirements at the time of the registration and can update these thresholds. The privacy protection scheme has higher security, shown by theoretical security analysis. The main contributions of our work are two-fold; Using smart contracts to automate the bidding process for transactions based upon supply and demand for energy in smart cities. Secondly, at the same time, using hyper ledger fabric and composer to leveraging Blockchain to uphold privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality at the same time giving the users ability to have dynamic pricing based on supply and demand.}

Each IoT device that is producing data may sense a sensitive one that should not be disclosed unintentionally. Due to the existence of a large number of devices in the near future, the possibility of information leakage, privacy breach, is increasing. To prevent this, each device applies a privacy-preserving method. We discover that all of the existing solutions have three major drawbacks: (1) applying one static privacy-preserving method for the entire system, (2) sending whole data at once, and (3) not context-aware. These cause unacceptable privacy-preserving degree. To address them, in this paper, at first, we equip IoT-based smart city with Software Defined Networking paradigm (SDN). Then, we mount an efficient privacy-preserving method on top of it that manages flowing data packets of split IoT device’ data. We have done extensive simulation through MININET-WIFI to show the effectiveness of our approach. Evaluation results show that our method can be widely applied to the smart city application with a superior performance regarding accuracy, overhead, and penetration rate compared to existing privacy-preserving solutions.}

Proposed smart traffic light solutions based on Wireless Sensor Network and Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork are either unreliable and inflexible or complex and costly. Furthermore, the handling of special vehicles such as emergency is still not viable, especially during busy hours. Inspired by the emergence of distributed smart cameras, we present a novel fuzzy logic approach to traffic control at intersections. Our approach uses smart cameras at intersections along with image understanding for real-time traffic monitoring and assessment. Besides understanding the traffic flow, the cameras can detect and track special vehicles and help prioritize emergency cases. Traffic violations can be identified as well and traffic statistics collected. In this paper, we introduce a flexible, adaptive and phase-free distributed traffic-control algorithm that uses the information provided by distributed smart cameras to efficiently control traffic signals. Experimental results show that our collision-free approach outperforms the state-of-the-art of the average user’s waiting time in the queue and improves the routing of emergency vehicles in a cross congestion area.}

In an edge computing environment, users can offload their computationally expensive tasks to offloading points, which may reduce the energy consumption or communication delay. There are a large number of offloading points and users in a system, and their tasks are structured. However, resources of offloading points are limited, and users have different preferences for energy consumption and communication delays. In this paper, we first establish a system model for the environment with multiple users, multiple offloading points, and structured tasks. Then, we formalize an offloading decision problem in such an environment as a cost-minimization problem, which is a NP-hard problem. Thus, we design a method based on backtracking to obtain its exact solution; the method’s time complexity is, unfortunately, exponential with the number of offloading points. To reduce the complexity, a method based on an improved genetic algorithm and a method based on a greedy strategy are designed. Finally, we validate and compare three methods in terms of the total cost of all users, resource utilization of offloading points and execution time. The simulation results show that the last method performs the best.}

One of the most significant pillars of the Smart City is to ensure healthy and sustainable environment by making the city pollution free as far as possible, to ensure the smart health of the citizens. In this work, a frame work is proposed using Context Aware Computing approach to monitor the air health of urban region. The proposed frame work is designed to help in sensing air pollutant parameters using smart sensors and generate alert using context if there is a threat of air pollution. Here, the Input layer optimization technique is also proposed. It has been shown that, the Input layer optimization technique has discarded the unwanted overheads of the proposed frame work without degrading the efficiency of the system.}

abstract = {The recent development in the technology brings the concept of Smart City that is achieved through real-time city related intelligent decisions by analyzing the data harvested from various smart systems in the city using millions of sensors and devices connected over the Internet, termed as Internet of Things (IoT). These devices generate the overwhelming volume of high-speed streaming data, termed as Big Data. However, the generation of city data at a remote location and then transmitting it to central city servers for analysis purpose raises the concerns of security and privacy. On the other hand, providing security to such Big Data streaming requires a high-speed security system that can work in a real-time environment without providing any delay that may slow down the overall performance of the Smart City System. To overthrown these challenges, in this paper, we proposed an efficient and real-time Smart City security system by providing strong intrusion detection at intelligent city building (ICB) and also a security protocol to protect the communication between the remote smart system(RSS)/User and the city analysis building, i.e., ICB. The proposed communication security protocol consists of various phases, i.e., registration phase, session key exchange phase, session key revocation phase, and data transmission phases from RSS to ICB as well as from User to ICB. Vast security analyses are performed to evaluate the credibility of the system. The proposed system is also evaluated on efficiency in terms of computation cost and throughput of overall functions used in the system. The system’s evaluation and the comparative study with existing system show that the prosed system is secure, more efficient, and able to work in a real-time, high-speed Smart City environment.}

Through observation, we found that existing solutions apply one common privacy-preserving rule for all devices while they address the heterogeneity issue separately that lead to unappealing performance. In this paper, we propose a framework for addressing the heterogeneity issue and privacy-preserving of IoT devices at the network edge using a novel proposed ontology data model. Besides, it leverages the proposed ontology to obtain a privacy-preserving method by frequently changing the privacy-preserving behaviors of IoT devices. Through simulation, we show that our solution overhead is less than 9 percent in the worst situation so that it is affordable to most IoT devices in one of its applications that is smart city.}

Aside from hearing impairment and stress-related illnesses, it can also interfere with spoken communication, reduce human performance and affect the quality of life. As urbanization is intensifying, the potential benefits of reducing noise pollution in smart-city environments are extensive. Noise levels can be collected and analyzed using a wireless sensor network which can monitor the noise level by using microphones. However, every wireless system struggles in terms of the battery requirements needed for continuous data collection and monitoring. In this paper, the design of a testbed for a smart microphone system is presented. To save power, a microcontroller and an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) dynamically switch between high and low power modes in response to environmental noise. Specifically, the high powered components are triggered by a spike in the acoustic noise level. Three wireless technologies, WiFi (2.4 GHz), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 4.0 and Zigbee were examined. According to the results, the power consumption of a node can be lowered by 97% when idle based on the testbed.}

The Smart City has been praised but also criticized as a discourse for its narrow epistemology. Limitations have led to reductionist benchmarking that lends itself to comparison, yet limits practitioners’ ability to translate findings into ontologically diverse action. In the related fields of information systems and management studies, a pragmatist research paradigm has been used to address this challenge. This article explores that pragmatist paradigm, describing how it can expand the current limits of the current Smart City discourse to include local politics, technologies, and the relational genealogies that characterize sociotechnical systems. The pragmatist methodology I explore here uses excerpts from practitioner oral histories—organized visually using actor-network theory—to define and explain the emergence of two Smart City initiatives. This approach is capable of a more situated and contingent practitioner explanation of the complexity of urban projects. Ultimately, the article concludes with reflections on the use of pragmatism for Smart City cases to provide a counter perspective to the dominant discourse.}

Less attention has been devoted to identifying the practical conditions under which big data can realistically contribute to addressing urban policy problems. In this paper, we discuss the value and limitations of big data for long-term urban policy and planning. We first develop a theoretical perspective on urban analytics as a practice that is part of a new smart urbanism. We identify the particular tension of opposed temporalities of high-frequency data and the long durée of structural challenges facing cities. Drawing on empirical studies using big urban data, we highlight epistemological and practical challenges that arise from the analysis of high-frequency data for strategic purposesand formulate propositions on the ways in which urban analytics can inform long-term urban policy.}

Different kinds of Smart City APIs enable smart city services and applications, while their effectiveness depends on the architectural solutions to pass from data to services for city users and operators, exploiting data analytics, and presenting services via APIs. Therefore, there is a strong activity on defining smart city architectures to cope with this complexity, putting in place a significant range of different kinds of services and processes. In this paper, the work performed in the context of Sii-Mobility smart city project on defining a smart city architecture addressing a wide range of processes and data is presented. To this end, comparisons of the state of the art solutions of smart city architectures for data aggregation and for Smart City API are presented by putting in evidence the usage semantic ontologies and knowledge base in the data aggregation in the production of smart services. The solution proposed aggregate and re-conciliate data (open and private, static and real time) by using reasoning/smart algorithms for enabling sophisticated service delivering via Smart City API. The work presented has been developed in the context of the Sii-Mobility national smart city project on mobility and transport integrated with smart city services with the aim of reaching a more sustainable mobility and transport systems. Sii-Mobility is grounded on Km4City ontology and tools for smart city data aggregation, analytics support and service production exploiting smart city API. To this end, Sii-Mobility/Km4City APIs have been compared to the state of the art solutions. Moreover, the proposed architecture has been assessed in terms of performance, computational and network costs in terms of measures that can be easily performed on private cloud on premise. The computational costs and workloads of the data ingestion and data analytics processes have been assessed to identify suitable measures to estimate needed resources. Finally, the API consumption related data in the recent period are presented.}

abstract = {Smart cities is an emerging concept that allows the usage of technology to improve the quality and efficiency of services delivered to the population of a given city, considering a vast application domain. Some applications, like smart surveillance using Internet of Things sensors demand the transmission of high amounts of traffic with strict quality of service, what may not be available at all times. One solution to deal with this traffic overload is to implement the concept of resources sharing. Considering this context, in this article, a heterogeneous network scenario is considered to implement a multi-purpose real time video surveillance application which can be applied to both smart cities and military surveillance such as borderline security. The proposed solution considers three crucial aspects: the QoS requirements of the real time video application; the cost-benefit of the spectrum allocation; and the time constraints involved in a vertical handover operation to avoid interference. The main contribution of the article are: (I) inclusion of a multilevel resources broker in the Smart Cities architecture, (II) a QoS-enabled solution for video surveillance to provide borderline security, and (III) a low overhead control mechanism to avoid interfering with the legitimate network traffic. Results obtained via simulations show that after the proposed solution is implemented delay and jitter are kept below their specific thresholds and therefore the QoS is guaranteed considering the coexistence of up to 500 IoT sensors. Nearly 70% of the traffic is accommodated either in IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.22 networks, which offer relatively low cost resources. These results are also compared with two state of the art related works and show that the proposed solution performs better than the related work in the analyzed scenarios. Finally, with respect to the time constraints, the implementation of the proposed solution leads to fast vertical handover, attaining times up to 46% lower than the maximum allowed handover duration.}

OSN constitute a breeding ground for the spread of several risks and threats to privacy and security that affect participation and quality of life in smart cities. Although the aspects of privacy and security, and individuals' behavior in social networking are important for the successful development of smart cities, they have not been adequately discussed. To this end, this study aims to address this issue by revealing the risks, threats and individuals' behavior on OSN as an attempt to enhance privacy and security, and boost community's engagement in smart cities. Furthermore, a novel model which outlines the relationships between privacy and security threats, along with some effective countermeasures for the protection of OSN users in smart cities are proposed.}

Due to the high frequency noise and complicated relationships in water demand series, forecasting the urban water demand is not an easy task. In order to improve the model’s abilities in handling the complex patterns and catching the peaks in time series, we propose a hybrid long short-term memory model combining with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and principal component analysis (PCA) pre-processing techniques for water demand forecasting, i.e., DWT-PCA-LSTM. First, the outliers of water demand series are identified and smoothed by 3σ criterion and weighted average method, respectively. Then, the noise component of water demand series is eliminated by DWT method and the principal components (PCs) among influencing factors of water demand are selected by PCA method. In addition, two LSTM networks are built to yield the daily urban water demand predictions using the results of DWT and PCA techniques. At last, the superiorities of the proposed model are demonstrated by comparing with the other benchmark predictive models. The water demand from 2016 to 2020 of a waterworks located in Suzhou, China is used for the experiment. The predictive performance of the experiments are evaluated by the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute percentage errors of peaks (pMAPE), explain variance score (EVS) and correlation coefficient (R). The results show that the DWT-PCA-LSTM model outperforms the other models and has satisfactory performance both in catching the peaks and the average prediction accuracy.}

New systems try to improve the experiences citizens in Smart Cities platforms, because many of these government platforms are not user-friendly and their quality, in terms of UX, are not up to the task. To solve this problem, both in the interface design and UX, the solution proposed in this article is the application of Adaptive Interface Ecosystems (AIE), a new concept that can be applied to existing interfaces. The advantage of using AIE on developed and in operation interfaces is that it is not necessary to redesign the interface, but rather they will be adjusted (adapting over time) to each user’s own way of using and monitoring it. The AIEs give the possibility of perfecting the initial modeling of an interface, collecting and analyzing the segmented data of citizens’ interactions. The proposed model has been evaluated by expert users in a real scenario and compared with other existing software with similar features.}

In this paper, we analyzed the processing center’s economic indexes and optimized the dynamic transportation network assignment based on continuous big IoT input database, and a high performance computing model is proposed for the dynamic traffic planning. Specifically, while the previous methods exploited the geographical information system (GIS) or K-means separately, the proposed transportation planning is based on the real-time IoT and GIS data, which is processed by DBN and K-means to make the final solution close to the practice and meet the requirements of high performance computing and economic cost. which is regarded as the key target index. Moreover, considering the large data characteristic of real-time online stream, the deep belief network (DBN) model is built to preprocess the data to improve the clustering effect of the K-means. This study works on the example case of hotel service centers problem in Tianjin to evaluate the optimal dynamic traffic network planning result. The experiment test has proved that based on the performance of super high computing, the model is precisely helpful for the optimal planning of traffic network under real time mass data situation and low cost, and promoting the construction and development of the smart city.}

Recently, researches using machine learning-based techniques for Android malware detection increased rapidly. Nevertheless, most of the appeared approaches have to perform feature analysis and selection, so-called feature engineering, which is time-consuming and relies on artificial experience. To solve the inefficiency problem of feature engineering, we propose TC-Droid, an automatic framework for Android malware detection based on text classification method. The core idea of TC-Droid is derived from the field of text classification. TC-Droid feeds on the text sequence of APPs analysis reports generated by AndroPyTool, applies a convolutional neural network (CNN) to explore significant information (or knowledge) under original report text, instead of manual feature engineering. In an evaluation with different number of real-world samples, TC-Droid outperforms state-of-the-art model (Drebin) and several classic models (NB, LR, KNN, RF) as well. With multiple experimental settings and corresponding comparisons, TC-Droid achieves effective and flexible performance in Android malware detection task.}

The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness.

abstract = {This research work adopts the idea of Internet of Things (IoT) for constructing a green wireless sensor network (WSN) for improving sensor based communication in future smart cities. To achieve green IoT implementation, it is important to take necessary measures to prevent energy depletion and promote energy efficiency techniques. Clustering can extend the lifetime of such networks and its efficiency depends on the selection of quality clustering schemes. To balance the energy consumption for maximizing the network lifetime, this paper proposes an Improved-Adaptive Ranking based Energy-efficient Opportunistic Routing protocol (I-AREOR), based on regional density, relative distance, and residual energy. Importantly, the first node death (FND), half node death (HND), and last node death (LND) are the major challenges for improving the energy efficiency. Therefore, the proposed approach provides a solution to extend the time of FND by considering the regional density, relative distance, and residual energy of the sensor nodes. I-AREOR protocol considers the energy parameters based on dynamic threshold for each round. The demonstrated results show that the I-AREOR clustering technique shows more efficiency in maximizing the network lifetime as compared to the existing algorithms.}

Repositioning democratic values of citizens’ choices in these complex ecosystems has turned out to be imperative in an era of social media filter bubbles, fake news and opportunities for manipulating electoral results with such means. This paper introduces a new paradigm of augmented democracy that promises actively engaging citizens in a more informed decision-making augmented into public urban space. The proposed concept is inspired by a digital revive of the Ancient Agora of Athens, an arena of public discourse, a Polis where citizens assemble to actively deliberate and collectively decide about public matters. The core contribution of the proposed paradigm is the concept of proving witness presence: making decision-making subject of providing secure evidence and testifying for choices made in the physical space. This paper shows how the challenge of proving witness presence can be tackled with blockchain consensus to empower citizens’ trust and overcome security vulnerabilities of GPS localization. Moreover, a novel platform for collective decision-making and crowd-sensing in urban space is introduced: Smart Agora. It is shown how real-time collective measurements over citizens’ choices can be made in a fully decentralized and privacy-preserving way. Witness presence is tested by deploying a decentralized system for crowd-sensing the sustainable use of transport means. Furthermore, witness presence of cycling risk is validated using official accident data from public authorities, which are compared against wisdom of the crowd. The paramount role of dynamic consensus, self-governance and ethically aligned artificial intelligence in the augmented democracy paradigm is outlined.}

In this paper, we present a mobile edge-based collaborative solution against identity theft over social platforms by taking advantage of the convergence of social, wireless, and mobile networks in the 5G Era. The collaborative framework delegates detection of a potential identity theft to other smart users who are the connections of the potential victim over a social platform. The collaborating smart users are not involved in semantic analysis but are assigned a subset of the contextual features of the smart user under review. We present thorough performance evaluation by using real social platform data in simulations. The numerical results show that collaboration among smart users can reveal anomalous behavior on the social accounts of other participants with a success ratio at the order of >90%. Furthermore, we show that false positive (FP) decisions can be mitigated while false negatives, which are less severe than FPs, can be reduced down to the order of ≤3%.}

Accurate urban hotspots spatiotemporal prediction can improve urban planning, scheduling and, security capability, reduce resource consumption. Existing deep spatiotemporal prediction methods mainly utilize geographic grid based image, some given network structure or some additional data to capture spatiotemporal dynamic. However, we observed that mining some latent self-semantics from raw data and fusing them with geospatial based grid images can also improve the performance of spatiotemporal predictions. In this paper, we propose Geographic-Semantic Ensemble Neural Network (GSEN), a novel deep learning approach to stack geographical prediction neural network and semantical prediction neutral network. GSEN model integrates the structures of Predictive Recurrent Neural Network (PredRNN), Graph Convolutional Predictive Recurrent Neural Network (GC-PredRNN), and Ensemble Layer to capture spatiotemporal dynamics from different views. And this model can also be correlated with some latent high-level dynamics in the real-world without any external data. We evaluate our proposed model on three different domains real-world datasets and the experimental studies demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of GSEN in different urban hotspots spatiotemporal prediction tasks.}

Transport system users equipped with a smartphone with the RCT mobile application on board record data of linear accelerations, speed, and vehicle location, and then, without any intervention, send them to the RCT server database in an aggregated form. The aggregated data are processed in the combined time and location criterion, and the road pavement condition assessment index is estimated for fixed 10 m long measuring sections. The measuring sections correspond to the sections of roads defined in the pavement management systems (PMS) used by municipal road infrastructure administration bodies. Both the research in question and the results obtained by the method proposed for purposes of the road pavement condition assessment were compared with a set of reference data of the road infrastructure administration body which conducted surveys using highly specialised measuring equipment. The results of this comparison, performed using binary classifiers, confirm the potential RCT solution proposed by the author. This solution makes it possible to global monitor the road infrastructure condition on a continuous basis via numerous users of the transport system, which guarantees that such an assessment is kept up to date.}

The user has nothing to do but normally approach a controlled entry: authentication is automatically triggered by ambient elements (beacons). This transparent protocol entails user awareness of the authentication since the user has to install a suitable app, therefore it does not cause any covert privacy violation. In addition, it allows avoiding any explicit, possibly cumbersome authentication procedure. Last but not least, the use of a sensor directly embedded in everyday users’ equipment supports an efficient approach without the need for further hardware.}

It is significantly vital to capture and analyze the data from various resources in smart cities. For instance, the real-time air pollution data are remarkably important in controlling air pollution for urban sustainability and protecting humans against the air pollution damages. However, in reality, the average construction investment and maintenance costs in the air pollution stations are too high. This paper intends to investigate whether and how we can measure air pollution using cost effective means and without using the expensive pollution sensors and facilities. In order to realize such a goal, a predictive model for particulate matter prediction was developed. The proposed model consists of multiple components to integrate heterogeneous multiple sources of urban data and predict the particulate matter based on transfer learning perspective in which neural network and regression was leveraged as the core of the prediction. The results of the particulate matter prediction exposed that while these data sources are capable of proper prediction of the particulate matter, they can also yield better results over the models, which were based only on the features of the air pollution sensors. This work provides an opportunity for evaluation of the model with the urban data from the city of Aarhus, in Denmark, and comparison of the model performance against various specified baselines. The superiority of the model over the baselines shows the practicality of the model.}

abstract = {Similar to a fingerprint search system, face recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects or finding missing persons. Face recognition technology lets the police detect a suspect’s face and compare it with image databases of known criminals and provides investigators with a match list of the most similar faces. Face recognition is a highly efficient and accurate tool in investigation processes. However, in some sensitive scenarios covert methods are required for the detection of suspects or missing persons without risking the lives of police. With the availability of the nano devices such as Raspberry Pi, law enforcement agencies such as police can be equipped with a concealed and secure face recognition system. In this paper, a Raspberry Pi and cloud assisted face recognition framework is proposed. A small-sized portable wireless camera is mounted on a police officer’s uniform to capture a video stream, which is passed to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition. The proposed method uses Bag of Words for extraction of oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF points from the detected face, followed by support vector machine for identification of suspects. Raspberry Pi has limited resources such as storage space, memory, and processing power, and therefore the proposed classifier is stored and trained on the cloud. The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi 3 model B in Python 2.7 and is tested on various standard datasets. Experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed method in accurate detection of faces compared to state-of-the-art face detection and recognition methods, and verify its effectiveness for enhancing law-enforcement services in smart cities.}

Present research on IoT mainly focus on the processing of scalar sensor data events and barely considers the challenges posed by multimedia based events. In this paper, we systematically review the existing solutions available for the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) by analyzing sensing, networking, service, and application-level services provided by IoT. We present state-of-the-art event-based middleware methods and their suitability for multimedia event processing methods. We observe that existing IoT event-based middleware solutions focus on structured (scalar) events and possess only domain-specific characteristics for unstructured (multimedia) events. A case study for object detection is also presented to demonstrate the requirements associated with the processing of multimedia events within smart cities, even with common image recognition based applications. In order to validate the existing issues in the detection of objects, we also presented an evaluation of object detection models using existing datasets. At the end of each section, we shed light on trends, gaps, and possible solutions based on our analysis, experiments, and review of the existing research. Finally, we summarize the challenges and future research directions for the generalized multimedia event processing (by taking detection of each and every object as an example) based on applications using IoMT. Our experiments demonstrate that existing models are very slow to respond to any unseen class, and existing rich datasets do not have a sufficient number of classes to meet the requirements of real-time applications of smart cities. We show that although there is a significantly large technical literature on IoT, and research on IoMT is also quite actively growing, there have not been much research efforts directed towards the processing of multimedia events. As an example, although deep learning techniques have been shown to achieve impressive performance in applications like image recognition, the methods are deficient in detecting new (previously unseen) objects for multimedia based applications in smart cities. In light of these facts, it becomes imperative to conduct research on bringing together the abilities of event-based middleware for IoMT, and low response-time based online training and adaptation techniques.}
