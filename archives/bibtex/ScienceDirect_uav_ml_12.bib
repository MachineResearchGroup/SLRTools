abstract = {Many potential applications of adaptive control, such as adaptive flight control systems, require that the controller have high performance, stability guarantees, and robustness to time delays. These requirements typically lead to engineering trade-offs, such as a tradeoff between performance and robustness. In this paper, a new Time Delay Resistant (TDR) adaptive control framework is proposed using a combination of several modifications to the typical direct model reference adaptive control (MRAC) approach. The benefits of the TDR approach are explored with a simulation of the longitudinal dynamics of a fixed-wing aircraft. Flight tests of a 4 rotor mini-UAV were also performed using a subset of the TDR adaptive control features.}

abstract = {The spectral-spatial classification of high spatial resolution RGB images obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for detection of tomatoes in the image is presented. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the image. Spectral clustering was carried out using K-means, expectation maximisation (EM) and self-organising map (SOM) algorithms to categorise the pixels into two groups i.e. tomatoes and non-tomatoes. Due to resemblance in spectral intensities, some of the non-tomato pixels were grouped into the tomato group and in order to remove them, spatial segmentation was performed on the image. Spatial segmentation was carried out using morphological operations and by setting thresholds for geometrical properties. The number of pixels grouped in the tomato cluster is different for each clustering method. EM doesn't pick up the land patches as tomato pixels. As a result, the size of the tomatoes picked up is different than K-means and SOM. Since threshold values chosen for carrying out spatial segmentation are shape and size dependent, different threshold values are applied to different methods of clustering. A synthetic image of 12 × 12 pixels with different labels is created to illustrate the effect of each method used for spatial segmentation on the clustered image. Two representative UAV images captured at different heights from the ground were used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Results and comparison of performance parameters of different spectral-spatial classification methods were presented. It is observed that EM performed better than K-means and SOM.}

In this study, we constructed 39 models to estimate the forage P of alpine grassland in the east of Tibetan Plateau based on hyperspectral remote sensing and multiple factors (topography, soil, vegetation and meteorology) using a machine learning algorithm. The results show that (1) first derivative (FD) and continuum removal (CR) spectra can retrieve more feature bands that are mainly located in the near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions than log transformed (Log (1/R)) and original (OR) spectra for the forage P estimation; (2) in terms of the model precision, the combination of important bands (IBs) and important factors (longitude and monthly mean temperature) increase the accuracy of forage P estimation as compared with the models that used IBs alone; and (3) considering the precision, stability and simplicity of the model comprehensively, the FD-IBs + support vector machine (SVM) model is the optimum forage P inversion model, which presents coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 0.67 and 0.0472%, respectively, and standard deviations (SDs) of 0.2386 and 0.0050%, respectively. This model can account for 88% of the variation of forage P in alpine grassland. This study demonstrates the importance of using a multi-factor modeling approach and spectral transformation techniques for estimating the forage P of grasslands and provides a scientific basis for the reasonable use and management of alpine grassland resources.}

The aerial images are obtained with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), used to analyze “where and how” changes happened between pairs of images at different times. Even that aerial images could conveniently provide real time detailed information for land cover analysis, there still exist two challenging obstacles for coping with the change detection issue on aerial images. The one is that the paired aerial images captured at different times are roughly aligned due to the fact that the camera is mounted on a moving platform like UAVs. The other one is that season changes, light changes, and noise disturbance frequently happen, and they are useless or even impeditive in real applications. To conquer the problems, we propose a change detection networks named dual regions of interest networks to locate semantic change with object level, which could be easier coping with the above-mentioned compared with pixel-based methods. Moreover, we also introduce a pipeline to create a “Aerial change detection dataset” for the research of the change detection issues of aerial images analysis. Our evaluations on this benchmark dataset, “CDnet 2014 dataset”, and “AICD 2012 dataset” demonstrate the good detection and localization performance.}

abstract = {The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are commonly used to understand the microstructure of the concrete. With the advancements in the field of computer vision, many researchers have adopted the image processing technique for the microstructure analysis. Most of the previous methods are not adaptable, non-reproducible, semi-automated, and most importantly all these methods are highly influenced by image magnification. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, this paper presents a machine learning based image segmentation method for microstructure analysis and degree of hydration measurement using SEM images. In addition, the authors looked into the impact of magnification of SEM images on the model accuracy and classifier training for the degree of hydration measurement considering two scenarios. First, the image segmentation was performed using a classifier of specific magnification, and then a common classifier is trained using the image of different magnification. The results show that the Random Forest classifier algorithm is suitable for microstructure analysis using SEM images. Through the statistical analysis, it has been proved that there is no significant effect of magnification on model training and accuracy for the degree of hydration measurement. So, a single classifier can be used to process the images of different magnification of a specimen which reduces the effort of training and computational time. The proposed method can generate highly accurate and reliable results in a shorter time and lower cost. Moreover, the findings in this research can be useful for researchers to determine the optimum magnification required for the microstructure analysis.}

abstract = {Building detection from aerial images has many applications in fields like urban planning, real-estate management, and disaster relief. In the last two decades, a large variety of methods on automatic building detection have been proposed in the remote sensing literature. Many of these approaches make use of local features to classify each pixel or segment to an object label, therefore involving an extra step to fuse pixelwise decisions. This paper presents a generic framework that exploits recent advances in image segmentation and region descriptors extraction for the automatic and accurate detection of buildings on aerial orthophotos. The proposed solution is supervised in the sense that appearances of buildings are learnt from examples. For the first time in the context of building detection, we use the matrix covariance descriptor, which proves to be very informative and compact. Moreover, we introduce a principled evaluation that allows selecting the best pair segmentation algorithm-region descriptor for the task of building detection. Finally, we provide a performance evaluation at pixel level using different classifiers. This evaluation is conducted over 200 buildings using different segmentation algorithms and descriptors. The performance analysis quantifies the quality of both the image segmentation and the descriptor used. The proposed approach presents several advantages in terms of scalability, suitability and simplicity with respect to the existing methods. Furthermore, the proposed scheme (detection chain and evaluation) can be deployed for detecting multiple object categories that are present in images and can be used by intelligent systems requiring scene perception and parsing such as intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle navigation and automatic 3D city modeling.}

Then a power consumption model of UAV is established based on predetermined flight mission of UAV using aerodynamics and momentum theory, which estimates power consumption of UAV under different operational conditions. Its calculation results can be directly used in battery state-space model as its input, while its model parameters are simultaneously updated by online measurements of consumed power. Finally, a Particle Filter (PF) approach with Adam optimization algorithm is developed to estimate SOE and predict EOD time on-line, and better prediction results compared to conventional PF are achieved. Real experiments on UAV verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Within this challenging context, the paper proposes a framework for jamming detection in drone networks, relying on a distributed approach based on supervised machine learning techniques, namely, Multi-layer Perceptrons and Decision Trees. Given a reference data packet trace set, our framework computes the features of some predefined metrics, such as throughput, PDR and RSSI, which vary during a jamming attack, and that can therefore be used to detect it. We evaluate our framework using datasets from publicly available standardized jamming attack scenarios with IEEE 802.11p radio data, and via ns3-based simulation datasets from networks of drones using WiFi. We show that the performance of the classifiers improves as the sampling time of the packets decreases. We also show that the Multi-layer Perceptron can be effectively generalized to achieve jamming detection accuracy superior to that of Decision Trees even when applied to communication scenarios for which it has not been specifically trained. Our proposed framework reaches a satisfactory accuracy level of 96%, while requiring low computational and hardware capabilities, thus proving to be suitable for resource-constrained drone networks.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel optimization technique for an efficient multi-fidelity model building approach to reduce computational costs for handling aerodynamic shape optimization based on high-fidelity simulation models. The wing aerodynamic shape optimization problem is solved by dividing optimization into three steps—modeling 3D (high-fidelity) and 2D (low-fidelity) models, building global meta-models from prominent instead of all variables, and determining robust optimizing shape associated with tuning local meta-models. The adaptive robust design optimization aims to modify the shape optimization process. The sufficient infilling strategy—known as adaptive uniform infilling strategy—determines search space dimensions based on the last optimization results or initial point. Following this, 3D model simulations are used to tune local meta-models. Finally, the global optimization gradient-based method—Adaptive Filter Sequential Quadratic Programing (AFSQP) is utilized to search the neighborhood for a probable optimum point. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated by applying it, along with conventional optimization approach-based meta-models, to a Blended Wing Body (BWB) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The drag coefficient is defined as the objective function, which is subjected to minimum lift coefficient bounds and stability constraints. The simulation results indicate improvement in meta-model accuracy and reduction in computational time of the method introduced in this paper.}

The prioritization of maintenance works is required to preserve the efficiency and functionality of road infrastructure. To overcome the subjectivity of traditional visual inspections for road pavement condition assessment, advanced (semi-)automatic approaches have been emerging. Still, the quantitative and objective description of damage typology and extent, and its severity classification remain the major issues for the assessment of landslide impacts on transportation routes. The objective of this work is to provide a ready-to-use tool for semi-automatic damage assessment of asphalt-paved roads in landslide-affected areas to support risk analysis and planning of mitigation measures. The use of 3D models and 2D images as reconstructed from UAV-based photogrammetry is investigated to detect longitudinal and transverse cracks on the road pavement and assess their severity in landslide areas, as a rapid, systematic, objective and less laborious alternative to traditional field surveys. A semi-automatic procedure is proposed to i) select asphalt-paved roads exposed to landslides, ii) rapidly map distresses on selected road sections, iii) quantitatively detect and describe longitudinal and transverse cracks, and iv) classify their severity according to the International Roughness Index (IRI). The procedure is applied to the Province of Como (northern Italy), where three test sites are selected for detailed analyses. The results indicate that the proposed procedure is useful for road management purposes at different levels of details by providing four outputs: i) a road damage hotspot map to detect deformations, ii) a multi-criteria binary classifier to detect pavement damage, iii) an IRI-based criterion to rate the pavement quality, and iv) a road damage severity map.}

Considering the three main aspects of an inspection UAS; the camera, the flight controller, and the motors, designing and developing an inspection UAS can be inexpensive in comparison to the COTS UASs. Application based designing can reduce costs immensely, where specific requirements are set out to design the UAS. Setting out the criteria for image quality and size for inspection purposes allows a design iteration to happen. COTS UAS, for example, using high quality cameras that are primarily used in cinematography, but has also been used for industrial applications, is costly and unjustified here. In this paper the weight, current draw and image quality requirements have been analysed, to select components that are suitable for the purpose while being cost effective. This results in a low cost, application based UAS design. As the system is primarily for inspections in preventive maintenance for aircraft, photography-based inspection is the main focus.}

Results showed that most diversity indexes had a higher correlation with the mean of spectral vegetation indexes (DVI, RVI, NDVI, SAVI, and MSAVI). The diversity indexes (C_SP and C_SW) constructed by relative coverage had a better overall correlation with spectral indexes. Interestingly, opposite correlations were found between Tamarix chinensis and Phragmites australis plots. We further gave a deep insight into the interspecific associations in Phragmites australis and Tamarix chinensis plots with the variance ratio (VR) method. It was found that plant species in Tamarix chinensis plot showed positive association (VR > 1), with a VR value of 1.095. Plant species in Phragmites australis plot had a negative association (VR < 1), with a VR value of 0.983. In Phragmites australis plot, C_SP and C_SW showed a significant decreasing trend (r2 of 0.36 and 0.33 respectively, and P values less than 0.001) with the increase of Phragmites australis coverage. Moreover, the effect of spatial resolution was not significant on plant diversity estimation. Correlations between remote sensing indexes and diversity indexes were improved with the quadrat size changing from 2 m × 2 m to 4 m × 4 m. These findings demonstrate promising approaches for remote sensing of wetland plant diversity and indicate that the type of wetland plant community determines the relationship between diversity index and spectral index.}

abstract = {Unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), owing to its potential to perform dangerous, repetitive tasks in remote and hazardous, is very promising for the technological leadership of the nation and essential for improving the security of society. A novel hybrid method for the globally optimal path planning of UCAV is proposed in this paper, which is based on an artificial neural network (ANN) trained by imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA). The comparative experimental results with artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm show that our proposed approach can not only reduce the uncertainty of the evolutionary computation caused by the probability model, but also avoid falling into local point with much quicker speed.}

abstract = {Existing public safety networks (PSNs) are not designed to cope with disasters such as terrorist attacks, consequently leading to long delays and intolerable response times. First responders’ life threats when accessing the attacked zone are more severe in comparison to other disasters and the accuracy of basic information such as the number of terrorists, the number of trapped people, their locations and identity, etc., is vital to the reduction of the response time. Recent technologies for PSNs are designed to manage natural disaster scenarios; these are not best suited for situations like terrorist attacks because a proper communication infrastructure is required for operating most of the classical PSNs. This serious concern makes it highly desirable to develop reliable and adaptive pervasive public safety communication technologies to counter such a kind of emergency situation. Device-to-device (D2D) communication can be a vital paradigm to design PSNs that are fit for dealing with terrorist attacks thanks to long-term evolution (LTE)-sidelink, which could allow the devices that people carry with themselves in the attacked zone to communicate directly. To our best knowledge, this is the first survey paper on public safety communication in the context of terrorist attacks. We discuss PSN scenarios, architectures, 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standards, and recent or ongoing related projects. We briefly describe a system architecture for disseminating the critical information, and we provide an extensive literature review of the technologies that could have a significant impact in public safety scenarios especially in terrorist attacks, such as beamforming and localization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), LTE sidelink for both centralized (base-station assisted) and decentralized (without base-station) architectures, multi-hop D2D routing for PSN, and jamming and anti-jamming in mobile networks. Furthermore, we also cover the channel models available in the literature to evaluate the performance of D2D communication in different contexts. Finally, we discuss the open challenges when applying these technologies for PSN.}

abstract = {In this paper, the distributed finite-time formation tracking control problem with collision avoidance is investigated for multiple quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) subject to external disturbances. Firstly, two finite-time observers are designed to estimate the external disturbance force and torque without upper bound, respectively. Then, utilizing the precisely observed information deriving from the observers, a novel sliding mode surface-like variable based distributed position formation tracking control strategy and a fast terminal sliding mode based attitude tracking control strategy are proposed, respectively. It achieves that the multiple quadrotor UAVs can track the desired trajectory in a specific formation configuration within the safe distance and avoid dynamic obstacles. Meanwhile, the rapid attitude synchronization and tracking is also achieved. The entire multiple UAVs distributed formation tracking closed-loop control system are proved to be globally fast finite-time stable by using Lyapunov-like analysis. Finally, the effective and fine performance of the proposed schemes are demonstrated by a numerical simulation example with a group of quadrotor UAVs.}

Similarly, advancements in computer-vision made it possible to assess structural conditions from a set of digital images. This research introduces a novel inspection technique for detecting subsurface defects that cause heat loss. A combination of Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms and infrared (IR) imaging has been developed for quantifying the severity of subsurface damages inducing energy loss on a scaled building structure. Furthermore, an automated detection algorithm is proposed to segment the contours of the damages. Results of experiments performed using different IR cameras prove that this approach can identify subsurface defects and quantify their dimensions with an error below 5% when compared to the actual size of the damages. The proposed approach can also be easily integrated with unmanned aerial vehicles for remote inspection and damage detection on large-scale systems.}

abstract = {The process of routing in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) is a challenging task in city environments. Finding the shortest end-to-end connected path satisfying delay restriction and minimal overhead is confronted with many constraints and difficulties. Such difficulties are due to the high mobility of vehicles, the frequent path failures, and the various obstructions, which may affect the reliability of the data transmission and routing. Commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or what are commonly referred to as drones can come in handy in dealing with these constraints. In this paper, we study how UAVs operating in ad hoc mode can cooperate with VANET on the ground so as to assist in the routing process and improve the reliability of the data delivery by bridging the communication gap whenever it is possible. In a previous work, we have proposed UVAR – a UAV-Assisted VANETs routing protocol, which improves data routing and connectivity of the vehicles on the ground through the use of UAVs. However, UVAR does not fully exploit UAVs in the sky for data forwarding because it uses UAVs only when the network is poorly dense. In this paper, we propose an extension of this protocol by supporting two different ways of routing data: (i) delivering data packets exclusively on the ground using UVAR-G; and (ii) transmitting data packets in the sky using a reactive routing based on UVAR-S. Simulation results demonstrate that the hybrid communication between vehicles and UAVs is ideally suited for VANETs compared to traditional vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications.}

A Domain-driven approach is developed, in which the domain probabilities are used for captioning the remote sensing images. This approach concentrates on the domain- based information available in the images. A new dataset, called UAVIC dataset is created for images captured using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), which covers wide range of land having multiple terrains and gives a better view of the landscapes.

Another aim of ours is to determine how long these particles stay in the environment (cabinet, room, air and etc.) by calculating the concentration amounts (CA) in different humidity conditions and what type of particle is given to the cabinet. Binarized phase images reconstructed from the recorded holograms were used to find the CA. The CA was calculated by measuring in a time depended manner. In addition, in this study, the behavior of particulate matter in different humidity conditions was also revealed. It has been clearly demonstrated that the residence time in the air varies depending on the structure of each particulate matter and the behavior of the environment in different humidity conditions. Moreover, images were classified by deep learning based on Convolution Neural Network (CCN) algorithm. The CNN algorithm was trained using binarized phase images and the type of substance dispersed in the air was determined with high accuracy (99%). Unlike the traditional digital holography microscopy techniques used to capture a single microsized sample located between two lamellas, this study reveals successful results obtained with high accuracy that nano-sized particles moving freely in the air can be imaged and the type of particulate matter can be detected. It is thought that the proposed system for the early detection of particles that causes various infectious diseases will lead to future studies in terms of both non-contact and real-time imaging.}

Based on the hierarchical control principle, the aforesaid model is first subdivided into two subsystems, i.e., a fully-actuated subsystem and an under-actuated subsystem. In other words, the under-actuated subsystem is further transformed into a regular form whereby the under-actuated characteristics are decoupled in terms of control inputs. In the proposed design, the nonlinear drift terms, which certainly varies in full flight, are estimated via functional link neural networks to improve the performance of the controller in full flight. Besides, a variable gain robust exact differentiator (VG-RED) is designed to provide us with estimated flight velocities. It has consequently reduced the noise in system’s velocities and has mapped this controller as a practical one. The finite-time sliding mode enforcement and the states’ convergence are shown, for all flight loops, i.e., forward flight and backward flight, via the Lyapunov approach. All these claims are verified via numerical simulations and experimental implementation of the quadcopter system in a Matlab environment. For a more impressive presentation, the developed simulation results are compared with standard literature.}

Indeed, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can successfully be employed in different applications, such as agriculture, search and rescue missions, surveillance systems, mission-critical services, among others, thanks to some technological and practical advantages: high mobility, capability to extend wireless coverage areas, or ability to reach places inaccessible to humans. Moreover, the employment of drones promisingly improves the performance parameters of different network architectures, e.g., reliability, connectivity, throughput, and delay. Nevertheless, the adoption of networks of drones gives rise to several issues related to the intrinsic unreliability of the wireless medium, the duration of batteries, and the high mobility degree, which may cause frequent topology changes. Also security and privacy issues need to be properly investigated. This explains the very large number of works produced in the recent literature on IoD-related topics. With respect to other surveys on IoD-related topics, the goal of the present work is to categorize the multifaceted aspects of IoD, proposing a classification approach of the IoD environment that develops along two main directions. The IoD is initially introduced according to the possible applications and reference operating scenarios. On top of that, this work discussed with its applicability with a dedicated focus on the economical/social implications that the adoption of drones at scale may have. At a macroscopic level, it follows the structure of the Internet protocol stack, starting from the physical layer and extending to the upper layers, without neglecting cross-layer and optimization approaches. At a finer level, all the most relevant works belonging to each layer of the stack are further classified, according to the different issues that propose a peculiar challenges for each layer, and highlighting the most relevant differences with the other surveys present in literature. To provide a deeper insight, the present work embraces many facets of the IoD, with a thorough examination of privacy and security considerations. Finally, a discussion on the main research challenges and possible future directions is carried out, focusing on both open issues and the most promising technologies that deserve to be further developed in the IoD field.}

However, the target perception capability of machine vision largely depends on illumination, which restricts UAV to move safely in dark environment. Since images acquired by infrared and visible sensors are complementary in most cases, enhancing image qualities in dark environments by fusion of infrared and visible images is a promising solution. By considering the difficulties of image fusion for airborne targets, a Convolutional Sparse Representation (CSR) based infrared and visible airborne targets image fusion algorithm is proposed in this paper for enhancing SAA capability of UAV in dark environments, which contains three parts: image decomposition, image transformation and image reconstruction. A series of registered infrared and visible images containing airborne targets are selected to evaluate the algorithm proposed in this paper. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithm proposed in this paper effectively increases image qualities in dark environments. In the aspects of fusion metrics, the algorithm proposed in this paper can achieve favorable performance against other image fusion algorithms.}

In real world, immediate recovery to the disaster areas is ensured by adapting the unmanned aerial vehicles that enable people to reach the disaster areas immediately. Here specific task in the disaster area can be completed efficiently by working with multi Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) instead of single UAV. Here data communication between the UAV needs to be very reliable to ensure the proper disaster management outcome. It is more complex to provide the required services to the users when there is situation arise to switch between the heterogeneous networks. The QoS-Oriented Distributed routing protocol (QOD) is used in the existing methods to give solution to this problem. The data is transferred between hybrid networks with required QoS. In the existing work, routing is done by considering the QoS consideration thus the efficient and reliable distributed routing is guaranteed. However the existing work lacks from the following issues: It avoids the data transfer through the path in which data transmission is going already to avoid the interference problems which might reduce the throughput rate. Priority of the data transferred from multiple sources are not considered in the previous work and also existing work focused on reducing delay alone as QoS factor. Priority and Interference aware Multipath Routing Protocol (PIMRP) is introduced to rectify this issue in the proposed method. In this method, interference aware and priority routing is ensured by introducing the following research methods. Here, Multipath interference based routing method is used allow transmission of data from multiple path that resides within interference range with guaranteed interference avoidance and increased throughput. Here route path nodes are selected with multiple objectives such as delay, bandwidth, and energy consumption. To provide more preference to the prioritized data transmission nodes with more resource availability is provided to the prioritized data packets which are tiny segmented. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using NS2 simulation tool. The simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed method.}

Such slight modifications lead to the following two attractive features: 1) both of two schemes can improve the approximation accuracy of the RBFNN for the dynamics with significant bias, and then enhance the control performance correspondingly; 2) when the inputs deviate from the approximation domain of the RBFNN because of the large payloads, the controller with the local bias or global bias degrades to the PID controller to push the states back. It improves the robustness of the adaptive RBFNN controller further. We also propose a simpler controller structure that reduces the dimension of the input vectors from 4n to 3n, where n is the degree of freedom of the manipulator. It exponentially decreases the computation cost of the RBFNNs. Uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two schemes.}

abstract = {In this paper, a neural network (NN) based event trigger control problem of electromagnetic active suspension system is solved. Due to the limitation of vehicle communication resources, the control schemes utilizing fixed threshold and relative threshold are presented respectively to reduce the communication burden between actuator and controller. Firstly, the fixed threshold-based trigger mechanism is developed while the algebraic loop problem is addressed using the special characteristics of NN basis function. Second, to further avoid a large measurement error, the time-varying threshold-based event trigger approach is built. The designed event trigger controllers can make the vertical displacement and speed of the electromagnetic suspension system near zero. In the design process, the radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are employed to approximate unknown terms. Then, all signals in the resulted system are proved to be bounded, and the Zeno behavior is avoided successfully. Finally, the feasibility and rationality of the two methods are proved by the simulation analysis base on the electromagnetic suspension system.}

The unsupervised nature of the presented algorithm eliminates the need for labelled training data. The problem is cast as a two class clustering problem (water and non-water), while clustering is done on deep features obtained by a pre-trained CNN. After initial clusters have been identified, representative samples from each cluster are chosen by the unsupervised curriculum learning algorithm for fine-tuning the feature extractor. The stated process is repeated iteratively until convergence. Three datasets have been used to evaluate the approach and show its effectiveness on varying scales: (i) SAT-6 dataset comprising high resolution aircraft images, (ii) Sentinel-2 of EuroSAT, comprising remote sensing images with low resolution, and (iii) PakSAT, a new dataset we created for this study. PakSAT is the first Pakistani Sentinel-2 dataset designed to classify water bodies of Pakistan. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the progressive learning behaviour of UCL and reported promising results of water classification on all three datasets. The obtained accuracies outperform the supervised methods in domain adaptation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

Though, the research in FBL is still in early stage due to the fact that 5G requires high reliability of almost 99.9999% with latency of less than 1 ms, simultaneously. The FBL has been worked upon to reduce latency such that Shannon's capacity expression is no longer applicable. The 5G claims to provide connectivity everywhere, hence to increase the coverage to remote places Unmanned Ariel Vehicle (UAV) has gained attention due to its low cost, mobility, and air time. In this paper, a scenario where a UAV relays data from a base station (BS) to remote users (RU), which are otherwise not in direct contact, is analyzed. All the communications among BS, UAV, and RU's are considered to be non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based with Finite blocklength (FBL). An exact closed form expression for end-to-end average block error rate (BLER) is derived for above mentioned scenario and verified by extensive simulations. In addition, an asymptotic BLER for remote users at high transmission Signal to noise ratio is also derived. Further, the BLER is minimized to jointly optimize the power allocation coefficients, position of UAV and Blocklength for the communication system. The effects of different parameters on average BLER, position, and power are studied and the coverage provided by UAV for given probability of error is presented.}

Currently, non-destructive methods for measuring AGB heavily depend on tools such as Remote Sensing and LiDAR, which is subject to specialized knowledge and high-cost. Low-cost solutions appear therefore to be a necessary supplement. In this study, an easy-to-use AGB estimation method for winter wheat at early growth stages was proposed by using digital images captured under field conditions and Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Using canopy images as input, the DCNN was trained to learn the relationship between the canopy and the corresponding AGB. To compare the results of the DCNN, conventionally adopted methods for estimating AGB in conjunction with some color and texture feature extraction techniques were used. Results showed strong correlations could be observed between the actual measurements of AGB to those estimated by the DCNN, with high coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.808) and low Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE = 0.8913 kg/plot, NRMSE = 24.95%). Factors may influence the accuracy of the DCNN were evaluated. Results showed selecting suitable values of these factors for the DCNN was the guarantee to accurate estimation results. Plant density was proved to be an influence of factor to all the estimation methods based on digital images. The performances of all the methods were influenced to varying degrees while the DCNN achieved the best robustness, indicating the DCNN with RGB images could be an efficient and robust tool for estimating AGB of winter wheat at early growth stages.}

High-density photoreceptors and lateral inhibition mechanisms have inspired a novel biologic computational method based on structure and properties in eagle eyes as proposed for change detection. We call this method “STabCD,” which ensures spatiotemporal distribution consistency to achieve foreground acquisition, noise reduction, and background adaptability. Therefore, our proposed model responds strongly to object information and suppresses noise and wave textures. Then, we present a cloning method to simulate water scenes and collect a new synthetic dataset (called “Synthetic Boat Sequence”) for UAV vision research. Besides, we utilize synthetic datasets and corresponding real datasets to conduct change detection experiments. The experimental results indicate that: 1) the STabCD model achieves the best results in real or synthetic water landing scenes; and 2) change detection models for UAV can be quantitatively analyzed and tested under challenging synthetic scenarios.}

In this paper, a visual localisation approach is proposed to eliminate the requirement of image-based reconstruction of the indoor environment by using a 3D indoor model. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is fine-tuned using synthetic images obtained from the 3D indoor model to regress the camera pose.

Moreover, the sufficient conditions on the proposed trajectory for fulfillment of UAV constraints are derived. In the next step, ambient disturbances like wind gust are considered for UAV heading rate computation which are mitigated by employment of the well known sliding mode controller.

First, the attitude dynamics model of the spacecraft is presented, and the error dynamics model with input saturation is derived. Second, a control scheme using sliding mode control (SMC) and backstepping technique is proposed to guarantee the robustness against the dynamics uncertainty and deal with the effect of input saturation. Under this framework, a neural network (NN) approximator is developed to online estimate the dynamics uncertainty of the spacecraft. Adaptive laws are designed to update the NN weight and estimate the unknown bound of approximation error. The control law does not require the prior knowledge about the bounds on the uncertainty and can provide complete compensation for the uncertainty. Moreover, a Lyapunov-based approach is employed to prove the global stability of the closed-loop system and the asymptotical convergence of the attitude tracking errors. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controllers. Contrasting simulation results indicate that the neural network backstepping sliding mode controller reduces the chattering effectively and has better performance against the sliding mode controller.}

By taking advantages of deep learning in object detection, a semantic simultaneous localization and mapping framework named Dynamic-SLAM is proposed, in order to solve the problem of SLAM in dynamic environment. First, based on the convolutional neural network, an SSD object detector which combines prior knowledge is constructed to detect dynamic objects in the newly detection thread at semantic level. Then, in view of low recall rate of the existing SSD object detection network, a missed detection compensation algorithm based on the speed invariance in adjacent frames is proposed, which greatly improves the recall rate of detection. Finally, a feature-based visual SLAM system is constructed, which processes the feature points of dynamic objects through a selective tracking algorithm in the tracking thread, to significantly reduce the error of pose estimation caused by incorrect matching. The recall rate of the system is increased from 82.3% to 99.8% compared with the original SSD network. Several experiments show that the localization accuracy of Dynamic-SLAM is higher than the state-of-the-art systems. The system successfully localizes and constructs an accurate environmental map in real-world dynamic environment by using a mobile robot. In sum, our experimental demonstrations verify that Dynamic-SLAM shows improved accuracy and robustness in robot localization and mapping comparing to the state-of-the-art SLAM system in dynamic environment.}

Unfortunately, the DSSS data rate is limited by four users as a maximum due to the extensive multipath arrivals. This paper proposes a new scheme for the AUV communication systems called, deep learning coded index modulation-spread spectrum (DL-CIM-SS), to overcome the increasing data rate restriction of limited users number. The proposed DL-CIM-SS transmits the majority of information bits via the index of spreading code instead of transmitting all information bits physical. That doesn't only harvest more energy efficiency as the majority of information bits are not transmitted physically anymore, but also provide almost perfect detection at the receiver end. To further save the AUV energy, a pre-processing stage is added before feeding the received signal into the DL-based detector; the DL-based detector becomes environment-independent and no more training will be required during the online deployment. The proposed DL-CIM-SS performance is evaluated in this paper over simulation and measured underwater acoustic channels. The simulation results show the ability of the proposed scheme to increase the underwater acoustic data rate with significant energy efficiency improvement and low system bit and symbol error rate.}

Secondly, due to the collision or obstacle avoidance terms within the formation controller may result in large separation distance among agents and each agent’s communication distance is limited by its hardware, the collision or obstacle avoidance terms increase the chance of losing connectivity between agents. In order to guarantee the connectivity of the formation, the connectivity maintenance controller is designed with taking the communication topology into account. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the stability of the closed-loop multi-agent systems can be guaranteed. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

This paper offers a design technique of adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) for finite-time stabilization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems with parametric uncertainties. Applying the Lyapunov stability concept and finite-time convergence idea, the recommended control method guarantees that the states of the quad-rotor UAV are converged to the origin with a finite-time convergence rate. Furthermore, an adaptive-tuning scheme is advised to guesstimate the unknown parameters of the quad-rotor UAV at any moment.

abstract = {Recent improvements in communications have led to the proliferation of networked control systems (NCSs). NCSs are used to increase the efficiency and reliability of these systems. However, these connectivities between agents, sensors, and centralized controllers expose NCSs to a range of faults, failures, delays, and cyber-attacks. Detection of intelligent and new types of attacks such as time delay switched (TDS) attacks is a crucial task in the design of NCSs. The injection of the TDS attack to NCSs has the potential to provoke inefficiency or even cause instability in these systems. The TDS or delay signal attack influences the system by introducing a random delay in the process of transmitting and receiving packets. Due to the connectivity between agents, especially in distributed power grids, the injection of a TDS attack on one agent can propagate to others, which can lead to catastrophic consequences. This paper uses a neural networked-based detection algorithm to estimate the TDS attack in real-time. The performance of the proposed TDS attack detection and estimation are evaluated through simulation for two area power systems.}

Supervised machine learning regressions are applied to create trained models from experimental results. The proposed method aims to develop accurate predictive models via dimensional analysis and datasets expansion from in-between randomization. Built models predicted the still performance (η) when replacing PS with another wall-insulating material. We correlated the water-glass temperature (Tw–Tg) and evaporative coefficients (hewg) to the still outputs using the stepwise linear regression (SLR) showing minimum statistical errors (R2≈1) and RMSE<0.016. A good agreement between theoretical, numerical, and experimental results is observed; while decreasing feed rates boosts evaporation/condensation. The still achieved a maximum η = 18.33% corresponding to F = 30 mL/day, Tw–Tg = 4.6 °C, hewg = 21.11 W/m2°C, and radiative water-glass coefficient (qrwg) = 0.188 W/m2 at 15:00 time. Hourly-measured still outputs fitted against NASA insolation followed similar patterns confirming the successful operation. Polyurethane (PU) and Silica are found to be promising wall-insulating candidates for maximizing the still output owing to their low kins. This work paves the way towards retaining the still absorbed radiation via thin-film foil-wrapped low-conductive insulators.}

So far, the usage of repeat photographs for quantitative analyses is limited to approaches based on manual classification. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic detection and classification of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. We also tested if the classification results based on the automatic approach can be used for quantifying changes in woody vegetation cover between image pairs. The CNN was trained with 50 × 50 pixel tiles of woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation. We then tested the classifier on 17 pairs of repeat photographs to assess the model performance on unseen data. Results show that the CNN performed well in differentiating woody vegetation from non-woody vegetation (accuracy = 87.7%), but accuracy varied strongly between individual images. The very similar appearance of woody vegetation and herbaceous species in photographs made this a much more challenging task compared to the classification of vegetation as a single class (accuracy = 95.2%). In this regard, image quality was identified as one important factor influencing classification accuracy. Although the automatic classification provided good individual results on most of the 34 test photographs, change statistics based on the automatic approach deviated from actual changes. Nevertheless, the automatic approach was capable of identifying clear trends in increasing or decreasing woody vegetation in repeat photographs. Generally, the use of repeat photography in landscape monitoring represents a significant added value to other quantitative data retrieved from remote sensing and field measurements. Moreover, these photographs are able to raise awareness on landscape change among policy makers and public as well as they provide clear feedback on the effects of land management.}

A load monitoring system enables one to recover the actual load spectra of the component and track its aging continuously. However, complex loading can be difficult to be identified, as for complex aerodynamic loads due to operational maneuvers in aeronautical structures, especially when environmental conditions vary. This work proposes a method for recovering the full strain and displacement fields in the entire structure, leveraging on the Calibration Matrix approach and an equivalent set of lumped forces, including the thermal variation among the unknown parameters. A least-squares minimization of an error functional defined as a comparison between measured and numerical strain is exploited for load and temperature reconstruction, automatically compensating thermal effects on the strain measurements without requiring any training data sets. By assuming a linear relationship between strain and the unknowns through a calibration matrix, the minimization can be performed analytically offline, resulting in a computationally very efficient algorithm that can be operated in real-time at a reduced computational burden. Though the mathematical formulation is general for any arbitrary component geometry and loading condition, the method is tested with a full-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) undergoing different operational maneuvers, both numerically and with actual flight tests. The results confirm the robustness of the method to real environmental disturbances, correctly reconstructing the strain and displacement fields due to aerodynamic loads through triangular equivalent forces and automatically adapting to different load scenarios and temperature changes.}

To use the high spatial resolution of UAV images, image fusion was carried out through the high-pass filter, wavelet, principal component transformation, BROVEY, IHS, and Gram Schmidt methods. ERGAS, RMSE, and correlation criteria were applied to assess their accuracy. The results represented that the wavelet method with R2, RMSE, and ERGAS 0.91, 12.22 cm, and 2.05 respectively had the highest accuracy in combining these images. Then, images obtained by this method were chosen with a spatial resolution of 20 cm for classification. Different classification methods including unsupervised method, maximum likelihood, minimum distance, fuzzy artmap, perceptron, and tree methods were evaluated. Moreover, six soil classes, Ahmad Aghaei, Akbari, Kalleh Ghoochi, Fandoghi, and a mixing class of Kalleh Ghoochi and Fandoghi were applied, and also three classes of soil, pistachio tree and weeds were extracted from the trees. The results demonstrated that the fuzzy artmap method had the highest accuracy in separating weeds from trees, differentiating various pistachio cultivars with Landsat image and also classification with combined image and had 0.87, 0.79, and 0.87 kappa coefficients respectively. The comparison between pistachio cultivars through Landsat image and the combined image showed that the validation accuracy obtained from harvest has raised by 17% because of the combination of images.

abstract = {Cloud cover is a common and inevitable phenomenon that often hinders the usability of optical remote sensing (RS) image data and further interferes with continuous cartography based on RS image interpretation. In the literature, the off-the-shelf cloud detection methods either require various hand-crafted features or utilize data-driven features using deep networks. Overall, deep networks achieve much better performance than traditional methods using hand-crafted features. However, the current deep networks used for cloud detection depend on massive pixel-level annotation labels, which require a great deal of manual annotation labor. To reduce the labor needed for annotating the pixel-level labels, this paper proposes a weakly supervised deep learning-based cloud detection (WDCD) method using block-level labels indicating only the presence or the absence of cloud in one RS image block. In the training phase, a new global convolutional pooling (GCP) operation is proposed to enhance the ability of the feature map to represent useful information (e.g., spatial variance). In the testing phase, the trained deep networks are modified to generate the cloud activation map (CAM) via the local pooling pruning (LPP) strategy, which prunes the local pooling layers of the deep networks that are trained in the training phase to improve the quality (e.g., spatial resolution) of CAM. One large RS image is cropped into multiple overlapping blocks by a sliding window, and then the CAM of each block is generated by the modified deep networks. Based on the correspondence between the image blocks and CAMs, multiple corresponding CAMs are collected to mosaic the CAM of the large image. By segmenting the CAM using a statistical threshold against a clear-sky surface, the pixel-level cloud mask of the testing image can be obtained. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed WDCD method, we collected a new global dataset, for which the training dataset contains over 200,000 RS image blocks with block-level labels from 622 large GaoFen-1 images from all over the world; the validation dataset contains 5 large GaoFen-1 images with pixel-level annotation labels, and the testing dataset contains 25 large GaoFen-1 and ZiYuan-3 images with pixel-level annotation labels. Even under the extremely weak supervision, our proposed WDCD method could achieve excellent cloud detection performance with an overall accuracy (OA) as high as 96.66%. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our proposed WDCD method obviously outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The collected datasets have been made publicly available online (https://github.com/weichenrs/WDCD).}

This type of “record-offload-process” approach incurs long delays and has serious risks of data loss. Emerging 5G networks enable high-throughput and low-latency network connectivity, allowing UAVs to transmit sensor data to the receiver during the flight. However, it is challenging to meet the network QoS requirements for such “online” data transfer during a flight because the performance of a 5G network may vary significantly due to channel conditions, structural blockage and movement of UAVs. In this paper, we first present a model of this new UAV path planning problem with network QoS constraint, which turns out to be a nonlinear optimization problem. We then transform the problem into two subproblems and derive solutions. We leverage an integrated full-stack simulation framework to study the end-to-end performance of UAV data transfer over a 5G mmWave network and evaluate our proposed solution. The experimental results show that our solution achieves significant reduction of data losses as well as improvement on flight time.}

Firstly, models describing the air-to-ground relationship between ground vehicles and the UAV are built to derive mathematical expressions of radar echo signals. Secondly, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is utilized to analyze micro-Doppler components of the ground wheeled vehicle and the ground tracked vehicle respectively. Thirdly, according to classify requirements, specific signal components are restored by Singular Value Reconstruction (SVR). Seven micro-Doppler features are extracted from reconstructed signals. At last, these features are sent to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Compared with current related methods such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and multi-level wavelet decomposition (MWD), experimental results in different cases illustrate the effectiveness of this method.

Accurate detection and analysis for the landscapes pattern plays key role in understanding the sociocultural milieu and human-natural relations. Current methods perceive their problems.

Remote sensing technique has been successfully applied in the field of heritage protection for its ability in object detection. But these methods are limited by visiting circle, spatial resolution and data richness. Therefore, the scientific methods of landscape pattern detection, documentation and analysis for the traditional village has long been under discussion. By taking Baojiatun castle village as a case study, the present paper aims to detect and analyze spatial pattern of traditional village by the geospatial data from a low altitude UAV-borne remote sensing. A four-leveled hierarchical landscape recognition scheme and the corresponding landscape category regulation were established. Based on the derived data and the established scheme, a three-level classification model was construct by using Object-Oriented Image Analysis method (OBIA) method and machine learning classifiers (Random Forest classifier and SVM classifier). The model was proven to be accurate and stable by ten-fold cross validation, and five major heritage landscape elements of the village were finally extracted. Furthermore, spatial pattern characteristics and distribution differences of targeted landscapes were unveiled based on distance statistics and clustering analysis.

Finally, an automatic milking device is built to perform teat cup attachment experiments in the laboratory environment. Among the 20 groups experiments, all teats are detected correctly, the average refresh time is 0.39 s.

The nonlinearities and uncertainties which are caused by dynamical device, mechanical structure, extreme downhole environment and requirements of complex trajectory design in the actual drilling work increase the difficulties of accurate trajectory tracking. This paper proposes a model-based dual-loop feedback cooperative control method based on interval type-2 fuzzy logic control (IT2FLC) and actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with one-order digital low-pass filters (LPF) for three-dimensional trajectory tracking of RSS. In the proposed RSS trajectory tracking control architecture, an IT2FLC is utilized to deal with system nonlinearities and uncertainties, and an online iterative actor-critic RL controller structured by radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is exploited to eliminate the stick–slip oscillations relying on its approximate properties both in action function (actor) and value function (critic). The two control effects are fused to constitute cooperative controller to realize accurate trajectory tracking of RSS. The effectiveness of our controller is validated by simulations on designed function tests for angle building hole rate and complete downhole trajectory tracking, and by comparisons with other control methods.}

One possible scenario for these sUAV is to use them in a cooperative flights. In this case one UAV finds Points of Interest and the others inspect them based on each UAV's capabilities. This scenario requires that the path planning algorithm is executed by the embedded processors such that the UAVs can collaborate directly. This paper presents a path planning algorithm based on Simulated Annealing for small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The objective of the algorithm is to find flight paths to allow the UAVs to inspect numerous points of interest placed over a region, considering that these points may belong to different kinds and should be inspected by a specific type of UAV. This is considered as a multiple Traveler Salesman Problem, solved by the proposed SA algorithm where the Energy function takes into account the mismatches between POI type and UAV specialty. The algorithm is implemented on a Raspberry Pi and tested using a ArduCopter platform flight simulator, considering two inspector UAVs. The results show that the algorithm is capable of calculating paths matching POI and UAV types with an execution time that is suitable for on-the-fly mission generation.}

abstract = {The recent emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has opened a new horizon in vegetation remote sensing, especially for agricultural applications. However, the benefits of UAV centimeter-scale imagery are still unclear compared to coarser resolution data acquired from satellites or aircrafts. This study aims (i) to propose novel methods for retrieving canopy variables from UAV multispectral observations, and (ii) to investigate to what extent the use of such centimeter-scale imagery makes it possible to improve the estimation of leaf and canopy variables in sugar beet crops (Beta vulgaris L.). Five important structural and biochemical plant traits are considered: green fraction (GF), green area index (GAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), as well as canopy chlorophyll (CCC) and nitrogen (CNC) contents. Based on a comprehensive data set encompassing a large variability in canopy structure and biochemistry, the results obtained for every targeted trait demonstrate the superiority of centimeter-resolution methods over two standard remote-sensing approaches (i.e., vegetation indices and PROSAIL inversion) applied to average canopy reflectances. Two variables (denoted GFGREENPIX and VICAB) extracted from the images are shown to play a major role in these performances. GFGREENPIX is the GF estimate obtained by thresholding the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) image, and is shown to be an accurate and robust (e.g., against variable illumination conditions) proxy of the structure of sugar beet canopies, i.e., GF and GAI. VICAB is the mNDblue index value averaged over the darkest green pixels, and provides critical information on Cab. When exploited within uni- or multivariate empirical models, these two variables improve the GF, GAI, Cab, CCC and CNC estimates obtained with standard approaches, with gains in estimation accuracy of 24, 8, 26, 37 and 8%, respectively. For example, the best CCC estimates (R2 = 0.90) are obtained by multiplying Cab and GAI estimates respectively derived from VICAB and a log-transformed version of GFGREENPIX, log(1-GFGREENPIX). The GFGREENPIX and VICAB variables, which are only accessible from centimeter-scale imagery, contributes to a better identification of the effects of canopy structure and leaf biochemistry, whose influences may be confounded when considering coarser resolution observations. Such results emphasize the strong benefits of centimeter-scale UAV imagery over satellite or airborne remote sensing, and demonstrate the relevance of low-cost multispectral cameras to retrieve a number of plant traits, e.g., for agricultural applications.}

However, the mobility of UAV platforms, along with radiometric and atmospheric distortions, makes the task difficult. In this paper, various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are explored for resolving the issues related to sub-pixel classification and super-resolution of drone-derived datasets. The main contributions of this work are: 1) network-inversion based architectures for super-resolution and sub-pixel mapping of drone-derived images taking into account their spectral-spatial characteristics and the distortions prevalent in them 2) a feature-guided transformation for regularizing the inversion problem 3) loss functions for improving the spectral fidelity and inter-label compatibility of coarser to finer-scale mapping 4) use of multi-size kernel units for avoiding over-fitting. The proposed approach is the first of its kind in using neural network inversion for super-resolution and sub-pixel mapping. Experiments indicate that the proposed super-resolution approach gives better results in comparison with the sparse-code based approaches which generally result in corrupted dictionaries and sparse codes for multispectral aerial images. Also, the proposed use of neural network inversion, for projecting spatial affinities to sub-pixel maps, facilitates the consideration of coarser-scale texture and color information in modeling the finer-scale spatial-correlation. The simultaneous consideration of spectral bands, as proposed in this study, gives better super-resolution results when compared to the individual band enhancements. The proposed use of different data-augmentation strategies, for emulating the distortions, improves the generalization capability of the framework. Sensitivity of the proposed super-resolution and sub-pixel mapping frameworks with regard to the network parameters is thoroughly analyzed. The experiments over various standard datasets as well as those collected from known locations indicate that the proposed frameworks perform better when compared to the prominent published approaches.}

In this paper, the most popular convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced to assess flood susceptibility in Shangyou County, China. The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows. First, the CNN technique is used for flood susceptibility mapping through two different CNN classification and feature extraction frameworks. Second, three data presentation methods are designed in the CNN architecture to fit the two proposed frameworks. To construct the proposed CNN-based methods, 13 flood triggering factors related to historical flood events in the study area were prepared. The performance of these CNN-based methods was evaluated using several objective criteria in comparison to the conventional support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experiments results demonstrate that all the CNN-based methods can produce more reliable and practical flood susceptibility maps. For example, the proposed CNN-based classifiers were 0.022–0.054 higher than SVM in terms of area under the curve (AUC). In addition, in the classification process, CNN-based feature extraction can effectively improve the prediction capability of SVM by 0.021–0.051 in terms of AUC. Therefore, the proposed CNN frameworks can help mitigate and manage floods.}

A highly nonlinear 1DOF mathematical model of the TRMS is considered in this study and a nonlinear inverse model is developed for the pitch channel of the system. An adaptive neural network element is integrated thereafter with the feedback control system to compensate for model inversion errors. The proposed on-line learning algorithm updates the weights and biases of the neural network using the error between the set-point and the real output. The real-time response of the method shows a satisfactory tracking performance in the presence of inversion errors caused by model uncertainty. The approach is therefore deemed to be suitable to apply real-time to other nonlinear systems with necessary modifications.}

abstract = {Agricultural robots, or agrobots, have been increasingly adopted in every aspect of farming from surveillance to fruit harvesting in order to improve the overall productivity over the last few decades. Motivated by the compelling growth of the agricultural robots in modern farms, in this work, an autonomous quality inspection over rice farms is proposed by employing quadcopters. Real-time control of these vehicles, however, is still challenging as they exhibit a highly nonlinear behavior especially for agile maneuvers. What is more, these vehicles have to operate under uncertain working conditions such as wind and gust disturbances as well as positioning errors caused by inertial measurement units and global positioning system. To handle these difficulties, as a model-free and learning control algorithm, type-2 fuzzy neural networks (T2-FNNs) are designed for the control of a quadcopter. The novel particle swarm optimization-sliding mode control (PSO-SMC) theory-based hybrid algorithm is proposed for the training of the T2-FNNs. In particular, the continuous version of PSO is adopted for the identification of the antecedent part of the T2-FNNs while the SMC-based update rules are utilized for the online learning of the consequent part during control. In the virtual environment, the quadcopter is expected to perform an autonomous flight including agile maneuvers such as steep turning and sudden altitude changes over a rice terrace farm in Longsheng, China. The simulation results for the T2-FNNs are compared with the outcome of conventional proportional-derivative (PD) controllers for different case studies. The results show that our method decreases the trajectory tracking integral squared error by %26 over PD controllers in the ideal case, while this ratio goes up to %95 under uncertain working conditions.}

This study evaluated the performance of imagery data acquired using a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based imaging system for estimating yield of maize (Zea mays L.) and the effects of variable-rate nitrogen (N) application on crops. Images of a 27-ha maize field were captured using a UAV with a consumer-grade RGB camera flying at ~100 m above ground level at three maize growth stages. The collected sequential images were stitched and the Excess Green (ExG) colour feature was extracted to develop prediction models for maize yield and to examine the effect of the variable-rate N application. Various linear regression models between ExG and maize yield were developed for three sample area sizes (21, 106, and 1058 m2). The model performance was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2), F-test and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between estimated and actual yield. All linear regression models between ExG and yield were significant (p ≤ 0.05). The MAPE ranged from 6.2 to 15.1% at the three sample sizes, although R2 values were all <0.5. Prediction error was lower at the later growth stages, as the crop approached maturity, and at the largest sample level. The ExG image feature showed potential for evaluating the effect of variable-rate N application on crop growth. Overall, the low-cost UAV imaging system provided useful information for field management.}

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may provide new tools for improved forest health monitoring by providing data with very high temporal and spatial resolutions. These platforms also pose unique challenges and methods for health assessments must be validated before use. In this research, we simulated a disease outbreak in mature Pinus radiata D. Don trees using targeted application of herbicide. The objective was to acquire a time-series simulated disease expression dataset to develop methods for monitoring physiological stress from a UAV platform. Time-series multi-spectral imagery was acquired using a UAV flown over a trial at regular intervals. Traditional field-based health assessments of crown health (density) and needle health (discolouration) were carried out simultaneously by experienced forest health experts. Our results showed that multi-spectral imagery collected from a UAV is useful for identifying physiological stress in mature plantation trees even during the early stages of tree stress. We found that physiological stress could be detected earliest in data from the red edge and near infra-red bands. In contrast to previous findings, red edge data did not offer earlier detection of physiological stress than the near infra-red data. A non-parametric approach was used to model physiological stress based on spectral indices and was found to provide good classification accuracy (weighted kappa=0.694). This model can be used to map physiological stress based on high-resolution multi-spectral data.}

abstract = {To provide technical support for lodging-resistant wheat breeding, post-disaster assessment, and analysis of factors affecting lodging, the dynamic and accurate extraction of lodging area is particularly important. Most existing methods of monitoring wheat lodging aim to extract the lodging area at a single growth stage, rendering the dynamic monitoring of wheat lodging highly difficult. Thus, this study was aimed at developing a method of estimating wheat lodging at multiple growth stages. For this purpose, nitrogen fertilizers were utilized at different levels to induce different lodging conditions in wheat fields. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were used to obtain Red, Green and Blue (RGB) and multispectral images of the field at different wheat-growth stages. Based on these two types of images, a new method combining transfer learning and the DeepLabv3+ network is proposed herein to extract lodging areas at various wheat-growth stages. The proposed method was compared with the commonly used UNet for the extraction of the lodging area. The results show that the proposed method and UNet achieved dice coefficients of 0.82 and 0.75 (early flowering), 0.88 and 0.80 (late flowering), 0.89 and 0.86 (filling stage), 0.90 and 0.87 (early maturity), and 0.90 and 0.88 (late maturity), respectively, using RGB images; further, the proposed method and UNet achieved dice coefficients of 0.91 and 0.51 (early flowering), 0.89 and 0.28 (late flowering), 0.91 and 0.82 (filling stage), 0.93 and 0.76 (early maturity), and 0.92 and 0.56 (late maturity), respectively, at different wheat-growth stages using multispectral image data. Thus, the proposed method can be used to predict lodging at multiple wheat-growth stages, and it outperforms UNet. An effective tool for dynamic monitoring of wheat lodging has been proposed herein.}

Machine learning (ML) methods are promising due to their capability of processing different types of data and modeling both linear and non-linear relationships. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the potential improvement of in-season prediction of corn N nutrition index (NNI) and grain yield by combining soil, weather and management data with active sensor data using random forest regression (RFR) as compared with Lasso linear regression (LR) using similar data and simple regression (SR) models only using crop sensor data; and (2) to develop a new in-season side-dress N fertilizer recommendation strategy at eighth to ninth leaf stage (V8-V9) of corn developement using the RFR model.

The GreenSeeker sensor data and corn NNI were collected at V8-V9 stage, and grain yield was determined at the harvest stage (R6). The soil information was obtained at planting and the weather data was measured throughout the growing season. The results indicated that corn NNI and grain yield were better predicted by combining soil, weather and management information with GreenSeeker sensor data using RFR model (R2 = 0.86 and 0.79) and LR model (R2 = 0.85 and 0.76) as compared with only using GreenSeeker sensor data (R2 = 0.66 and 0.62–63) based on the test dataset. An innovative in-season side-dress N recommendation strategy was developed using the RFR grain yield prediction model to simulate corn grain yield responses to a series of side-dress N rates at V8-V9 stage. Based on these response curves, site-, and year-specific optimum side-dress N rates can be determined. The scenario analysis results indicated that this RFR model-based in-season N recommendation strategy could recommend side-dress N rates similar to those based on measured agronomic optimum N rate (AONR) or economic optimum N rate (EONR), with root mean square error (RMSE) of 17 kg ha−1 and relative error (RE) of 14–15 %. It is concluded that combining soil, weather and management information with crop sensor data using RFR can significantly improve both in-season corn NNI and grain yield prediction and N management, compared with the approach based only on crop sensor data. More studies are needed to further improve and evaluate this approach under diverse on-farm conditions.}

These devices are predominantly used for aerial surveying in sensitive and remote areas. It is alarming that issues pertaining to stalking and information control have increased with the growth of technology. This paper presents a Blockchain Technology (BCT) based solution to improve the security and privacy of VC based device data. The proposed design is evaluated by implementing an IoT based application in a virtual vehicle monitoring system. The technical information about the instructions to the vehicle (devices), authentication, integrity, and vehicle reactions are stored in a cloud platform wherein Pentatope based Elliptic curve cryptography and SHA are used to ensure privacy in data storage. The data is later stored in an Ethereum based public blockchain to enable seamless BCT transactions. This system uses the Ganache platform for BCT that ensures data protection and privacy. Furthermore, metamask wallet for Ethbalance is required to perform transactions over BCT. The proposed methodology thus helps to protect data from stalkers, plaintext attacks as well as ciphertext attacks. The results, when compared with the state-of-the-art, justify the efficiency and security aspects of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {The rendezvous and formation problem is a significant part for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) technique. It can be divided into two major phases: the long-range guidance phase and the formation phase. In this paper, an iterative computation guidance law (ICGL) is proposed to compute a series of state variables to get the solution of a control variable for a UAV conducting rendezvous with a tanker in AAR. The proposed method can make the control variable converge to zero when the tanker and the UAV receiver come to a formation flight eventually. For the long-range guidance phase, the ICGL divides it into two sub-phases: the correction sub-phase and the guidance sub-phase. The two sub-phases share the same iterative process. As for the formation phase, a velocity coordinate system is created by which control accelerations are designed to make the speed of the UAV consistent with that of the tanker. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ICGL is effective and robust against wind disturbance.}

abstract = {Characterisation of the ecosystem functioning of mudflats requires insight on the morphology and facies of these coastal features, but also on biological processes that influence mudflat geomorphology, such as crab bioturbation and the formation of benthic biofilms, as well as their heterogeneity at cm or less scales. Insight into this fine scale of ecosystem functioning is also important as far as minimizing errors in upscaling are concerned. The realisation of high-resolution ground surveys of these mudflats without perturbing their surface is a real challenge. Here, we address this challenge using UAV-supported photogrammetry based on the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) workflow. We produced a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophotograph at 1 cm and 0.5 cm pixel resolutions, respectively, of a mudflat in French Guiana, and mapped and classed into different size ranges intricate morphological features, including crab burrow apertures, tidal drainage creeks and depressions. We also determined subtle facies and elevation changes and slopes, and the footprint of different degrees of benthic biofilm development. The results generated at this scale of photogrammetric analysis also enabled us to relate macrofaunal crab burrowing activity to various parameters, including mudflat elevation, spatial distribution and sizes of creeks and depressions, benthic biofilm distribution, and flooding duration. SfM photogrammetry offers interesting new perspectives in fine-scale characterisation of the geomorphology, benthic activity and degree of biofilm development of dynamic muddy intertidal environments that are generally difficult of access. The main shortcomings highlighted in this study are a drift of accuracy of the DSM outside areas of ground control points and the deployment of which perturb the mudflat morphology and biology, the water-logged or very wet surfaces which generate reconstruction artefacts through the sun glint effect, and the time-consuming task of manual interpretation of extraction of features such as crab burrow apertures. On-going developments in UAV positioning integrating RTK/PPK GPS solutions for image-georeferencing and precise orientation with high-quality inertial measurement units will limit the difficulties inherent to ground control points, while conduction of surveys during homogeneous cloudy conditions could reduce the sun-glint effect. Manual extraction of image features could be automated in the future through the use of deep-learning algorithms.}

An adaptive control strategy is proposed to smooth the agent’s trajectory, and the neural network is constructed to estimate the system’s unknown components. The consensus conditions are demonstrated for tracking a leader with nonlinear dynamics under an adaptive control algorithm in the absence of model uncertainties. Then, the results are extended to the system with unknown time-varying disturbances by applying the neural network estimation to compensating for the uncertain parts of the agents’ models. Update laws are designed based on the Lyapunov function terms to ensure the effectiveness of robust control. Finally, the theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations, and a comparative experiment is conducted, showing that the trajectories generated by the proposed method exhibit less oscillation and converge faster.}

Because of low energy, ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) processors are used for DNNs in embedded applications. However, in harsh environments, soft errors induced by radiation strikes may cause Silent Data Corruptions (SDCs) and Detected Unrecoverable Errors (DUEs). In this work, for DNNs, we evaluate the soft error resilience of the register file and analyze the impact of compiler optimizations. The results show that compiler optimization significantly degrades the reliability of DNNs. Furthermore, we track SDC propagation and record execution time for each layer. The results indicate that for most DNNs, convolutional layers are the most vulnerable because they are the most time-consuming parts. For instructions, we evaluate Program Vulnerability Factor (PVF) contributions of instructions and identify the vulnerable instructions that may cause critical SDCs. To mitigate critical SDCs, we propose two efficient approaches: 1) selective kernel hardening and 2) Symptom-based Duplication with Comparison (SDWC). The former reduces SDCs by an order of magnitude and incurs 33.56% time overhead. The second approach reduces critical SDCs to 0 and incurs less than 10% time overhead. For DUEs, we propose an idempotency-based recovery. Our approach mitigates more than 92.2% DUEs and incurs 3.43% latency overhead on average.}

The present algorithm only considers one or two spatial sub channels with the maximum eigenvalue, and does not consider how to satisfy multiple requirements with limited resources, nor does it consider the problem of admission control. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes an intelligent resource dynamic allocation method based on QoS. In this paper, resources are managed effectively through resource reservation mechanism and selective QoS adjustment mechanism. Then, all non-zero eigenvalue space sub channels are used for data transmission to maximize channel capacity under the condition that the total transmission power is limited and user QoS requirements are met. The simulation results show that the algorithm can effectively improve the throughput of the system by making full use of multi-user diversity on the basis of satisfying the QoS requirements of users.}

By doing so, optimal paths in terms of probability of collision, traversal time and uncertainty are obtained. Moreover, our approach takes into account the real dimensions of the UAV in order to reliably estimate the probability of collision from the predicted uncertainty. The motion planner relies on a graduated fidelity state lattice and a novel multi-resolution heuristic which adapt to the obstacles in the map. This allows managing the uncertainty at planning time and yet obtaining solutions fast enough to control the UAV in real time. Experimental results show the reliability and the efficiency of our approach in different real environments and with different motion models. Finally, we also report planning results for the reconstruction of 3D scenarios, showing that with our approach the UAV can obtain a precise 3D model autonomously.}

This application scenario requires 2D target (e.g., athlete, ball, bicycle, boat) tracking for visually assisting the UAV pilot (or cameraman) to maintain proper target framing, or even for actual 3D target following/localization when the drone flies autonomously. In these cases, it should be expected that the target to be tracked/followed, may disappear from the UAV camera field of view, due to fast 3D target motion, illumination changes, or due to visual target occlusions by obstacles, even if the actual UAV continues following it (either autonomously, by exploiting alternative target localization sensors, or by pilot maneuvering). Therefore, the 2D tracker should be able to recover from such situations. The proposed framework solves exactly this problem. Target occlusions are detected from the 2D tracker responses. Depending on the occlusion immensity, the proposed framework decides whether to not update the tracking model, or to employ target re-detection in a broader window. As a result, the proposed framework allows continued target tracking once the target re-appears in the video stream, without tracker re-initialization.}

With the equipment gradually moving towards intelligence, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will be widely used for integrated reconnaissance/attack in the future. The lightweight and compact design of the small UAV allows it to travel through dense forests and other environments to capture images with its convenient mobility. However, as the camouflage has been designed to blend in with surroundings, which greatly reduces the probability of the target being discovered. Moreover, the lack of training data on camouflaged people detection will inhibit the training of a deep model. To address these problems, a novel semi-supervised camouflaged military people detection network is proposed to automatically detect the target from the images. In this paper, the camouflaged object detection dataset (COD10K) is first supplemented according to our mission requirements, then the edge attention is utilized to enhance the boundaries based on search identification network. Further, a semi-supervised learning strategy is presented to take advantage of the unlabeled data which can alleviate insufficient data and improve the detection accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised search identification network (Semi-SINet) performs well in camouflaged people detection compared with other object detection methods.}

Farmers have used the chemical analysis of leaf tissue to determine the amount of nitrogen needed in a crop. However, its possible to directly classify the leaf nitrogen content (LNC) using remote sensing data. But, the accuracy of this methodology is yet low and is unknown how to enhance it. We propose a new approach to estimate the LNC in Valencia orange trees applying spectral analysis algorithms in multispectral images of high spatial resolution. Here we show an accuracy upper than 87% in determining the LNC in Valencia orange tree. Previous research, that also used multispectral images of high spatial resolution, obtained an accuracy lower than 65%. A total of 320 spectral measurements were obtained with a field spectroradiometer and the multispectral images were acquired with a Parrot Sequoia camera mounted in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We calculated the mean values of 10 spectral measurements and created 32 spectral signatures with different nitrogen content. Each spectral signature was assigned for three LNC classes; low (≤27 g.kg−1), medium (>27 and ≤29 g.kg−1) and high (>29 g.kg−1). A band simulation was performed to Parrot Sequoia images for each spectral signature. We adopted 7 spectral analysis algorithms to determine the LNC: Constrained Energy Minimization; Linear Spectral Unmixing; Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering; Minimum Distance; Orthogonal Subspace Projection; Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and; Spectral Information Divergence. All these algorithms were trained using the simulated spectral signatures as input data. We used the 32 spectral signatures as training data and approximately 30,000 pixels as testing data, corresponding to the identified nitrogen content in orange-trees. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated with a confusion matrix and Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. The SAM algorithm presented the highest accuracy (overall of 87.6% with a kappa coefficient of 0.75) to determine LNC in orange trees. The proposed methodology may reduce the number of leaf tissue analysis and also optimize the monitoring process of orange orchards.}

One of the civil applications in which UAV networks may have more potential is in emergency response operations. Having a UAV network that is able to deploy autonomously and provide communication services in a disaster scenario would be very helpful for both victims and first responders. However, generating exploratory trajectories for these networks is one of the main issues when dealing with complex scenarios. We propose an algorithm based on the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, in which the UAV team follows the networking approach known as Delay Tolerant Network. We pursue two main goals, the first is exploring a disaster scenario area, and the second is making the UAVs converge to several victims groups discovered during the exploration phase. We have run extensive simulations for performing a characterization of the proposed algorithm. Both goals of the mission are successfully achieved with the proposed algorithm. Besides, in comparison to an optimal trajectory planning algorithm that sweeps the entire disaster scenario, our algorithm is able to discover faster the 25%, 50% and 75% of the scenario victims and it converges faster. In addition, in terms of connections events between a victim and a UAV, our algorithm shows more frequent connections and less time between consecutive connections.}

While these characteristics are typical of various disaster response and commercial applications, there is a lack of online MRTA solutions to address them. To solve this class of complex MRTA problems, an efficient online method (which is also suitable for decentralized deployment) is developed based on the construction and weighted matching of bipartite graphs. An exact integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of this class of MRTA problems is also developed, the solution of which serves both as an offline MRTA approach and as a provably optimal benchmark against which the online method is compared. The new methods are applied to a flood response problem where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles must respond to victims spread out over a large area. The results show that the new online algorithm closely trails the offline ILP method in terms of task completion performance, while being >103 times more computationally efficient compared to the ILP method. Dedicated case studies provide further insights into the favorable scalability of the online method with an increasing number of UAVs — offering up to 46% higher task completion compared to a random walk baseline in huge 1000-task problems. Lastly, application to a slightly different class of SR–ST problems and comparison of the ensuing results with that of corresponding state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the potential wider applicability of the proposed online MRTA method.}

abstract = {The objective of this work is to illustrate how to algorithmically integrate Machine-Learning Algorithms (MLA’s) with multistage/multicomponent fire spread models. In order to tangibly illustrate this process, this work develops a framework for a specific model problem combining: (I) a meshless discrete element “submodel” that tracks the trajectory of airborne hot particles/embers, subject to prevailing wind velocities and updrafts, (II) a topographical “submodel” of the ambient combustible material whereby airborne embers that make contact are allowed to start secondary fires (if conditions are appropriate), combined with ground-based surface spread and burn rates for generating new embers, new updrafts (due to hot air), etc., and (III) a Machine-Learning Algorithm to rapidly ascertain the multi-submodel system parameters that force the overall model to match observations. The submodels compute both ground and airborne hot-ember driven fire propagation, as well as subsequent distribution of debris/soot, which is important for air-quality assessment. The overall framework is designed for use in digital twin technology, which refers to an adaptive digital replica of a physical system, whereby model updates are continuously in near real-time. This necessitates a rapid simulation paradigm that can easily interface with telecommunications, cameras and sensors. The presented framework is designed to run quickly on laptops and hand held devices, with the guiding principle being to make it potentially useful for first-responders in real-time.}

abstract = {The accurate evaluation of maize plants’ uniformity aligned with an effective improvement in germination and biomass assessment is of paramount importance for farmers. Early detection of stand count provides details on uneven emergence for farmers to make a prompt decision for replanting and applying proper agricultural inputs at defective zones. However, conventional, ground-based stand count methods are costly, time-intensive, and the accuracy of the counting method heavily depends on the selected area. This study focuses on validating the potential application of high resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images for detecting the total number of maize plants and stand uniformity soon after maize germination. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate proper image processing algorithm for detecting the maize crop and calculating the distance between adjacent maize plants within a row. In the mosaicked images, the pixels including maize plants were segmented using two methods including excess green index (EXG) method and k-means clustering-segmentation technique. The mean accuracy using EXG method was 46%, however, the k-means clustering-segmentation method satisfactorily identified plants with mean accuracy of 91% in the field. The planting uniformity of maize plants was also evaluated based on three indices including miss index, multiple index, and coefficient of precision. Results showed that plant stand assessment using mosaicked images was closer to the values set on the planting machine. The marginal discrepancy between estimated and observed plant stand count and other indices confirms the high accuracy of UAV mosaicked images in plant density estimation for growers to make appropriate management decisions.}

abstract = {The article proposes the use of PCA transformation carried out with the use of a neural network as a method for compress data obtained from geodetic measurements. In this study, the goal was to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which enables possible to reduce the input data space by determining independent principal components. The applicability of these methods has been exemplified by the results of vertical displacement measurements of a building. The results of calculations carried out using artificial intelligence assisted and PCA indicates that the approach can be effectively used to compress of geodetic measurement results and then to reproduce them without loss of accuracy of displacement identification. The degree of accuracy of displacement vector reconstruction did not exceed twice the average measurement error, for the most unfavourable situation, amounted to ±0.21 mm. This reduction leads to data compression and makes it possible for the example presented in the article almost to reduce the amount of information stored three times.}
