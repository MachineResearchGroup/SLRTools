abstract={The problem of vehicular congestion is transversal to all the cities worldwide. To deal with it, it can be done from the construction of new roads or the management of these as in the case of exclusive roads for public transport. In the latter case, information is necessary. Currently, in Chile this collection process is manually done, so it does not respond to current information needs, because the long time the process takes. The use of deep learning models for automatic counting has shown outstanding results, but based on a scheme for sending video streaming to remote servers. The present proposal aims to not depend on fiber optic connectivity. It is based on a network of modules based on Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI) in order to build a scalable, real-time data capture platform.},

abstract={Smart solutions that make use of machine learning and data analyses are on the rise. Big Data analysis is attracting more and more developers and researchers, and at least five requirements (Velocity, Volume, Value, Variety, and Veracity) show challenges in deploying such solutions. Across the globe, many Smart City initiatives are using Big Data Analytics as a tool for doing predictive analytics which can be helpful to human well being. This work presents a generic architecture named Machine Learning in Microservices Architecture (MLMA) that provides design patterns to transform a monolithic architecture of machine learning pipelines in microservices with separate roles. We present two case studies deployed to a Smart City initiative, where we discuss how each component of the architecture applied in specific applications that use predictions with machine learning. Among the benefits of this architecture, we argue prediction performance, scalability, code maintenance and reusability makes such transition a natural trend in Big Data and machine learning applications.},

Among these services, intelligent re-design of first responder services call for novel solutions that save city resources and result in faster response time. To this end, we propose to utilize sensory data in connected vehicles to capture contextual details that can be obtained through various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to determine which set of first responders should be called in the case of an accident. We use real images from a rich dataset of accidents involving different types of vehicles to train and test the CNNs. Through experimental results, we show that when ResNet-34 network is augmented with one fit cycle, image augmentation and hidden layer unfreezing methods can result in 88.9% accuracy in the prediction of the required first responder(s) in case of an accident solely based on the captured images.},

abstract={The goal of hyperspectral image fusion (HIF) is to reconstruct high spatial resolution hyperspectral images (HR-HSI) via fusing low spatial resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) and high spatial resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) without loss of spatial and spectral information. Most existing HIF methods are designed based on the assumption that the observation models are known, which is unrealistic in many scenarios. To address this blind HIF problem, we propose a deep learning-based method that optimizes the observation model and fusion processes iteratively and alternatively during the reconstruction to enforce bidirectional data consistency, which leads to better spatial and spectral accuracy. However, general deep neural network inherently suffers from information loss, preventing us to achieve this bidirectional data consistency. To settle this problem, we enhance the blind HIF algorithm by making part of the deep neural network invertible via applying a slightly modified spectral normalization to the weights of the network. Furthermore, in order to reduce spatial distortion and feature redundancy, we introduce a Content-Aware ReAssembly of FEatures module and an SE-ResBlock model to our network. The former module helps to boost the fusion performance, while the latter make our model more compact. Experiments demonstrate that our model performs favorably against compared methods in terms of both nonblind HIF fusion and semiblind HIF fusion.},

pages={2326-2341},
abstract={With the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities have become the mainstream of urbanization. IoT networks allow distributed smart devices to collect and process data within smart city infrastructure using an open channel, the Internet. Thus, challenges such as centralization, security, privacy (e.g., performing data poisoning and inference attacks), transparency, scalability, and verifiability limits faster adaptations of smart cities. Motivated by the aforementioned discussions, we present a Privacy-Preserving and Secure Framework (PPSF) for IoT-driven smart cities. The proposed PPSF is based on two key mechanisms: a two-level privacy scheme and an intrusion detection scheme. First, in a two-level privacy scheme, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the IoT data and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is applied to transform raw IoT information into a new shape. In the intrusion detection scheme, a Gradient Boosting Anomaly Detector (GBAD) is applied for training and evaluating the proposed two-level privacy scheme based on two IoT network datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. We also suggest a blockchain-InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) integrated Fog-Cloud architecture to deploy the proposed PPSF framework. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the PPSF framework over some recent approaches in blockchain and non-blockchain systems.},

abstract={One of the most challenging areas of Future Smart Cities Research is the Smart Energy domain. Critical issues related to optimization, provision of smart customizable networks and sophisticated computational techniques and methods enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning need further investigation. The renewable energy (RE) is a powerful resource for the future global development in the context of climate change and resources depletion. Artificial intelligence (AI) implies new rules of organizing the activities in order to respond to these new requirements. It is necessary to improve the design of the energy infrastructure, the deployment and production of RE in order to face the multiple challenges that will affect the sector's growth and resilience.. In this research work we exploit the recent developments on the AI adoption for RE sector in European Union (EU). In this respect, we analysed (i) the efficiency of the transformation processes of the RE within the energy chain from Gross Inland Consumption to Final Energy Consumption, (ii) its implications on the structure of renewable energy by source (solar, wind, biomass etc.), (iii) the labour productivity in RE sector compared to the economy as a whole and its correlation with investments level, (iv) the implication of the adoption of AI for RE towards Future Smart Cities Research. The main contribution of this research is the development of a framework for understanding the contribution of AI in the RE sector in Europe. Another bold contribution of this work is the discussion of the implications for Future Smart Cities Research and future research directions.},

abstract={Dealing with air pollution presents a major environmental challenge in smart city environments. Real-time monitoring of pollution data enables local authorities to analyze the current traffic situation of the city and make decisions accordingly. Deployment of the Internet of Things-based sensors has considerably changed the dynamics of predicting air quality. Existing research has used different machine learning tools for pollution prediction; however, comparative analysis of these techniques is required to have a better understanding of their processing time for multiple datasets. In this paper, we have performed pollution prediction using four advanced regression techniques and present a comparative study to determine the best model for accurately predicting air quality with reference to data size and processing time. We have conducted experiments using Apache Spark and performed pollution estimation using multiple datasets. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) have been used as evaluation criteria for the comparison of these regression models. Furthermore, the processing time of each technique through standalone learning and through fitting the hyperparameter tuning on Apache Spark has also been calculated to find the best-fit model in terms of processing time and lowest error rate.},

abstract={In the last years we have seen huge advancements in the area of Machine Learning, specially with the use of Deep Neural Networks. One of the most relevant examples is in image classification, where convolutional neural networks have shown to be a vital tool, hard to replace with any other techniques. Although aggregation functions, such as OWA operators, have been previously used on top of neural networks, usually to aggregate the outputs of different networks or systems (ensembles), in this paper we propose and explore a new way of using OWA aggregations in deep learning. We implement OWA aggregations as a new layer inside a convolutional neural network. These layers are used to learn additional order-based information from the feature maps of a certain layer, and then the newly generated information is used as a complement input for the following layers. We carry out several tests introducing the new layer in a VGG13-based reference network and show that this layer introduces new knowledge into the network without substantially increasing training times.},

The prediction of building energy consumption is of great significance for energy conservation and environmental protection as well as the construction of smart city. With the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning technology has been introduced to energy consumption prediction. In this study, multiple learning algorithms including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF) are developed to perform energy consumption prediction. The most appropriate machine learning algorithm for energy consumption prediction has been investigated and found to be the random forest algorithm. Based on the developed machine learning models, studies on the sampling strategy for energy consumption prediction have been conducted. It is found that the variance of data has a significant effect on the prediction accuracy, and a better prediction result can be achieved by increasing the sampling density over the data with high variance. This result can be used to optimize the machine learning algorithm for building energy consumption prediction and improve the computational efficiency.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a human gesture recognition algorithm using impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar. The radar signal is transmitted into a three dimensional space, however, the received signal is only expressed in one dimensional. Therefore, it is difficult to classify 3-D gestures by analyzing specific features, such as power, peak value, index of peak value, and other values of received signal. To resolve this problem, a new human gesture recognition algorithm using machine learning is proposed. Two machine learning technics are used in this paper. One is unsupervised learning technic which is used for extracting features from received radar signal is principal component analysis, and the other one is supervised learning which is used for classifying gestures. The features are extracted by using the principal component analysis (PCA) method, then neural network method is used for training and classifying gestures using the extracted features. In training and classifying step, other method can be used, such as supporting vector machine (SVM), however, this method is hard to recognize noise gesture which means untrained gesture. To resolve this problem, we use neural network method in this paper, then in order to classy noise gestures and trained gestures, a noise determining algorithm is used.},

abstract={Waste collection and management presents a major challenge for municipalities wanting to achieve cleaner urban environments. Smart city infrastructure incorporating the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm offers substantial advantages in terms of real-time waste monitoring capability. Basic sensory monitoring by itself, however, falls short of achieving optimal waste management without comprehensive data analytics. To this end, the present work proposes an off-the-shelf IoT-based waste monitoring solution, combined with back-end data analytics for efficient waste collection. The work employs Raspberry Pi and ultrasonic sensors, mounted on waste-bins in a specific area of a cooperating municipality for waste capacity monitoring. Realtime bin status and machine learning analytics are used to identify present as well as predict future waste collection scheduling. Dynamic collection servicing routes are accordingly mapped for utilization by waste collection vehicles. During a tenday trial and validation period, it was observed that the proposed design increases fuel efficiency by up to 46% and a reduction in collection times by up to 18%. In addition to the noted quantitative improvements, the proposed scheme can also aid in optimizing long-term waste policies in smart city environments using the recorded statistics.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a group of millions of devices having sensors and actuators linked over wired or wireless channel for data transmission. IoT has grown rapidly over the past decade with more than 25 billion devices expected to be connected by 2020. The volume of data released from these devices will increase many-fold in the years to come. In addition to an increased volume, the IoT devices produces a large amount of data with a number of different modalities having varying data quality defined by its speed in terms of time and position dependency. In such an environment, machine learning (ML) algorithms can play an important role in ensuring security and authorization based on biotechnology, anomalous detection to improve the usability, and security of IoT systems. On the other hand, attackers often view learning algorithms to exploit the vulnerabilities in smart IoT-based systems. Motivated from these, in this article, we propose the security of the IoT devices by detecting spam using ML. To achieve this objective, Spam Detection in IoT using Machine Learning framework is proposed. In this framework, five ML models are evaluated using various metrics with a large collection of inputs features sets. Each model computes a spam score by considering the refined input features. This score depicts the trustworthiness of IoT device under various parameters. REFIT Smart Home data set is used for the validation of proposed technique. The results obtained proves the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in comparison to the other existing schemes.},

Furthermore, our study targets for an image-based machine learning platform to prepare users for the upcoming era of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. TVDP will be used to pilot, test, and apply various visual data-intensive applications in a collaborative way. New data, methods, and extracted knowledge from one application can be effectively translated into other applications, ultimately making visual data and analysis as a smart city infrastructure. The goal is to make value creation through visual data and their analysis as broadly available as possible, thus to make social and economic problem solving more distributed and collaborative among users. This paper reports the design and implementation of TVDP in progress and partial experimental results to demonstrate its feasibility.},

abstract={Over the recent years smart cities have been emerged as promising paradigm for a transition toward providing effective and real time smart services. Despite the great potential it brings to citizens' life, security and privacy issues still need to be addressed. Due to technology advances, large amount of data is produced, where machine learning methods are applied to learn meaningful patterns. In this paper a machine learning-based framework is proposed for detecting distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in smart cities. The proposed framework applies restricted Boltzmann machines to learn high-level features from raw data and on top of these learned features, a feed forward neural network model is trained for attack detection. The performance of the proposed framework is verified using a smart city dataset collected from a smart water plant. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in detecting DDoS attacks.},

The structure of aero engine is complex, and the technical requirements for maintenance are high. During the operation of the aircraft, the engine equipment will decay due to fatigue, wear, aging and other reasons. Running equipment in a decay state often causes increased costs, increased failure rates, and huge safety risks. Proper maintenance can prevent equipment from operating in poor conditions, but excessive maintenance can increase equipment downtime and maintenance costs. According to the development trend of the state and possible failure modes, adopting corresponding maintenance strategies, preparing maintenance in advance, and adjusting the flight plan reasonably, this is of great significance for reducing equipment maintenance costs, improving operating efficiency and system safety, and improving the revenue of aviation companies.},

abstract={The major objective of a smart city is to provide ripest and rightest services to its residents with minimal human intervention. The data collected from various sensors, receptors and receivers can be stored in a reliable, cost effective and manageable cloud storage. Predictive analytics such as predictive modelling and machine learning can be used to analyze the latest and past data from the cloud to forecast the near and far future. The predictive analytics will immediately send notifications and the appropriate actions to be taken to the concerned system so that the residents can get equable life. Waste management such as sewage management and trash management are one of the major exertion in a smart city. In this paper, predictive analytics is applied on the cloud data collected from various sensors attached on the waste management resources such as trash bins and sewage pipes. Firstly, group of trash bins and sewage pipes are attached with radio wave sensors which in turn connected to an IoT enabled receiver to provide cost effective data collection. Secondly, the data from the receivers are stored in a cloud. Thirdly, predictive analytics are proposed for applying on the data in the cloud. Finally, actions like redirecting the trash collection truck and sewage clearing robot based on the priority can be done automatically and long term actions can be directed to the concerned authorities with notifications and alerts to take necessary actions. In this paper, designing of an immaculate smart city is proposed which can be achieved by developing IoT based trash collection and sewage cleaning system. For analysis purpose synthetic data is considered where levels for garbage cleaning bins at different time are represented with different numbers.},

The importance and usefulness of two wrapper feature selection methods is demonstrated here on 23 time series appearing typically in smart city area. Particularly, high dimensionality reduction is achieved without sacrificing the prediction performance for energy consumption, temperature, price and people's presence prediction. Only for thermal discomfort prediction, high dimensionality reduction causes small increase of mean average prediction error typically less than 1%. Since the two methods are comparable from the dimensionality reduction and prediction performance point of view, sensitivity based pruning is recommended, because of its less computational demands.},

abstract={Photovoltaic power generation forecasting (PVGF) is an attractive research topic for efficient energy management in smart city. In addition, the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM/RNN) has been actively utilized for predicting various time series tasks in recent years due to its outstanding ability to learn the feature of sequential time-series data. Although the existing forecasting models were obtained from learning the sequential PVGF data, it is observed that irregular factors made adverse effects on the forecasting results of very-short-term PVGF tasks, thus, the entire forecasting performance was deteriorated. In this regard, multiscale LSTM-based deep learning which is capable for forecasting very-short-term PVGF is proposed for efficient management. The model concatenates on two different scaled LSTM modules to overcome the deterioration that is originated from the irregular factors. Lastly, experimental results present the proposed framework can assist to forecast the tendency of PVGF amount steadily.},

abstract={In the age of smart cities, it is envisioned that most processes within the smart city context will be smart and automated. This includes smart houses, smart kitchens, etc. within this context, a need will arise for Smart nursery rooms. Within the smart nursery concept, the infant needs will need to be fulfilled automatically, in addition, to infant monitoring and safety. The motivation of this work is to design a smart cradle system for a smart nursery room that automates the functions of the cradle based on the infant's sounds. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an infant sound classification technique based on the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel using 18 extracted features of infant sounds. The proposed technique has been compared with two SVC kernel function, linear, and poly, as well as other classification algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gaussian Naive Bayes. As a result of comparing the confusion matrix, recall, F1 Score, accuracies, and precision values of various applied machine learning algorithms over-extracted features. SVC using RBF kernel function was found to be the most efficient model with an average accuracy of more than 96%. The proposed system outperforms all other systems proposed in the previous literature.},

abstract={IoT networks continue to expand in various domains, from smart homes and campuses to smart cities and critical infrastructures. Due to the lack of appropriate security measures embedded in IoT devices, they are increasingly becoming the target of sophisticated cyber-attacks. Existing machine learning-based methods for monitoring and securing IoT networks are fragile, expensive, and inflexible, and hence unable to cost-effectively cope with the dynamic and complex nature of attacks. For my PhD thesis, the aim is to develop a robust, accurate, scalable, and cost-effective network monitoring solution for securing large IoT systems. To do so, we would require to dynamically measure and analyze certain portions of network traffic. Therefore, we employ programmable networking techniques to dynamically and selectively acquire necessary telemetry data (packets and/or flows of connected devices) fed to a collection of learning-based models (each specialized in certain protocols with specific granularity) to classify devices, monitor their activity, and detect malicious behaviors. Our preliminary results show that the signature analysis of selected signaling packets from 26 real IoT devices yields a reasonably accurate inference by progressively collecting telemetry data at manageable processing costs.},

abstract={Smart city advancements are driving massive transformations of healthcare, the largest global industry. The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system. The system is described in detail including the algorithmic implementation of the three components and four layers. Three widely used data sets are used to evaluate the UbeHealth system.},

In order to ensure quality services, each of city service gathers multidimensional data from abundant IoT nodes. Therefore, the centralized traffic management has become critically challenging for a large volume of multidimensional smart city network data. Consequently, in this research, we concentrate on solving this problem by introducing Software Defined Networks (SDN) based intelligent service fulfillment for dense smart city network to accomplish service requests from multiple smart citizens and service providers. First, we model a distributed software defined IoT network for smart city environment where introduce a fog-based SDN controller with an intelligent engine, fog unit, and virtual mesh topology module. Then, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based intelligent algorithm for IoT network, and that intelligent agent-based service fulfillment algorithm accomplishes the city service. We use fog based SDN controller unit to implement the learning model based on processing and waiting delay of the SDN switches that qualify the smart city services to the service providers.

abstract={As the smart city applications are moving from conceptual models to development phase, smart transportation is one of smart cities applications and it is gaining ground nowadays. Electric Vehicles (EVs) are considered one of the major pillars of smart transportation applications. EVs are ever growing in popularity due to their potential contribution in reducing dependency on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. However, large-scale deployment of EV charging stations poses multiple challenges to the power grid and public infrastructure. To overcome the issue of prolonged charging time, the simple solution of deploying more charging stations to increase charging capacity does not work due to the strain on power grids and physical space limitations. Therefore, researchers have focused on developing smart scheduling algorithms to manage the demand for public charging using modeling and optimization. More recently, there has been a growing interest in data-driven approaches in modeling EV charging. Consequently, researchers are looking to identify consumer charging behavior pattern that can provide insights and predictive analytics capability. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review for the use of supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning as well as Deep Neural Networks for charging behavior analysis and prediction. Recommendations and future research directions are also discussed.},

abstract={Smart cities rely heavily on collecting and using data. Smart systems are implemented and deployed to provide intelligent features that help improve efficiency and quality of life. This creates a huge repository of data representing many aspects of smart city operations. Many data-driven applications can take advantage of this data to further improve the “smartness” of a smart city. At the same time, smart city systems, being very large-scale distributed systems and highly integrated with the physical infrastructure and residents of the city, pose immense security challenges as well. So why don't we take advantage of this data to improve security measures? In this paper we propose the use of data-driven security approaches to secure smart city systems. To illustrate the significance of this approach we first identify the different challenges for securing smart city systems given the unique characteristics of these systems. Then we discuss the benefits of using data-driven security. Furthermore, we categorize the different types of security applications (features) needed to help capitalize on the data needs and benefits. We also discuss the how these categories of applications can alleviate some of the challenges. In addition, we highlight possible future research directions to incorporate effective data-driven security in smart city systems.},

abstract={This article investigates the distributed fault-tolerant time-varying formation control problem for multiple unmanned airships (UAs) against limited communication ranges and input saturation to achieve the safe observation of a smart city. To address the strongly nonlinear functions caused by the time-varying formation flight with limited communication ranges and bias faults, intelligent adaptive learning mechanisms are proposed by incorporating fuzzy neural networks. Moreover, Nussbaum functions are introduced to handle the input saturation and loss-of-effectiveness faults. The distinct features of the proposed control scheme are that time-varying formation flight, actuator faults including bias and loss-of-effectiveness faults, limited communication ranges, and input saturation are simultaneously considered. It is proven by Lyapunov stability analysis that all UAs can achieve a safe formation flight for the smart city observation even in the presence of actuator faults. Hardware-in-the-loop experiments with open-source Pixhawk autopilots are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract={Collective adaptive systems are challenging from the engineering perspective. Different approaches aim at taming these systems either by specifying the behaviour programmatically or by using Machine Learning techniques. Aggregate programming is part of the first group and is a novel technique by which developers can express collective system behaviours from a global perspective, using a compositional and functional programming approach. Over the years, Aggregate Computing has been applied in different scenarios, ranging from smart cities to crowd of augmented people. Despite its promising capabilities, it is sometimes challenging to describe aggregate behaviours, so we aim at merging Aggregate Computing with Machine Learning techniques to simplify the aggregate program synthesis.},

abstract={Smart city concepts have gained substantial attention over the last few years, as they apply advances in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to enhance the quality and efficiency of services and resources. Microgrids are potentially powerful building blocks in the development of smart cities. Motivated by the opportunity, this article examines the factors leadings to the adoption of microgrids for mainstream electrical utilities grids, discusses the benefits that drive the growth, identifies the issues hindering benefit-capture of distributed energy generation inside microgrids, and provides a framework for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to overcome challenges. We examine a simulation framework scenario and useful data sources that can help build AI capabilities within utilities. A brief description of the scalable BluWave-ai framework that leverages deep learning in the data centre is also provided, and AI inference at edge computing nodes and IoT sensors to optimize the benefits from microgrids at residential, neighbourhood, campus, enterprise and community levels is examined.},

abstract={Recently, the classification of tree species using 3-D point clouds has drawn wide attention in surveys and forestry investigations. This letter proposes a new voxel-based deep learning method to classify tree species in 3-D point clouds collected from complex forest scenes. The proposed method includes three steps: 1) individual tree extraction based on the density of the point clouds; 2) low-level feature representation through voxel-based rasterization; and 3) classification of tree species by a deep learning model. Two data sets of 3-D forest point clouds acquired by terrestrial laser scanning systems are used to evaluate the proposed method. The method achieves an average classification accuracy of 93.1% and 95.6% on the two data sets. Furthermore, in comparative experiments, the proposed method exhibits performance superior to that of the other 3-D tree species classification methods.},

abstract={The smart city is an integrated environment that heavily relies on intelligent robots, which provides the basis for the warehouse automation. However, a warehouse is a typical unstructured environment, and robotic grasp and manipulation are extremely important for the package, transfer, search, and so on. Currently, the most usual method is to detect the picking or grasping points for some specific end-effector including suction cup, gripper, or robotic hand. The manipulation performance is, therefore, strongly influenced by the visual detector. To tackle this problem, the affordance map has recently been developed. It characterizes the operation possibilities afforded by the operation scene and has been used for several grasp tasks. Nevertheless, the conventional affordance method often fails in complicated environments due to the mistake calculation results. In this article, we develop a novel framework to integrate the interactive exploration with a composite robotic hand for robotic grasping in a complicated environment. The exploration strategy is obtained by a deep reinforcement learning procedure. The developed new composite hand, which integrates the suction cup and grippers, is used to test the merits of the proposed interactive perception method. Experimental results show the proposed method significantly increases the manipulation efficiency and may bring great economic and social and benefits for smart cities.},

abstract={Smart cities are expected to offer a variety of innovative digital services and to improve quality of life of their citizens. To achieve this, a huge number of sensors permanently monitors different objects generating vast amounts of data which need to be transmitted and processed efficiently. Today's networks struggle to scale and manage this data. Novel concepts, such a Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), are introduced to overcome these challenges. In this paper we enhance an IoT architecture for smart cities by integrating SDN for the optimal allocation of smart city applications between MEC centers and the cloud.

abstract={The smooth operation of largely deployed Internet of Things (IoT) applications will depend on, among other things, effective infrastructure failure detection. Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%. The proposed framework holds potential for other pattern recognition tasks in smart-city wireless infrastructures, that would enable the monitoring, prediction and improvement of the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by IoT applications.},

abstract={In modem city management, the detection and identification of abnormal objects is particularly important. Random parking of non-motor vehicles is one of the common important problems in the process of smart city management. The traditional processing method is mainly to find abnormal targets manually and equipment, and then report to the urban management center for the next step. These methods are time consuming, laborious, and inefficient. In order to further improve the efficiency of urban management, this paper proposes an improved YOLOv3 urban management surveillance video anomaly object detection algorithm. On the basis of the original YOLOv3 framework, we use depthwise separable convolution to reduce the amount of model calculations and increase the detection speed. At the same time, the SE module is added to improve the network structure complexity and detection accuracy. Based on the actual surveillance video data, the detection speed of this algorithm is 4 fps faster than the traditional YOLOv3, and the recognition accuracy is improved by 3%.},

The healthcare system is going through a crisis. Many precautionary measures have been taken to reduce the spread of this disease where wearing a mask is one of them. In this paper, we propose a system that restrict the growth of COVID-19 by finding out people who are not wearing any facial mask in a smart city network where all the public places are monitored with Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras. While a person without a mask is detected, the corresponding authority is informed through the city network. A deep learning architecture is trained on a dataset that consists of images of people with and without masks collected from various sources. The trained architecture achieved 98.7% accuracy on distinguishing people with and without a facial mask for previously unseen test data. It is hoped that our study would be a useful tool to reduce the spread of this communicable disease for many countries in the world.},

abstract={The emergence of a massive Internet-of-Things (IoT) ecosystem is changing the human lifestyle. In several practical scenarios, IoT still faces significant challenges with reliance on human assistance and unacceptable response time for the treatment of big data. Therefore, it is very urgent to establish a new framework and algorithm to solve problems specific to this kind of fast autonomous IoT. Traditional reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have abilities of autonomous decision making, but time-consuming modeling and training procedures limit their applications. To get over this dilemma, this article proposes the broad reinforcement learning (BRL) approach that fits fast autonomous IoT as it combines the broad learning system (BLS) with a reinforcement learning paradigm to improve the agent's efficiency and accuracy of modeling and decision making. Specifically, a BRL framework is first constructed. Then, the associated learning algorithm, containing training pool introduction, training sample preparation, and incremental learning for BLS, is carefully designed. Finally, as a case study of fast autonomous IoT, the proposed BRL approach is applied to traffic light control, aiming to alleviate traffic congestion in the intersections of smart cities. The experimental results show that the proposed BRL approach can learn better action policy at a shorter execution time when compared with competing approaches.},

Behaviors such as malicious data injection can significantly impact connected vehicles. To aid in combating this threat, monitoring smart city and connected vehicle's sensor data will allow for construction of a behavioral model. Implementing machine learning will aid in constructing a standard behavior such that any device that begins to malfunction or behave maliciously can be detected and mitigated in real-time. This behavioral analysis will be further applied to supplement trust management approaches such that a more accurate value can be associated with the device's perceived trustworthiness without the need to rely on a majority consensus.},

In the first case the superposition of states or even the entanglement concepts are suitable tools for recording non - orthogonal interface parameters and resulting phase sensitivity of the respective interface. In the second approach processes on interfaces are modeled as mutual translations of specific languages.

abstract={With the continuous development of technology in the artificial intelligence era, smart city applications based on high-performance servers in large data centers have penetrated all walks of life. However, the current mainstream smart city application model is only data collection on the device side, and then calculations and inferences in the data center. Data transmission is difficult to achieve the real-time performance of the system, resulting in poor effects in many smart city applications. The intelligent perception for smart city is required to perceive the whole urban environment comprehensively. Among them, small-size pixel target detection and recognition is particularly critical. To this end, a real-time small-size pixel target perception algorithm based on embedded system for smart city is proposed, which uses lightweight neural networks and model pruning optimization to realize terminal intelligence for smart city applications, and integrates traditional machine learning filtering algorithms for improving the detection speed and the accuracy. The experimental results of the method show that the real-time performance and the accuracy of detection are greatly improved for different sizes of small-size pixel targets.},

We built ensemble machine learning models to track property ownership variance in Austin, TX, USA. Then, the study employed the long short term memory (LSTM) model as a deep learning approach to forecasting property value in the same area. For model validation, root mean squared errors were calculated in both models. To avoid underfitting or overfitting of LSTM, we experimented with specific parameters settings. Bagging-based random forest machine learning model outperformed other ensemble machine learning models. Regarding property ownership variance, the Random Forest model’s highest feature importance generally comprised the race, age of residents, land use and built environment factors, number of schools, and neighborhood location. Our LSTM model predicted Austin to retain a rising curve in housing prices and identified which part of Austin experiences an increase or decrease in property value. The predictive models may help city planners to quantify and gain insights on future impacts of developing neighborhoods.},

Many of these applications and services manage real-time data analytics with high volumes of data, thus requiring an efficient computing infrastructure. Edge computing helps to enable this scenario improving service latency and reducing network saturation. This computing paradigm consists on the deployment of numerous smaller data centers located near the data sources. The energy efficiency is a key challenge to implement this scenario, and the management of federated edge data centers would benefit from the use of microgrid energy sources parameterized by user's demands. In this research we propose an ANN predictive power model for GPU-based federated edge data centers based on data traffic demanded by the application. We validate our approach, using real traffic for a state-of-the-art driving assistance application, obtaining 1 hour ahead power predictions with a normalized root-mean-square deviation below 7.4% when compared with real measurements. Our research would help to optimize both resource management and sizing of edge federations.},

The theory of coincidence degree and inequality technique instead of the bifurcation method, are employed to prove the existence of periodic solutions for the discrete-time bidirectional neural networks. Without assuming the smoothness and boundedness of the activation functions, the easily checked conditions ensuring the existence of periodic solutions for the discrete-time bidirectional neural networks are obtained.

abstract={Air pollution in smart cities in the world has been drastically increasing lately and the increase in the concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air is a threat for the country and citizens as it can out-turn unbearable consequences such as cardiovascular disease and worsen asthma. PM2.5 is a deadly air pollutant that is a mixture of solid and liquid coarse particles and has a diameter of 2.5 micrometres. In Malaysia, traffic congestion has been the main contributor to developing air pollution in smart cities such as Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru. The systemic way of air pollution prediction using machine learning has been widely studied globally over the years and many machine learning algorithms were studied and tested to find the solution to air pollution in their country. However, very few approaches were done in Malaysia to predict air pollution using machine learning methods. This study aims to implement machine learning algorithms to find the accuracy of the prediction of particulate matter, PM2.5 in air pollution in smart cities of Malaysia. To test the implementation of machine learning in this prediction, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Random Forest are chosen and compared between these two algorithms using the Malaysia Air Pollution dataset. The outcome of this research is that Random Forest gave the best accuracy in prediction of Particulate Matter, PM2.5 Air Pollution Index in smart cities of Malaysia than MLP.},

abstract={Over the past decade, smart city applications have gained significant attention in industrial informatics. However, little attention has been given to perceiving the emotions and perceptions of citizens who have a direct impact on smart city initiatives. In this article, we propose the use of publicly available abundant social media conversations that contain contextual information encompassing citizens' emotions and perceptions, which could be considered to provide the means to feel the “emotional pulse” of a city. We propose an automated AI-based observation framework to detect the emergence of public emotions and negativity in conversations. We evaluated the applicability of the framework using 29 928 social media conversations toward the much-debated topic of self-driving vehicles which will become increasingly relevant to smart cities. The patterns and transitions of citizens' collective emotions were modeled using the Natural Language Processing and Markov models while the negativity (toxicity) in conversations was evaluated using a deep learning based classifier. The framework could be adopted by industry leaders and government officials for smart observation of citizen opinions to improve security, communication, and policymaking.},

abstract={With the fast development of smart cities and 5G, the amount of mobile data is growing exponentially. The centralized cloud computing mode is hard to support the continuous exchanging and processing of information generated by millions of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, mobile-edge computing (MEC) and software-defined networking (SDN) are introduced to form a cloud-edge-terminal collaboration network (CETCN) architecture to jointly utilize the communicational and computational resources. Although the CETCN brings many benefits, there still exist some challenges, such as the unclear operation mode, low utilization of edge resources, as well as the limited energy of terminals. To address these problems, a reinforcement learning-based joint communicational-and-computational resource allocation mechanism (RJCC) is proposed to optimize overall processing delay under energy limits. In RJCC, a Q -learning-based online offloading algorithm and a Lagrange-based migration algorithm are designed to jointly optimize computation offloading across multisegments and on edge platform, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed RJCC outperforms the delay-optimal, energy-optimal, and edge-to-terminal offloading algorithm by 42%-74% in long-term average energy consumption while maintaining relatively low delay.},

abstract={In the era of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city ecosystems, there is a need for innovative smart parking systems for more sustainable cities. With the increasing number of vehicles in the cities every year, it takes more time to find parking spaces. The solution methods developed are no longer sufficient. The time that passes while waiting for a parking space in traffic carries with it problems such as energy, environmental pollution and stress. In this study, a deep learning and cloud-based new mobile smart parking application was developed to minimize the problem of searching for parking spaces. Within the application, a service has been developed based on deep learning with Long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the parking space. Here, dynamic access is provided to the LSTM-based model previously created through the mobile device of the user, and the process of displaying the occupancy rates of the parks at the desired place is accomplished on the mobile device by entering the relevant parameters. By this means, both energy and time savings have been achieved. With the real-time car parking data collected in the city of Istanbul in Turkey, high accuracy results were obtained. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model proposed, it was compared with the Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and ARIMA methods. The results have confirmed the high accuracy and reliability that was promised.},

abstract={The increase in the number world population of elderly citizens, as well as those who live in solitude, needs an immediate solution with an intelligent monitoring system at home. In this work, we present an intelligent fall-detection system based on IoT to monitor the elderly with your privacy-protected. Currently, fall detection has attracted significant research attention and deep learning has shown promising performance in this task using conventional cameras. However, these traditional methods pose a risk of the leakage of personal privacy. This work proposes a novel fall-detection system that uses a continuous-wave Doppler radar sensor to acquisition the elderly movements and sends this information thought the internet to a server with deep learning using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that identifies the fall. The radar sensor is inexpensive, completely camera-free, and collects no personally identifiable information, thereby allaying privacy concerns. Additionally, unlike traditional cameras, it has environmental robustness and dark/light-independence. The proposed system obtained 99.9% accuracy in detecting falls by using the GoogleNet convolutional neural network. The proposed system is also capable of detecting other types of movements in addition to those tested, including the detection of diseases such as COVID-19 through the cough movement.},

abstract={Traffic congestion is a major issue for developed countries; therefore, research into the prediction of road traffic flow is vital. Deep neural networks, such as deep recurrent neural networks, are now being explored for road traffic flow prediction. However, what deep architecture is the most appropriate remains unanswered. Previous research into deep recurrent neural networks fails to compare them to other deep models; instead, comparisons are made with simple shallow models. To compound this issue, standard performance metrics assess a model's success solely on its accuracy. No consideration is given to computational cost. Furthermore, optimisation of a neural network's architecture can be difficult. There is no standard or analytical method to determine their correct structure. This often leads to sub-optimal architectures being used. Therefore, deep neural networks should be assessed on how sensitive the model is to architectural changes. In this paper, we have examined three recurrent neural networks (a standard recurrent, a long short-term memory, and a gated recurrent unit) to determine how they perform on time-series data based on a real dataset. We compared their accuracy, training time, and sensitivity to architectural change. Additionally, we developed a new performance metrics, Standardised Accuracy and Time Score (STATS), which standardises the accuracy and training time into a comparable score, allowing an overall score to be awarded. The experimental results show that, based on the STATS, the gated recurrent unit produced the highest overall performance and accuracy score. Furthermore, its prediction was most stable against architectural changes. Conversely, the long short-term memory was the least stable model.},

abstract={Predicting urban congregations can help in monitoring a variety of unusual group events, which is of great importance to public safety and traffic management in smart cities. However, it is very challenging because of complicated spatio-temporal correlations. In this article, we propose a deep neural network-based model, entitled CgNet, for urban congregations prediction. Firstly, we design three types of flows to present dependencies between regions among different timestamps to model the mobility of individuals. Secondly, CgNet utilizes four components, including spatial feature extraction, temporal feature extraction, external factors fusion and congregation feature fusion to collaboratively predict congregations. The combination of these components is capable of not only capturing the spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously, but also learning the essential relationships between three flows and congregations in each region at different stages. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of CgNet with extensive experimental study on real taxi trajectory data. The results demonstrate the advantages of our model beyond several baselines.},

abstract={Massive devices connected through fifth-generation (5G) networks constitute a ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT), providing diverse service applications in a smart city. A robust network topology structure against cyber-attacks is the foundation of highly reliable service quality, especially in next-generation networks or beyond 5G (B5G) networks. Existing methods apply neural networks with deep reinforcement learning methods to advance the network topology. However, the reduction of unique hardware resource constraints and the application of edge intelligent networking capability of terminal nodes are emerging challenges for robustness optimization of IoT with 5G and B5G networks. To address these problems, we design a distributed learning framework utilizing edge intelligence, improving smart terminal nodes' networking capability, which is deployed on ordinary computers instead of specialized hardware such as GPUs. The proposed framework leveraging multi-core CPU and intelligent edge methods decreases the training time and economic cost and takes full advantage of computer resources. Furthermore, the best performing framework considers the distributed communication model of edge computing and optimizes the network topology by taking advantage of smart terminal nodes' contributions. We show that the framework succeeds in various topologies and outperforms compared with other state-of-art algorithms in improving the robustness for IoT topology in smart cities.},

abstract={Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are critical to any smart city strategy. They are used to optimize the flow of urban traffic which in turn leads to a reduction in time spent traveling. In order for ITS to work properly, sensors that collect real-time traffic flow information from streets and highways are required so the ITS can know the current state of the traffic. However, such sensors are prone to failures and network faults. This poses a serious hindrance when performing data analysis and knowledge extraction on sensor data due to the fact that such data is composed of noisy and missing values. In this work, we benchmark several deep learning based methods for filling missing values in a dataset collected from 2013 to 2015 in the city of Oporto, Portugal. The dataset is composed of readings of 26 sensors that measure traffic information in 5 minute intervals. Around 12% of all values are missing.},

Sentiment analysis of such large-scale visual content, such as those in image tweets, helps to obtain user sentiments toward events or topics and therefore complement textual sentiment analysis. Motivated by the need to leverage large scale yet noisy training data to solve the extremely challenging problem of face sentiment analysis, we employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

abstract={Deep learning techniques have been widely applied to traffic flow prediction, considering underlying routine patterns, and multiple context factors (e.g., time and weather). However, the complex spatio-temporal dependencies between inherent traffic patterns and multiple disturbances have not been fully addressed. In this paper, we propose a two-phase end-to-end deep learning framework, namely DeepSTD to uncover the spatio-temporal disturbances (STD) to predict the citywide traffic flow. In the STD Modeling phase, we propose an STD modeling method to model both the different regional disturbances caused by various region functions and the spatio-temporal propagating effects. In the Prediction phase, we eliminate the STD from the historical traffic flow to enhance the leaning of inherent traffic patterns and combine the STD at the prediction time interval to consider the future disturbances. The experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DeepSTD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={Adaptive traffic signal control is one key avenue for mitigating the growing consequences of traffic congestion. Incumbent solutions such as SCOOT and SCATS require regular and time-consuming calibration, can't optimise well for multiple road use modalities, and require the manual curation of many implementation plans.A recent alternative to these approaches are deep reinforcement learning algorithms, in which an agent learns how to take the most appropriate action for a given state of the system. This is guided by neural networks approximating a reward function that provides feedback to the agent regarding the performance of the actions taken, making it sensitive to the specific reward function chosen. Several authors have surveyed the reward functions used in the literature, but attributing outcome differences to reward function choice across works is problematic as there are many uncontrolled differences, as well as different outcome metrics.This paper compares the performance of agents using different reward functions in a simulation of a junction in Greater Manchester, UK, across various demand profiles, subject to real world constraints: realistic sensor inputs, controllers, calibrated demand, intergreen times and stage sequencing. The reward metrics considered are based on the time spent stopped, lost time, change in lost time, average speed, queue length, junction throughput and variations of these magnitudes. The performance of these reward functions is compared in terms of total waiting time. We find that speed maximisation resulted in the lowest average waiting times across all demand levels, displaying significantly better performance than other rewards previously introduced in the literature.},

Familiarity with these issues allows assess and understand the state of science in this field, which covers various aspects of the design, organization and operation of a smart city. As a result, the article gives presentation of different approach to smart cities creation. The authors urge to study in more detail certain aspects of the smart cities information technologies: digital economy, urban operating system, green energy, standards for transport movement, urban ecology. The article noted that today analysts are still discussing many proposed models and possible ways of transition to Smart City. The role of the Internet platforms in Smart Cities and various approaches to the implementation of the Smart City platforms themselves are shown. The paper compares various international approaches for smart cities creation and suggests that using project management methodologies is the best way for that goal. Project management allows maintain a balance between the total control of urban infrastructure and the right of residents for privacy. Meanwhile, many of us already live in a world of automated systems that manage urban infrastructure. The study emphasized ready-made information solutions exist that analyze large amounts of data using analytical forecasts and machine learning algorithms. In conclusion, it is noted that the main goal is that the introduction of the concept of smart cities should become a tool for the sustainable development of humankind while preserving the possibilities of freedom of choice and the inviolability of private life for a person, not transfer these functions to artificial intelligence.},

abstract={Predicting sentiments of multimodal microblogs composed of text, image, and emoticon have attracted ever-increasing research focus recently. The key challenge lies in the difficulty of collecting a sufficient amount of training labels to train a discriminative model for multimodal prediction. One potential solution is to exploit the labels collected from social media users, which is, however, restricted by the negative effect of label noise. Besides, we have quantitatively found that sentiments in different modalities may be independent, which disables the usage of previous multimodal sentiment analysis schemes in our problem. In this paper, we introduce a weakly supervised multimodal deep learning (WS-MDL) scheme toward robust and scalable sentiment prediction. WS-MDL learns convolutional neural networks iteratively and selectively from “weak” emoticon labels, which are cheaply available and noise containing. In particular, to filter out the label noise and to capture the modality dependency, a probabilistic graphical model is introduced to simultaneously learn discriminative multimodal descriptors and infer the confidence of label noise. Extensive evaluations are conducted in a million-scale, real-world microblog sentiment dataset crawled from Sina Weibo. We have validated the merits of the proposed scheme by quantitatively showing its superior performance over several state-of-the-art and alternative approaches.},

abstract={In many developing countries, rapid urbanisation of cities coupled with the lack of proper urban planning has made various streets susceptible to waterlogging during heavy rains. This severely affects the traffic movement across an entire city and leads to disruption in work. Since an important component of smart cities is developing an efficient urban mobility system, the authors have developed a method which helps in detection of areas prone to waterlogging and prediction of severity of waterlogging in these areas in the future. The areas susceptible to waterlogging are detected with the help of elevation of the area and the past travel time data. Elevation of an area is an indicator of the level or height of an area, so the low-lying areas are more prone to accumulation of water when it rains. Similarly, the past travel time data of an area also serves as a measure to find out the intensity of water logging as the larger the accumulation of water in an area, the more is the travel time. The past data pertaining to waterlogging severity in an area with respect to parameters such as the amount of rainfall and day of the week is used to train a neural network, which is then used to predict the possibility of waterlogging and its intensity in that area in the future.},

abstract={The deep learning technique has proven to be effective in the classification and localization of objects on the image or ground plane over time. The strength of the technique's features has enabled researchers to analyze object trajectories across multiple cameras for online multi-object tracking (MOT) systems. In the past five years, these technical features have gained a reputation in handling several real-time multiple object tracking challenges. This contributed to the increasing number of proposed deep learning methods (DLMs) and networks seen by the computer vision community. The technique efficiently handled various challenges in real-time MOT systems and improved overall tracking performance. However, it experienced difficulties in the detection and tracking of objects in overcrowded scenes and motion variations and confused appearance variations. Therefore, in this paper, we summarize and analyze the 95 contributions made in the past five years on deep learning-based online MOT methods and networks that rank highest in the public benchmark. We review their expedition, performance, advantages, and challenges under different experimental setups and tracking conditions. We also further categorize these methods and networks into four main themes: Online MOT Based Detection Quality and Associations, Real-Time MOT with High-Speed Tracking and Low Computational Costs, Modeling Target Uncertainty in Online MOT, and Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), Affinity and Data Association. Finally, we discuss the ongoing challenges and directions for future research.},

abstract={Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) plays a vital role in the performance of machine learning algorithms. When the algorithm is complex or the dataset is large, the computational cost of algorithm evaluation is very high, which is a major challenge for HPO. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning optimization method for efficient hyperparameter tuning. In particular, an RL agent selects hyperparameters sequentially, thus the search space is greatly reduced. The k-fold cross-validation result is used as a reward signal to update the agent. To speed up the training of the agent, we employ a predictive model to evaluate an algorithm with the selected hyperparameters. However, model inaccuracy is further exacerbated by long-horizon rollout, resulting in collapse performance. We employ a straightforward method to discipline the model rollout in short-horizon. After the short-horizon model rollout, the model is trained again with new samples. The model training and the model rollout are alternately repeated. To fast adapt to new tasks, meta-learning is used to train the predictive model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. We evaluate our approach on 25 datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that with the limited resources, our method can significantly improve the efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian methods and evolution method.},

Although the related technologies have been developed rapidly and many solid achievements have been already obtained, there is still a lot of space to deeply enhance the related research including the recognition structures, algorithms, and so on, to meet the increasing requirements of Smart City construction. In this article, we first review the conventional HBR structure, and analyze the problems and challenges for future smart city applications. Then a parallel and multi-layer deep recognition architecture (PMDRA) is discussed, which could have more powerful and ubiquitous feature extraction ability because of the hierarchical utilization of the deep learning network.

abstract={As an industrial application of Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the most crucial techniques for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), which is a basic element of smart cities. The primary issue for the deployment of ITS based on IoV is the security for both users and infrastructures. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is important for IoV users to keep them away from various attacks via the malware and ensure the security of users and infrastructures. In this paper, we design a data-driven IDS by analyzing the link load behaviors of the Road Side Unit (RSU) in the IoV against various attacks leading to the irregular fluctuations of traffic flows. A deep learning architecture based on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to extract the features of link loads, and detect the intrusion aiming at RSUs. The proposed architecture is composed of a traditional CNN and a fundamental error term in view of the convergence of the backpropagation algorithm. Meanwhile, a theoretical analysis of the convergence is provided by the probabilistic representation for the proposed CNN-based deep architecture. We finally evaluate the accuracy of our method by way of implementing it over the testbed.},

abstract={Finding a parking slot in the city centre has always been a great challenge. In many cases, drivers spend a lot of time roaming around looking for an empty and suitable parking slot. The emerging machine learning technologies in intelligent transport system has made it more flexible for Electric Autonomous Vehicle (EAV) to find a parking slot and get parked. The Long-range Autonomous Valet Parking (LAVP) allows an EAV to drop user at a suitable drop-off spot and select an economical parking slot. With the evolution of battery operated vehicles, the primary concern is efficient use of battery resources. This can be done either by maximizing battery capacity or by smartly using battery with existing capacity. During the parking process, most of the energy is consumed by finding an optimal path to parking slot. The work proposed in this paper guides EAV from a random starting point to nearest drop-off spot and CP. A Reinforcement Learning based Autonomous Valet Parking technique (RL-LAVP) has been designed to guide EAV to drop-off spot, CP and minimize the total distance covered during this process. The RL-LAVP results show a significant improvement towards minimizing covered distance and consumed energy when compared with RaNdom (RN) parking and LAVP parking techniques.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a shifting paradigm that allows the integration of billions of devices with the Internet. With its wide range of application domains, including smart cities, smart homes, and e-health, the IoT has created new challenges, particularly security threats. Traditional security solutions, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, need amending to fit the new networking paradigm. Given the recent advances in machine learning, we investigated the use of deep learning algorithms for anomaly detection. The IoT collects a massive amount of data from the environment, and deep learning is based on a set of algorithms striving for the data. Intrusion detection systems are used to expose network threats and are an effective means of protecting network assets. Anomaly detection is a conventional intrusion detection approach that separates normal and abnormal network traffic using statistical, rule-based, or machine learning models. Of the machine learning models, deep learning is a neural network algorithm that has provided breakthroughs in domains such as object and voice recognition. However, there are limitations in applying deep learning to network anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel anomaly detection framework based on unsupervised deep learning algorithms for revealing network threats. Our research explores the applicability of deep learning to detect anomalies by evaluating the use of Restricted Boltzmann machines as generative energy-based models against Autoencoders as non-probabilistic algorithms. The study provides an in-depth analysis of unsupervised deep learning algorithms. The simulations studies show $\approx$ 99% detection accuracy, which is significantly improved compared to the closely related work.},

However, the use of ML algorithms to gain insight on prosumer behavior and characteristics raises not only numerous technical but also legal concerns. This paper maps electricity prosumer concerns towards the AMI and its ML based analytical tools in terms of data protection, privacy and cybersecurity and conducts a legal analysis of the identified prosumer concerns within the context of the EU regulatory frameworks. By mapping the concerns referred to in the technical literature, the main aim of the paper is to provide a legal perspective on those concerns.

abstract={Nowadays, road maps play a key role in our society. Therefore, keeping those maps up-to-date is highly important. The extraction of road networks from satellite imagery is a complex problem, not only because of occlusions, shadows produced by non-road objects, but also due to the limited spatial resolution of the imagery used. The feasibility to detect a road depends on its width, which can reach sub-pixel size in some satellite products. In the last decade, many attempts have been carried out to automatize this labour. However, the vast majority of methods rely on aerial imagery, whose costs are not yet affordable for maintaining up-to-date maps. This work demonstrates that it is also possible to accurately detect roads using freely available Sentinel-2 imagery, regardless of their width. For that purpose, a new deep learning architecture which combines semantic segmentation and super-resolution techniques is proposed. As a result, fine-grained road network maps at 2.5 m are generated from 10 m imagery taken as input. To evaluate this proposal a data-set composed of 20 cities spread across the Spanish territory is used.},
