abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) offers new opportunities, innovations and potential for entrepreneurs and existing businesses. Many early-movers deliver better quality, superior services and gain customers as a result. This paper presents an IoT &amp; mobile-based system for business. It was designed and developed in the form of a case study of a quick service restaurant. The Raspberry Pi 3B+ running on Raspbian OS is used as a server. The client side involves the use of mobile devices. The system supports the full features of two approaches including Internet and non-internet model. In the Internet model, the Raspberry Pi server is able to connect to the world through an Internet connection and gateway using the mobile hotspot (3G/4G mobile data plan) of the restaurant's mobile. The evaluation consists of three dimensions - usability, functionality and security. The results reveal that all the dimensions were evaluated at a high level. The restaurant owner and customers were highly satisfied with the system.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications are increasingly used in domains critical for society and adapted to individual needs. Thereby, various physical entities, humans and computer programs are dynamically networked while being situated in different locations. For system stakeholders, reliable operation requires intelligible design and adaptability at run time. The more users can adjust IoT systems dynamically, the more transparent has to be how specific requirements can be met. Executable and role-specific process models are a viable starting point, as they represent the behavior of components and the flow of control. However, they need to be extended with effective data exchange mechanisms between IoT system elements. In this paper, we utilize the subject-oriented concept and notation for role-specific process modeling and communication design of IoT systems and enrich them with a data sharing facility, so-called shared input pools. In order to avoid a single point of failure in system operation, we propose to implement them as blockchains. IoT-elements can then interact and exchange data in a semantically correct and robust way, in particular when behavior changes may occur dynamically.},

abstract = {Management Flight Simulators (MFS) supply a simulated environment in which managers can learn from experience in a controlled setting. Although its use is usual in other areas, no such software has been developed to learn about the complexity of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) management. This paper describes an MFS of ICUs which includes main features that distinguish it from other simulators such as the evolution of patients' health status and the recreation of real discharge and admission processes. The mathematical model is a discrete event simulation model in which different types of patients arrive at the ICU (emergency and scheduled patients). The user manages the simulated ICU by deciding about their admission or diversion and which inpatients are discharged. The analysis of recorded data is used to detect controversial scenarios and to understand how physicians' decisions are made.},

abstract = {Although computer scientists are eager to help address social problems, the field faces a growing awareness that many well-intentioned applications of algorithms in social contexts have led to significant harm. We argue that addressing this gap between the field's desire to do good and the harmful impacts of many of its interventions requires looking to the epistemic and methodological underpinnings of algorithms. We diagnose the dominant mode of algorithmic reasoning as "algorithmic formalism" and describe how formalist orientations lead to harmful algorithmic interventions. Addressing these harms requires pursuing a new mode of algorithmic thinking that is attentive to the internal limits of algorithms and to the social concerns that fall beyond the bounds of algorithmic formalism. To understand what a methodological evolution beyond formalism looks like and what it may achieve, we turn to the twentieth century evolution in American legal thought from legal formalism to legal realism. Drawing on the lessons of legal realism, we propose a new mode of algorithmic thinking---"algorithmic realism"---that provides tools for computer scientists to account for the realities of social life and of algorithmic impacts. These realist approaches, although not foolproof, will better equip computer scientists to reduce algorithmic harms and to reason well about doing good.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Musical Things (IoMusT) emerges, audio-specific operating systems (OSs) are required on embedded hardware to ease development and portability of IoMusT applications. Despite the increasing importance of IoMusT applications, in this article, we show that there is no OS able to fulfill the diverse requirements of IoMusT systems. To address such a gap, we propose the Elk Audio OS as a novel and open source OS in this space. It is a Linux-based OS optimized for ultra-low-latency and high-performance audio and sensor processing on embedded hardware, as well as for handling wireless connectivity to local and remote networks. Elk Audio OS uses the Xenomai real-time kernel extension, which makes it suitable for the most demanding of low-latency audio tasks. We provide the first comprehensive overview of Elk Audio OS, describing its architecture and the key components of interest to potential developers and users. We explain operational aspects like the configuration of the architecture and the control mechanisms of the internal sound engine, as well as the tools that enable an easier and faster development of connected musical devices. Finally, we discuss the implications of Elk Audio OS, including the development of an open source community around it.},

abstract = {Predictions of people's behaviour increasingly drive interactions with a new generation of IoT services designed to support everyday life in the home, from shopping to heating. Based on the premise that such automation is difficult due to the contingent nature of people's practices, in this work we explore the nature of these contingencies in depth. We have designed and conducted a technology probe that made use of simple linear predictions as a provocation, and invited people to track the life of their household essentials over a two-month period. Through a mixed-method approach we demonstrate the challenges of simple predictions, and in turn identify eight categories of contingencies that influenced prediction accuracy. We discuss strategies for how designers of future predictive IoT systems may take the contingencies into account by removing, hiding, revealing, managing, or exploiting the system uncertainty at the core of the issue.},

abstract = {Self-powered systems running on scavenged energy will be a key enabler for pervasive computing across the Internet of Things. The variability of input power in energy-harvesting systems limits the effectiveness of static optimizations aimed at maximizing the input-energy-to-computation ratio. We show that the resultant gap between available and exploitable energy is significant, and that energy storage optimizations alone do not significantly close the gap. We characterize these effects on a real, fabricated energy-harvesting system based on a nonvolatile processor. We introduce a unified energy-oriented approach to first optimize the number of backups, by more aggressively using the stored energy available when power failure occurs, and then optimize forward progress via improving the rate of input energy to computation via dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and self-learning techniques. We evaluate combining these schemes and show capture of up to 75.5% of all input energy toward processor computation, an average of 1.54 \texttimes{} increase over the best static “Forward Progress” baseline system. Notably, our energy-optimizing policy combinations simultaneously improve both the rate of forward progress and the rate of backup events (by up to 60.7% and 79.2% for RF power, respectively, and up to 231.2% and reduced to zero, respectively, for solar power). This contrasts with static frequency optimization approaches in which these two metrics are antagonistic.},

abstract = {Signal strength maps are of great importance to cellular providers for network planning and operation, however they are expensive to obtain and possibly limited or inaccurate in some locations. In this paper, we develop a prediction framework based on random forests to improve signal strength maps from limited measurements. First, we propose a random forests (RFs)-based predictor, with a rich set of features including location as well as time, cell ID, device hardware and other features. We show that our RFs-based predictor can significantly improve the tradeoff between prediction error and number of measurements needed compared to state-of-the-art data-driven predictors, i.e., requiring 80% less measurements for the same prediction accuracy, or reduces the relative error by 17% for the same number of measurements. Second, we leverage two types of real-world LTE RSRP datasets to evaluate into the performance of different prediction methods: (i) a small but dense Campus dataset, collected on a university campus and (ii) several large but sparser NYC and LA datasets, provided by a mobile data analytics company.},

abstract = {Many research and industrial communities are betting on LoRa to provide reliable, long-range communication for the Internet of Things. This new radio technology, however, provides widely heterogeneous coverage; a LoRa link may span hundreds of meters or tens of kilometers, depending on the surrounding environment. This high variability is not captured by popular channel models for LoRa, and on-site measurements---a common alternative---are impractical due to the large geographical areas involved.We propose a novel, automated approach to estimate the coverage of LoRa gateways prior to deployment and without on-site measurements. We achieve this goal by combining free, readily-available multispectral images from remote sensing with the right channel model. Our processing toolchain automatically classifies the type of environment (e.g., buildings, trees, or open fields) traversed by a link, with high accuracy (&gt;90%) and spatial resolution (10X10m2). We use this information to explain the attenuation observed in experiments. As signal attenuation is not well captured by popular channel models, we focus on the Okumura-Hata empirical model, hitherto largely unexplored for LoRa, and show that i) it yields estimates very close to our observations, and ii) we can use our toolchain to automatically select and configure its parameters. A validation on 8,000+ samples from a real dataset shows that our automated approach predicts the expected signal power within a ~10dBm error, against the 20--40dBm of popular channel models.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of DNA-sequencing technologies motivates more personalized and predictive genetic-oriented services, which further attract individuals to increasingly release their genome information to learn about personalized medicines, disease predispositions, genetic compatibilities, etc. Individual genome information is notoriously privacy-sensitive and highly associated with relatives. In this paper, we present an inference attack algorithm to predict target genotypes and phenotypes based on belief propagation in factor graphs. With this algorithm, an attacker can effectively predict the target genotypes and phenotypes of target individuals based on genome information shared by individuals or their relatives, and genotype and phenotype association from genome-wide association study (GWAS). To address the privacy threats resulted from such inference attacks, we elaborate the metrics to evaluate data utility and privacy and then present a data sanitization method. We evaluate our inference attack algorithm and data sanitization method on real GWAS dataset: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) case/control dataset. The evaluation results show that our work can effectively defense against genome threats while guaranteeing data utility.},

This indicates that corresponding risks will be seen in LDCs. The rise of digitalization may override developing country's opportunities to elevate itself from a low-income country to a middle or high-income country. In the aftermath of World War II, western society tried to support LDCs in maintain the principles of a free world system and contribute to reducing poverty through market oriented development. Since the end of Cold War, defense of the free world has lost its significance but economy is getting more important political instrument.

As artificial intelligence solutions take on increasingly important roles in decision-making and interaction, they have the potential to impact fair treatment of people with disabilities in society both positively and negatively. We describe some of the opportunities and risks across four emerging AI application areas: employment, education, public safety, and healthcare, identified in a workshop with participants experiencing a range of disabilities. In many existing situations, non-AI solutions are already discriminatory, and introducing AI runs the risk of simply perpetuating and replicating these flaws. We next discuss strategies for supporting fairness in the context of disability throughout the AI development lifecycle. AI systems should be reviewed for potential impact on the user in their broader context of use. They should offer opportunities to redress errors, and for users and those impacted to raise fairness concerns. People with disabilities should be included when sourcing data to build models, and in testing, to create a more inclusive and robust system. Finally, we offer pointers into an established body of literature on human-centered design processes and philosophies that may assist AI and ML engineers in innovating algorithms that reduce harm and ultimately enhance the lives of people with disabilities.},

Healthcare is not an exception and uses data analytics for some of its capabilities such as detecting diseases and diagnose patients at early stages, identifying high-risk patients and providing them treatment to reduce unnecessary hospitalization or readmission. However, the existing and expected increase of connected devices poses several challenges for data analysis, especially with little work being done to address them. Therefore, this paper brings together some of these challenges that needs to be addressed and some of the proposed solutions. We performed a review of some of the studies in the literature with a view of providing research directions for researchers.},

abstract = {Addressing ethical issues arising from AI research, and by extension from most areas of Data Science, is a core challenge in both the academic and industry worlds. The nature of research and the specific set of technical skills involved imply that AI and Data Science researchers are not equipped to identify and anticipate such issues arising, or to establish solutions at the time a specific research project is being designed. In this paper, we discuss the need for a methodology for ethical research design that involves a broader set of skills from the start of the project. We specifically identify, from the relevant literature, a set of requirements that we argue to be needed for such a methodology. We then explore two case studies where such ethical considerations have been explored in conjunction with the development of specific research projects, in order to validate those assumptions and generalise them into a set of principles guiding an "Ethics by Design" method for conducting AI and Data Science research.},

Crowded spectrum is creating realistic bottlenecks in the deployment of Wi-Fi, some of which can be well alleviated by the Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) technology. High transmission rate, wide bandwidth, no electromagnetic interference, and no health hazards have made Li-Fi an attractive technique for future smallcell communication. The emerging standardization of visible light communication (VLC) facilitates the acceleration of the development of Li-Fi technology and will eventually deliver real-world Li-Fi deployments.

abstract = {Mobile edge computing and network function virtualization (NFV) paradigms enable new flexibility and possibilities of the deployment of extreme low-latency services for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications within the proximity of their users. However, this poses great challenges to find optimal placements of virtualized network functions (VNFs) for data processing requests of IoT applications in a multi-tier cloud network, which consists of many small- or medium-scale servers, clusters, or cloudlets deployed within the proximity of IoT nodes and a few large-scale remote data centers with abundant computing and storage resources. In particular, it is challenging to jointly consider VNF instance placement and routing traffic path planning for user requests, as they are not only delay sensitive but also resource hungry.In this article, we consider admissions of NFV-enabled requests of IoT applications in a multi-tier cloud network, where users request network services by issuing service requests with service chain requirements, and the service chain enforces the data traffic of the request to pass through the VNFs in the chain one by one until it reaches its destination. To this end, we first formulate the throughput maximization problem with the aim to maximize the system throughput. We then propose an integer linear program solution if the problem size is small; otherwise, we devise an efficient heuristic that jointly takes into account VNF placements to both cloudlets and data centers and routing path finding for each request. For a special case of the problem with a set of service chains, we propose an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio. Next, we also devise efficient learning-based heuristics for VNF provisioning for IoT applications by incorporating the mobility and energy conservation features of IoT devices. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms by simulations. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms is promising.},

abstract = {In large and medium-sized cities, detecting unusual changes of crowds of people on the streets is needed for public security, transportation management, emergency control, and terrorism prevention. As public transportation has the capability to bring a large number of people to an area in a short amount of time, real-time discovery of anomalies in passenger numbers is an effective way to detect crowd anomalies. In this paper, we devise an approach called Kochab. Kochab adopts a generative model and combines the prior knowledge about passenger flows. Hence, it can detect anomalies in the numbers of incoming and outgoing passengers within a certain time and spatial area, including anomalous events along with their durations and severities. Through well-designed inference algorithms, Kochab requires only a moderate amount of historical data to be sample data. As such, Kochab shows good performance in real time and makes prompt responses to user' s interactive analysis requests. In particular, based on the recognized anomalous events, we capture event patterns which give us hints to link to activities or status in cities. In addition, for the convenience of method evaluation and comparison, we create an open Stream Anomaly Benchmark on the basis of large-scale real-world data. This benchmark will prove useful for other researchers too. Using this benchmark, we compare Kochab with four other methods. The experimental results show that Kochab is sensitive to population flow anomalies and has superior accuracy in detecting anomalies in terms of precision, recall and the F1 score.},

This paper describes a unique month-long workshop that convened interdisciplinary experts to collaborate on projects related to flood data. In addition to findings about the practical accomplishment of interdisciplinary collaboration, we offer three interrelated contributions. First, we position interdisciplinarity as a critical practice and offer a detailed example of how we staged this process. We then discuss the benefits to interdisciplinarity of expanding the range of temporal logics normally deployed in design workshops. Finally, we reflect on approaches to evaluating the event's contributions toward sustained critique and reform of expert practice.},

abstract = {Traffic accidents considerably hinder transportation in urban centres, bringing high socio-economic costs. More importantly, an accident can severely compromise the health and lives of individuals. Minimizing the access time of an emergency response vehicle (ERV) to an accident site reduces damages, losses, and costs considerably. Traffic management systems (TMS) solutions ease the traffic congestion levels through recommended alternative re-routed paths. However, even though TMS might positively and indirectly aid ERV access, there is no focus on efficiently reducing ERV access time. Thus, a VANET-based approach is proposed to facilitate the timely arrival of an ERV to a destination. The approach uses multi-hop, ad-hoc messages between ordinary connected vehicles, the network edge, and ERVs to communicate details on an accident and coordinate a response. Results show that accident resolution can outperform congestion mitigation methods and demonstrate that ERV selection based on proximity reduces response time.},

abstract = {Time-sync comments (TSCs) reveal a new way of extracting the online video tags. However, such TSCs have lots of noises due to users’ diverse comments, introducing great challenges for accurate and fast video tag extractions. In this article, we propose an unsupervised video tag extraction algorithm named Semantic Weight-Inverse Document Frequency (SW-IDF). Specifically, we first generate corresponding semantic association graph (SAG) using semantic similarities and timestamps of the TSCs. Second, we propose two graph cluster algorithms, i.e., dialogue-based algorithm and topic center-based algorithm, to deal with the videos with different density of comments. Third, we design a graph iteration algorithm to assign the weight to each comment based on the degrees of the clustered subgraphs, which can differentiate the meaningful comments from the noises. Finally, we gain the weight of each word by combining Semantic Weight (SW) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). In this way, the video tags are extracted automatically in an unsupervised way. Extensive experiments have shown that SW-IDF (dialogue-based algorithm) achieves 0.4210 F1-score and 0.4932 MAP (Mean Average Precision) in high-density comments, 0.4267 F1-score and 0.3623 MAP in low-density comments; while SW-IDF (topic center-based algorithm) achieves 0.4444 F1-score and 0.5122 MAP in high-density comments, 0.4207 F1-score and 0.3522 MAP in low-density comments. It has a better performance than the state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms in both F1-score and MAP.},

abstract = {The law and ethics of Western democratic states have their basis in liberalism. This extends to regulation and ethical discussion of technology and businesses doing data processing. Liberalism relies on the privacy and autonomy of individuals, their ordering through a public market, and, more recently, a measure of equality guaranteed by the state. We argue that these forms of regulation and ethical analysis are largely incompatible with the techno-political and techno-economic dimensions of artificial intelligence. By analyzing liberal regulatory solutions in the form of privacy and data protection, regulation of public markets, and fairness in AI, we expose how the data economy and artificial intelligence have transcended liberal legal imagination. Organizations use artificial intelligence to exceed the bounded rationality of individuals and each other. This has led to the private consolidation of markets and an unequal hierarchy of control operating mainly for the purpose of shareholder value. An artificial intelligence will be only as ethical as the purpose of the social system that operates it. Inspired by the science of artificial life as an alternative to artificial intelligence, we consider data intermediaries: sociotechnical systems composed of individuals associated around collectively pursued purposes. An attention cooperative, that prioritizes its incoming and outgoing data flows, is one model of a social system that could form and maintain its own autonomous purpose.},

abstract = {Internet-enabled devices operating in the physical world are increasingly integrated in modern distributed systems. We focus on systems where the dynamics of spatial distribution is crucial; in such cases, devices may need to carry out complex computations (e.g., analyses) to check satisfaction of spatial requirements. The requirements are partly global—as the overall system should achieve certain goals—and partly individual, as each entity may have different goals. Assurance may be achieved by keeping a model of the system at runtime, monitoring events that lead to changes in the spatial environment, and performing requirements analysis. However, computationally intensive runtime spatial analysis cannot be supported by resource-constrained devices and may be offloaded to the cloud. In such a scenario, multiple challenges arise regarding resource allocation, cost, performance, among other dimensions. In particular, when the workload is unknown at the system’s design time, it may be difficult to guarantee application-service-level agreements, e.g., on response times. To address and reason on these challenges, we first instantiate complex computations as microservices and integrate them to an IoT-cloud architecture. Then, we propose alternative cloud deployments for such an architecture—based on virtual machines, containers, and the recent Functions-as-a-Service paradigm. Finally, we assess the feasibility and tradeoffs of the different deployments in terms of scalability, performance, cost, resource utilization, and more. We adopt a workload scenario from a known dataset of taxis roaming in Beijing, and we derive other workloads to represent unexpected request peaks and troughs. The approach may be replicated in the design process of similar classes of spatially distributed IoT systems.},

However, with increased utilization of third-party components distributed as images, the potential vulnerabilities in microservice-based systems increase. Based on component dependency, such vulnerabilities can lead to exposing a system's critical assets. Similar problems have been addressed by the computer networks community. In this paper, we propose utilizing attack graphs in the continuous delivery infrastructure of microservices-based systems. To that end, we relate microservices to network nodes and automatically generate attack graphs that help practitioners identify, analyze, and prevent plausible attack paths in their microservice-based container networks. We present a complete solution that can be easily embedded in continuous delivery systems and demonstrate its efficiency and scalability based on real-world use cases.},

Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) it is effective: it operates on semi-infinite collections of co-evolving streams and summarizes all the streams into a set of multiple discrete segments grouped by their similarities. (b) it is automatic: it automatically and incrementally recognizes such patterns and generates models for each of them if necessary; (c) it is scalable: the complexity of our method does not depend on the length of the data streams. Our extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that StreamScope can find meaningful patterns and achieve great improvements in terms of computational time and memory space over its full batch method competitors.},

abstract = {Continuous vision is the cornerstone of a diverse range of intelligent applications found on emerging computing platforms such as autonomous machines and Augmented Reality glasses. A critical issue in today's continuous vision systems is their long end-to-end frame latency, which significantly impacts the system agility and user experience. We find that the long latency is fundamentally caused by the serialized execution model of today's continuous vision pipeline, whose key stages, including sensing, imaging, and vision computations, execute sequentially, leading to long frame latency.This paper seeks to reduce the end-to-end latency of continuous vision tasks. Our key idea is a new proactive vision execution model that breaks the sequential execution of the vision pipeline. Specifically, we propose to allow the pipeline front-end (sensing and imaging) to predict future frames; the pipeline back-end (vision algorithms) then predictively operates on the future frames to reduce frame latency. While the proactive execution model is generally applicable to any vision systems, we demonstrate its effectiveness using an implementation on resource-constrained mobile Systems-on-a-chips (SoC). Our system, PVF, incorporates two techniques to overcome key challenges that arise in deploying proactive vision in mobile systems: it enables multiple outstanding speculative frames by exploiting the hardware heterogeneities in mobile SoCs; it reduces the energy overhead of prediction by exploiting the error-resilient nature of vision algorithms. We show that PVF reduces the frame latency by up to 92% under the same energy.},

abstract = {Collaborative work with data is increasingly common and spans a broad range of activities - from creating or analysing data in a team, to sharing it with others, to reusing someone else's data in a new context. In this paper, we explore collaboration practices around structured data and how they are supported by current technology. We present the results of an interview study with twenty data practitioners, from which we derive four high-level user needs for tool support. We compare them against the capabilities of twenty systems that are commonly associated with data activities, including data publishing software, wikis, web-based collaboration tools, and online community platforms. Our findings suggest that data-centric collaborative work would benefit from: structured documentation of data and its lifecycle; advanced affordances for conversations among collaborators; better change control; and custom data access. The findings help us formalise practices around data teamwork, and build a better understanding how people's motivations and barriers when working with structured data.},

Many older people currently experience a range of vulnerabilities which are barriers to positive ageing. Solutions such as 'Linkers' have proven successful, but may not be possible in some contexts, because they are resource intensive. Communities have a responsibility to meet the needs of their members as they age, and to do so in a sustainable way -- socially (reducing burn-out of care-givers), economically (so that provision of care is equitable) and environmentally (so that care can be maintained by future generations). It is also in the best interests of communities in the long term to develop approaches to mitigating vulnerabilities by fostering the agency of the older people. One way to achieve this is through smart architectures which augment human care.},

abstract = {Despite the advent of numerous Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, recent research demonstrates potential side-channel vulnerabilities exploiting sensors which are used for event and environment monitoring. In this paper, we propose a new side-channel attack, where a network of distributed non-acoustic sensors can be exploited by an attacker to launch an eavesdropping attack by reconstructing intelligible speech signals. Specifically, we present PitchIn to demonstrate the feasibility of speech reconstruction from non-acoustic sensor data collected offline across networked devices. Unlike speech reconstruction which requires a high sampling frequency (e.g., &gt; 5 KHz), typical applications using non-acoustic sensors do not rely on richly sampled data, presenting a challenge to the speech reconstruction attack. Hence, PitchIn leverages a distributed form of Time Interleaved Analog-Digital-Conversion (TIADC) to approximate a high sampling frequency, while maintaining low per-node sampling frequency. We demonstrate how distributed TI-ADC can be used to achieve intelligibility by processing an interleaved signal composed of different sensors across networked devices. We implement PitchIn and evaluate reconstructed speech signal intelligibility via user studies. PitchIn has word recognition accuracy as high as 79%. Though some additional work is required to improve accuracy, our results suggest that eavesdropping using a fusion of non-acoustic sensors is a real and practical threat.},

abstract = {Social influences are key drivers of many human behaviors, and have been the focus of an abundance of discrete simulation models. In participatory modeling, the emphasis is on developing models in an intuitive and transparent manner. Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) provides such an intuitive and transparent process, but it can only simulate the thinking of one entity rather than how entities influence each other. Hybrid architectures based on FCM and Agent Based Modeling (ABM) can bridge this gap, but current software implementing these architectures either restricted the models (e.g., limiting agent heterogeneity by requiring that they all follow the same rules) or required extensive coding (which participatory modeling avoids). In this paper, we contribute to software development by presenting CoFluences, and to the theory of modeling and simulation by better characterizing hybrid ABM/FCM architectures. CoFluences is the first software to develop and simulate hybrid ABM/FCM models in a participatory setting, and where agents can follow different rules. Although we take a User-Centered Design approach to develop CoFluences, a comprehensive usability study will be necessary to fully evaluate it in context. In addition, the growing interest in developing simulation software involving FCM will call for more standardization, and for a better understanding of how an FCM behaves in a hybrid simulation.},

These wearable IoT devices combined with the extensive use by individu- als of Online Social Networks (OSNs) have raised many security and privacy concerns. Individuals enrich the content of their online posts with their physical performance and attendance at sporting events, without considering the plausible risks that this may result in. This paper aims to examine the potential exposure of users- identity that is caused by information that they share online and personal data that are stored by their tness-trackers. We approach the privacy concerns that arise by building an interactive tool. This tool models online information shared by individuals and elaborates on how they might be exposed to the unwanted leakage of further personal data. The tool also illustrates the privacy risks that arise from information that people expose, which could be exploited by malicious parties such as fraudsters, stalkers and other online and o ine criminals. To understand the level of users-awareness con- cerning their identity exposure when engaging with such devices and online services, we also have conducted a qualitative analysis and present our ndings here.},

abstract = {As the capacity and reliability of mobile networks increases, so does the demand for more responsive end-to-end services: applications such as augmented reality, live video conferencing, and smart or autonomous vehicles require reliable, throughput-intensive end-to-end communications with strict delay constraints. Only consistently reliable delivery of data flows well within human interactivity deadlines will enable a truly immersive user experience. To enable data delivery within pre-defined deadlines, controlled on demand by an application or its user, we propose and demonstrate a novel transport-layer protocol for explicit latency control called latency-controlled end-to-end aggregation protocol LEAP. The LEAP splits a data flow with quality of service QoS constraints into multiple subflows that are delivered over multiple parallel links e.g., Wi-Fi and LTE in a standard smartphone, WiGig, and 5G in the near future. The subflow data rates are set based on a novel proactive forecasting of the achievable channel capacity, subject to application-specific QoS constraints. Cross-path encoding and redundancy adaptation are then used to deliberately balance the trade-off between maximum throughput, required delay, and minimum reliability as function of application/user-specific input parameters. When compared to leading state-of-the-art transport protocols in live network experiments, LEAP exhibits a superior capacity to reliably provide a high and stable throughput with bounded latency, both in wired and wireless scenarios. The LEAP is also the first protocol to allow applications to explicitly set their priorities, giving them the freedom to set the operating point in the trade-off between throughput, latency, and reliability.},

abstract = {With edge computing emerging as a promising solution to cope with the challenges of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, there is an increasing need to automate the deployment of large-scale applications along with the publish/subscribe brokers they communicate over. Such a placement must adjust to the resource requirements of both applications and brokers in the heterogeneous environment of edge, fog, and cloud. In contrast to prior work focusing only on the placement of applications, this paper addresses the problem of jointly placing IoT applications and the pub/sub brokers on a set of network nodes, considering an application provider who aims at minimizing total end-to-end delays of all its subscribers. More specifically, we devise two heuristics for joint deployment of brokers and applications and analyze their performance in comparison to the current cloud-based IoT solutions wherein both the IoT applications and the brokers are located solely in the cloud. As an application provider should consider not only the location of the application users but also how they are distributed across different network components, we use von Mises distributions to model the degree of clustering of the users of an IoT application. Our simulations show that superior performance of our heuristics in comparison to cloud-based IoT operation is most pronounced under a high degree of clustering. When users of an IoT application are in close network proximity of the IoT sensors, cloud-based IoT unnecessarily introduces latency to move the data from the edge to the cloud and vice versa while processing could be performed at the edge or the fog layers.},

abstract = {Spatial information retrieval is a common task of digital ecosystems due to the popularity of collecting and storing spatial information and phenomena in the world of the Internet of Things (IoT). Spatial relationships play an important role in this context by specifying how two or more spatial objects are related or connected. Examples of spatial relationships include topological relationships (e.g., intersect, overlap, contains), metric relationships (e.g., nearest neighbors), and direction relationships (e.g., cardinal directions like north and south). Many works in the literature have proposed definitions and implementations of spatial queries based on specific types of spatial relationships. Hence, a holistic view of these works is important to understand their applicability and relations. This paper advances in the literature by providing a comprehensive survey of the implementations and types of spatial queries that can be used by digital ecosystems. We present a novel characterization based on spatial relationships to define topological-based, metric-based, and direction-based spatial queries. For each type of spatial query, we present its intuitive and formal definitions together with possible strategies of implementation. Further, we identify hybrid spatial queries as combinations of two or more spatial relationships, and spatial joins as generalization cases. In addition, we present some equivalences between some types of queries. As a result, we point out future research topics in spatial information retrieval.},

abstract = {The adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) drastically witnesses an increase in different domains and contributes to the fast digitalization of the universe. Henceforth, next generation of IoT-based systems are set to become more complex to design and manage. Collecting real-time IoT-generated data unleashes a new wave of opportunities for business to take more precise and accurate decisions at the right time. However, a set of challenges, including the design complexity of IoT-based systems and the management of the ensuing heterogeneous big data as well as the system scalability, need to be addressed for the development of flexible smart IoT-based systems. Consequently, we proposed a set of design patterns that diminish the system design complexity through selecting the appropriate combination of patterns based on the system requirements. These patterns identify four maturity levels for the design and development of smart IoT-based systems. In this article, we are mainly dealing with the system design complexity to manage the context changeability at runtime. Thus, we delineate the autonomic cognitive management pattern, which is at the most mature level. Based on the autonomic computing, this pattern identifies a combination of management processes able to continuously detect and manage the context changes. These processes are coordinated based on cognitive mechanisms that allow the system perceiving and understanding the meaning of the received data to make business decisions, as well as dynamically discovering new processes that meet the requirements evolution at runtime. We demonstrated the use of the proposed pattern with a use case from the healthcare domain; more precisely, the patient comorbidity management based on wearables.},

ParkMaster estimates parking space availability using video gleaned from drivers' dash-mounted smartphones on the network's edge, uploading analytics about the street to the cloud in real time as participants drive. Novel lightweight parked-car localization algorithms enable the system to estimate each parked car's approximate location by fusing information from phone's camera, GPS, and inertial sensors, tracking and counting parked cars as they move through the driving car's camera frame of view. To visually calibrate the system, ParkMaster relies only on the size of well-known objects in the urban environment for on-the-go calibration. We implement and deploy ParkMaster on Android smartphones, uploading parking analytics to the Azure cloud. On-the-road experiments in three different environments comprising Los Angeles, Paris and an Italian village measure the end-to-end accuracy of the system's parking estimates (close to 90%) as well as the amount of cellular data usage the system requires (less than one mega-byte per hour). Drill-down microbenchmarks then analyze the factors contributing to this end-to-end performance, as video resolution, vision algorithm parameters, and CPU resources.},

abstract = {Event processing systems involve the processing of high volume and variety data which has inherent uncertainties like incomplete event streams, imprecise event recognition etc. With the emergence of crowdsourcing platforms, the performance of event processing systems can be enhanced by including 'human-in-the-loop' to leverage their cognitive ability. The resulting crowd-sourced event processing can cater to the problem of event uncertainty and veracity by using humans to verify the results.This paper introduces the first hybrid crowd-enabled event processing engine. The paper proposes a list of five event crowd operators that are domain and language independent and can be used by any event processing framework. These operators encapsulate the complexities to deal with crowd workers and allow developers to define an event-crowd hybrid workflow. The operators are: Annotate, Rank, Verify, Rate, and Match. The paper presents a proof of concept of event crowd operators, schedulers, poolers, aggregators in an event processing system. The paper demonstrates the implementation of these operators and simulates the system with various performance metrics. The experimental evaluation shows that throughput of the system was 7.86 events per second with average latency of 7.16 seconds for 100 crowd workers. Finally, the paper concludes with avenues for future research in crowd-enabled event processing.},

abstract = {Mobile phone sensing contributes to changing the way we approach science: massive amount of data is being contributed across places and time, and paves the way for advanced analyses of numerous phenomena at an unprecedented scale. Still, despite the extensive research work on enabling resource-efficient mobile phone sensing with a very-large crowd, key challenges remain. One challenge is facing the introduction of a new heterogeneity dimension in the traditional middleware research landscape. The middleware must deal with the heterogeneity of the contributing crowd in addition to the system's technical heterogeneities. In order to tackle these two heterogeneity dimensions together, we have been conducting a large-scale empirical study in cooperation with the city of Paris. Our experiment revolves around the public release of a mobile app for urban pollution monitoring that builds upon a dedicated mobile crowd-sensing middleware. In this paper, we report on the empirical analysis of the resulting mobile phone sensing efficiency from both technical and social perspectives, in face of a large and highly heterogeneous population of participants. We concentrate on the data originating from the 20 most popular phone models of our user base, which represent contributions from over 2,000 users with 23 million observations collected over 10 months. Following our analysis, we introduce a few recommendations to overcome -technical and crowd- heterogeneities in the implementation of mobile phone sensing applications and supporting middleware.},
