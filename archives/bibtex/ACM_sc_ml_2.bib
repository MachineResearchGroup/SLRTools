abstract = {City anomalies such as residential fires or urban floods can cause a lot of damage each year from loss of human lives to negative effects on the productivity of the city. One possible way to deal with these anomalies in a quick and effective manner is to use the information provided by the network of citizens that is likely present at the scene of any serious anomaly. However, this source of information may be of varying quality and there may be too much data for human operators to manually inspect in a speedy manner. This motivates us to propose an architecture to effectively make use of the network of citizens to deal with city anomalies. At the center of our architecture is a neural network that automatically classify incoming image data and use this information to assist anomaly handling efforts. In order for our classifier to work well, we have also collected a dataset of city anomalies specific to Vietnam, consisting of 9963 images. We experiment with several neural network models on our collected dataset. In overall, they all have decent accuracies with the best being MobileNet with 92.3% accuracy.},

abstract = {The revolution of online shopping in recent years demands corresponding evolution in delivery services in urban areas. To cater to this trend, delivery by the crowd has become an alternative to the traditional delivery services thanks to the advances in ubiquitous computing. Notably, some studies use public transportation for crowdsourcing delivery, given its low-cost delivery network with millions of passengers as potential couriers. However, multiple practical impact factors are not considered in existing public-transport-based crowdsourcing delivery studies due to a lack of data and limited ubiquitous computing infrastructures in the past. In this work, we design a crowdsourcing delivery system based on public transport, considering the practical factors of time constraints, multi-hop delivery, and profits. To incorporate the impact factors, we build a reinforcement learning model to learn the optimal order dispatching strategies from massive passenger data and package data. The order dispatching problem is formulated as a sequential decision making problem for the packages routing, i.e., select the next station for the package. A delivery time estimation module is designed to accelerate the training process and provide statistical delivery time guarantee. Three months of real-world public transportation data and one month of package delivery data from an on-demand delivery platform in Shenzhen are used in the evaluation. Compared with existing crowdsourcing delivery algorithms and widely used baselines, we achieve a 40% increase in profit rates and a 29% increase in delivery rates. Comparison with other reinforcement learning algorithms shows that we can improve the profit rate and the delivery rate by 9% and 8% by using time estimation in action filtering. We share the data used in the project to the community for other researchers to validate our results and conduct further research.1 [1].},

abstract = {As Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as the next logical stage of the Internet, it has become imperative to understand the vulnerabilities of the IoT systems when supporting diverse applications. Because machine learning has been applied in many IoT systems, the security implications of machine learning need to be studied following an adversarial machine learning approach. In this paper, we propose an adversarial machine learning based partial-model attack in the data fusion/aggregation process of IoT by only controlling a small part of the sensing devices. Our numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of this attack to disrupt the decision making in data fusion with limited control of IoT devices, e.g., the attack success rate reaches 83% when the adversary tampers with only 8 out of 20 IoT devices. These results show that the machine learning engine of IoT system is highly vulnerable to attacks even when the adversary manipulates a small portion of IoT devices, and the outcome of these attacks severely disrupts IoT system operations.},

abstract = {As an alternative means of convenient and smart transportation, mobility-on-demand (MOD), typified by online ride-sharing and connected taxicabs, has been rapidly growing and spreading worldwide. The large volume of complex traffic and the uncertainty of market supplies/demands have made it essential for many MOD service providers to proactively dispatch vehicles towards ride-seekers. To meet this need effectively, we propose STRide, an MOD coordination-learning mechanism reinforced spatio-temporally with capsules. We formalize the adaptive coordination of vehicles into a reinforcement learning framework. STRide incorporates spatial and temporal distributions of supplies (vehicles) and demands (ride requests), customers' preferences and other external factors. A novel spatio-temporal capsule neural network is designed to predict the provider's rewards based on MOD network states, vehicles and their dispatch actions. This way, the MOD platform adapts itself to the supply-demand dynamics with the best potential rewards. We have conducted extensive data analytics and experimental evaluation with three large-scale datasets (~ 21 million rides from Uber, Yellow Taxis and Didi). STRide is shown to outperform state-of-the-arts, substantially reducing request-rejection rate and passenger waiting time, and also increasing the service provider's profits, often making 30% improvement over state-of-the-arts.},

abstract = {With the unprecedented success of deep learning in computer vision tasks, many cloud-based visual analysis applications are powered by deep learning models. However, the deep learning models are also characterized with high computational complexity and are task-specific, which may hinder the large-scale implementation of the conventional data communication paradigms. To enable a better balance among bandwidth usage, computational load and the generalization capability for cloud-end servers, we propose to compress and transmit intermediate deep learning features instead of visual signals and ultimately utilized features. The proposed strategy also provides a promising way for the standardization of deep feature coding. As the first attempt to this problem, we present a lossy compression framework and evaluation metrics for intermediate deep feature compression. Comprehensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed methods and the feasibility of the proposed data transmission strategy. It is worth mentioning that the proposed compression framework and evaluation metrics have been adopted into the ongoing AVS (Audio Video Coding Standard Workgroup) - Visual Feature Coding Standard.},

abstract = {New applications such as smart homes, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles are driving an increased interest in deploying machine learning on edge devices. Unfortunately, deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices presents significant challenges. These workloads are computationally intensive and often require cloud-like resources. Prior solutions attempted to address these challenges by either introducing more design efforts or by relying on cloud resources for assistance.In this paper, we propose a runtime adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN) acceleration framework that is optimized for heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The framework leverages spatial partitioning techniques through fusion of the convolution layers and dynamically selects the optimal degree of parallelism according to the availability of computational resources, as well as network conditions. Our evaluation shows that our framework outperforms state-of-art approaches by improving the inference speed and reducing communication costs while running on wirelessly-connected Raspberry-Pi3 devices. Experimental evaluation shows up to 1.9x ~ 3.7x speedup using 8 devices for three popular CNN models.},

Without the intelligent techniques, these devices would be at increased risk of damage from malicious programs.

This paper presents malwares classifier using KNN and malware visualization technique. We used a database of 9339 samples of malwares from 25 families. We calculated the GIST descriptor for grayscale malware images. Then a KNN model was trained and evaluated many times to reach a score of 97%, which is very close to results found on literature.},

Recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technique to optimize the efficiency and adaptability of vehicle and wireless communication. However, rapidly increasing absolute numbers of vehicles on the roads are leading to increased automobile accidents, many of which are attributable to drivers interacting with their mobile phones. To address potentially dangerous driver behavior, this study applies deep learning approaches to image recognition to develop an AI-based detection system that can detect potentially dangerous driving behavior.

In this paper, we propose a distributed, fog-cloud data processing and orchestration framework, which is capable of exploiting the semantics of both fog platforms and the Cloud. Our framework can create on-demand process engine data flow (PEDF) spanning multiple device layers with various resource constraints. This will considerably help the developers rapidly develop and deploy data processing applications over the fog-cloud continuum.

abstract = {Recently, the deployment of various Internet of Things (IoT) sensors has encouraged smart cities to accumulate a large volume of data. When machine learning models utilize such accumulated raw data to predict events and situations, various systems of a smart city, such as traffic accident management systems, can be further developed by utilizing the predicted events and situations. However, although there has been a large volume of various IoT raw data on smart cities, such data do not have labels that are related to events or situations. Data with meaningful labels are required for the training of the models. Because these sensor data do not have meaningful labels, the data cannot be utilized into the models. There are several existing methods for labeling, but they have different drawbacks. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of utilizing social media messages to extract meaningful labels for machine learning to predict events and situations in smart city environments. As a case study, we compared the extracted labels from social media messages with the events and situations found in announced traffic news, and other articles. The results show that it is feasible to utilize social media messages as a source for meaningful labels of events and situations. We also propose an improved clustering algorithm using an outlier detection technique to extract meaningful labels in a more robust way. Furthermore, for other researchers who want to utilize the IoT raw data, we analyze and release the refined sensor data on which there were unknown noise.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, the use of swarms of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in monitoring and remote area surveillance applications has become economically efficient thanks to the price reduction and the increased capabilities of drones. The drones in the swarm need to cooperatively explore an unknown area, in order to identify and monitor interesting targets, while minimizing their movements. In this work, we propose a distributed Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach that scales to larger swarms without modifications. The proposed framework can easily deal with non-uniform distributions of targets, drawing from past experience to improve its performance. In particular, our experiments show that when agents are trained for a specific scenario, they can adapt to a new one with a minimal amount of additional training. We show that our RL approach achieves favorable performance compared to a computationally intensive look-ahead heuristic.},

The adoption of Machine Learning (ML) methodologies can play a fundamental role, allowing smarter IoT applications to continuously adapt to evolving environmental conditions and user's needs. In this context, the time is now ripe for a decisive step forward in the direction of a systematic integration of ML functionalities within the IoT platform.In this paper, we outline the principles that should guide the realization of a ML service for the IoT, proposing a conceptual architecture of such a learning service, integrated within the IoT reference model. Our proposal leverages on the experience of recent successful European initiatives that led to the realization of intelligent sensor networks built on the synergy between resource efficient ML models for temporal data processing and wireless sensor networks.

For this, various sensors are generally embedded in vehicles to alert the driver in case of danger present on the road. Unfortunately, the performance of such systems degrades in the presence of adverse weather conditions. In addition, eliminating the fog of a single image captured by a camera is a very difficult and ill-posed phenomenon in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Recent developments in the field of deep learning have allowed researchers to build relevant models using various tools available. We propose in this paper a new architecture based on fast R-CNN for the detection of objects in fogged images, and a convolutional neuron network (CNN) is designed on the basis of a reformulated model of atmospheric diffusion for fog elimination to restore the sharp image.},

Considering the multi-data fusion characteristics of dynamic driving behavior and random charging behavior of electric vehicles and the complexity of multi-system modeling, this paper proposes a charging navigation strategy for electric vehicles based on Data-driven mode and deep reinforcement learning. Firstly, the actual operation data of electric vehicles collected by "electric vehicle cluster optimization energy storage cloud platform" are modeled and mined to obtain the driving, charging data and urban charging station data of electric vehicles. Secondly, the charging navigation model is established by introducing deep reinforcement learning method. The real-time data of "electric vehicle-charging station-traffic network" is used as the state space of deep Q-network algorithm, and the allocation of charging stations is regarded as the executive action of agent. The optimal action-value function is calculated by establishing the reward mechanism of driving on the way and after arriving at the station, so as to recommend the optimal charging station of return value and plan the driving path for vehicle owners. Finally, a multi-scene simulation example is designed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method},

However, in real-world scenarios, trajectory outliers can often appear in groups, e.g., a group of bikes that deviates to the usual trajectory due to the maintenance of streets in the context of intelligent transportation. The current paper considers the Group Trajectory Outlier (GTO) problem and proposes three algorithms. The first and the second algorithms are extensions of the well-known DBSCAN and kNN algorithms, while the third one models the GTO problem as a feature selection problem. Furthermore, two different enhancements for the proposed algorithms are proposed. The first one is based on ensemble learning and computational intelligence, which allows for merging algorithms’ outputs to possibly improve the final result. The second is a general high-performance computing framework that deals with big trajectory databases, which we used for a GPU-based implementation. Experimental results on different real trajectory databases show the scalability of the proposed approaches.},

EEEs are comprised of a large number of segments, some containing poisonous substances that affect human wellbeing and climate, if not handled appropriately. The volume of EEEs that is delivered all through the world, has driven governments in different nations to make severe arrangements, to guarantee effective removal of the created e-waste.

To leverage these emerging technologies, the application developers require an enormous amount of data to build models. Data marketplaces enable the IoT application developers to buy data from IoT device owners to train machine learning models. Contemporary data marketplaces only focus on connecting the IoT infrastructure owner (seller) with application developers (buyer) while lacking integrated support for data analytics. Application developers are required to manually create and manage machine learning pipelines by combining edge computing resources with data sources. In this paper, we present an architectural framework to build machine learning pipelines for data marketplaces automatically. Our framework enables application developers (buyers) to leverage the edge computing resources provided by the sellers and compose low-latency IoT applications that incorporate ML-based processing. We present a proof-of-concept implementation on the I3 data marketplace and outline open challenges in combining machine-learning, AI, and edge computing technologies with data marketplaces.},

Existing methods propose to add the synthetic fog to the images collected in normal environments, and to train the models on the augmented datasets. However, these methods only alleviate the problem. Due to that the generalization ability of a machine learning method can only be guaranteed if training and test datasets are with the same data distribution, the distribution gap between synthetic and real-world images limits the upper bound of the detection performance. In this paper, we develop a general smoke detection dataset with diverse real-world collected samples. Furthermore, we develop a novel smoke detection method based on dark-channel assisted mixed attention. Experiments show the importance of the built dataset and the effectiveness of our detection method.},

Road safety features (e.g., concrete barriers, metal crash barriers, rumble strips) play an important role in preventing or mitigating vehicle crashes. Accurate maps of road safety features is an important component of safety management systems for federal or state transportation agencies, helping traffic engineers identify locations to invest in safety infrastructure. In current practice, mapping road safety features is largely done manually (e.g., observations on the road or visual interpretation of streetview imagery), which is both expensive and time consuming. In this article, we propose a deep learning approach to automatically map road safety features from streetview imagery. Unlike existing convolutional neural networks that classify each image individually, we propose to further add a recurrent neural network (long short-term memory) to capture geographic context of images (spatial autocorrelation effect along linear road network paths). Evaluations on real-world streetview imagery show that our proposed model outperforms several baseline methods.},

abstract = {3D point cloud presentation has been widely used in computer vision, automatic driving, augmented reality, smart cities and virtual reality. 3D point cloud compression method with higher compression ratio and tiny loss is the key to improve data transportation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new 3D point cloud geometry compression method based on deep learning, also an auto-encoder performing better than other networks in detail reconstruction. It can reach much higher compression ratio than the state-of-art while keeping tolerable loss. It also supports parallel compressing multiple models by GPU, which can improve processing efficiency greatly. The compression process is composed of two parts. Firstly, Raw data is compressed into codeword by extracting feature of raw model with encoder. Then, the codeword is further compressed with sparse coding. Decompression process is implemented in reverse order. Codeword is recovered and fed into decoder to reconstruct point cloud. Detail reconstruction ability is improved by a hierarchical structure in our decoder. Latter outputs are grown from former fuzzier outputs. In this way, details are added to former output by latter layers step by step to make a more precise prediction. We compare our method with PCL compression and Draco compression on ShapeNet40 part dataset. Our method may be the first deep learning-based point cloud compression algorithm. The experiments demonstrate it is superior to former common compression algorithms with large compression ratio, which can also reserve original shapes with tiny loss.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested wearing a face mask in public for effective protection. While much of the global population has adhered to these recommendations, some continue to wear the face mask improperly or refuse to wear the mask at all. It is essential that face masks are properly worn in public. To address this, we implemented computer vision, a recent advanced technology, to detect the status of face masks on individuals in crowded public places. Our research is intended to aid in minimizing the spread of coronavirus by developing technology for authorities to discern if face masks are being worn properly. We collected data from the Internet and increased it synthetically by augmentation. Two publicly available datasets were merged: the face mask detection dataset and the MASKEDFACE-NET dataset. Our data was annotated manually and then made into a graphical user interface (GUI) for semi-automatic annotation. The multiple object detection networks were trained for three states of face mask wearing: with_mask, without_mask, and mask_weared_incorrect. Four two-stage object detection models were trained and tested during the experiment. The results are compared based on the mean average precisions and scores. The networks achieved above 91% accuracy in both mean average precisions and scores for the three classes of object. We applied these object detectors to our annotation tool for quick semi-supervised annotation. The proposed mask status detection system can aid in reducing the spread of COVID-19 if deployed in a real-world scenario. Our data labeling tool with annotation, augmentation, and automatic suggestion can help further research into these types of technologies.},

We formulate the TA prediction problem as a time series regression problem. LSTM is a particular type of recurrent neural network, which has a strong ability to model the temporal relationship of time series data and can well manage the problem of long-term dependency. The proposed network architecture consists of two types of hidden layers: LSTM layer and full connected dense layer. The LSTM layer is used to model the time series relationship. The fully connected layer is used to map the output of the LSTM layer to a final prediction. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model, we perform tests on data collected by our own IoT system on Tangier. In addition, we show all the results in a web interface.},

Therefore, it is necessary to go beyond the state-of-the-art approaches that measure only the dB level and also identify the type of noise. In this paper, we present a machine learning based method for urban noise identification using an inexpensive IoT unit. We use Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for audio feature extraction and supervised classification algorithms (that is, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, bootstrap aggregation, and random forest) for noise classification. We evaluate our approach experimentally with a data-set of about 3000 sound samples grouped in eight sound classes (such as car horn, jackhammer, or street music). We explore the parameter space of the four algorithms to estimate the optimal parameter values for classification of sound samples in the data-set under study. We achieve a noise classification accuracy in the range 88% - 94%.},

abstract = {Cloud Computing has emerged as a foundation of smart environments by encapsulating and virtualizing the underlying design and implementation details. Concerning the inherent latency and deployment issues, Mobile Edge Computing seeks to migrate services in the vicinity of mobile users. However, the current migration-based studies lack the consideration of migration cost, transaction cost, and energy consumption on the system-level with discussion on the impact of personalized user mobility. In this paper, we implement an enhanced service migration model to address user proximity issues. We formalize the migration cost, transaction cost, energy consumption related to the migration process. We model the service migration issue as a complex optimization problem and adapt Deep Reinforcement Learning to approximate the optimal policy. We compare the performance of the proposed model with the recent Q-learning method and other baselines. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can estimate the optimal policy with complicated computation requirements.},

abstract = {Mobility in urban environments is an undisputed key factor that can affect citizens’ well-being and quality of life. This is particularly relevant for those people with disabilities or with reduced mobility who have to face the presence of barriers in urban areas. In this scenario, the availability of information about such architectural elements (together with facilities) can greatly support citizens’ mobility by enhancing their independence and their abilities in conducting daily outdoor activities. With this in mind, we have designed and developed mobile Pervasive Accessibility Social Sensing (mPASS), a system that provides users with personalized paths, computed on the basis of their own preferences and needs, with a customizable and accessible interface. The system collects data from crowdsourcing and crowdsensing to map urban and architectural accessibility by providing reliable information coming from different data sources with different levels of trustworthiness. In this context, reliability can be ensured by properly managing crowdsourced and crowdsensed data, combined when possible with authoritative datasets, provided by disability rights organizations and local authorities. To demonstrate this claim, in this article we present our trustworthiness model and discuss results we have obtained by simulations.},

abstract = {Users tend to search over the Internet to get the most updated news when an event occurs. Search engines should then be capable of effectively retrieving relevant documents for event-related queries. As the previous studies have shown, different retrieval models are needed for different types of events. Therefore, the first step for improving effectiveness is identifying the event-related queries and determining their types. In this paper, we propose a novel model based on deep neural networks to classify event-related queries into four categories: periodic, aperiodic, one-time-only, and non-event. The proposed model combines recurrent neural networks (by feeding two LSTM layers with query frequencies) and visual recognition models (by transforming time-series data from a 1D signal to a 2D image - later passed to a CNN model) for effective query type estimation. Worth noting is that our method uses only the time-series data of query frequencies, without the need to resort to any external sources such as contextual data, which makes it language and domain-independent with regards to the query issued. For evaluation, we build upon the previous datasets on event-related queries to create a new dataset that fits the purpose of our experiments. The obtained results show that our proposed model can achieve an F1-score of 0.87.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection in video streams with imbalanced data and real-time constraints is a challenging task of computer vision. This paper proposes a novel real-time approach for real-world video anomaly detection exploiting a supervised learning methodology. In particular, we present a deep learning architecture based on the analysis of contextual, spatial, and motion information extracted from the video. A data balancing strategy based on hard-mining and adaptive framerate is used to avoid overfitting and increase detection accuracy. The approach defines an extended taxonomy by differentiating anomalies in ”soft” and ”hard”. A novel anomaly detection score based on a sigmoidal function has been introduced to reduce false positive rate while maintaining a high level of true positive rate. The proposed methodology has been validated with a set of experiments on a well-known video anomaly dataset: UCF-CRIME. The experiments on the testbed demonstrate the impact of the contextual information and data balancing on the classification performances, considering only ”hard” anomalies during training and that the proposed model can achieve state-of-the-art performances while minimizing resource consumption. },

abstract = { Machine Learning (EdgeML) algorithms on edge devices facilitate safety-critical applications like building security management and smart city interventions. However, their wired/wireless connections with the Internet make such platforms vulnerable to attacks compromising the embedded software. We find that in the prior works, the issue of regular runtime integrity assessment of the deployed software with negligible EdgeML performance degradation is still unresolved. In this paper, we present PracAttest, a practical runtime attestation framework for embedded devices running compute-heavy EdgeML applications. Unlike the conventional remote attestation schemes that check the entire software in each attestation event, PracAttest segments the software and randomizes the integrity check of these segments over short random attestation intervals. The segmentation coupled with the randomization leads to a novel performance-vs-security trade-off that can be tuned per the EdgeML application’s performance requirements. Additionally, we implement three realistic EdgeML benchmarks for pollution measurement, traffic intersection control, and face identification, using state-of-the-art neural network and computer vision algorithms. We specify and verify security properties for these benchmarks and evaluate the efficacy of PracAttest in attesting the verified software. PracAttest provides 50x-80x speedup over the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of mean attestation time, with negligible impact on application performance. We believe that the novel performance-vs-security trade-off facilitated by PracAttest will expedite the adoption of runtime attestation on edge platforms.},

abstract = {We aim to increase the revenue or reduce the purchase cost of a given market participant in a double-sided, day-ahead, wholesale electricity market serving a smart city. Using an operations research based market clearing mechanism and attention based time series forecaster as sub-modules, we build a holistic interactive system. Through this system, we discover better bidding strategies for a market participant using reinforcement learning (RL). We relax several assumptions made in existing literature in order to make the problem setting more relevant to real life. Our Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation enables us to tackle action space explosion and also compute optimal actions across time-steps in parallel. Our RL framework is generic enough to be used by either a generator or a consumer participating in the electricity market.We study the efficacy of the proposed RL based bidding framework from the perspective of a generator as well as a buyer on real world day-ahead electricity market data obtained from the European Power Exchange (EPEX). We compare the performance of our RL based bidding framework against three baselines: (a) an ideal but un-realizable bidding strategy; (b) a realizable approximate version of the ideal strategy; and (c) historical performance as found from the logs. Under both perspectives, we find that our RL based framework is more closer to the ideal strategy than other baselines. Further, the RL based framework improves the average daily revenue of the generator by nearly €7,200 (€2.64 M per year) and €9,000 (€3.28 M per year) over the realizable ideal and historical strategies respectively. When used on behalf of a buyer, it reduces average daily procurement cost by nearly €2,700 (€0.97 M per year) and €57,200 (€52.63 M per year) over the realizable ideal and historical strategies respectively. We also observe that our RL based framework automatically adapts its actions to changes in the market power of the participant.},

abstract = {User authentication is a critical process in both corporate and home environments due to the ever-growing security and privacy concerns. With the advancement of smart cities and home environments, the concept of user authentication is evolved with a broader implication by not only preventing unauthorized users from accessing confidential information but also providing the opportunities for customized services corresponding to a specific user. Traditional approaches of user authentication either require specialized device installation or inconvenient wearable sensor attachment. This article supports the extended concept of user authentication with a device-free approach by leveraging the prevalent WiFi signals made available by IoT devices, such as smart refrigerator, smart TV, and smart thermostat, and so on. The proposed system utilizes the WiFi signals to capture unique human physiological and behavioral characteristics inherited from their daily activities, including both walking and stationary ones. Particularly, we extract representative features from channel state information (CSI) measurements of WiFi signals, and develop a deep-learning-based user authentication scheme to accurately identify each individual user. To mitigate the signal distortion caused by surrounding people’s movements, our deep learning model exploits a CNN-based architecture that constructively combines features from multiple receiving antennas and derives more reliable feature abstractions. Furthermore, a transfer-learning-based mechanism is developed to reduce the training cost for new users and environments. Extensive experiments in various indoor environments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed authentication system. In particular, our system can achieve over 94% authentication accuracy with 11 subjects through different activities.},

abstract = {A smart space 1 is a physical environment that contains cooperating nodes which continuously and autonomously monitor their surroundings. The environment can interact with users and adapt their behaviors to enhance user experiences using semantic reasoning. Such semantic reasoning is based on information gathered and shared either from the physical environment (e.g., via sensors) or from the Internet (e.g., via user profiles). The nodes share knowledge to adapt their behaviors using semantic reasoning in a smart space. On the other hand, machine learning is a promising tool to generate or enhance knowledge for nodes' adaptations. In this paper, we propose a semantic learning component in a comprehensive smart space architecture to generate knowledge on stored semantics for nodes' adaptations. For this purpose, we propose an adaptive framework which includes machine learning techniques in the component for nodes' behaviors. Moreover, an example use-case is presented using the K-nearest neighbor algorithm. Further, two use-cases are discussed in support of the proposed framework. Finally, we address the further work to be studied.},

abstract = {Recently, deep neural network based approaches have emerged as indispensable tools in many fields, ranging from image and video recognition to natural language processing. However, the large size of such newly developed networks poses both throughput and energy challenges to the underlying processing hardware. This could be the major stumbling block to many promising applications such as self-driving cars and smart cities.Existing work proposes to weed zeros from input neurons to avoid unnecessary DNN computation (zero-valued operand multiplications). However, we observe that many output neurons are still ineffectual even if the zero-removal technique has been applied. These ineffectual output neurons could not pass their values to the subsequent layer, which means all the computations (including zero-valued and non-zero-valued operand multiplications) related to these output neurons are futile and wasteful. Therefore, there is an opportunity to significantly improve the performance and efficiency of DNN execution by predicting the ineffectual output neurons and thus completely avoid the futile computations by skipping over these ineffectual output neurons.To do so, we propose a two-stage, prediction-based DNN execution model without accuracy loss. We also propose a uniform serial processing element (USPE), for both prediction and execution stages to improve the flexibility and minimize the area overhead. To improve the processing throughput, we further present a scale-out design for USPE. Evaluation results over a set of state-of-the-art DNNs show that our proposed design achieves 2.5X speedup and 1.9X energy-efficiency on average over the traditional accelerator. Moreover, by stacking with our design, we can improve Cnvlutin and Stripes by 1.9X and 2.0X on average, respectively.},

abstract = {Sports have evolved from the exposition of athletes’ pure talent to an industry that generates jobs and entertainment. In the Philippines, athletes from different Universities and Colleges are the primary source of talents in amateur and professional leagues especially in the field of volleyball and basketball. As such, schools are developing their physical and athletic programs to establish their respective competitive advantage. However, student-athletes from universities with insufficient resources are often neglected due to inadequate exposure. Furthermore, there is no framework that secures the statistical data of student-athletes which can be used for future appraisal of player's talent and athletic skills. This study aims to propose a conceptual framework of “Sports Ed 3.5” for universities and collegiate athletic associations to develop an athlete information system for sports analytics. In addition, the framework aims to define the philosophy that will govern all the stakeholders in the utilization of an athlete's information for flexible decision-making. Players’ dataset from the Philippine Basketball Association's website was retrieved to demonstrate on how an athletic information system can support the athletes, coaches, and stakeholders of sports. Supervised algorithms were used to illustrate the value of data and machine learning models in athletic development programs. Future research direction and challenges are discussed to implement the proposed “Sports Ed 3.5” model for Philippine schools and universities.},

abstract = {The ability to categorize the driver behavior is very essential for advance driver assistance system (ADAS). A method for identifying driver's behavior is important to assist operative mode transition between the driver and autonomous vehicles. We propose a driver behavior recognition method in terms of steering and brake using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We are also proposing a HMM-based actuation behavior model for obstacle avoidance using collision avoidance algorithm. We plan to analyze different driver behaviors based on HMM model and produce the results. After generating results, we intend to empower it further with Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) in order to improve system's performance and accuracy.},
