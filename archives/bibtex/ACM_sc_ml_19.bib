abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of embedded sensors that transmit events over a wireless network. Complex event processing provides powerful abstractions to aggregate and analyze relationships among event streams in real time, which can improve IoT application development and management. A key challenge are stream imperfections, because of the non-deterministic nature of IoT: events can be delayed due to variance in delay, or may even be missing due to packet loss. Timeouts are used to handle stream imperfections, distinguishing between delayed and lost events. For some applications, missing delayed events is costly, as the quality of the result depends on the presence of all inputs, but reacting too late to event non-arrivals can also lead to incorrect results. State-of-the-art results in timeouts that are impractically large when little to no missed events are tolerated by the application. We propose Kairos, a novel, self-configuring technique for determining event arrival timeouts in IoT that are both small and ensure that little to no events are missed, while also eliminating the overhead and complexity of user configuration. We evaluate our approach against the state-of-the-art using two representative IoT networks: SmartMesh IP and LoRaWAN. The results show that our solution is capable of reducing timeouts by up to two orders of magnitude even when little to no missed events are tolerated, thus satisfying the aforementioned application requirements. },

abstract = {The forthcoming 5G operational environment entails heterogeneous and multi-dimensional ecosystems where cyber assets, digital actors and cyber-physical risks coexist. In this context, the prediction and anticipation of the attacks propagation thorough the targeted systems promises to be some of the major workhorses of the emerging self-protection capabilities. In the grounds of the Self-Organizing Network (SON) paradigm, it is expected that by taking into account proactive actuations, the decision and enforcement of the best courses of action will be enhanced. With the aim on contributing to their planning and execution, this paper introduces a novel framework for proactive self-protection on 5G environments, the description of an architectural framework able to sustain the rest of the anticipation enablers, the formalization of a knowledge representation and reasoning strategy for active cyber threat mitigation, and a prediction strategy adapted to the difficulties inherent in analyzing events on 5G scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposal has been demonstrated by proof-of-concept instantiation for anticipating the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on a real communication environment.},

abstract = {“Big Data,” huge volumes of data in both structured and unstructured forms generated by the Internet, social media, and computerized transactions, is straining our technical capacity to manage it. More importantly, the new challenge is to develop the capability to understand and interpret the burgeoning volume of data to take advantage of the opportunities it provides in many human endeavors, ranging from science to business. Data Science, and in business schools, Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&amp;A) are emerging disciplines that seek to address the demands of this new era. Big Data and BI&amp;A present unique challenges and opportunities not only for the research community, but also for Information Systems (IS) programs at business schools. In this essay, we provide a brief overview of BI&amp;A, speculate on the role of BI&amp;A education in business schools, present the challenges facing IS departments, and discuss the role of IS curricula and program development, in delivering BI&amp;A education. We contend that a new vision for the IS discipline should address these challenges.},

abstract = {News headlines about privacy invasions, discrimination, and biases discovered in the platforms of big technology companies are commonplace today. The headlines – ranging from comprehensive profiling of users, to microtargeting of political messages, to discrimination based on gender, race, and age – show that big tech’s operations can cause real-world harm. However, big tech companies are reluctant to disclose how they operate and typically do not give out specific information, such as what data they collect or how their algorithms make decisions. This secretive operation counteracts ideals of transparency, openness, and accountability. This tutorial will present research methods and findings from the last 5-10 years that use large-scale experiments to systematically interact with the publicly accessible elements of big tech’s platforms. These experiments allow inferring details about big tech’s hidden operations – in essence conducting meta-surveillance against big tech. For example, findings from these experiments have documented how user tracking works, the extent of tracking on the web today, and how the collected information is used for algorithmic decision-making and ad targeting.},

abstract = {As inexpensive Internet of Things (IoT) sensors have become widely available, an increasing number of researchers in domains as diverse as the engineering and geosciences, biomedicine, the social sciences, and even the arts have become interested in the insights and creative expression such sensors might enable. At the University of Iowa, we convened a series of meetings at which we posed the following framing question: "What would you do with 10,000, ~$10 sensors?" These discussions identified the clear need for a standard, end-to-end infrastructure for sensor deployment and data collection through data analytics and visualization, one that allowed researchers to focus on research and scholarship rather than infrastructure development. This paper1 describes the development of a suite of wireless sensors and a cloud-based toolkit for data capture, analysis, and visualization, based on Amazon Web Services (AWS), MQTT, and Jupyter notebooks.},

In this paper, an intelligent DSA-assisted IoT network is introduced, where we investigate the spectrum sensing through neuromorphic computing (NC) and spectrum access through genetic algorithm (GA)-based power allocation. To be specific, we apply the NC's unconventional computing architectures that exploit and harness the intrinsic dynamics for computation, and thus provide increased functionality with better spectrum sensing performance requiring significantly lower size, weight, and power budgets. Furthermore, we design a GA algorithm to intelligently search the desirable transmission power for multiple IoT devices sharing the same channel to enhance the capacity of the highly dynamic DSA-assisted IoT network. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the benefits of NC and GA compared to other baseline algorithms and methodologies.},

The overall picture is a massive collection of computing devices, characterized by very heterogeneous levels of performance and power consumption, which we could exploit to reduce the need to access Cloud computing resources. This would play a key role, especially for emerging use cases, where huge amount of data are generated. However, the deployment of distributed applications on such an heterogeneous infrastructures requires suitable management layers. This position paper aims at: (a) proposing a fully-distributed, cooperative, dynamic and multi-layered architecture, capable of integrating different computing paradigms; (b) identifying a possible solution to manage workloads at run-time in a resources continuity perspective, through an analysis of the open research challenges.},

In this paper our focus is on millions of photos being captured as informative reports and using them for emerging applications including situation recognition, trend analysis, and cultural dynamics. EventShop is an open source platform for situation recognition. Utilizing this platform and using a stream of photo reports from various sources as one of the data streams in this platform, we build a visual analytics system to understand the information that could be gleaned from such photo report streams. Our early experiments are based on the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100 Million photos set released recently. We are also using other sources to import and understand the efficacy of these reports for various important applications.},

abstract = {Policy making is influenced by a number of factors, including electoral politics, ideological biases of actors involved in the policy making process, and the interlocks between corporate and government entities. This influence is also exercised by shaping public opinion through mass media. In this paper, we study four ICTD policies in India, and explore the political economy around them by using data about how these policies are covered in the mass media. We study which actors are covered more in media, how they speak on the policy issues, and which aspects are given more coverage for these policies. We find that politicians get the highest coverage in mass media regarding discussions on policies, and that the politicians and business-persons often express similar ideologies related to these policies. We also observe that mass media is often biased towards issues related to its middle class reader base with a strong sense of technology driven high-modernism, and negative aspects of these policies and issues faced by the poor due to improper policy implementation are often not given significant coverage. Our key contribution is a methodology of using automated analysis of mass media data to reveal the factors that might be shaping the political economy behind policy making.},

Following the sociomateriality discourse, this research unfolds a perspective from which digital government research can understand the intertwinement of human action and technology performance while designing and shaping the upcoming digitalization of government operations. This perspective assumes an intended primacy of the people in the citizen−government relationship and perceives the marginalization of humans as a significant threat to applying social values in governance, especially when situated action is required. Using Mintzberg's models of managing government, we identify a variety of ‘monster’ challenges, point to opportunities for decomposition of human and machine agency and advocate the alignment and composition of both agencies as a long-term learning process that involves both citizens and technology and requires safeguarding by multiple stakeholders.},

For smart firefighting, timeliness and accuracy are two foremost system requirements, yet they are unsatisfied in many applications. One reason for such dilemma is due to the underlying used computing architecture (i.e. cloud computing) that can produce extra latency in large-scale data transmission. To address this problem, we explore the firefighting field utilizing edge computing and discuss the overall system architecture, opportunities, challenges, as well as some early technical suggestions on building edge-enabled smart firefighting. To validate the feasibility of edge computing, we simulate the firefighting context and respectively deploy a video-based flame detection algorithm on a local Intel's edge computing platform and a remote Amazon EC2. The preliminary results show that edge computing can significantly increase system's reactive speed, with on average 50% reduction in system latency.},

abstract = {Nowadays, time-sync comment (TSC), a new form of interactive comments, has become increasingly popular on Chinese video websites. By posting TSCs, people can easily express their feelings and exchange their opinions with others when watching online videos. However, some spoilers appear among the TSCs. These spoilers reveal crucial plots in videos that ruin people's surprise when they first watch the video. In this paper, we proposed a novel Similarity-Based Network with Interactive Variance Attention (SBN-IVA) to classify comments as spoilers or not. In this framework, we firstly extract textual features of TSCs through the word-level attentive encoder. We design Similarity-Based Network (SBN) to acquire neighbor and keyframe similarity according to semantic similarity and timestamps of TSCs. Then, we implement Interactive Variance Attention (IVA) to eliminate the impact of noise comments. Finally, we obtain the likelihood of spoiler based on the difference between the neighbor and keyframe similarity. Experiments show SBN-IVA is on average 11.2% higher than the state-of-the-art method on F1-score in baselines.},

Image inpainting techniques are widely used to virtually repair these damages. Generally, the inpainting task can be very challenging when structures are totally missing within a large area. In this article, we study mural image inpainting by incorporating structure information collected from line drawings, and propose a line-drawings-guided inpainting algorithm for repairing the damaged murals of Mogao Grottoes, Dunhuang. Unlike traditional methods that use one single patch to inpaint the target area, the proposed method constructs the target patch with a linear combination of multiple candidate patches. These candidate patches are selected by a sparse model, where two special constraints have been introduced to guarantee the texture similarity and structure continuity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

There is a need to systematically review and synthesize the literature on IoT architectural challenges or concerns. Using the SLR approach and applying customised search criteria derived from the research question, 22 relevant studies were identified and reviewed in this paper. The data from these papers were extracted to identify the IoT architectural challenges and relevant solutions. These results were organised into to 9 major challenge and 7 solution categories.

abstract = { Smart devices and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are replacing or being incorporated into traditional devices at a growing pace. The use of digital interfaces to interact with these devices has become a common occurrence in homes, work spaces, and various industries around the world. The most common interfaces for these connected devices focus on mobile apps or voice control via intelligent virtual assistants. However, with augmented reality (AR) becoming more popular and accessible among consumers, there are new opportunities for spatial user interfaces to seamlessly bridge the gap between digital and physical affordances. In this paper, we present a human-subject study evaluating and comparing four user interfaces for smart connected environments: gaze input, hand gestures, voice input, and a mobile app. We assessed participants’ user experience, usability, task load, completion time, and preferences. Our results show multiple trade-offs between these interfaces across these measures. In particular, we found that gaze input shows great potential for future use cases, while both gaze input and hand gestures suffer from limited familiarity among users, compared to voice input and mobile apps.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Since simulation-based optimisation typically requires large numbers of runs to identify sufficiently good solutions, the costs in terms of time and hardware can be enormous. To avoid unnecessary simulation runs, surrogate models can be applied, which estimate the simulation output under a given parameter combination. Model preemption is a related technique that dynamically analyses the simulation state at runtime to identify runs unlikely to result in a high-quality solution and terminates such runs early. However, existing work on model preemption relies on model-specific termination rules. In this paper, we describe an architecture for simulation-based optimisation using model preemption based on estimations of the simulation output. In a case study, the approach is applied to the optimisation of traffic light timings in a traffic simulation. We show that within a given time and hardware budget, model preemption enables the identification of higher-quality solutions than those found through traditional simulation-based optimisation.},

abstract = {Optimization problems arising in real-life transportation and logistics need to consider uncertainty conditions (e.g., stochastic travel times, etc.). Simulation is employed in the analysis of complex systems under such non-deterministic environments. However, simulation is not an optimization tool, so it needs to be combined with optimization methods whenever the goal is to: (i) maximize the system performance using limited resources; or (ii) minimize its operations cost while guaranteeing a given quality of service. When the underlying optimization problem is NP-hard, metaheuristics are required to solve large-scale instances in reasonable computing times. Simheuristics extend metaheuristics by adding a simulation layer that allows the optimization component to deal with scenarios under uncertainty. This paper reviews both initial as well as recent applications of simheuristics, mainly in the area of logistics and transportation. The paper also discusses current trends and open research lines in this field.},

In this scenario, Visualization Techniques can be applied to Open Government Data in order to help to solve this problem. In this sense, we analyzed previously published papers related to Open Government Data Visualization in order to provide an overview about how visualization techniques are being applied to Open Government Data and which are the most common challenges when dealing with it. A systematic mapping study was conducted to survey the papers that were published in this area. The study found 775 papers and, after applying all inclusion and exclusion criteria, 32 papers were selected. Among other results, we found that datasets related to transportation are the main ones being used and Map is the most used visualization technique. Finally, we report that data quality is the main challenge being reported by studies that applied visualization techniques to Open Government Data.},

abstract = {In today's digital era, data are everywhere from Internet of Things to health care or financial applications. This leads to potentially unbounded ever-growing Big data streams and it needs to be utilized effectively. Data normalization is an important preprocessing technique for data analytics. It helps prevent mismodeling and reduce the complexity inherent in the data especially for data integrated from multiple sources and contexts. Normalization of Big Data stream is challenging because of evolving inconsistencies, time and memory constraints, and non-availability of whole data beforehand. This paper proposes a distributed approach to adaptive normalization for Big data stream. Using sliding windows of fixed size, it provides a simple mechanism to adapt the statistics for normalizing changing data in each window. Implemented on Apache Storm, a distributed real-time stream data framework, our approach exploits distributed data processing for efficient normalization. Unlike other existing adaptive approaches that normalize data for a specific use (e.g., classification), ours does not. Moreover, our adaptive mechanism allows flexible controls, via user-specified thresholds, for normalization tradeoffs between time and precision. The paper illustrates our proposed approach along with a few other techniques and experiments on both synthesized and real-world data. The normalized data obtained from our proposed approach, on 160,000 instances of data stream, improves over the baseline by 89% with 0.0041 root-mean-square error compared with the actual data.},

The field of Geographic Information Science and Systems (GIS) uses myriad tools and datasets, which raises challenges in designing a science gateway to meet users' diverse research and teaching needs. We describe a new science gateway called the GISandbox that is designed meet the needs of researchers and educators leveraging geospatial computing, which is situated at the nexus of GIS and computational science. The GISandbox is built on Jupyter Notebooks to create an easy, open, and flexible platform for geospatial computing. Jupyter Notebooks is a widely used interactive computing environment running in the browser that integrates live code, narrative, equations and images. We extend the Jupyter Notebook platform to enable users to run interactive notebooks on the cloud resource Jetstream or computationally-intensive notebooks on the Bridges supercomputer located at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. A novel Job Management platform allows the user to easily submit a Jupyter Notebook for batch execution on Bridges (and eventually Comet), monitor the SLURM job, and retrieve output files. GISandbox Virtual Machines are created in Jetstream's Atmosphere interface and then deployed and configured using a series of Ansible scripts, which allow us to create an easily reproducible and scalable system. This paper outlines our vision for GISandbox, the current implementation, with a discussion looking toward the future and how the GISandbox could be used in other domains.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) refer to the next generation of embedded ICT systems that are interconnected, collaborative and that provide users and businesses with a wide range of smart applications and services. Software in CPS applications ranges from small systems to large systems, aka. Systems of Systems (SoS), such as smart grids and cities. CPSoS require managing massive amounts of data, being aware of their emerging behavior, and scaling out to progressively evolve and add new systems. Cloud computing supports processing and storing massive amounts of data, hosting and delivering services, and configuring self-provisioned resources. Therefore, cloud computing is the natural candidate to solve CPSoS needs. However, the diversity of platforms and the low-level cloud programming models make difficult to find a common solution for the development and deployment of CPSoS. This paper presents the architectural foundations of a cloud-centric framework for automating the development and deployment of CPSoS service applications to converge towards a common open service platform for CPSoS applications. This framework relies on the well-known qualities of the microservices architecture style, the autonomic computing paradigm, and the model-driven software development approach. Its implementation and validation is on-going at two European and national projects.},

abstract = {Many Internet of Things (IoT) applications require compute resources that cannot be provided by the devices themselves. At the same time, processing of the data generated by IoT devices often has to be performed in real- or near real-time. Examples of such scenarios are autonomous vehicles in the form of cars and drones where the processing of observational data (e.g., video feeds) needs to be performed expeditiously to allow for safe operation. To support the computational needs and timeliness requirements of such applications it is essential to include suitable edge resources to execute these applications. In this paper, we present our FlyNet architecture which has the goal to provide a new platform to support workflows that include applications executing at the network edge, at the computing core, and leverage deeply programmable networks. We discuss the challenges associated with provisioning such networking and compute infrastructure on demand, tailored to IoT application workflows. We describe a strategy to leverage the end-to-end integrated infrastructure that covers all points in the spectrum of response latency for application processing. We present our prototype implementation of the architecture and evaluate its performance for the case of drone video analytics workflows with varying computational requirements.},

abstract = {To draw a roadmap of current research activities of the blockchain community, we first conduct a brief overview of state-of-the-art blockchain surveys published in the past 5 years. We found that those surveys are basically studying the blockchain-based applications, such as blockchain-assisted Internet of Things (IoT), business applications, security-enabled solutions, and many other applications in diverse fields. However, we think that a comprehensive survey toward the essentials of blockchains by exploiting the state-of-the-art theoretical modelings, analytic models, and useful experiment tools is still missing. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized for future research directions. We hope this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.},

abstract = {Rapid technology advancement, economic growth, and industrialization have paved the way for developing a new niche of small body-worn personal devices, gathered together under a wearable-technology title. The triggers stimulated by end-users interest have introduced the first generation of mass-consumer wearables in just the past decade. Evidently, the trailblazing ones were not designed with strict energy-consumption restrictions in mind. Thus, wearable-computing-related research remained fragmented. Advanced and sophisticated batteries and communication technologies could be already procurable on devices. Additional solutions for efficient utilization of processing power are still a white spot on the wearable technology roadmap. A-WEAR EU project aims to enhance the understanding of how the superimposition of those technologies would improve wearable devices' energy efficiency, with the research area being far from saturation. We foresee enormous room for research as the Edge computing paradigm is emerging towards hand-held devices.},

abstract = {Digital civics research seeks to understand how technology can create new forms of relationships and services between public officials and citizens in governance. To accomplish this, design in digital civics emphasizes the importance of relationships based on dialogue, empowerment, and participation; all of which are contingent upon the existence of trust. Currently, however, these relationships are most often characterized by entrenched distrust which problematizes opportunities for dialogue and participation. In this paper, we explore how design might support trust in the relational aims of digital civics. To do so, we led 13 public officials in a large US city through a design-based inquiry centered around the role of trust in their various efforts to engage communities. In our findings, we discuss four strategies for supporting trust in digital civics.},

In this scenario, accurate prediction models and techniques are desirable to optimize the renewable energy production and reduce the environmental impact. In this article, we propose the development of predictive techniques based on mathematical models, and the integration in a simulation framework that enables the simulation of variable conditions in wind energy production. The system also offers the possibility to automatically select the most reliable model for the current conditions. Our results show an accuracy of prediction (model fit) of up to 84%. The proposed simulation framework has been stressed with real data acquired from wind turbines in the area of Spain, providing efficient model selection and tuning of optimization parameters.},

abstract = {Traditional hot-desking is a method of office resource management where a single office desk is shared by multiple employees at different times, instead of each one being assigned an individual desk. Utilising the desks in this manner can reduce the size of the office by up to 30% [9]. However there are numerous problems with the traditional approach, in particular with regards to desk personalisation, availability of preferred desks and the development of synergies between people doing similar work. The objective of this paper is to develop a smart hot-desking system that assigns temporary desks to employees in a way that takes into advantage personal preferences as well as spatial and temporal features in order to tackle the aforementioned issues and ultimately increase their well-being and productivity.Sensors distributed in space measure the temperature, light and noise level in different areas of an office, in order for an algorithm to be able to determine an optimal desk for a specific employee, according to their prerecorded preferences. We performed an experiment with students in a university lab, with the majority of the users showing notable increase in their satisfaction with the working environment, as a result of the system allocating them desks. We discuss our experimental setup, observations about the process and develop the concept further so that richer data can be fused in the future to inform even more meaningful desk allocation (e.g. calendar and to do lists).This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of combining realtime environmental sensor data and employees' feedback to produce a scalable desk allocation system.},

A fundamental assignment model is the so-called User Equilibrium (UE), which may turn into a complex optimisation problem. In this paper, we present the use of the GRASP metaheuristic to approximate the UE of the TAP. A path relinking mechanism is also employed to promote a higher coverage of the search space. Moreover, we propose a novel performance evaluation function, which measures the number of vehicles that have an incentive to deviate from the routes to which they were assigned. Through experiments, we show that our approach outperforms classical algorithms, providing solutions that are, on average, significantly closer to the UE. Furthermore, when compared to classical methods, the fairness achieved by our assignments is considerably better. These results indicate that our approach is efficient and robust, producing reasonably stable assignments.},

abstract = {The IEEE 802.15.4 standard is one of the widely adopted specifications for realizing different applications of the Internet of Things. It defines several physical layer options and Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer for devices with low-power operating at low data rates. As devices implementing this standard are primarily battery-powered, minimizing their power consumption is a significant concern. Duty-cycling is one such power conserving mechanism that allows a device to schedule its active and inactive radio periods effectively, thus preventing energy drain due to idle listening. The standard specifies two parameters, beacon order and superframe order, which define the active and inactive period of a device. However, it does not specify a duty-cycling scheme to adapt these parameters for varying network conditions. Existing works in this direction are either based on superframe occupation ratio or buffer/queue length of devices. In this article, the particular limitations of both the approaches mentioned above are presented. Later, a novel duty-cycling mechanism based on MAC parameters is proposed. Also, we analyze the role of synchronization schemes in achieving efficient duty-cycles in synchronized cluster-tree network topologies. A Markov model has also been developed for the MAC protocol to estimate the delay and energy consumption during frame transmission.},

abstract = {Recommender systems (RSs) commonly describe its user-item preferences with a high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrix filled with non-negative data. A non-negative latent factor (NLF) model relying on a single latent factor-dependent, non-negative and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) algorithm is frequently adopted to process such an HiDS matrix. However, an NLF model mostly adopts Euclidean distance for its objective function, which is naturally a special case of α-β-divergence. Moreover, it frequently suffers slow convergence. For addressing these issues, this study proposes a generalized and fast-converging non-negative latent factor (GFNLF) model. Its main idea is two-fold: a) adopting α-β-divergence for its objective function, thereby enhancing its representation ability for HiDS data; b) deducing its momentum-incorporated non-negative multiplicative update (MNMU) algorithm, thereby achieving its fast convergence. Empirical studies on two HiDS matrices emerging from real RSs demonstrate that with carefully-tuned hyperparameters, a GFNLF model outperforms state-of-the-art models in both computational efficiency and prediction accuracy for missing data of an HiDS matrix.},

However, vehicle ReID severely suffers from the perspective variation problem. For different vehicles with similar color and type which are taken from different perspectives, all visual patterns are misaligned and warped, which is hard for the model to find out the exact discriminative regions. In this paper, we propose part perspective transformation module (PPT) to map the different parts of vehicle into a unified perspective respectively. The PPT disentangles the vehicle features of different perspectives and then aligns them in a fine-grained level. Further, we propose a dynamically batch hard triplet loss to select the common visible regions of the compared vehicles. Our approach helps the model to generate the perspective invariant features and find out the exact distinguishable regions for vehicle ReID. Extensive experiments on three standard vehicle ReID datasets show the effectiveness of our method.},

Simulation models are one of the most widely used decision support tools in project management that can highly benefit from the integration of contextual knowledge with the model design. In this paper, a discrete event simulation (DES) model of construction operations involving human activities is designed, enriched with wearable sensor data using smartphones, and validated. The model parameters are defined using 1) a data-driven activity recognition and 2) a static engineering estimation method for comparison. Results show that the output of the data-driven simulation model is in a closer agreement with the values observed in the real system.},

However, these devices often cannot implement traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS), or they can not produce or store the audit trails needed for inspection. Therefore, it is often necessary to adapt existing IDS systems and malware detection approaches to cope with these constraints.We explore the application of unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering, to develop a novel IDS for networks composed of low-powered devices. We describe our solution, called Clust-IT (Clustering of IoT), to manage heterogeneous data collected from cooperative and distributed networks of connected devices and searching these data for indicators of compromise while remaining protocol agnostic. We outline a novel application of OPTICS to various available IoT datasets, composed of both packet and flow captures, to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed techniques and evaluate their feasibility in developing an IoT IDS.},

abstract = {Gauss-Newton method is a Hessian free second-order Newton's optimization method, which can be used to solve the common nonlinear least squares (NLLS) problems. In this paper, we consider the collaborative target localization problem in a wireless sensor network with a random topology structure. By using a specialized decomposition technique, the centralized Gauss-Newton method is modified as a distributed solution by exchanging locally information with the neighboring anchor nodes. In the recent diffusion Gauss-Newton algorithm, the main difficulty is the computation of inverse because the approximated Hessian is not always full column rank. To address this problem, we propose that two methods can be used to approximate the inverse matrix, i.e., Levenberg-Marquardt parameter and Moore-Penrose inverse methods. The former in essence is a damped iteration method, while the latter depends largely on the adjustment of step size. In addition to proposing the methods above for diffusion Gauss-Newton algorithm, we also compare their performance to solve the collaborative localization in wireless sensor networks, which can be modeled as a NLLS problem. Simulation results show both of them are applicable to diffusion GN, and LM method has some slight advantages in these respects such as resistance to environment noise while guaranteeing convergence, and dynamical increasing/decreasing to step size.},
