ABSTRACT = {Marine aquaculture plays an important role in seafood supplement, economic development, and coastal ecosystem service provision. The precise delineation of marine aquaculture areas from high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery is vital for the sustainable development and management of coastal marine resources. However, various sizes and detailed structures of marine objects make it difficult for accurate mapping from HSR images by using conventional methods. Therefore, this study attempts to extract marine aquaculture areas by using an automatic labeling method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), i.e., an end-to-end hierarchical cascade network (HCNet). Specifically, for marine objects of various sizes, we propose to improve the classification performance by utilizing multi-scale contextual information. Technically, based on the output of a CNN encoder, we employ atrous convolutions to capture multi-scale contextual information and aggregate them in a hierarchical cascade way. Meanwhile, for marine objects with detailed structures, we propose to refine the detailed information gradually by using a series of long-span connections with fine resolution features from the shallow layers. In addition, to decrease the semantic gaps between features in different levels, we propose to refine the feature space (i.e., channel and spatial dimensions) using an attention-based module. Experimental results show that our proposed HCNet can effectively identify and distinguish different kinds of marine aquaculture, with 98% of overall accuracy. It also achieves better classification performance compared with object-based support vector machine and state-of-the-art CNN-based methods, such as FCN-32s, U-Net, and DeeplabV2. Our developed method lays a solid foundation for the intelligent monitoring and management of coastal marine resources.},

ABSTRACT = {There are few network resources in wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs). Compressing media data can reduce the reliance of user&rsquo;s Quality of Experience (QoE) on network resources. Existing video coding software, such as H.264 and H.265, focuses only on spatial and short-term information redundancy. However, video usually contains redundancy over a long period of time. Therefore, compressing video information redundancy with a long period of time without compromising the user experience and adaptive delivery is a challenge in WMSNs. In this paper, a semantic-aware super-resolution transmission for adaptive video streaming system (SASRT) for WMSNs is presented. In the SASRT, some deep learning algorithms are used to extract video semantic information and enrich the video quality. On the multimedia sensor, different bit-rate semantic information and video data are encoded and uploaded to user. Semantic information can also be identified on the user side, further reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred. However, identifying semantic information on the user side may increase the computational cost of the user side. On the user side, video quality is enriched with super-resolution technologies. The major challenges faced by SASRT include where the semantic information is identified, how to choose the bit rates of semantic and video information, and how network resources should be allocated to video and semantic information. The optimization problem is formulated as a complexity-constrained nonlinear NP-hard problem. Three adaptive strategies and a heuristic algorithm are proposed to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that SASRT can compress video information redundancy with a long period of time effectively and enrich the user experience with limited network resources while simultaneously improving the utilization of these network resources.},

ABSTRACT = {Graphs are a very useful framework for representing information. In general, these data structures are used in different application domains where data of interest are described in terms of local and spatial relations. In this context, the aim is to propose an alternative graph-based image representation. An image is encoded by a Region Adjacency Graph (RAG), based on Multicolored Neighborhood (MCN) clustering. This representation is integrated into a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system, designed for the vision-based positioning task. The image matching phase, in the CBIR system, is managed with an approach of attributed graph matching, named the extended-VF algorithm. Evaluated in a context of indoor localization, the proposed system reports remarkable performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Automatic weed detection and classification faces the challenges of large intraclass variation and high spectral similarity to other vegetation. With the availability of new high-resolution remote sensing data from various platforms and sensors, it is possible to capture both spectral and spatial characteristics of weed species at multiple scales. Effective multi-resolution feature learning is then desirable to extract distinctive intensity, texture and shape features of each category of weed to enhance the weed separability. We propose a feature extraction method using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and superpixel based Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Both middle and high level spatial features are learned using the CNN. Local texture features from superpixel-based LBP are extracted, and are also used as input to Support Vector Machines (SVM) for weed classification. Experimental results on the hyperspectral and remote sensing datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that it outperforms several feature extraction approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have attracted great attention in remote sensing due to their high capability to model high-level semantic content of Remote Sensing (RS) images. However, CNNs do not explicitly retain the relative position of objects in an image and, thus, the effectiveness of the obtained features is limited in the framework of the complex object detection problems. To address this problem, in this paper we introduce Capsule Networks (CapsNets) for object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-acquired images. Unlike CNNs, CapsNets extract and exploit the information content about objects&rsquo; relative position across several layers, which enables parsing crowded scenes with overlapping objects. Experimental results obtained on two datasets for car and solar panel detection problems show that CapsNets provide similar object detection accuracies when compared to state-of-the-art deep models with significantly reduced computational time. This is due to the fact that CapsNets emphasize dynamic routine instead of the depth.},

ABSTRACT = {Vehicle detection from remote sensing images plays a significant role in transportation related applications. However, the scale variations, orientation variations, illumination variations, and partial occlusions of vehicles, as well as the image qualities, bring great challenges for accurate vehicle detection. In this paper, we present an affine-function transformation-based object matching framework for vehicle detection from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images. First, meaningful and non-redundant patches are generated through a superpixel segmentation strategy. Then, the affine-function transformation-based object matching framework is applied to a vehicle template and each of the patches for vehicle existence estimation. Finally, vehicles are detected and located after matching cost thresholding, vehicle location estimation, and multiple response elimination. Quantitative evaluations on two UAV image datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average completeness, correctness, quality, and F1-measure of 0.909, 0.969, 0.883, and 0.938, respectively. Comparative studies also demonstrate that the proposed method achieves compatible performance with the Faster R-CNN and outperforms the other eight existing methods in accurately detecting vehicles of various conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {With the advent of high-spatial resolution (HSR) satellite imagery, urban land use/land cover (LULC) mapping has become one of the most popular applications in remote sensing. Due to the importance of context information (e.g., size/shape/texture) for classifying urban LULC features, Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) techniques are commonly employed for mapping urban areas. Regardless of adopting a pixel- or object-based framework, the selection of a suitable classifier is of critical importance for urban mapping. The popularity of deep learning (DL) (or deep neural networks (DNNs)) for image classification has recently skyrocketed, but it is still arguable if, or to what extent, DL methods can outperform other state-of-the art ensemble and/or Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms in the context of urban LULC classification using GEOBIA. In this study, we carried out an experimental comparison among different architectures of DNNs (i.e., regular deep multilayer perceptron (MLP), regular autoencoder (RAE), sparse, autoencoder (SAE), variational autoencoder (AE), convolutional neural networks (CNN)), common ensemble algorithms (Random Forests (RF), Bagging Trees (BT), Gradient Boosting Trees (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)), and SVM to investigate their potential for urban mapping using a GEOBIA approach. We tested the classifiers on two RS images (with spatial resolutions of 30 cm and 50 cm). Based on our experiments, we drew three main conclusions: First, we found that the MLP model was the most accurate classifier. Second, unsupervised pretraining with the use of autoencoders led to no improvement in the classification result. In addition, the small difference in the classification accuracies of MLP from those of other models like SVM, GB, and XGB classifiers demonstrated that other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers are still versatile enough to handle mapping of complex landscapes. Finally, the experiments showed that the integration of CNN and GEOBIA could not lead to more accurate results than the other classifiers applied.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to solve the problem of the inaccuracy of the traditional online operation risk assessment model based on a physical mechanism and the inability to adapt to the actual operation of massive online operation monitoring data, this paper proposes an online operation risk assessment of the wind power system of the convolution neural network (CNN) considering multiple random factors. This paper analyzes multiple random factors of the wind power system, including uncertain wind power output, load fluctuations, frequent changes in operation patterns, and the electrical equipment failure rate, and generates the sample data based on multi-random factors. It uses the CNN algorithm network, offline training to obtain the risk assessment model, and online application to obtain the real-time online operation risk state of the wind power system. Finally, the online operation risk assessment model is verified by simulation using the standard network of 39 nodes of 10 machines New England system. The results prove that the risk assessment model presented in this paper is more rapid and suitable for online application.},

ABSTRACT = {Research on driver status recognition has been actively conducted to reduce fatal crashes caused by the driver&rsquo;s distraction and drowsiness. As in many other research areas, deep-learning-based algorithms are showing excellent performance for driver status recognition. However, despite decades of research in the driver status recognition area, the visual image-based driver monitoring system has not been widely used in the automobile industry. This is because the system requires high-performance processors, as well as has a hierarchical structure in which each procedure is affected by an inaccuracy from the previous procedure. To avoid using a hierarchical structure, we propose a method using Mobilenets without the functions of face detection and tracking and show this method is enabled to recognize facial behaviors that indicate the driver&rsquo;s distraction. However, frames per second processed by Mobilenets with a Raspberry pi, one of the single-board computers, is not enough to recognize the driver status. To alleviate this problem, we propose a lightweight driver monitoring system using a resource sharing device in a vehicle (e.g., a driver&rsquo;s mobile phone). The proposed system is based on Multi-Task Mobilenets (MT-Mobilenets), which consists of the Mobilenets&rsquo; base and multi-task classifier. The three Softmax regressions of the multi-task classifier help one Mobilenets base recognize facial behaviors related to the driver status, such as distraction, fatigue, and drowsiness. The proposed system based on MT-Mobilenets improved the accuracy of the driver status recognition with Raspberry Pi by using one additional device.},

ABSTRACT = {This research aims to develop a farm management emulation tool that enables agrifood producers to effectively introduce advanced digital technologies, like intelligent and autonomous unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), in real-world field operations. To that end, we first provide a critical taxonomy of studies investigating agricultural robotic systems with regard to: (i) the analysis approach, i.e., simulation, emulation, real-world implementation; (ii) farming operations; and (iii) the farming type. Our analysis demonstrates that simulation and emulation modelling have been extensively applied to study advanced agricultural machinery while the majority of the extant research efforts focuses on harvesting/picking/mowing and fertilizing/spraying activities; most studies consider a generic agricultural layout. Thereafter, we developed AgROS, an emulation tool based on the Robot Operating System, which could be used for assessing the efficiency of real-world robot systems in customized fields. The AgROS allows farmers to select their actual field from a map layout, import the landscape of the field, add characteristics of the actual agricultural layout (e.g., trees, static objects), select an agricultural robot from a predefined list of commercial systems, import the selected UGV into the emulation environment, and test the robot&rsquo;s performance in a quasi-real-world environment. AgROS supports farmers in the ex-ante analysis and performance evaluation of robotized precision farming operations while lays the foundations for realizing &ldquo;digital twins&rdquo; in agriculture.},

ABSTRACT = {In a human&ndash;machine cooperation system, assessing the mental workload (MW) of the human operator is quite crucial to maintaining safe operation conditions. Among various MW indicators, electroencephalography (EEG) signals are particularly attractive because of their high temporal resolution and sensitivity to the occupation of working memory. However, the individual difference of the EEG feature distribution may impair the machine-learning based MW classifier. In this paper, we employed a fast-training neural network, extreme learning machine (ELM), as the basis to build an individual-specific classifier ensemble to recognize binary MW. To improve the diversity of the classification committee, heterogeneous member classifiers were adopted by fusing multiple ELMs and Bayesian models. Specifically, a deep network structure was applied in each weak model aiming at finding informative EEG feature representations. The structure of hyper-parameters of the proposed heterogeneous ensemble ELM (HE-ELM) was then identified and then its performance was compared against several competitive MW classifiers. We found that the HE-ELM model was superior for improving the individual-specific accuracy of MW assessments.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in several fields including, for example, archaeology, cargo transport, conservation, healthcare, filmmaking, hobbies and recreational use. UAVs are aircraft characterized by the absence of a human pilot on board. The extensive use of these devices has highlighted maintenance problems with regard to the propellers, which represent the source of propulsion of the aircraft. A defect in the propellers of a drone can cause the aircraft to fall to the ground and its consequent destruction, and it also constitutes a safety problem for objects and people that are in the range of action of the aircraft. In this study, the measurements of the noise emitted by a UAV were used to build a classification model to detect unbalanced blades in a UAV propeller. To simulate the fault condition, two strips of paper tape were applied to the upper surface of a blade. The paper tape created a substantial modification of the aerodynamics of the blade, and this modification characterized the noise produced by the blade in its rotation. Then, a model based on artificial neural network algorithms was built to detect unbalanced blades in a UAV propeller. This model showed high accuracy (0.9763), indicating a high number of correct detections and suggests the adoption of this tool to verify the operating conditions of a UAV. The test must be performed indoors; from the measurements of the noise produced by the UAV it is possible to identify an imbalance in the propeller blade.},

ABSTRACT = {Mobile laser scanning (MLS) is widely used in the mapping of forest environments. It has become important for extracting the parameters of forest trees using the generated environmental map. In this study, a three-dimensional point cloud map of a forest area was generated by using the Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR system, so as to extract the diameter at breast height (DBH) of individual trees. The Velodyne VLP-16 LiDAR system and inertial measurement units (IMU) were used to construct a mobile measurement platform for generating 3D point cloud maps for forest areas. The 3D point cloud map in the forest area was processed offline, and the ground point cloud was removed by the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. The trees in the experimental area were segmented by the European clustering algorithm, and the DBH component of the tree point cloud was extracted and projected onto a 2D plane, fitting the DBH of the trees using the RANSAC algorithm in the plane. A three-dimensional point cloud map of 71 trees was generated in the experimental area, and estimated the DBH. The mean and variance of the absolute error were 0.43 cm and 0.50, respectively. The relative error of the whole was 2.27%, the corresponding variance was 15.09, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.70 cm. The experimental results were good and met the requirements of forestry mapping, and the application value and significance were presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Most approaches for moving object detection (MOD) based on computer vision are limited to stationary camera environments. In advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), however, ego-motion is added to image frames owing to the use of a moving camera. This results in mixed motion in the image frames and makes it difficult to classify target objects and background. In this paper, we propose an efficient MOD algorithm that can cope with moving camera environments. In addition, we present a hardware design and implementation results for the real-time processing of the proposed algorithm. The proposed moving object detector was designed using hardware description language (HDL) and its real-time performance was evaluated using an FPGA based test system. Experimental results demonstrate that our design achieves better detection performance than existing MOD systems. The proposed moving object detector was implemented with 13.2K logic slices, 104 DSP48s, and 163 BRAM and can support real-time processing of 30 fps at an operating frequency of 200 MHz.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital elevation model (DEM) has been frequently used for the reduction and management of flood risk. Various classification methods have been developed to extract DEM from point clouds. However, the accuracy and computational efficiency need to be improved. The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to determine the suitability of a new method to produce DEM from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, using a raw point cloud classification and ground point filtering based on deep learning and neural networks (NN); (2) to test the convenience of rebalancing datasets for point cloud classification; (3) to evaluate the effect of the land cover class on the algorithm performance and the elevation accuracy; and (4) to assess the usability of the LiDAR and UAV structure from motion (SfM) DEM in flood risk mapping. In this paper, a new method of raw point cloud classification and ground point filtering based on deep learning using NN is proposed and tested on LiDAR and UAV data. The NN was trained on approximately 6 million points from which local and global geometric features and intensity data were extracted. Pixel-by-pixel accuracy assessment and visual inspection confirmed that filtering point clouds based on deep learning using NN is an appropriate technique for ground classification and producing DEM, as for the test and validation areas, both ground and non-ground classes achieved high recall (&gt;0.70) and high precision values (&gt;0.85), which showed that the two classes were well handled by the model. The type of method used for balancing the original dataset did not have a significant influence in the algorithm accuracy, and it was suggested not to use any of them unless the distribution of the generated and real data set will remain the same. Furthermore, the comparisons between true data and LiDAR and a UAV structure from motion (UAV SfM) point clouds were analyzed, as well as the derived DEM. The root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean average error (MAE) of the DEM were 0.25 m and 0.05 m, respectively, for LiDAR data, and 0.59 m and &ndash;0.28 m, respectively, for UAV data. For all land cover classes, the UAV DEM overestimated the elevation, whereas the LIDAR DEM underestimated it. The accuracy was not significantly different in the LiDAR DEM for the different vegetation classes, while for the UAV DEM, the RMSE increased with the height of the vegetation class. The comparison of the inundation areas derived from true LiDAR and UAV data for different water levels showed that in all cases, the largest differences were obtained for the lowest water level tested, while they performed best for very high water levels. Overall, the approach presented in this work produced DEM from LiDAR and UAV data with the required accuracy for flood mapping according to European Flood Directive standards. Although LiDAR is the recommended technology for point cloud acquisition, a suitable alternative is also UAV SfM in hilly areas.},

ABSTRACT = {Major metropolitan cities worldwide have extensively invested to secure utilities and build state-of-the-art infrastructure related to underground fluid transportation. Sewer and water pipelines make our lives extremely convenient when they function appropriately. However, leakages in underground pipe mains causes sinkholes and drinking-water scarcity. Sinkholes are the complex problems stemming from the interaction of leaked water and ground. The aim of this work is to review the existing methods for monitoring leakage in underground pipelines, the sinkholes caused by these leakages, and the viability of wireless sensor networking (WSN) for monitoring leakages and sinkholes. Herein, the authors have discussed the methods based on different objectives and their applicability via various approaches&mdash;(1) patent analysis; (2) web-of-science analysis; (3) WSN-based pipeline leakage and sinkhole monitoring. The study shows that the research on sinkholes due to leakages in sewer and water pipelines by using WSN is still in a premature stage and needs extensive investigation and research contributions. Additionally, the authors have suggested prospects for future research by comparing, analyzing, and classifying the reviewed methods. This study advocates collocating WSN, Internet of things, and artificial intelligence with pipeline monitoring methods to resolve the issues of the sinkhole occurrence.},

ABSTRACT = {Feature tracking in image collections significantly affects the efficiency and accuracy of Structure from Motion (SFM). Insufficient correspondences may result in disconnected structures and incomplete components, while the redundant correspondences containing incorrect ones may yield to folded and superimposed structures. In this paper, we present a Superpixel-based feature tracking method for structure from motion. In the proposed method, we first propose to use a joint approach to detect local keypoints and compute descriptors. Second, the superpixel-based approach is used to generate labels for the input image. Third, we combine the Speed Up Robust Feature and binary test in the generated label regions to produce a set of combined descriptors for the detected keypoints. Fourth, the locality-sensitive hash (LSH)-based k nearest neighboring matching (KNN) is utilized to produce feature correspondences, and then the ratio test approach is used to remove outliers from the previous matching collection. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on several challenging benchmarking datasets including highly ambiguous and duplicated scenes. Experimental results show that the proposed method gets better performances with respect to the state of the art methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a fundamental indicator of plant growth status in agronomic and environmental studies. Due to rapid advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and sensor technologies, UAV-based remote sensing is emerging as a promising solution for monitoring crop LAI with great flexibility and applicability. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of combining color and texture information derived from UAV-based digital images for estimating LAI of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Rice field trials were conducted at two sites using different nitrogen application rates, varieties, and transplanting methods during 2016 to 2017. Digital images were collected using a consumer-grade UAV after sampling at key growth stages of tillering, stem elongation, panicle initiation and booting. Vegetation color indices (CIs) and grey level co-occurrence matrix-based textures were extracted from mosaicked UAV ortho-images for each plot. As a solution of using indices composed by two different textures, normalized difference texture indices (NDTIs) were calculated by two randomly selected textures. The relationships between rice LAIs and each calculated index were then compared using simple linear regression. Multivariate regression models with different input sets were further used to test the potential of combining CIs with various textures for rice LAI estimation. The results revealed that the visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) based on three visible bands and the NDTI based on the mean textures derived from the red and green bands were the best for LAI retrieval in the CI and NDTI groups, respectively. Independent accuracy assessment showed that random forest (RF) exhibited the best predictive performance when combining CI and texture inputs (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.87, MAE = 0.69). This study introduces a promising solution of combining color indices and textures from UAV-based digital imagery for rice LAI estimation. Future studies are needed on finding the best operation mode, suitable ground resolution, and optimal predictive methods for practical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Thermal infrared (TIR) pedestrian tracking is one of the major issues in computer vision. Mean-shift is a powerful and versatile non-parametric iterative algorithm for finding local maxima in probability distributions. In existing infrared data, and mean-shift-based tracking is generally based on the brightness feature values. Unfortunately, the brightness is distorted by the target and background variations. This paper proposes a novel pedestrian tracking algorithm, thermal infrared mean-shift (TIR-MS), by introducing radiometric temperature data in mean-shift tracking. The thermal brightness image (eight-bits) was distorted by the automatic contrast enhancement of the scene such as hot objects in the background. On the other hand, the temperature data was unaffected directly by the background change, except for variations by the seasonal effect, which is more stable than the brightness. The experimental results showed that the TIR-MS outperformed the original mean-shift-based brightness when tracking a pedestrian head with successive background variations.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now considered one of the best remote sensing techniques for gathering data over large areas. They are now being used in the industry sector as sensing tools for proactively solving or preventing many issues, besides quantifying production and helping to make decisions. UAVs are a highly consistent technological platform for efficient and cost-effective data collection and event monitoring. The industrial Internet of things (IIoT) sends data from systems that monitor and control the physical world to data processing systems that cloud computing has shown to be important tools for meeting processing requirements. In fog computing, the IoT gateway links different objects to the internet. It can operate as a joint interface for different networks and support different communication protocols. A great deal of effort has been put into developing UAVs and multi-UAV systems. This paper introduces a smart IIoT monitoring and control system based on an unmanned aerial vehicle that uses cloud computing services and exploits fog computing as the bridge between IIoT layers. Its novelty lies in the fact that the UAV is automatically integrated into an industrial control system through an IoT gateway platform, while UAV photos are systematically and instantly computed and analyzed in the cloud. Visual supervision of the plant by drones and cloud services is integrated in real-time into the control loop of the industrial control system. As a proof of concept, the platform was used in a case study in an industrial concrete plant. The results obtained clearly illustrate the feasibility of the proposed platform in providing a reliable and efficient system for UAV remote control to improve product quality and reduce waste. For this, we studied the communication latency between the different IIoT layers in different IoT gateways.},

ABSTRACT = {In present forest surveys, some problems occur because of the cost and time required when using external tools to acquire tree measurement. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a new cost-saving and time-saving ground measurement method implemented in a forest geographic information system (GIS) survey. To obtain a better solution, this paper presents the design and implementation of a new ground measurement tool in which mobile devices play a very important role. Based on terrestrial photogrammetry, location-based services (LBS), and computer vision, the tool assists forest GIS surveys in obtaining important forest structure factors such as tree position, diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, and tree species. This paper selected two plots to verify the accuracy of the ground measurement tool. Experiments show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the position coordinates of the trees was 0.222 m and 0.229 m, respectively, and the relative root mean square error (rRMSE) was close to 0. The rRMSE of the DBH measurement was 10.17% and 13.38%, and the relative Bias (rBias) of the DBH measurement was &minus;0.88% and &minus;2.41%. The rRMSE of tree height measurement was 6.74% and 6.69%, and the rBias of tree height measurement was &minus;1.69% and &minus;1.27%, which conforms to the forest investigation requirements. In addition, workers usually make visual observations of trees and then combine their personal knowledge or experience to identify tree species, which may lead to the situations when they cannot distinguish tree species due to insufficient knowledge or experience. Based on MobileNets, a lightweight convolutional neural network designed for mobile phone, a model was trained to assist workers in identifying tree species. The dataset was collected from some forest parks in Beijing. The accuracy of the tree species recognition model was 94.02% on a test dataset and 93.21% on a test dataset in the mobile phone. This provides an effective reference for workers to identify tree species and can assist in artificial identification of tree species. Experiments show that this solution using the ground measurement tool saves time and cost for forest resources GIS surveys.},

ABSTRACT = {Bushfires are becoming more frequent and intensive due to changing climate. Those that occur close to vineyards can cause smoke contamination of grapevines and grapes, which can affect wines, producing smoke-taint. At present, there are no available practical in-field tools available for detection of smoke contamination or taint in berries. This research proposes a non-invasive/in-field detection system for smoke contamination in grapevine canopies based on predictable changes in stomatal conductance patterns based on infrared thermal image analysis and machine learning modeling based on pattern recognition. A second model was also proposed to quantify levels of smoke-taint related compounds as targets in berries and wines using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) as inputs for machine learning fitting modeling. Results showed that the pattern recognition model to detect smoke contamination from canopies had 96% accuracy. The second model to predict smoke taint compounds in berries and wine fit the NIR data with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.97 and with no indication of overfitting. These methods can offer grape growers quick, affordable, accurate, non-destructive in-field screening tools to assist in vineyard management practices to minimize smoke taint in wines with in-field applications using smartphones and unmanned aerial systems (UAS).},

ABSTRACT = {The separation of crop types is essential for many agricultural applications, particularly when within-season information is required. Generally, remote sensing may provide timely information with varying accuracy over the growing season, but in small structured agricultural areas, a very high spatial resolution may be needed that exceeds current satellite capabilities. This paper presents an experiment using spectral and textural features of NIR-red-green-blue (NIR-RGB) bands data sets acquired with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The study area is located in the Swiss Plateau, which has highly fragmented and small structured agricultural fields. The observations took place between May 5 and September 29, 2015 over 11 days. The analyses are based on a random forest (RF) approach, predicting crop separation metrics of all analyzed crops. Three temporal windows of observations based on accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) were identified: an early temporal window (515&ndash;1232 AGDD, 5 May&ndash;17 June 2015) with an average accuracy (AA) of 70&ndash;75%; a mid-season window (1362&ndash;2016 AGDD, 25 June&ndash;22 July 2015) with an AA of around 80%; and a late window (2626&ndash;3238 AGDD, 21 August&ndash;29 September 2015) with an AA of &lt;65%. Therefore, crop separation is most promising in the mid-season window, and an additional NIR band increases the accuracy significantly. However, discrimination of winter crops is most effective in the early window, adding further observational requirements to the first window.},

ABSTRACT = {Exotic conifers can provide significant ecosystem services, but in some environments, they have become invasive and threaten indigenous ecosystems. In New Zealand, this phenomenon is of considerable concern as the area occupied by invasive exotic trees is large and increasing rapidly. Remote sensing methods offer a potential means of identifying and monitoring land infested by these trees, enabling managers to efficiently allocate resources for their control. In this study, we sought to develop methods for remote detection of exotic invasive trees, namely Pinus sylvestris and P. ponderosa. Critically, the study aimed to detect these species prior to the onset of maturity and coning as this is important for preventing further spread. In the study environment in New Zealand&rsquo;s South Island, these species reach maturity and begin bearing cones at a young age. As such, detection of these smaller individuals requires specialist methods and very high-resolution remote sensing data. We examined the efficacy of classifiers developed using two machine learning algorithms with multispectral and laser scanning data collected from two platforms&mdash;manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). The study focused on a localized conifer invasion originating from a multi-species pine shelter belt in a grassland environment. This environment provided a useful means of defining the detection thresholds of the methods and technologies employed. An extensive field dataset including over 17,000 trees (height range = 1 cm to 476 cm) was used as an independent validation dataset for the detection methods developed. We found that data from both platforms and using both logistic regression and random forests for classification provided highly accurate (kappa     &lt; 0.996    ) detection of invasive conifers. Our analysis showed that the data from both UAV and manned aircraft was useful for detecting trees down to 1 m in height and therefore shorter than 99.3% of the coning individuals in the study dataset. We also explored the relative contribution of both multispectral and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data in the detection of invasive trees through fitting classification models with different combinations of predictors and found that the most useful models included data from both sensors. However, the combination of ALS and multispectral data did not significantly improve classification accuracy. We believe that this was due to the simplistic vegetation and terrain structure in the study site that resulted in uncomplicated separability of invasive conifers from other vegetation. This study provides valuable new knowledge of the efficacy of detecting invasive conifers prior to the onset of coning using high-resolution data from UAV and manned aircraft. This will be an important tool in managing the spread of these important invasive plants.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous vision-based aerial grasping is an essential and challenging task for aerial manipulation missions. In this paper, we propose a vision-based aerial grasping system for a Rotorcraft Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to grasp a target object. The UAV system is equipped with a monocular camera, a 3-DOF robotic arm with a gripper and a Jetson TK1 computer. Efficient and reliable visual detectors and control laws are crucial for autonomous aerial grasping using limited onboard sensing and computational capabilities. To detect and track the target object in real time, an efficient proposal algorithm is presented to reliably estimate the region of interest (ROI), then a correlation filter-based classifier is developed to track the detected object. Moreover, a support vector regression (SVR)-based grasping position detector is proposed to improve the grasp success rate with high computational efficiency. Using the estimated grasping position and the UAV?√Ñ√¥s states, novel control laws of the UAV and the robotic arm are proposed to perform aerial grasping. Extensive simulations and outdoor flight experiments have been implemented. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed vision-based aerial grasping system can autonomously and reliably grasp the target object while working entirely onboard.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a primary role in a plethora of technical and scientific fields owing to their wide range of applications. In particular, the provision of emergency services during the occurrence of a crisis event is a vital application domain where such aerial robots can contribute, sending out valuable assistance to both distressed humans and rescue teams. Bearing in mind that time constraints constitute a crucial parameter in search and rescue (SAR) missions, the punctual and precise detection of humans in peril is of paramount importance. The paper in hand deals with real-time human detection onboard a fully autonomous rescue UAV. Using deep learning techniques, the implemented embedded system was capable of detecting open water swimmers. This allowed the UAV to provide assistance accurately in a fully unsupervised manner, thus enhancing first responder operational capabilities. The novelty of the proposed system is the combination of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) techniques and computer vision algorithms for both precise human detection and rescue apparatus release. Details about hardware configuration as well as the system&rsquo;s performance evaluation are fully discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Small unmanned aircraft vehicles (SUAVs) or drones are very useful for visual detection and tracking due to their efficiency in capturing scenes. This paper addresses the detection and tracking of moving pedestrians with an SUAV. The detection step consists of frame subtraction, followed by thresholding, morphological filter, and false alarm reduction, taking into consideration the true size of targets. The center of the detected area is input to the next tracking stage. Interacting multiple model (IMM) filtering estimates the state of vectors and covariance matrices, using multiple modes of Kalman filtering. In the experiments, a dozen people and one car are captured by a stationary drone above the road. The Kalman filter and the IMM filter with two or three modes are compared in the accuracy of the state estimation. The root-mean squared errors (RMSE) of position and velocity are obtained for each target and show the good accuracy in detecting and tracking the target position&mdash;the average detection rate is 96.5%. When the two-mode IMM filter is used, the minimum average position and velocity RMSE obtained are around 0.8 m and 0.59 m/s, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Detection and classification of tree species from remote sensing data were performed using mainly multispectral and hyperspectral images and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data. Despite the comparatively lower cost and higher spatial resolution, few studies focused on images captured by Red-Green-Blue (RGB) sensors. Besides, the recent years have witnessed an impressive progress of deep learning methods for object detection. Motivated by this scenario, we proposed and evaluated the usage of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) high spatial resolution RGB imagery for the detection of law protected tree species. Three state-of-the-art object detection methods were evaluated: Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN), YOLOv3 and RetinaNet. A dataset was built to assess the selected methods, comprising 392 RBG images captured from August 2018 to February 2019, over a forested urban area in midwest Brazil. The target object is an important tree species threatened by extinction known as Dipteryx alata Vogel (Fabaceae). The experimental analysis delivered average precision around 92% with an associated processing times below 30 miliseconds.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a power control method is proposed for a buffer-aided relay node (RN) to enhance the energy efficiency of the RN system. By virtue of a buffer, the RN can reserve the data at the buffer when the the channel gain between an RN and a destination node (DN) is weaker than that between SN and RN. The RN then opportunistically forward the reserved data in the buffer according to channel condition between the RN and the DN. By exploiting the buffer, RN reduces transmit power when it reduces the transmit data rate and reserve the data in the buffer. Therefore, without any total throughput reduction, the power consumption of RN can be reduced, resulting in the energy efficiency (EE) improvement of the RN system. Furthermore, for the power control, we devise a simple power control method based on a two-dimensional surface fitting model of an optimal transmit power of RN. The proposed RN power control method is readily and locally implementable at the RN, and it can significantly improve EE of the RN compared to the fixed power control method and the spectral efficiency based method as verified by the rigorous numerical results.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly growing in popularity. Initially introduced for military purposes, over the past few years, UAVs and related technologies have successfully transitioned to a whole new range of civilian applications such as delivery, logistics, surveillance, entertainment, and so forth. They have opened new possibilities such as allowing operation in otherwise difficult or hazardous areas, for instance. For all applications, one foremost concern is the selection of the paths and trajectories of UAVs, and at the same time, UAVs control comes with many challenges, as they have limited energy, limited load capacity and are vulnerable to difficult weather conditions. Generally, efficiently operating a drone can be mathematically formalized as a path optimization problem under some constraints. This shares some commonalities with similar problems that have been extensively studied in the context of urban vehicles and it is only natural that the recent literature has extended the latter to fit aerial vehicle constraints. The knowledge of such problems, their formulation, the resolution methods proposed‚Äîthrough the variants induced specifically by UAVs features‚Äîare of interest for practitioners for any UAV application. Hence, in this study, we propose a review of existing literature devoted to such UAV path optimization problems, focusing specifically on the sub-class of problems that consider the mobility on a macroscopic scale. These are related to the two existing general classic ones‚Äîthe Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. We analyze the recent literature that adapted the problems to the UAV context, provide an extensive classification and taxonomy of their problems and their formulation and also give a synthetic overview of the resolution techniques, performance metrics and obtained numerical results.},

ABSTRACT = {With increasing consumption, plastic mulch benefits agriculture by promoting crop quality and yield, but the environmental and soil pollution is becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, research on the monitoring of plastic mulched farmland (PMF) has received increasing attention. Plastic mulched farmland in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote images due to the high resolution, shows a prominent spatial pattern, which brings difficulties to the task of monitoring PMF. In this paper, through a comparison between two deep semantic segmentation methods, SegNet and fully convolutional networks (FCN), and a traditional classification method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), we propose an end-to-end deep-learning method aimed at accurately recognizing PMF for UAV remote sensing images from Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China. After experiments with single-band, three-band and six-band image data, we found that deep semantic segmentation models built via single-band data which only use the texture pattern of PMF can identify it well; for example, SegNet reaching the highest accuracy of 88.68% in a 900 nm band. Furthermore, with three visual bands and six-band data (3 visible bands and 3 near-infrared bands), deep semantic segmentation models combining the texture and spectral features further improve the accuracy of PMF identification, whereas six-band data obtains an optimal performance for FCN and SegNet. In addition, deep semantic segmentation methods, FCN and SegNet, due to their strong feature extraction capability and direct pixel classification, clearly outperform the traditional SVM method in precision and speed. Among three classification methods, SegNet model built on three-band and six-band data obtains the optimal average accuracy of 89.62% and 90.6%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed deep semantic segmentation model, when tested against the traditional classification method, provides a promising path for mapping PMF in UAV remote sensing images.},

ABSTRACT = {The precise classification of crop types is an important basis of agricultural monitoring and crop protection. With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV-borne hyperspectral remote sensing imagery with high spatial resolution has become the ideal data source for the precise classification of crops. For precise classification of crops with a wide variety of classes and varied spectra, the traditional spectral-based classification method has difficulty in mining large-scale spatial information and maintaining the detailed features of the classes. Therefore, a precise crop classification method using spectral-spatial-location fusion based on conditional random fields (SSLF-CRF) for UAV-borne hyperspectral remote sensing imagery is proposed in this paper. The proposed method integrates the spectral information, the spatial context, the spatial features, and the spatial location information in the conditional random field model by the probabilistic potentials, providing complementary information for the crop discrimination from different perspectives. The experimental results obtained with two UAV-borne high spatial resolution hyperspectral images confirm that the proposed method can solve the problems of large-scale spatial information modeling and spectral variability, improving the classification accuracy for each crop type. This method has important significance for the precise classification of crops in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery.},

ABSTRACT = {Slope failures occur when parts of a slope collapse abruptly under the influence of gravity, often triggered by a rainfall event or earthquake. The resulting slope failures often cause problems in mountainous or hilly regions, and the detection of slope failure is therefore an important topic for research. Most of the methods currently used for mapping and modelling slope failures rely on classification algorithms or feature extraction, but the spatial complexity of slope failures, the uncertainties inherent in expert knowledge, and problems in transferability, all combine to inhibit slope failure detection. In an attempt to overcome some of these problems we have analyzed the potential of deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for slope failure detection, in an area along a road section in the northern Himalayas, India. We used optical data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over two separate study areas. Different CNN designs were used to produce eight different slope failure distribution maps, which were then compared with manually extracted slope failure polygons using different accuracy assessment metrics such as the precision, F-score, and mean intersection-over-union (mIOU). A slope failure inventory data set was produced for each of the study areas using a frequency-area distribution (FAD). The CNN approach that was found to perform best (precision accuracy assessment of almost 90% precision, F-score 85%, mIOU 74%) was one that used a window size of 64 &times; 64 pixels for the sample patches, and included slope data as an additional input layer. The additional information from the slope data helped to discriminate between slope failure areas and roads, which had similar spectral characteristics in the optical imagery. We concluded that the effectiveness of CNNs for slope failure detection was strongly dependent on their design (i.e., the window size selected for the sample patch, the data used, and the training strategies), but that CNNs are currently only designed by trial and error. While CNNs can be powerful tools, such trial and error strategies make it difficult to explain why a particular pooling or layer numbering works better than any other.},

ABSTRACT = {A number of intelligent warning techniques have been implemented for detecting underwater infrastructure diagnosis to partially replace human-conducted on-site inspections. However, the extensively varying real-world situation (e.g., the adverse environmental conditions, the limited sample space, and the complex defect types) can lead to challenges to the wide adoption of intelligent warning techniques. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposed an intelligent algorithm combing gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) with self-organization map (SOM) for accurate diagnosis of the underwater structural damage. In order to optimize the generative criterion for GLCM construction, a triangle algorithm was proposed based on orthogonal experiments. The constructed GLCM were utilized to evaluate the texture features of the regions of interest (ROI) of micro-injury images of underwater structures and extracted damage image texture characteristic parameters. The digital feature screening (DFS) method was used to obtain the most relevant features as the input for the SOM network. According to the unique topology information of the SOM network, the classification result, recognition efficiency, parameters, such as the network layer number, hidden layer node, and learning step, were optimized. The robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach were tested on underwater structure images through the DFS method. The results showed that the proposed method revealed quite better performances and can diagnose structure damage in underwater realistic situations.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a payload designed to perform semi-autonomous contact inspection tasks without any type of positioning system external to the UAV, such as a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) or motion capture system, making possible inspection in challenging GNSS- denied sites. This payload includes two LiDAR sensors which measure the distance between the UAV and the target structure and their inner orientation angle. The system uses this information to control the approaching of the UAV to the structure and the contact between both, actuating over the pitch and yaw signals. This control is performed using a hybrid automaton with different states that represent all the possible UAV status during the inspection tasks. It uses different control strategies in each state. An ultrasonic gauge has been used as the inspection sensor of the payload to measure the thickness of a metallic sheet. The sensor requires a stable contact in order to collect reliable measurements. Several tests have been performed on the system, reaching accurate results which show it is able to maintain a stable contact with the target structure.},

ABSTRACT = {Using unmanned robotic systems in military operations such as reconnaissance or surveillance, as well as in many civil applications, is common practice. In this article, the problem of monitoring the specified area of interest by a fleet of unmanned aerial systems is examined. The monitoring is planned via the Cooperative Aerial Model, which deploys a number of waypoints in the area; these waypoints are visited successively by unmanned systems. The original model proposed in the past assumed that the area to be explored is perfectly flat. A new formulation of this model is introduced in this article so that the model can be used in a complex environment with uneven terrain and/or with many obstacles, which may occlude some parts of the area of interest. The optimization algorithm based on the simulated annealing principles is proposed for positioning of waypoints to cover as large an area as possible. A set of scenarios has been designed to verify and evaluate the proposed approach. The key experiments are aimed at finding the minimum number of waypoints needed to explore at least the minimum requested portion of the area. Furthermore, the results are compared to the algorithm based on the lawnmower pattern.},

ABSTRACT = {Feature/band selection (FS/BS) for target detection (TD) attempts to select features/bands that increase the discrimination between the target and the image background. Moreover, TD usually suffers from background interference. Therefore, bands that help detectors to effectively suppress the background and magnify the target signal are considered to be more useful. In this regard, three supervised distance-based filter FS methods are proposed in this paper. The first method is based on the TD concept. It uses the image autocorrelation matrix and the target signature in the detection space (DS) for FS. Features that increase the first-norm distance between the target energy and the mean energy of the background in DS are selected as optimal. The other two methods use background modeling via image clustering. The cluster mean spectra, along with the target spectrum, are then transferred into DS. Orthogonal subspace projection distance (OSPD) and first-norm distance (FND) are used as two FS criteria to select optimal features. Two datasets, HyMap RIT and SIM.GA, are used for the experiments. Several measures, i.e., true positives (TPs), false alarms (FAs), target detection accuracy (TDA), total negative score (TNS), and the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) are employed to evaluate the proposed methods and to investigate the impact of FS on the TD performance. The experimental results show that our proposed FS methods, as compared with five existing FS methods, have improving impacts on common target detectors and help them to yield better results.},

ABSTRACT = {A sufficient nitrogen (N) supply is mandatory for healthy crop growth, but negative consequences of N losses into the environment are known. Hence, deeply understanding and monitoring crop growth for an optimized N management is advisable. In this context, remote sensing facilitates the capturing of crop traits. While several studies on estimating biomass from spectral and structural data can be found, N is so far only estimated from spectral features. It is well known that N is negatively related to dry biomass, which, in turn, can be estimated from crop height. Based on this indirect link, the present study aims at estimating N concentration at field scale in a two-step model: first, using crop height to estimate biomass, and second, using the modeled biomass to estimate N concentration. For comparison, N concentration was estimated from spectral data. The data was captured on a spring barley field experiment in two growing seasons. Crop surface height was measured with a terrestrial laser scanner, seven vegetation indices were calculated from field spectrometer measurements, and dry biomass and N concentration were destructively sampled. In the validation, better results were obtained with the models based on structural data (R2 &lt; 0.85) than on spectral data (R2 &lt; 0.70). A brief look at the N concentration of different plant organs showed stronger dependencies on structural data (R2: 0.40&ndash;0.81) than on spectral data (R2: 0.18&ndash;0.68). Overall, this first study shows the potential of crop-specific across‚Äëseason two-step models based on structural data for estimating crop N concentration at field scale. The validity of the models for in-season estimations requires further research.},

ABSTRACT = {Rice lodging severely affects harvest yield. Traditional evaluation methods and manual on-site measurement are found to be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and cost-intensive. In this study, a new method for rice lodging assessment based on a deep learning UNet (U-shaped Network) architecture was proposed. The UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) equipped with a high-resolution digital camera and a three-band multispectral camera synchronously was used to collect lodged and non-lodged rice images at an altitude of 100 m. After splicing and cropping the original images, the datasets with the lodged and non-lodged rice image samples were established by augmenting for building a UNet model. The research results showed that the dice coefficients in RGB (Red, Green and Blue) image and multispectral image test set were 0.9442 and 0.9284, respectively. The rice lodging recognition effect using the RGB images without feature extraction is better than that of multispectral images. The findings of this study are useful for rice lodging investigations by different optical sensors, which can provide an important method for large-area, high-efficiency, and low-cost rice lodging monitoring research.},

ABSTRACT = {Natural-language-based scene understanding can enable heterogeneous robots to cooperate efficiently in large and unconstructed environments. However, studies on symbolic planning rarely consider the semantic knowledge acquisition problem associated with the surrounding environments. Further, recent developments in deep learning methods show outstanding performance for semantic scene understanding using natural language. In this paper, a cooperation framework that connects deep learning techniques and a symbolic planner for heterogeneous robots is proposed. The framework is largely composed of the scene understanding engine, planning agent, and knowledge engine. We employ neural networks for natural-language-based scene understanding to share environmental information among robots. We then generate a sequence of actions for each robot using a planning domain definition language planner. JENA-TDB is used for knowledge acquisition storage. The proposed method is validated using simulation results obtained from one unmanned aerial and three ground vehicles.},

ABSTRACT = {The gas sensor array has long been a major tool for measuring gas due to its high sensitivity, quick response, and low power consumption. This goal, however, faces a difficult challenge because of the cross-sensitivity of the gas sensor. This paper presents a novel gas mixture analysis method for gas sensor array applications. The features extracted from the raw data utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) were used to complete random forest (RF) modeling, which enabled qualitative identification. Support vector regression (SVR), optimized by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, was used to select hyperparameters C and &gamma; to establish the optimal regression model for the purpose of quantitative analysis. Utilizing the dataset, we evaluated the effectiveness of our approach. Compared with logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM), the average recognition rate of PCA combined with RF was the highest (97%). The fitting effect of SVR optimized by PSO for gas concentration was better than that of SVR and solved the problem of hyperparameters selection.},

ABSTRACT = {The aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU) is responsible for environmental control in the cabin and the main engines starting the aircraft. The prediction of its performance sensing data is significant for condition-based maintenance. As a complex system, its performance sensing data have a typically nonlinear feature. In order to monitor this process, a model with strong nonlinear fitting ability needs to be formulated. A neural network has advantages of solving a nonlinear problem. Compared with the traditional back propagation neural network algorithm, an extreme learning machine (ELM) has features of a faster learning speed and better generalization performance. To enhance the training of the neural network with a back propagation algorithm, an ELM is employed to predict the performance sensing data of the APU in this study. However, the randomly generated weights and thresholds of the ELM often may result in unstable prediction results. To address this problem, a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is utilized to optimize the ELM. In this way, a stable performance parameter prediction model of the APU can be obtained and better performance parameter prediction results can be achieved. The proposed method is evaluated by the real APU sensing data of China Southern Airlines Company Limited Shenyang Maintenance Base. Experimental results show that the optimized ELM with an RBM is more stable and can obtain more accurate prediction results.},

In this paper, road images from UAV oblique photogrammetry are used to reconstruct road three-dimensional (3D) models, from which road pavement distress is automatically detected and the corresponding dimensions are extracted using the developed algorithm.
