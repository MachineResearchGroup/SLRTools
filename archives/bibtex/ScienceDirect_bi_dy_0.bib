abstract = {Purpose
This study examined the effects of a vocabulary intervention for bilingual children that was conducted in children’s first language, Spanish, and included explicit instruction on cognates. We measured effects in terms of change from pre- to post-intervention in Spanish as well as associations with the non-target language, English.
Method
Participants were 12 Spanish-English bilingual children, aged 6–8 years, with and without Developmental Language Disorder. Children completed the intervention in pairs (one child with DLD and a typically developing peer) for 70-minute sessions, 3 days a week, for four weeks. Intervention targeted 32 words (16 cognates, 16 non-cognates) using four storybooks (8 words/book) and interactive activities that highlighted similarities across languages. Pre- and post-intervention measures in Spanish and English included tasks of word definition and cognate facilitation.
Results
As a group, children showed improvement in definition quality and cognate naming in Spanish. There was a positive correlation between definition quality and cognate naming for the typically developing children, but not for the children with DLD. All children showed positive cross-language correlations on post-intervention measures.
Conclusions
Bilingual children, with and without DLD, have the capacity to improve in their awareness and use of cognates. Explicit teaching of cognates can be an effective tool for building vocabulary skills. Children with DLD may need additional time and support to apply their knowledge of cognates to vocabulary learning.}

abstract = {Public awareness of language impairment in childhood (Developmental Language Disorder (DLD)) has been identified as an important determiner of research and clinical service delivery, yet studies directly assessing public awareness are lacking. This study surveyed awareness across 18 countries of Europe.
Method
A questionnaire developed by an international team asked whether respondents had heard of language impairment affecting children, what they thought its manifestations and causes were and where they had heard of it. Respondents were also asked whether they had heard of autism, dyslexia, ADD/ADHD and speech disorder. The questionnaire was administered to members of the public in 18 European countries. A total of 1519 responses were obtained, spanning 6 age groups, 4 educational level groups and 3 income level groups.
Results
Across all but one country, significantly fewer people had heard of language impairment than any of the other disorders (or 60 % compared to over 90 % for autism). Awareness tended to be lowest in Eastern Europe and greatest in North-Western Europe, and was influenced by education level, age and income level. People in countries with overall low and overall high awareness differed in their views on manifestations and causes. People had heard of language impairment and autism the same way - most frequently through the media, including Internet, and less frequently through their child’s school or a medical professional.
Discussion
The study confirms that awareness of language impairment and knowledge of the breadth of its manifestations are low. It also suggests opportunities for how to increase awareness, including greater media coverage of language impairment and more efficient use of venues such as schools and healthcare. Ways in which cultural and linguistic differences may influence public awareness efforts are discussed, including the translatability of clinical labels and scientific terms. These may impact the acceptance of a common term and definition across all countries. As awareness campaigns are gaining momentum, the findings of this study can serve as a baseline against which to compare future findings.}

abstract = {Background
Parents and providers are sometimes concerned that exposure to two languages will impair language acquisition in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other developmental disorders (DD). However, research to date suggests that language milestones and abilities are unaffected by this exposure. The current study explored language abilities in toddlers with ASD or DD exposed to one versus multiple languages, prior to intervention. To our knowledge, this is the largest investigation of language learning in bilingual-exposed (BE) children with ASD.
Methods
Participants were 388 children evaluated as part of a larger study on the early detection of ASD. Parents were asked to list all languages that primary caretakers use to communicate with their child. One hundred six BE children (57 ASD, 49 DD) were compared to 282 monolingual-exposed (ME) children (176 ASD, 106 DD). The Mullen Scales of Early Learning assessed nonverbal and verbal abilities. Multiple regression was used to evaluate the relationship of BE to language abilities, beyond the influence of nonverbal cognitive abilities, diagnosis, and socioeconomic status.
Results
Results showed greater language impairment in ASD than DD, but no main effect for language exposure group nor any interaction of language group by diagnosis. Results remained consistent after controlling for socioeconomic status.
Conclusion
This study suggests that bilingual caregivers can communicate with their children in both languages without adverse effects on their children’s language functioning.}

Children described ten objects arranged in a picture, being some of them ambiguous. Verbal exchanges were transcribed and coded in CHAT format. Results showed that children with SLI produced fewer initial and final correct messages than their age-matched controls and adults used the same type of communicative regulations with both groups. Furthermore, morphosyntactic level assessed at age 7 did not predict the number of correct messages in the referential communication task one year later. We believe that the key difficulty in this task for children with SLI might not be exclusively linguistic and involves the analysis of the communicative context, the ability to extract the relevant information and to consider the adults’ perspectives in order to allow them do the task correctly.
Resumen
El objetivo del presente trabajo fue analizar la calidad de los mensajes producidos por niños bilingües con Trastorno Específico del Lenguaje (TEL), hablantes de catalán y español, en una tarea de comunicación referencial, en comparación con niños controles de la misma edad a los 8 años de edad. La tarea de los niños consistía en describir la colocación de diversos objetos de un dibujo, algunos de ellos ambiguos, a un adulto que no veía la imagen. Los intercambios verbales fueron transcritos y codificados en formato CHAT. Los resultados mostraron que los niños con TEL producían menos mensajes correctos iniciales y finales que sus controles de edad. Los adultos utilizaron el mismo tipo y cantidad de mensajes para regular la comunicación con ambos grupos. Por otra parte, el nivel morfosintáctico a la edad de 7 años no predijo el número correcto de los mensajes en la tarea de comunicación referencial un año después. Creemos que la principal dificultad en esta tarea para los niños con TEL no es exclusivamente lingüística, e implica el análisis del contexto comunicativo, la capacidad de extraer la información relevante y considerar la perspectiva del adulto con el fin de hacer la tarea correctamente.}

abstract = {Background
Children’s executive functioning (EF) is often negatively associated with a developmental language disorder (DLD) and positively related to bilingualism. However, both regarding children with DLD and bilingual children, findings are mixed and few studies have investigated the combination of DLD and bilingualism in relation to EF.
Aims
This study investigated the effects of DLD and bilingualism on children’s EF development.
Methods
Monolingual and bilingual children with DLD and typical development (TD; N = 32 in each group) were tested three times with yearly intervals (MAGE = 71 months at time 1). Verbal and visuospatial working memory, selective attention, and inhibition were assessed.
Results
Monolinguals and bilinguals with DLD had weak working memory and inhibition skills at each time point compared to TD peers, which could partly be explained by verbal short-term memory limitations. Positive effects of bilingualism emerged when controlling for Dutch vocabulary and morphology skills, and were most pronounced at time 1.
Conclusions
Monolinguals and bilinguals with DLD have similar and persistent EF deficits, which are partly secondary to verbal short-term memory weaknesses. Bilinguals performed better on EF than monolinguals when Dutch language knowledge was controlled for. This effect was found regardless of DLD and was most prominent at age 5–6 years.}

Adult dyslexia affects about 4% of the population. However, studies on the neurobiological basis of dyslexia in adulthood are scarce compared to paediatric studies.
Aim
This review investigates the neurobiological basis of dyslexia in adulthood.
Development
Using PsycINFO, a database of psychology abstracts, we identified 11 studies on genetics, 9 neurostructural studies, 13 neurofunctional studies and 24 neurophysiological studies. Results from the review show that dyslexia is highly heritable and displays polygenic transmission. Likewise, adult neuroimaging studies found structural, functional, and physiological changes in the parieto-occipital and occipito-temporal regions, and in the inferior frontal gyrus, in adults with dyslexia.
Conclusion
According to different studies, aetiology in cases of adult dyslexia is complex. We stress the need for neurobiological studies of dyslexia in languages with transparent spelling systems.
Resumen
Introducción
La dislexia en la edad adulta afecta a alrededor del 4% de la población. Sin embargo, la investigación acerca de los sustratos neurobiológicos de la dislexia en población adulta es relativamente escasa en comparación con la realizada en niños.
Objetivo
El presente estudio ofrece una revisión de las bases neurobiológicas de la dislexia en población adulta.
Desarrollo
A partir de una búsqueda bibliográfica en la base de datos del Psychological Abstracts: PsycINFO, se identificaron 11 trabajos sobre las bases genéticas, 9 estudios que emplearon técnicas de neuroimagen estructural, 13 artículos que emplearon técnicas neurofuncionales, y 24, neurofisiológicas. Los resultados de la revisión señalan la gran heredabilidad de la dislexia, así como la implicación de diferentes genes. Asimismo, los estudios de neuroimagen muestran diferencias estructurales, funcionales y fisiológicas en regiones temporoparietales y occipitotemporales, y en el giro frontal inferior en los adultos con dislexia.
Conclusión
Las investigaciones muestran la gran complejidad etiológica de la dislexia en población adulta. Se destaca la necesidad de realizar estudios neurobiológicos en diferentes lenguas transparentes.}

However, the reproducibility, task-dependency, and presence of these brain anomalies in childhood rather than adulthood remain debated. We probed the large-scale organization of ventral visual and spoken language areas in dyslexic children using minimal target-detection tasks that were performed equally well by all groups. In 23 normal and 23 dyslexic 10-year-old children from two different socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds, we compared fMRI activity to visually presented houses, faces, and written strings, and to spoken sentences in the native or in a foreign language. Our results confirm a disorganization of both ventral visual and spoken language areas in dyslexic children. Visually, dyslexic children showed a normal lateral-to-medial mosaic of preferences, as well as normal responses to houses and checkerboards, but a reduced activation to words in the visual word form area (VWFA) and to faces in the right fusiform face area (FFA). Auditorily, dyslexic children exhibited reduced responses to speech in posterior temporal cortex, left insula and supplementary motor area, as well as reduced responses to maternal language in subparts of the planum temporale, left basal language area and VWFA. By correlating these two findings, we identify spoken-language predictors of VWFA activation to written words, which differ for dyslexic and normal readers. Similarities in fMRI deficits in both SES groups emphasize the existence of a core set of brain activation anomalies in dyslexia, regardless of culture, language and SES, without however resolving whether these anomalies are a cause or a consequence of impaired reading.}

Our data showed larger amplitudes of negative-going waveforms in non-dyslexic children than dyslexic children over occipital/occipitotemporal electrodes at about 220ms after stimulus onset. This electrophysiological response has previously been identified in adult readers and labeled as the N170 component. Notably, as reflected by the topographic maps children irrespective of group processed the linguistic stimuli bilaterally and we did not observe any differences in ERP parameters in words and pseudowords within groups. Contrarily, behavioral responses indicate that words were more quickly recognized than pseudowords irrespective of group. By applying post-hoc ROI analyses based on a source estimation approach (sLORETA) we observed that non-dyslexic participants, when compared to dyslexic children, demonstrated significantly stronger current density over the left hemispheric inferior temporal lobe when processing pseudowords. We concluded that impaired reading is reflected by the decreased amplitude of the early lexical component N170. The lack of a left hemispheric processing preference in both groups and similar activation for words and pseudowords can be considered a lack of reading experience and less established reading system in children. Our results indicate that dyslexic children commit fewer specialized neuronal circuits for processing print and confirm the reasoning that acquiring reading skills requires cortical reorganization over occipitotemporal regions.}

Although researchers have explored parental perspectives on childhood speech and language disorders, this work has mostly been conducted in English-speaking countries. Little is known about parental experiences across countries. Participation in the COST Action IS1406 ‘Enhancing children’s oral language skills across Europe and beyond’ provided an opportunity to conduct cross-cultural qualitative interviews. The aims were to explore how parents construe inclusion and/or exclusion of their child and how parents involve themselves in order to facilitate inclusion.
Method
Parents from nine countries and with a child who had received services for speech-language disorder participated in semi-structured qualitative interviews. We used thematic analysis to analyze the data.
Results
Two overarching themes were identified: ‘Language disabilities led to social exclusion’ and ‘Promoting pathways to social inclusion’. Two subthemes were identified Interpersonal relationships are important and Deliberate proactiveness as stepping stones for social inclusion.
Conclusions
Across countries, parents report that their children’s hidden disability causes misunderstandings that can lead to social exclusion and that they are important advocates for their children. It is important that the voices and experiences of parents of children with developmental disabilities are understood and acknowledged. Parents’ recommendations about how to support social inclusion need to be addressed at all levels of society.}

Twin and family studies have indicated a genetic component, while genome-wide studies have implicated a number of susceptibility genes, most of which have direct or indirect roles in neuronal migration. Reelin (RELN) has important biological functions facilitating migration of neurons. Polymorphisms in RELN have been implicated in related disorders like autism and schizophrenia but have not been examined in dyslexia. We hypothesized that not only RELN, but its interactors in the neuronal migration pathway may play roles in the etiology of dyslexia. Twenty two functional variants across six RELN signalling genes (RELN, VLDLR, APOER2, DAB1, LIS1 and NDEL1) and two dyslexia candidate genes (DCDC2 and ROBO1) were analyzed for association in twenty six nuclear and three extended families with individuals affected with dyslexia. Univariate association analysis was suggestive of association (puncorrected = 0.01) with rs362746 in RELN which however did not withstand Bonferroni corrections (pcorrected = 0.21). Multimarker tests indicated significant association (p = 0.037), based on which we tested for haplotype associations. Although there were no significant haplotypic associations, we found that a three marker unit with rs3808039 and rs2072403 flanking and independently in linkage disequilibrium with rs362746 was significantly overtransmitted (risk allelic combination – TAT) to dyslexia affected individuals in the sample (p = 0.002).

Using diffusion MRI in 36 pre-readers with a family risk for dyslexia (FRD+) and 35 well matched pre-readers without a family risk (FRD−), our results show that phonological predictors of reading are sustained bilaterally by both ventral and dorsal tracts. This suggests that a dorsal and left-hemispheric specialisation for phonological aspects of reading, as observed in adults, is presumably gradually formed throughout reading development. Second, our results indicate that FRD+ pre-readers display mainly white matter differences in left ventral tracts. This suggests that atypical white matter organisation previously found in dyslexic adults may be causal rather than resulting from a lifetime of reading difficulties, and that the location of such a deficit may vary throughout development. While this study forms an important starting point, longitudinal follow-up of these children will allow further investigation of the dynamics between emerging literacy development and white matter connections.}

However, most have focused on phonological awareness as a risk factor for dyslexia, although there is considerable diversity in the underlying causes of this reading difficulty. Specifically, the relationship between phonology, derivational morphology, and dyslexia in the Finnish language remains unclear. In the present study, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the brain responses to correctly and incorrectly derived Finnish nouns in 34 first grade Finnish children (21 typically developing and 13 with familial risk for dyslexia). In addition, we compared longitudinally the morphological information processing of 27 children (16 typically developing and 11 at-risk for dyslexia) first at pre-school age and then at first grade age. The task consisted of 108 pairs of sentences, including a verb and its root with the derivational suffix/-jA/. Correctly and incorrectly derived forms were presented both as real words and pseudowords. The incorrectly derived nouns contained a morpho-phonological violation in the last vowel of the noun before the derivational suffix. The brain activation of the typically developing children in response to morphological information processing showed sensitivity to the morphologically correct vs. incorrect contrast only in the cases of the real words. Children at-risk for dyslexia showed sensitivity to the morphological information processing both for real words and pseudowords. However, no significant differences between the groups emerged either for the correct vs. incorrect morphological contrast or for the correctly and incorrectly derived forms separately. Interestingly, in our previous study, cluster-based permutation tests showed significant developmental behavioral and brain differences between the children at pre-school age and at first-grade age in the morphological information processing of real words and pseudowords. Our results indicate the important role of derivational morphology in the early phases of learning to read.}

The L2 children’s performance was compared to L2 adults from Demirci (2001) and children with SLI from van der Lely and Stollwerck (1997). The L2 children’s performance in the comprehension of reflexives was almost identical to their age-matched controls, and differed from L2 adults and children with SLI. In the comprehension of pronouns, L2 children showed an asymmetry between referential and quantificational NPs, a pattern attested in younger L1 children and children with SLI. Our study provides evidence that the development of comprehension of reflexives and pronouns in these children resembles monolingual L1 acquisition and not adult L2 acquisition or acquisition of children with SLI.}

The narrative performance in Dutch as measured by mean length of utterance and number of ungrammatical sentences was found to be generally worse for children learning Dutch as a second language, for children suffering from SLI, and for younger children. Furthermore, omission of an agreement marker in the third person singular verb form can be seen as a clinical marker of SLI in both first and second language learners. Bilingual children with SLI were found to be in an additionally disadvantaged position as far as their use of L2 verb morphology.}

abstract = {Objective
Developmental dyslexia is a reading disorder that features difficulties in perceiving and tracking rhythmic regularities in auditory streams, such as speech and music. Studies on typical healthy participants have shown that power fluctuations of neural oscillations in beta band (15–25 Hz) reflect an essential mechanism for tracking rhythm or entrainment and relate to predictive timing and attentional processes. Here we investigated whether adults with dyslexia have atypical beta power fluctuation.
Methods
The electroencephalographic activities of individuals with dyslexia (n = 13) and typical control participants (n = 13) were measured while they passively listened to an isochronous tone sequence (2 Hz presentation rate). The time–frequency neural activities generated from auditory cortices were analyzed.
Results
The phase of beta power fluctuation at the 2 Hz stimulus presentation rate differed and appeared opposite between individuals with dyslexia and controls.
Conclusions
Atypical beta power fluctuation might reflect deficits in perceiving and tracking auditory rhythm in dyslexia.
Significance
These findings extend our understanding of atypical neural activities for tracking rhythm in dyslexia and could inspire novel methods to objectively measure the benefits of training, and predict potential benefit of auditory rhythmic rehabilitation programs on an individual basis.}

abstract = {Introduction
The finding of biological markers of specific language impairment would facilitate their detection and early intervention. In this sense, the 2D:4D finger ratio is considered an indirect indicator of prenatal exposure to testosterone. Previous studies have related it to linguistic competence and aggressive behaviour, and could be a candidate for a biological marker of language impairment. The aim was to compare the value of the 2D:4D ratio in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) with those of children with typical language development, as well as to establish to what extent this biological index correlates with the behaviour (linguistic, cognitive, social,...) in both groups.
Subjects and methods
2D:4D ratio, language, cognition and social behaviour were compared in a group of children with SLI (n=15), with a group of children without language difficulties (n=16) of the same age (between 5 and 8 years), gender (male), and socio-cultural level.
Results
Children with SLI showed significantly higher values of 2D:4D ratio of the right hand, and a negative correlation between this ratio and their linguistic competence. Although the children with SLI showed impaired adaptive abilities, but not more aggressive behaviour, these measurements did not correlate with the 2D:4D index. Nevertheless, social behaviour correlated with language and cognition competence.
Conclusions
A higher value of the biological 2D:4D ration (lower intrauterine exposure to testosterone) seems to be associated with language difficulties in boys with SLI, but not with their behavioural difficulties. Their behavioural difficulties seem to be a consequence of their linguistic difficulties and their level of cognition.
Resumen
Introducción
Encontrar marcadores biológicos del trastorno específico del lenguaje facilitaría su detección e intervención precoz. En este sentido, el índice digital D2:D4 es considerado un indicador indirecto de la exposición prenatal a la testosterona, y estudios previos lo han relacionado con la competencia lingüística y la conducta agresiva, por lo que podría ser un candidato a marcador biológico. El objetivo es comparar el valour de este índice digital en niños con trastorno específico del lenguaje (TEL) frente a sujetos con desarrollo típico del lenguaje, estableciendo en qué medida correlacionan los valores del índice biológico con la conducta (lingüística, cognitiva, social…) de dichos sujetos.
Sujetos y métodos
Se comparó el índice D2:D4, el lenguaje, la cognición y la conducta social en un grupo de niños con TEL (n=15) con un grupo de niños sin dificultades del lenguaje (n=16) de la misma la misma edad (entre 5–8 años), sexo (masculino) y nivel sociocultural.
Resultados
Los niños con TEL mostraron valores significativamente más altos en el índice D2:D4 de la mano derecha, y una correlación negativa entre el índice D2:D4 de la mano derecha y la competencia lingüística. Aunque los niños con TEL mostraron peores habilidades adaptativas y conductas internalizantes, aunque no mayor agresividad, estas medidas no se correlacionaron con el índice D2:D4, y sí con los valores de lenguaje y de cognición.
Conclusiones
Un valour más alto del índice biológico D2:D4 (menor exposición intrauterina a la testosterona) parece estar asociado con las dificultades del lenguaje de los niños con TEL, pero no con sus dificultades conductuales. Las dificultades conductuales de estos niños parecen ser consecuencia de sus dificultades lingüísticas y de su nivel de cognición.}

Specifically, we aimed at disentangling two hypotheses. If phonological processing drives novel word learning and if phonological processing is impaired in students with dyslexia, they should perform lower than skilled readers not only in the phonological categorization tasks but also in the matching and semantic tasks. By contrast, if students with dyslexia use semantic knowledge to compensate for their phonological deficits, should be able to reach the same level of performance and show similar enhancements of the N200 and N400 components than skilled readers in the matching and semantic tasks. Results at both behavioral and electrophysiological levels showed that the phonological deficits evidenced in the phonological tasks did not impede students with dyslexia to learn the meaning of novel words, possibly because they mobilized more frontal resources than skilled readers. These results are discussed within a general framework of semantic compensation in adults with dyslexia.}

The aim of this study was to compare narrative abilities in children with specific language impairment (SLI) who are monolingual and those who are dual language learners.
Method
The participants were 26 children with SLI, 14 monolingual English speakers and 12 dual language learners. The dual language learners were English dominant and spoke a variety of other languages in the home. The two SLI groups were compared using standardized tests and measures from two narrative samples.
Results
Compared to the monolingual children, the dual language learners achieved lower scores on standardized tests of morphosyntax but not on measures of language form derived from the narrative samples. Both groups achieved below average scores on productivity, narrative structure, literate language, and language form measures from the narrative samples.
Conclusion
The data suggest that narrative samples can be a sensitive way to assess the language skills of dual language learners with specific language impairment. Furthermore, the findings are consistent with the position that English standardized tests may be a biased assessment measure when used with dual language learners, particularly for the assessment of expressive morphosyntactic skills. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to (1) describe the narrative abilities of typically developing dual language learners; (2) describe similarities between the narrative abilities of children with SLI who are monolingual and dual language learners; (3) identify ways to analyses narratives at a variety of levels.}

Fifty monolingual Spanish-speaking children between 4; 0 and 6; 11 years were assigned to one of two groups: 25 children with SLI and 25 TLD age-matched peers. A scripted picture book was read to each child and the child was subsequently asked to retell the story using pictures. Story retells were analyzed for MLU, %UGS, TNW, and NDW. Results showed significant differences between groups on all four measures. Children with SLI showed significantly lower MLU, TNW and NDW, and significantly higher%UGS when compared with age-matched peers with TLD.

The results show that text messages in the two groups were of equal length, but the children with TD used more textisms (alternative ways of spelling words) than the children with SLI. Both groups omitted words in their texting messages with similar frequencies, but while the SLI group omitted words equally frequently in texting messages and spoken language messages, omissions in the TD group were more specific to texting. This suggests that TD children omit words in texting because it is a register-specific convention, whereas children with SLI omit words regardless of the register. Socio-emotional reasons to use texting were found to be relatively important for children with SLI. This may be related to their higher level of shyness.}

: The narrative abilities of bilinguals with TD and with DLD/SLI in their English L2 were examined in order to 1) identify the narrative components that differentiate these two groups and 2) determine the role of age and input factors in predicting L2 narrative abilities in each group.
Method
: Participants were 24 English L2 children with DLD and 63 English L2 children with TD, matched on age (mean = 5; 8) and length of exposure to the L2 (mean = 24 months). Narrative samples were elicited using a story generation task and a parent questionnaire provided age and input variables.
Results
: Bilinguals with DLD had significantly lower scores for story grammar than their TD peers, but showed similar scores for narrative microstructure components. Length of L2 exposure in school and richness of the L2 environment predicted better narrative abilities for the group with TD but not with DLD. Older age predicted better narrative abilities for the group with DLD but not with TD. Quantity of L2 input/output at home did not predict story grammar or microstructure abilities in either group.
Conclusion
: Story grammar might differentiate between children with TD and DLD better than microstructure among bilinguals with less exposure to the L2 and when a story generation task is used. Bilinguals with TD make more efficient use of L2 input than bilinguals with DLD.}

In addition, attention factors have a greater influence on auditory processing of verbal than nonverbal stimuli for children with LD, and children with LD exhibit a general processing bias to the same hemisphere unlike control children. Furthermore, employing directed attention conditions in DL experiments has played an important role in explaining learning disabled children’s performance on DL tasks. We conclude that auditory perceptual asymmetries as assessed by DL with children who experience LD are the result of the interaction of hemispheric capability and attention factors.}

abstract = {Typical development of tense and aspect has been extensively studied across various languages. However, relevant research on language disorders has been generally restricted on tense morphology rather than aspect resulting in inconsistent findings. Specifically, some studies imply that acquisition of aspect in Specific Language Impairment (SLI) does not differentiate from typical development, whereas others report a deviant performance. These inconsistencies could be related to the limited number of languages tested or even to the different methodologies used across the studies. The present study examines the comprehension and production of grammatical aspect in Greek-speaking children with SLI. Thirty-six children participated in a combined comprehension – production task; twelve children with SLI (mean age: 6;3), twelve age-matched typically developing children (mean age: 6;3) and twelve language-matched typically developing children (mean age: 4;4). The originality of the study mainly lies on its methodology, since the task distributed to the children consisted of video stimuli instead of pictures, which are usually used in similar experimental designs. According to the findings, Greek-speaking children with SLI exhibited the same asymmetrical pattern reported for early stages of typical development. That is, perfective aspect is fully acquired, while interpretation and use of imperfective aspect seems to be problematic. Therefore, development of aspect in Greek SLI appears rather delayed than severely impaired.}

The DLL in the randomized Preparing Pequeños intervention classrooms were compared to control DLL with comparable Spanish language delays and in which the school district's core curriculum was being implemented.

In total, 51 control and 52 intervention classrooms participated; pre-test measures were completed with 829 children, with 777 of these children also completing post-test measures (7% attrition). Results showed that intervention teachers and paraprofessionals, as compared to control, showed greater increases in most of the targeted areas of cognitive instruction (d range = 0.60–2.38) and in the use of small groups (d range = 3.32–4.46), progress monitoring (d = 0.17) to inform instruction, and team teaching (d = 1.94). Intervention children, as compared to control, showed significantly greater gains in Spanish oral language, print knowledge, phonological awareness, and phonics with small to large effect sizes (d range = 0.14–0.52). Also, potentially as a result of greater attention to children's individual needs and support for managing their behavior, intervention children, as compared to control, showed greater decreases in school avoidance, anger, and aggression with small effect sizes (d range = −0.22 to −0.29). Results are discussed in relation to the need for greater attention in teachers' training in effective approaches for small-group instruction.}

DLLs are disproportionately more likely to live in families of low socioeconomic status (SES), which places many of them at risk for poor dual-language outcomes. To date, most studies on SES and dual language development have relied on static measures of vocabulary and syntactic skills, without examining the language learning processes – children’s ability to acquire new language items. The current study used a newly developed language measure, the Quick Interactive Language Screener: English and Spanish (QUILS:ES), to assess 3- through 5-year-old Spanish-English DLLs’ language learning processes. We also examined the association between SES (as measured by primary caregivers’ education) and language learning processes, and further explored mechanisms underlying the association. DLLs from higher-SES families showed better language learning skills than those from lower-SES families. The size of the gap did not vary by child age. Home literacy environment (i.e., access to books, book-reading frequency) and children’s existing knowledge (i.e., vocabulary and syntactic knowledge) mediated the SES effect. Together, these findings highlight the need to better prepare DLLs from low-SES families for learning from a dual-language environment. Supporting DLLs’ language environment and knowledge through learning materials and language and literacy activities in both languages is crucial for ameliorating the SES gap in language learning processes.}

abstract = {Purpose
This paper examines whether bilingual children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) showed limited comprehension of Direct Object (DO) pronoun sentences and/or morphosyntactic priming compared to children with Typical Language Development (TLD) and adults. We analyzed the relation of these morphosyntactic processes to other psycholinguistic abilities, according to the MUC (Memory-Unification-Control) model.
Method
Ten bilingual native Spanish-speaking children with SLI (8;3–10;6) and 10 age-matched children with TLD (7;6–10;10) received a psycholinguistic evaluation in Spanish-English. The 20 children and 10 adults (19–34) performed an on-line cross-modal pronoun task. They listened to long distance animate DO pronoun sentences, and filler sentences without any pronoun. At the offset of the pronoun in each pronoun sentence, a picture of an animal for the antecedent (match condition), another animal for the second noun (mismatch), or an unrelated object (neutral) was displayed on the screen. In the filler sentences, a picture of an object that depicted the first noun, appeared at the offset of another later noun. Participants decided whether that pictured item was “alive”/“not alive” by pressing two keys on the computer keyboard. Immediately after, they answered an oral comprehension question about the DO pronoun sentence.
Results
Bilingual children with SLI showed significantly poorer comprehension of DO pronoun sentences than bilingual children with TLD. Pronoun sentence understanding in the overall children correlated significantly with oral sentence completion, expressive vocabulary abilities, auditory story comprehension, and the non-word repetition task, all in Spanish. Adults showed significantly the highest pronoun sentence comprehension, and the fastest animacy decisions across conditions; it was the only group showing a significant behavioral morphosyntactic priming effect. All groups exhibited high accuracy in the animacy decisions across conditions, although children with SLI showed lower accuracy and more variability.
Conclusion
Bilingual Spanish-English children with SLI showed significant limitations in understanding long distance animate DO pronoun sentences. The deficits were also related to weak morphosyntactic, lexical, and/or phonological representations stored in their memory. These processes may be harder to combine in the unification process, and also to control for answering the comprehension questions. Clinical and educational implications are discussed.}

Four distinct groups were identified from the Kindergarten cohort of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) (1) English-only+typical speech and language (n=2012); (2) multilingual+typical speech and language (n=476); (3) English-only+speech and language concern (n=643); and (4) multilingual+speech and language concern (n=109). Two analytic approaches were used to compare these groups. First, a matched case-control design was used to randomly match multilingual children with speech and language concern (group 4, n=109) to children in groups 1–3 on gender, age, and family socio-economic position in a cross-sectional comparison of vocabulary, school readiness, and behavioral adjustment. Next, analyses were applied to the whole sample to determine longitudinal effects of group membership on teachers' ratings of literacy, numeracy, and behavioral adjustment at ages 6–7 and 8–9 years. At 4–5 years, multilingual children with speech and language concern did equally well or better than English-only children (with or without speech and language concern) on school readiness tests but performed more poorly on measures of English vocabulary and behavior. At ages 6–7 and 8–9, the early gap between English-only and multilingual children had closed. Multilingualism was not found to contribute to differences in literacy and numeracy outcomes at school; instead, outcomes were more related to concerns about children’s speech and language in early childhood. There were no group differences for socio-emotional outcomes. Early evidence for the combined risks of multilingualism plus speech and language concern was not upheld into the school years.}

It is self-evident then that learning to read requires formation of cross-sensory associations to the point that deeply encoded multisensory representations are attained. While the majority of individuals manage this task to a high degree of expertise, some struggle to attain even rudimentary capabilities. Why do dyslexic individuals, who learn well in myriad other domains, fail at this particular task? Here, we examine the literature as it pertains to multisensory processing in dyslexia. We find substantial support for multisensory deficits in dyslexia, and make the case that to fully understand its neurological basis, it will be necessary to thoroughly probe the integrity of auditory–visual integration mechanisms.}

The aim of this systematic review is to examine the early interactions between bilingualism and stuttering to synthesize knowledge that could inform diagnosis and treatment for bilingual children who stutter.
Method
Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, ERIC Ebsco, and Google Scholar were searched with no limits placed on the year of publication. Search terms consisted of: (“stuttering” [MeSH] OR “stutter”) AND (“child” [MeSH] OR “children”) AND (“multilingualism” [MeSH] OR “bilingualism”). Inclusion criteria were children who stutter, bilinguals who stutter, empirical research articles, and published in peer review journals. Exclusion criteria were studies that reported on only adults, only monolinguals, or were not published in English.
Results
A total of 50 articles met the criteria. There was convergence with monolingual studies reporting sexually dimorphic and familial trends in the prevalence of stuttering and rates of recovery. Findings surrounding language proficiency, cross-linguistic stuttering severity, and development were ambivalent. Results point to the difficulty in identifying stuttering in bilingual children, and the need for culturally competent research and interpretations.
Conclusion
Current findings offer a fragmented view of bilingual development and echoes a recurring theme, i.e., the current understanding of bilingualism and stuttering is limited and more research is warranted.}

Few publications deal with non-neurogenic language disorders (NNLDs), distinct from psychogenic speech disorders such as psychogenic dysphonia or stuttering. NNLDs are alterations in language owing to psychosomatic preoccupations, conversion disorder, psychiatric disorders, or other psychological reasons.
Objective
To identify and classify the range of NNLDs and their characteristics.
Methods
This review summarizes the literature on disturbances in language, broadly defined as the use of symbols for communication, which may have a psychogenic or psychiatric etiology.
Results
The literature suggests a classification for NNLDs that includes psychogenic aphasia with dysgrammatism; psychogenic “lalias” including oxylalia and agitolalia, palilalia and echolalia, xenolalia, glossolalia, and coprolalia; psychologically-mediated word usage; psychotic language; and psychogenic forms of the foreign accent syndrome.
Conclusions
Clinicians and researchers have insufficiently emphasized the presence of NNLDs, their characteristics, and their identification. Yet, these disorders may be the first or predominant manifestation of a psychologically-mediated illness. There are 2 steps to recognition. The first is to know how to distinguish NNLDs from the manifestations of neurogenic language impairments after a neurological evaluation. The second step is awareness of specific associated and examination features that suggest the presence of a NNLD.}

abstract = {Background
The relationship between parental input and child language development has had a complex history. It has become clear that indirect parent training for the parents of children with delayed language development is an important feature of interventions offered by speech and language therapists in the anglophone countries. Yet we know less about how this type of approach is realised in other countries.
Methods
In this paper we report the results of a survey of practice undertaken as part of the work of COST Action IS1406, a European Union (EU) funded research network. The focus of this paper is specifically on parent-related questions and responses referring to children under the age of twelve. The survey was devised by members of the Action and circulated electronically during the summer of 2017. In all, 4024 practitioners responded from 60 countries, the majority of whom came from EU member countries.
Findings
Respondents to the survey indicated that indirect therapy is commonly carried out via the parent in the early years and via teachers later. A range of professional groups, in addition to speech and language therapists, is likely to adopt this approach; including teachers, pedagogues and psychologists. A variety of interventions is reported, some of which have a reasonable evidence-base underpinning them. It is interesting to see the widespread involvement of fathers and other family members in interventions. Finally, the fact that practitioner characteristics (age, experience, location of practice etc.) are not related to the use of indirect techniques points to the universal recognition of the value of these approaches.
Conclusions
Despite the very different traditions in the practice of intervention across countries, there is clearly a widespread recognition of the importance of indirect approaches to intervention and specifically those focusing on parents. The mixture of family members being involved in interventions is a very promising indication of the role sharing commonly associated with the contemporary family. Yet the number of specific intervention approaches identified is relatively small given the number of respondents. There is a need for a better understanding of what exactly practitioners are doing when they involve parents in intervention or carry out parent-child interaction interventions and how well these interventions work in routine practice. This also has implications for the application of evidence-based practice and the precise nature of the interventions concerned (advice to parents, video interaction training etc.).}

Here, we adopted a whole brain hodological approach and investigated relationships between structural white matter connectivity and reading skills and phonological processing in a cross-sectional study of 44 adults using individual local connectome matrix from diffusion MRI data. Moreover, we performed quantitative anisotropy aided differential tractography to uncover structural white matter anomalies in dyslexia (23 dyslexics and 21 matched controls) and their correlation to reading-related skills. The connectometry analyses indicated that reading skills and phonological processing were both associated with corpus callosum (tapetum), forceps major and minor, as well as cerebellum bilaterally. Furthermore, the left dorsal and right thalamic pathways were associated with phonological processing. Differential tractography analyses revealed structural white matter anomalies in dyslexics in the left ventral route and bilaterally in the dorsal route compared to the controls. Connectivity deficits were also observed in the corpus callosum, forceps major, vertical occipital fasciculus and corticostriatal and thalamic pathways. Altered structural connectivity in the observed differential tractography results correlated with poor reading skills and phonological processing. Using a hodological approach, the current study provides novel evidence for the extent of the reading-related connectome and its aberrations in dyslexia. The results conform current functional neuroanatomical models of reading and developmental dyslexia but provide novel network-level and tract-level evidence on structural connectivity anomalies in dyslexia, including the vertical occipital fasciculus.}

In a word extension task, we used several types of object entities (solid, animate, nonsolid, functional, and spatial relations) for which children needed to attend to diverse properties (shape, texture, role, or spatial relation) to decide category membership. We compared 15 school-aged children with DLD with typically developing (TD) children matched on either age or vocabulary. Our results indicate that children with DLD were impaired in extending novel words for nonsolid substances and relational objects, whereas age-matched TD children performed well for all object classes. Similar to children with DLD, TD children matched on language had difficulty in extending spatial relation categories. We also show that children with DLD needed more learning exemplars and relied more on shape-based information than TD children, especially for spatial configuration objects. Overall, our findings suggest that children are able to learn regularities between object properties and category organization and to focus on diverse features according to the object presented when extending novel nouns. They also provide clear evidence linking DLD to deficits in novel name generalization and word learning.}

Previous work has identified several theoretical possibilities for the underlying locus of impairment in surface dyslexia. In this study, we systematically investigated whether children with surface dyslexia showed different patterns of reading performance that could be traced back to different underlying levels of impairment. To do this, we tested 12 English readers, replicating previous work in Hebrew (Gvion & Friedmann, 2013; 2016; Friedmann & Lukov, 2008; Friedmann & Gvion, 2016). In our sample, we found that poor irregular word reading was associated with deficits at the level of the orthographic input lexicon and with impaired access to meaning and spoken word forms after processing written words in the orthographic input lexicon. There were also children whose surface dyslexia seemed to be caused by impairments of the phonological output lexicon. We suggest that further evidence is required to unequivocally support a fourth pattern where the link between orthography and meaning is intact while the link between orthography and spoken word forms is not functioning. All patterns found were consistent with dual route theory while possible patterns of results, which would be inconsistent with dual route theory, were not detected.}

abstract = {Language difficulties of children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) have been associated with multiple underlying factors and are still poorly understood. One way of investigating the mechanisms of DLD language problems is to compare language-related brain activation patterns of children with DLD to those of a population with similar language difficulties and a uniform etiology. Children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) constitute such a population. Here, we conducted an fMRI study, in which children (6-10yo) with DLD and 22q11DS listened to speech alternated with reversed speech. We compared language laterality and language-related brain activation levels with those of typically developing (TD) children who performed the same task. The data revealed no significant differences between groups in language lateralization, but task-related activation levels were lower in children with language impairment than in TD children in several nodes of the language network. We conclude that language impairment in children with DLD and in children with 22q11DS may involve (partially) overlapping cortical areas.}

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that reading development when learning alphabetic languages is related to the underlying cognitive ability to maintain the serial order of information in short-term memory (STM). However, it remains unclear at which time point in reading development serial order STM is most important. Here, we established a crucial link between the reading development of primary school children and their serial order STM performance for both verbal and nonverbal materials. In a large cohort study of 113 Italian-speaking elementary school children in Grades 1–4, we investigated this relationship by implementing a novel double-probe design. In Experiment 1, we found that serial order STM performance was related to children’s reading abilities, especially in Grades 2 and 3, corresponding to the training phase of grapheme–phoneme decoding skills. In Experiment 2, we assessed children with developmental dyslexia (DD) and found that their serial order STM performance was significantly lower than that of chronological age-matched controls (CA). It also differed from that of reading age-matched controls when accounting for individual reading performance. Furthermore, the CA group displayed an implicit serial order facilitation for item memory, whereas this implicit recruitment of serial order abilities was completely absent in children with DD. Our results suggest that the domain-general cognitive ability to maintain the serial order of information interacts with the development of reading competency, especially during a middle training phase of word reading, and this particular relationship is markedly impaired in children with DD.}

Children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) have a significant deficit in spoken language ability which affects their communication skills, education, mental health, employment and social inclusion.
Aim
The present study reports findings from a survey by EU network COST ACTION 1406 and aims to explore differences in service delivery and funding of SLT services for children with DLD across Europe and beyond.
Methods and procedures
The survey was completed by 5024 European professionals. COST countries were grouped into Nordic, Anglo-Saxon, Continental, Mediterranean, Central/Eastern and Non-European categories. The use of direct, indirect and mixed interventions, and their relationship to funding available (public, private or mixed) were considered for further analysis.
Outcomes and results
The results revealed that for direct therapy, there were more cases than expected receiving private funding. For indirect therapy, fewer than expected received private and more than expected public funding. For mixed therapy, fewer cases than expected received private funding.
Conclusions and implications
The results implies that other factors than evidence-based practices, practitioners experience, and patient preferences, drive choices in therapy. More research is needed to gain a better understanding of factors affecting the choice of therapy.}

We compared the performances of the two languages in spontaneous speech and in a wide set of linguistic subtests including translation tasks. Three of the patients had acquired Catalan and Spanish at the same time, while the rest were exposed to their second language (Spanish) between three and five years of age. Catalan was the most frequently used language for all the participants. Their performances in Catalan and Spanish were similar, except for the verbal fluency subtest (Spanish > Catalan). Their translation of words was better from Spanish to Catalan, whereas the translation of sentences was better from Catalan to Spanish. The analysis of spontaneous speech only showed that the patients produced more words and sentences in Catalan. According to the declarative/procedural model of language, these results suggest that the processing of the two languages is more similar than different. Nevertheless, regression to the first language may be more evident as the disease progresses. In our study, the differences observed between one language and the other may be influenced by the sociolinguistic environment of the patients.}

abstract = {Background
Augmentative signs may facilitate word learning in children with vocabulary difficulties, for example, children who are Deaf/Hard of Hearing (DHH) and children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Despite the fact that augmentative signs may aid second language learning in populations with a typical language development, empirical evidence in favor of this claim is lacking.
Aims
We aim to investigate whether augmentative signs facilitate word learning for DHH children, children with SLI, and typically developing (TD) children.
Methods and procedures
Whereas previous studies taught children new labels for familiar objects, the present study taught new labels for new objects. In our word learning experiment children were presented with pictures of imaginary creatures and pseudo words. Half of the words were accompanied by an augmentative pseudo sign. The children were tested for their receptive word knowledge.
Outcomes and results
The DHH children benefitted significantly from augmentative signs, but the children with SLI and TD age-matched peers did not score significantly different on words from either the sign or no-sign condition.
Conclusions and implications
These results suggest that using Sign-Supported speech in classrooms of bimodal bilingual DHH children may support their spoken language development. The difference between earlier research findings and the present results may be caused by a difference in methodology.}

Although cognitive impairments are common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), language impairments are not well defined.
Objective
The goal of this review was to examine the presence and nature of language disorders associated with MS.
Method
A search of PubMed and PsycINFO databases was conducted using combinations of the following terms: language disorders, language pathology, language impairment, multiple sclerosis, communication, language and speech. Studies were chosen based on the original language of the text, year of publication, peer-review status and specificity of the results regarding language and communication disorders.
Results
This review covers 30 articles from 13 countries. The studies involved patients with different types of MS. Various language impairments were reported in MS. However, since the methods used in the studies varied widely, it is difficult to draw any conclusions thus far.
Conclusion
Given the various cognitive deficits in MS, it is expected that higher language abilities would be affected. This aspect should be investigated in future studies.}

We conducted a longitudinal study examining reading acquisition in these children between 8 and 12 years old and we relate this data with early oral language acquisition at 6 years old. Compared to the control group, the SLI group presented impaired decoding and comprehension skills at age 8, as evidenced by poor scores in all the assessed tasks. Nevertheless, only text comprehension abilities appeared to be impaired at age 12. Individual analyses confirmed the presence of comprehension deficits in most of the SLI children. Furthermore, early semantic verbal fluency at age 6 appeared to significantly predict the reading comprehension capacity of SLI participants at age 12. Our results emphasize the importance of semantic capacity at early stages of oral language development over the consolidation of reading acquisition at later stages. Learning Outcomes: Readers will recognize the relevance of prior oral language impairment, especially semantic capacity, in children with a history of SLI as a risk factor for the development of later reading difficulties.}

One hundred forty-five monolingual primary school pupils were included in the study. Two study groups were formed: pupils with typical language development (TD) (n = 145) and pupils with developmental language disorders (LD) (n = 72). Acoustic measurements were made in twelve classrooms with different reverberation time. Monosyllabic nonsense words perception tests, presented by an examiner, were carried out in classrooms with and without SFAS. The number of errors in the test carried out with SFAS in different acoustic conditions reduced in pupils of Grade 1 with TD (Z = –2.273, p = .023; Z = –1.965, p = .049) and with LD (Z = –2.410, p = .016; Z = –2.156, p = .031). The SFAS installed in large classrooms with long reverberation time significantly increased the number of errors in nonsense monosyllables perception (rS = 0.361, p < .01, rS = 0.229, p < .01). The mean number of errors in children with LD was higher than in children with TD in monosyllabic nonsense words tests carried out with and without SFAS (U = 3194, p < .001; U = 3518.5, p < .001). First-grade students benefit from sound field amplification in perception of monosyllabic nonsense words regardless of classrooms acoustics, and irrespective of the level of language development. The positive effect of SFAS on nonsense word perception was not observed in pupils of Grade 2, 3, and 4 of primary school. Classroom acoustics affects the expected positive impact of SFAS for children older than first graders. Amplification increases speech perception and decreases the number of errors in the reproduction of monosyllabic nonsense words in classrooms with short reverberation time.}

abstract = {Introduction
Previous research (Gibson et al., 2015; Summers, Bohman, Gillam, Peña & Bedore, 2010) has suggested an advantage in Spanish over English on nonword repetition tasks with Spanish-English bilingual children. However, comparing nonwords of equal syllable lengths across languages may not sufficiently account for phonological differences across languages. We compared Spanish-language nonword sets of different lengths to select a set that would be equivalent with respect to difficulty in English. We considered language-specific phonological structure and level of difficulty in evaluating nonword performance in 126 first- and second-grade, Spanish-English bilingual children. We predicted that adding 5-syllable words to the Spanish nonword set and monosyllabic words to the English set would result in comparable difficulty.
Method
Participants repeated nonwords of increasing lengths in English of 1, 2, 3, and 4 syllables and in Spanish of 2, 3, 4, and 5 syllables. Percent phonemes correct was calculated for total sounds. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare accuracy across word lengths.
Results
Results indicated significant differences in overall means between languages when nonwords of equal word lengths were compared, but no significant differences in overall means when lengths of 1 – 4 syllables in English and 2 – 5 syllables in Spanish were used. Differences between languages varied at individual levels of complexity.
Conclusions
The finding that level of word length affects performance may have implications for understanding the factors in clinical test development for bilingual children. Further research may benefit from assessing additional language variables and additional language combinations to extend findings.}

The primary purposes of this study were to investigate differential item functioning (DIF) and item bias across Spanish and English forms of an assessment of early mathematics skills. Secondary purposes were to investigate the presence of selection bias and demonstrate a novel approach for investigating DIF that uses a regression discontinuity design framework to control for selection bias. Data were drawn from 1,750 Spanish-speaking Kindergarteners participating in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999, who were administered either the Spanish or English version of the mathematics assessment based on their performance on an English language screening measure. Evidence of selection bias—differences between groups in SES, age, approaches to learning, self-control, social interaction, country of birth, childcare, household composition and number in the home, books in the home, and parent involvement—highlighted limitations of a traditional approach for investigating DIF that only controlled for ability. When controlling for selection bias, only 11% of items displayed DIF, and subsequent examination of item content did not suggest item bias. Results provide evidence that the Spanish translation of the ECLS-K mathematics assessment is an equitable and unbiased assessment accommodation for young dual language learners.}

Despite of some similarities in language abilities, different combinations of language deficits were observed, and individual language profiles varied substantially. Thus, though there is a high prevalence of language deficits in this family which raises the likelihood of a genetic origin of these deficits, and though all affected study participants displayed selective linguistic deficits with normal non-verbal functioning, language testing showed considerable variance in overlap and homogeneity of linguistic deficits.

Three emergent bilinguals were paired with 3 English-only peer-buddies. Children were typically-developing and 3.9–5.2 years old. Each dyad was trained using an Invite-Play-Talk model, followed by 10, 20-minute-intervention play sessions. A staggered multiple baseline design across participants was used to measure the effect of this peer-mediated intervention on emergent bilingual and peer buddy interactions. Interactions were coded as verbal or nonverbal. All dyads of emergent bilingual and peer buddy children exhibited increases in their initiations and responses throughout the intervention phase over-time. Gains were maintained with a slight decrease in interactions at 2-weeks postintervention.

Longitudinal data of German-Italian bilingual children with SLI (N = 3) is compared to cross-sectional data (N = 42) of monolingual and bilingual typically developing (TD) children and monolingual children with SLI (ages four and seven). Spontaneous and elicited speech data is analysed in terms of target-like dative case marking in German. Results show differences between the acquisition of case marking of pronouns and of full Determiner Phrases (DPs). Regarding the target-like dative case marking in total, there were no differences found between bilingual TD, monolingual and bilingual children with SLI by the age of four. They demonstrated a similar delay when compared to monolingual TD children. By the age of seven, however, bilingual TD children ‘catch up’ with their monolingual peers. Children with SLI do not master the acquisition of dative case marking by this age. Cumulative effects of bilingualism and SLI were not found neither in younger nor in older bilingual children. These findings underline the importance of further research on linguistic markers and of distinguishing between effects of SLI and bilingualism.}

Previous research has shown that regular rhythmic stimulation benefits subsequent syntax processing in children with dyslexia and specific language impairment. The present EEG study examined the influence of a rhythmic musical prime on the P600 late evoked-potential, associated with grammatical error detection for dyslexic adults and matched controls. Participants listened to regular or irregular rhythmic prime sequences followed by grammatically correct and incorrect sentences. They were required to perform grammaticality judgments for each auditorily presented sentence while EEG was recorded. In addition, tasks on syntax violation detection as well as rhythm perception and production were administered. For both participant groups, ungrammatical sentences evoked a P600 in comparison to grammatical sentences and its mean amplitude was larger after regular than irregular primes. Peak analyses of the P600 difference wave confirmed larger peak amplitudes after regular primes for both groups. They also revealed overall a later peak for dyslexic participants, particularly at posterior sites, compared to controls. Results extend rhythmic priming effects on language processing to underlying electrophysiological correlates of morpho-syntactic violation detection in dyslexic adults and matched controls. These findings are interpreted in the theoretical framework of the Dynamic Attending Theory (Jones, 1976, 2019) and the Temporal Sampling Framework for developmental disorders (Goswami, 2011).}

abstract = {Summary
Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterised by slow and inaccurate word recognition. Dyslexia has been reported in every culture studied, and mounting evidence draws attention to cross-linguistic similarity in its neurobiological and neurocognitive bases. Much progress has been made across research specialties spanning the behavioural, neuropsychological, neurobiological, and causal levels of analysis in the past 5 years. From a neuropsychological perspective, the phonological theory remains the most compelling, although phonological problems also interact with other cognitive risk factors. Work confirms that, neurobiologically, dyslexia is characterised by dysfunction of the normal left hemisphere language network and also implicates abnormal white matter development. Studies accounting for reading experience demonstrate that many recorded neural differences show causes rather than effects of dyslexia. Six predisposing candidate genes have been identified, and evidence shows gene by environment interaction.}

The diagnosis of Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is very complex, given the variety of clinical pictures described in this disorder. Knowledge about the linguistic markers of SLI can facilitate its differentiation from the normal profile of language development. These markers can also be used as tools that may improve diagnostic.
Aims
To determine which psycholinguistic markers best discriminate Spanish-speaking children with SLI from children with typical language development.
Method and procedure
The performance of 31 Spanish-speaking children with SLI was analysed using a battery of 13 psycholinguistic tasks organized into two areas: phonology and morphosyntax. The performance of the SLI group was compared to that of two subgroups of controls: aged matched (CA) and linguistically matched (CL).
Outcomes and results
The data show that the SLI group performed worse than the CA subgroup on all 13 verbal tasks. However, the performance of the SLI group did not significantly differ from that of the CL subgroup on most (11/13) of the tasks. Stepwise discriminant analysis established the canonical function of three tasks (morphologic integration, sentence understanding and diadochokinesis) which significantly discriminated SLI from CA, with sensitivity 84% and specificity 90%.
Conclusions and implications
These results contribute to determining the psycholinguistic and clinical characteristics of SLI in Spanish-speaking children and provide some methods for screening assessment.}

abstract = {Purpose
Nonword repetition (NWR) and sentence imitation (SI) are increasingly used as diagnostic tools for the identification of Primary Language Impairment (PLI). They may be particularly promising diagnostic tools for bilingual children if performance on them is not highly affected by bilingual exposure. Two studies were conducted which examined (1) the effect of amount of bilingual exposure on performance on French and English nonword repetition and sentence imitation in 5-year-old French-English bilingual children and (2) the diagnostic accuracy of the French versions of these measures and of receptive vocabulary in 5-year-old monolingual French-speakers and bilingual speakers with and without PLI, carefully matched on language exposure.
Method
Study 1 included 84 5-year-olds acquiring French and English simultaneously, differing in their amount of exposure to the two languages but equated on age, nonverbal cognition and socio-economic status. Children were administered French and English tests of NWR and SI. In Study 2, monolingual and bilingual children with and without PLI (four groups, n=14 per group) were assessed for NWR, SI, and receptive vocabulary in French to determine diagnostic accuracy.
Results
Study 1: Both processing measures, but in particular NWR, were less affected by previous exposure than vocabulary measures. Bilingual children with varying levels of exposure were unaffected by the length of nonwords. Study 2: In contrast to receptive vocabulary, NWR and SI correctly distinguished children with PLI from children with typical development (TD) regardless of bilingualism. Sensitivity levels were acceptable, but specificity was lower.
Conclusions
Bilingual children perform differently than children with PLI on NWR and SI. In contrast to children with PLI, bilingual children with a large range of previous exposure levels achieve high NWR scores and are unaffected by the length of the nonwords. Learning outcomes: Readers will recognize the effect of language input on the rate of language development, focusing specifically on how bilingual exposure affects the language learning of each language of bilingual children.}

This cross-validation study investigated the extent to which a Spanish narrative language dynamic assessment accurately identified students with and without developmental language disorder across two separate samples of monolingual Spanish-speaking students from Guatemala and Mexico.
Materials and methods
Students with developmental language disorder and students with typically developing language were administered a Spanish narrative dynamic assessment. A test–teach–retest format of dynamic assessment was followed. Posttest scores and measures of student modifiability were gathered and examined.
Results and conclusions
Results indicated that the most predictive dynamic assessment variables for the Guatemalan sample were posttest scores and two modifiability measures. These same variables were applied in the cross-validation analysis of the Mexican sample with high classification accuracy achieved when posttest scores and an overall modifiability rating were combined. The results of this study indicate that a Spanish narrative dynamic assessment may be a culturally appropriate diagnostic tool in identifying Spanish-speaking students with developmental language disorder.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
Este estudio de validación cruzada investigó hasta qué punto una evaluación dinámica del lenguaje narrativo en español identificó con precisión a estudiantes con y sin trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje en dos muestras separadas de estudiantes monolingües de habla hispana de Guatemala y México.
Materiales y métodos
Se administró una evaluación dinámica narrativa en español a estudiantes con trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje y a estudiantes con un desarrollo típico del lenguaje. Se siguió un formato de evaluación dinámica de tipo test-enseñanza-retest. Se recogieron y examinaron las puntuaciones posteriores a la prueba y las medidas de modificabilidad de los estudiantes.
Resultados y conclusiones
Los resultados indicaron que las variables de evaluación dinámica más predictivas para la muestra guatemalteca fueron las puntuaciones postest y dos medidas de modificabilidad. Estas mismas variables se aplicaron en el análisis de validación cruzada de la muestra mexicana y se logró una alta precisión de clasificación cuando se combinaron las puntuaciones del postest y una calificación global de modificabilidad.

The children were administered two similar reading batteries in French and Spanish. The deficits of the dyslexic children in reading accuracy were mainly visible in their opaque orthography (French) whereas difficulties indexed by reading speed were observed in both their opaque and transparent orthographies. Dyslexic children did not exhibit any phonemic awareness problems in French or in Spanish, but showed poor VA Span skills compared to their control peers. VA span skills correlated with reading accuracy and speed measures in both Spanish and French, whereas phonemic awareness correlated with reading accuracy only. Overall, the present results show that the VA Span is tightly related to reading speed regardless of orthographic transparency, and that it accounts for differences in reading performance between good and poor readers across languages. The present findings further suggest that VA Span skills may play a particularly important role in building-up specific word knowledge which is critical for lexical reading strategies.}

Multiple independent research findings indicate that children with specific language impairment (SLI) show subtle difficulties beyond the language domain. Uncertainties remain on possible association between body-mediated, non-linguistic expression of verbs and early manifestation of SLI during verb acquisition. The present study was conducted to determine whether verb production through non-linguistic modalities is impaired in children with SLI. Children with SLI (mean age 41 months) and typically developing children (mean age 40 months) were asked to recognize target verbs while viewing video clips showing the action associated with the verb (verb-recognition task) and to enact the action corresponding to the verb (verb-enacting task). Children with SLI performed more poorly than control children in both tasks. The present study demonstrates that early language impairment emerges at the bodily level. These findings are consistent with the embodied theories of cognition and underscore the role of action-based representations during language development.}

Behavioural investigation showed a severe reduction of reading speed for both single items (words and pseudo-words) and texts in the two languages. However, performance was more affected in French than in Spanish. MP was administered an intensive VA span intervention programme. Pre–post intervention comparison revealed a positive effect of intervention on her VA span abilities. The intervention further transferred to reading. It primarily resulted in faster identification of the regular and irregular words in French. The effect of intervention was rather modest in Spanish that only showed a tendency for faster word reading. Text reading improved in the two languages with a stronger effect in French but pseudo-word reading did not improve in either French or Spanish. The overall results suggest that VA span intervention may primarily enhance the fast global reading procedure, with stronger effects in French than in Spanish. MP underwent two fMRI sessions to explore her brain activations before and after VA span training. Prior to the intervention, fMRI assessment showed that the striate and extrastriate visual cortices alone were activated but none of the regions typically involved in VA span. Post-training fMRI revealed increased activation of the superior and inferior parietal cortices. Comparison of pre- and post-training activations revealed significant activation increase of the superior parietal lobes (BA 7) bilaterally. Thus, we show that a specific VA span intervention not only modulates reading performance but further results in increased brain activity within the superior parietal lobes known to housing VA span abilities. Furthermore, positive effects of VA span intervention on reading suggest that the ability to process multiple visual elements simultaneously is one cause of successful reading acquisition.}

However, previous studies have shown that children with SLI show some cognitive and literacy problems. Our study analyses the relationship between preschool cognitive and linguistic abilities and the later development of reading abilities in Spanish–Catalan bilingual children with SLI. The sample consisted of 17 bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI and 17 age-matched controls. We tested eight distinct processes related to phonological, attention, and language processing at the age of 6 years and reading at 8 years of age. Results show that bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI show significantly lower scores, as compared to typically developing peers, in phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming (RAN), together with a lower outcome in tasks measuring sentence repetition and verbal fluency. Regarding attentional processes, bilingual Spanish–Catalan children with SLI obtained lower scores in auditory attention, but not in visual attention. At the age of 8 years Spanish–Catalan children with SLI had lower scores than their age-matched controls in total reading score, letter identification (decoding), and in semantic task (comprehension). Regression analyses identified both phonological awareness and verbal fluency at the age of 6 years to be the best predictors of subsequent reading performance at the age of 8 years. Our data suggest that language acquisition problems and difficulties in reading acquisition in bilingual children with SLI might be related to the close interdependence between a limitation in cognitive processing and a deficit at the linguistic level. Learning Outcomes: After reading this article, readers will be able to: identify their understanding of the relation between language difficulties and reading outcomes; explain how processing abilities influence reading performance in bilingual Spanish-Catalan children with SLI; and recognize the relation between language and reading via a developmental model in which the phonological system is considered central for the development of decoding abilities and comprehension.}

abstract = {Purpose
The current study examines how speech disfluencies manifest themselves in the two languages of bilingual persons who stutter, starting from the hypothesis that stuttering is associated with an attentional deficit at the level of speech production.
Methods
Twenty-eight bilingual people who stutter performed a spontaneous and a controlled speech production task, once in their dominant and once in their non-dominant language. The controlled production task (i.e. a network description task) was carried out once under a full-attention condition and once under a divided-attention condition where a non-linguistic, pitch discrimination task was performed simultaneously.
Results
In both the spontaneous and the controlled speech task, bilingual persons who stutter produced more (typical and stuttering-like) disfluencies in their L2 than in their L1. Furthermore, whereas the typical disfluencies increased when attention was directed away from speech production, stuttering-like disfluencies decreased. This effect was however restricted to L2. In addition, L2 proficiency was generally found to be a predicting factor, with higher proficiency leading to fewer disfluencies.
Conclusions
These results suggest that speaking in a non-dominant language increases both typical and stuttering-like disfluencies in bilingual persons who stutter, but also that these two types of dysfluencies differ regarding their attentional origins. Our findings offer further support for attentional accounts of stuttering and have both theoretical and clinical implications.}

abstract = {Purpose
Given that children with Down syndrome (DS) have language learning difficulties, concerns have been raised about the capacity of these children to acquire two (or more) languages. This research examines the language profiles of bilingual children with DS and typically developing (TD) children in comparison to monolinguals, with a view towards identifying the factors associated with language abilities within these populations.
Method
Four groups of children were recruited: Welsh-English bilinguals with DS (n=10), English monolinguals with DS (n=10), TD Welsh-English bilinguals (n=10) and TD English monolinguals (n=10). Children were individually matched on nonverbal cognitive ability (NVCA) to each child in the bilingual DS group and the four groups were matched on socioeconomic status and gender. Bilinguals were matched on current and lifetime exposure to Welsh and age of first exposure to their L2. Within DS and TD groups, chronological age was statistically controlled for. Language abilities were assessed via standardised assessments and specially designed tasks. Bilinguals were assessed in both of their languages.
Results
Results show no effect of language status on measures of expressive and receptive language abilities or phonological awareness. Language impairments were evident for both DS groups, particularly for expressive morphosyntax. Welsh receptive vocabulary scores of the bilinguals with DS were comparable to the TD bilinguals. Working memory, phonological awareness and chronological age were the strongest predictors of receptive language outcomes in both DS groups, explaining 90% of the variability.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we report no adverse outcomes on language development for bilinguals with DS. To our knowledge, this is the first group study of bilingualism in children with DS within the UK. Findings align with and add to the growing body of literature that reports that bilingualism does not negatively impact the language development of children with developmental disabilities. Clinical and educational implications are discussed.}

Descriptive method/qualitative approach using observation and interview schedule techniques were employed in data gathering and analysis of population (n=125) of which female students comprised of twenty percent (20%) and males were eighty percent (80%). It was observed that one major struggle that learning facilitators had, how to effectively carry out the learning process with meaningful results and keeping in sight the existence of students from different nationalities. The research findings revealed that students needed updated instructional materials and the universities should modify the business curriculum for students with multiple intelligences. Curriculum modification was not limited to instructional modification or content modification but included a continuum of a wide range of modified educational components in business .On the bases of findings and conclusions derived from the study, and in consideration of the limitations of the study, the following were recommended: curriculum development/modification in business courses offerings,training of personnel, training of faculty needed to have a compulsory component in “teaching and assessing learners with learning challenges”. Similar in-service training was also needed for the already practicing faculty .Further, there was a clear manifestation of lack of resources in learning institutions where special students were found, modified curriculum and differentiated instruction materials for students’ with multiple intelligences must be introduced.}

Purpose
This exploratory, qualitative study was conducted to explore Chinese couples' perceived educational needs for parenting a child with specific learning difficulties (SLD).
Methods
We recruited a purposive sample of 25 couples who were caring for a child with SLD at home from one regional child mental health center in Hong Kong. Data were collected from individual couples via audio-taped, semi-structured interviews between April and June 2011. Each interview lasted for about an hour. We analyzed the interview data using qualitative content analysis, as suggested by Graneheim and Lundman (2004).
Results
Four identified categories of parents' perceived educational needs were information needs for caregiving, a variety of health concerns with themselves and their child, inadequate psychosocial support, and perceived stigma attached to help-seeking. These results reveal challenges and information for mental health professionals in providing effective educational and psychosocial support and culture-specific health care for these families and their children with learning disabilities.
Conclusion
Our findings indicate a few important educational needs of parents in caring for a child with SLD that might be underestimated by mental health professionals and teachers, such as psychological support and information needs. To facilitate effective parenting, holistic and individualized needs assessment and education should be provided to address each parent's biopsychosocial and cultural needs in relation to caregiving.}

Very preterm infants (<30weeks of gestation) are at increased risk of specific language impairment and systematic developmental follow-up is essential for the provision of targeted early intervention.
Aims
To define the predictive value of early language testing and stability of language development, and perinatal and demographic risk factors for the diagnosis of SLI at 5years, in a cohort of preterm infants.
Study design
We used a retrospective hospital based cohort study.
Subjects
Preterm infants <30weeks of gestation, were cared for in NICU at RPAH, between 2004 and 2007, and prospectively enrolled in developmental follow-up. Standardised developmental assessment was done at 3years utilising the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III was done at 5years.
Outcome measures
Predictive value and stability of early language testing were assessed with respect to SLI at 5years, using measures of diagnostic accuracy and kappa values. Multivariate logistic regression was performed during the distribution of perinatal and demographic risk factors for SLI.
Results
One-in-five met diagnostic criteria for SLI (19%, n=24). Limited diagnostic accuracy was found with early expressive language and the stability of language scores demonstrated only fair agreement (Cohen's κ .383). Multilingual status and extreme gestational age at 24–25weeks were associated with a six-fold increased risk of SLI (OR 6.09, 95% CI 1.89–19.56; OR 6.09, 95% CI 1.28–29.0).
Conclusion
We defined a high incidence of SLI among our cohort, but only a limited diagnostic accuracy of early language testing. Multilingual status and extreme prematurity were independent risk factors for SLI. It remains imperative to perform continued developmental assessments beyond pre-school age to identify language impairment with greater accuracy.}

abstract = {Background
While studies confirm high prevalence of language disorder among justice-involved young people, little is known about the impact of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) on language among this population. It is also not clear how language skills vary according to language diversity in Australian youth justice settings, where a disproportionate number of justice-involved youth are Aboriginal and may not speak Standard Australian English (SAE) as their first language. Language skills are important to understand, as language disorder and language difference can lead to a mismatch between the communication skills of a young person and the communication skills of the justice workforce with whom they are communicating. In the highly verbal environments that are common to justice systems, language disorder and language difference may result in a young person misunderstanding legal information and expectations placed on them and not being adequately understood by the justice workforce.
Methods
This study examined the language skills of 98 young people sentenced to detention in Western Australia (WA), who participated in a cross-sectional study examining the prevalence of FASD. Language skills assessed using standardised and non-standardised tasks were analysed by the three major language groups identified: speakers of SAE, Aboriginal English and English as an additional language.
Results
We identified rich diversity of languages, and multilingualism was common. Most young people for whom English was not their first language demonstrated difficulties in SAE competence. Further, nearly one in two young people were identified with language disorder – over half of whom had language disorder associated with FASD.
Conclusions
This study has documented language diversity and the prevalence of language disorder associated with FASD among a representative sample of youth sentenced to detention in WA. Results underscore the need for the justice workforce to consider language difference when working with justice-involved youth, as well as language disorder and FASD. The findings also demonstrate the need for speech pathology to be embedded as core service in youth justice systems, working in collaboration with local cultural and language advisors and accredited interpreters. This can better enable appropriate identification of and response to communication and associated rehabilitation needs of young people navigating youth justice systems.}

Phonological and morphological awareness are both known to play an important role in reading acquisition. Problems in morpho-phonological information processing could arguably be associated with developmental dyslexia, especially for Finnish, which is a rich morphologically language. We used MEG to study the connection between morpho-phonology in the Finnish language and familial risk for developmental dyslexia. We measured event-related fields (ERFs) of 22 pre-school children without risk and 18 children with familial risk for developmental dyslexia during a morphological task. Pairs of sentences consisting of a verb and its derived noun with the derivational suffix/–jA/and pairs of sentences consisting of a pseudo-verb and its pseudo-noun ending with the same suffix were presented to the participants. The derived nouns were also divided into correctly and incorrectly derived forms. Incorrectly derived forms contained an incorrect morpho-phonological change in the last vowel before the derivational suffix/-jA/. Both typically developing children and children at-risk for developmental dyslexia were sensitive to the morphological information, both in the case of real words and pseudowords, as shown by the sensor level analysis and cluster-based permutation tests for the responses to the morphologically correct vs. incorrect contrast. The groups showed somewhat different response patterns to this contrast. However, no significant differences were found in the between-group differences. No significant differences emerged between typically developing children and children at-risk for developmental dyslexia neither for real words nor for pseudowords. Overall, these findings suggest that pre-school children with and without risk for developmental dyslexia are already sensitive to the processing of morpho-phonological information before entering school.}

The present study is the first to assess the online comprehension of Spanish articles in bilingual children with DLD. In an eye tracking experiment, we monitored participants’ eye movements as they listened to Spanish articles embedded in structurally simple sentences. Ninety-six subjects from four different groups were evaluated: 24 children with DLD (average age 7;08), 24 children with the same chronological age (average age 7;08), 24 younger children matched for mean length utterance (average age 6;08), and 24 adults (average age 22;05). We calculated the proportion between the preference for the correct visual referent and a competitor object. Our results suggest that children with DLD are capable of timely comprehension of Spanish articles in real time and within simple sentence structures. However, we observed a strong effect of chronological age in the sample of interest; younger children with DLD are able to identify the correct referent, but this preference is weaker compared to the older children with DLD. We also observed local differences between the DLD group, and the other two children control groups, particularly when the chronological age group is introduced as a factor. These findings suggest a developmental trajectory that is different in the DLD group relative to children with typical language development. Notwithstanding, in spite of the article production difficulties previously reported, children with DLD in the present sample appear to be able to comprehend Spanish articles in the current experimental conditions.}

abstract = {Background
Developmental language disorder (DLD) often remains undetected until children shift from ‘learning to read’ to ‘reading to learn,’ around 9 years of age. Mono- and bilingual children with DLD frequently have co-occurring reading, attention, and related difficulties, compared to children with typical language development (TLD). Data for mono- and bilingual children with DLD and TLD would aid differentiation of language differences versus disorders in bilingual children.
Objective
We conducted a scoping review of descriptive research on mono-and bilingual children < and >= 9 years old with DLD versus TLD, and related skills (auditory processing, attention, cognition, executive function, and reading).
Data Sources
We searched PubMed for the terms “bilingual” and “language disorders” or “impairment” and “child[ren]” from August 1, 1979 through October 1, 2018.
Charting Methods
Two abstracters charted all search results. Main exclusions were: secondary data/reviews, special populations, intervention studies, and case studies/series. Abstracted data included age, related skills measures’, and four language groups of participants: monolingual DLD, monolingual TLD, bilingual DLD, and bilingual TLD.
Results
Of 366 articles, 159 (43%) met inclusion criteria. Relatively few (14%, n = 22) included all 4 language groups, co-occurring difficulties other than nonverbal intelligence (n = 49, 31%) or reading (n = 51, 32%) or any 9–18 year-olds (31%, n = 48). Just 5 (3%) included only 9-18 year-olds. Among studies with any 9 to 18 year olds, just 4 (8%, 4/48) included 4 language groups.
Conclusions
Future research should include mono- and bilingual children with both DLD and TLD, beyond 8 years of age, along with data about their related skills.}

Based on previous work, we hypothesized that training abstract words in either language would promote within-language generalization, while training in the nondominant language would promote both within- and cross-language generalization. Methods: This case study used a single-subject A1BA2CA3 design. The participant was living with aphasia secondary to stroke and spoke both Polish and English, with Polish being his native and dominant language. Phase B consisted of abstract word training in Polish and phase C consisted of abstract word training in English. Prior to initiating therapy, in addition to a comprehensive language battery, we administered a cognitive control task to explore the relationship between cognitive control and treatment outcome. Results: We found within-language generalization regardless of the trained language, replicating previous work in monolingual persons with aphasia, further supporting the utility of training abstract words. However, contrary to our second hypothesis, cross-language generalization only occurred when the stronger language was trained. Conclusions: The discussion of the results of this case study is framed within previous work and theories of bilingualism. The lack of cross-language generalization when the weaker language was trained is discussed, taking into account nonverbal cognitive control deficits. In addition to showing the efficacy of BAbSANT, these results highlight the importance of considering cognitive control as a factor influencing therapeutic outcomes in anomia treatment in bilingual PWA.}

Twelve dyslexic and 13 nondyslexic adults performed a lexical decision task while stimuli were presented unimodally (either aurally or visually) or bimodally (audiovisually simultaneously). The behavioral data collected during the experiment evidenced more accurate processing for bimodally than for unimodally presented stimuli irrespective of group. Words were processed faster than pseudowords. Notably, no group differences have been found for either accuracy or for reaction times. With respect to brain responses, nondyslexic compared to dyslexic adults elicited stronger hemodynamic responses in the leftward supramarginal gyrus (SMG), as well as in the right hemispheric superior temporal sulcus (STS). Furthermore, dyslexic compared to nondyslexic adults showed reduced responses to only aurally presented signals and enhanced hemodynamic responses to audiovisual, as well as visual stimulation in the right anterior insula. Our behavioral results evidence that the two groups easily identified the two-syllabic proper nouns that we provided them with. Our fMRI results indicate that dyslexics show less neuronal involvement of heteromodal and extrasylvian regions, namely, the STS, SMG, and insula when decoding phonological information. We posit that dyslexic adults evidence deficient functioning of word processing, which could possibly be attributed to deficits in phoneme to grapheme mapping. This problem may be caused by impaired audiovisual processing in multimodal areas.}

Assuming that speaking a language in varying environments involves distinct subskills that can be acquired in differential patterns, the achievement of phonological, lexical, morphosyntactic and textual abilities were assessed separately. For each of these abilities, it was determined to what extent the conditions of restricted input (first vs. second language) and language deficit (typically developing vs. SLI) cause stagnation or a delay in language acquisition. Bilingual children with SLI perform at a lower level than the other groups in almost all aspects of achievement in Dutch. For language tasks related to the mental lexicon and grammar, an additional disadvantage was evidenced as a result of the combination of learning Dutch as second language and having SLI.}

abstract = {Dual-language immersion (DLI) experience has been linked to enhanced reading and math skills in minority- and majority-language elementary school children. However, it remains unclear whether DLI experience can also enhance executive functioning. The current study took a longitudinal approach to this question and examined the effect of DLI experience on the development of executive function skills in majority-language children over a 1-year period. In total, 33 monolingual children attending English-only classrooms (Mage = 9.17 years, SD = 1.03) and 33 English–Spanish bilingual children attending DLI classrooms (Mage = 9.27 years, SD = 0.94) matched on age, gender, nonverbal IQ, and socioeconomic status were tested twice, 1 year apart, on nonverbal measures of inhibition, shifting, switching, and monitoring. Results revealed a significant interaction between group and year only on the response inhibition task, with bilinguals showing superior inhibition in Year 1 but not in Year 2. The two groups performed equivalently on all other measures at both time points. Results suggest that classroom DLI has a minimal impact on executive functions, at least as tested in the current study.}

abstract = {Children with developmental disabilities (DD) often need and sometimes opt to become bilingual. The context for bilingual acquisition varies considerably and can impact outcomes. In this first article of the special issue, we review research on the timing and amount of bilingual exposure and outcomes of either direct language intervention or educational placements in three groups of children with DD: Specific Language Impairment (SLI), Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and Down syndrome (DS). Children with SLI have been studied more than the other two groups. Findings showed that, on the one hand, the communication skills of simultaneous bilinguals and matched monolinguals with DD were similar for all groups when the stronger language or both languages of the bilingual children were considered. On the other hand, similar to typically developing children, sequential bilinguals and matched monolinguals with SLI (other groups not studied) differed on some but not all second language (L2) measures; even after an extended period of exposure, differences in L2 outcomes were not completely resolved. There is emerging evidence that the typological similarity of the languages being learned influences L2 development in sequential bilinguals, at least in children with SLI. Increasing the frequency of exposure seems to be more related to development of the weaker language in bilinguals with DD than their stronger language. Language intervention studies show the efficacy of interventions but provide little evidence for transfer across languages. In addition, only one (unpublished) study has compared the language and academic outcomes of children with DD in different language education programs. Research on bilingual children with DD in different educational settings/programs is limited, probably as a result of restricted inclusion of these children in some educational settings. We argue for the implementation of full inclusion policies that provide increased access to dual language programs for children with DD and access to a complete range of support services.}

The differences between native- and second-language speech processing and the establishment of new brain representations for spoken second language in dyslexia are not, however, well understood. We used recordings of the mismatch negativity component of event-related potential to determine possible differences between the activation of long-term memory representations for spoken native- and second-language word forms in Finnish-speaking 9–11-year-old children with or without dyslexia, studying English as their second language in school. In addition, we sought to investigate whether the bottleneck of dyslexic readers' second-language learning lies at the level of word representations or smaller units and whether the amplitude of mismatch negativity is correlated with native-language literacy and related skills. We found that the activation of brain representations for familiar second-language words, but not for second-language speech sounds or native-language words, was weaker in children with dyslexia than in typical readers. Source localization revealed that dyslexia was associated with weak activation of the right temporal cortex, which has been previously linked with word-form learning. Importantly, the amplitude of the mismatch negativity for familiar second-language words correlated with native-language literacy and rapid naming scores, suggesting a close link between second-language processing and these skills.}

abstract = {When speech is presented in their second language (L2), bilinguals have more difficulties with speech perception in noise than monolinguals do. However, how noise affects speech perception of bilinguals in their first language (L1) is still unclear. In addition, it is not clear whether bilinguals' speech perception in challenging listening conditions is specific to the type of degradation, or whether there is a shared mechanism for bilingual speech processing under complex listening conditions. Therefore, the current study examined the speech perception of 60 Arabic-Hebrew bilinguals and a control group of native Hebrew speakers during degraded (speech in noise, vocoded speech) and quiet listening conditions. Between participant comparisons (comparing native Hebrew speakers and bilinguals' perceptual performance in L1) and within participant comparisons (perceptual performance of bilinguals in L1 and L2) were conducted. The findings showed that bilinguals in L1 had more difficulty in noisy conditions than their control counterparts did, even when performed like controls under favorable listening conditions. However, bilingualism did not hinder language learning mechanisms. Bilinguals in L1 outperformed native Hebrew speakers in the perception of vocoded speech, demonstrating more extended learning processes. Bilinguals' perceptual performance in L1 versus L2 varied by task complexity. Correlation analyses revealed that bilinguals who coped better with noise degradation were more successful in perceiving the vocoding distortion. Together, these results provide insights into the mechanisms that contribute to speech perceptual performance in challenging listening conditions and suggest that bilinguals' language proficiency and age of language acquisition are not the only factors that affect performance. Rather, duration of exposure to languages, co-activation, and the ability to benefit from exposure to novel stimuli appear to affect the perceptual performance of bilinguals, even when operating in their dominant language. Our findings suggest that bilinguals use a shared mechanism for speech processing under challenging listening conditions.}

The subtests of expressive vocabulary and of receptive and expressive word classes of the CELF-4 were used. The intervention program consisted of 75 sessions lasting 20minutes each. The results indicated that pupils diagnosed with developmental language disorder initially performed worse in vocabulary and word classes than those with TD. Also, the pupils with developmental language disorder not only improved their performance by the end of the program, but were found to be the group with the greatest gains from the intervention. There are educational implications for organizing an early intervention of an inclusive nature.
Resumen
El objetivo principal de la presente investigación es comprobar la efectividad de un programa de intervención sobre la organización léxica de alumnado con desarrollo típico y con trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje. Participan un total de 99 alumnos de cinco años de edad de colegios de la Isla de Tenerife (Islas Canarias, España). Se utilizan los subtest de vocabulario expresivo, de clases de palabras receptivo y expresivo del CELF-4. El programa de intervención consta de 75 sesiones de 20 minutos de duración. Los resultados indican que el alumnado diagnosticado con trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje presenta inicialmente un peor rendimiento en vocabulario y clases de palabras que el diagnosticado con desarrollo típico. Una vez finalizado el programa, el alumnado con trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje además de mejorar su rendimiento, es el grupo que presenta mayores ganancias. Existen implicaciones educativas para organizar una intervención temprana de naturaleza inclusiva.}

abstract = {Monolingual and bilingual participants performed a Proactive Interference task in verbal and nonverbal conditions while EEG was recorded. Behavioral results showed faster responses for bilinguals on interference trials in the nonverbal condition, and electrophysiological results indicated greater attentional control for bilinguals. ROI analyses showed this pattern for bilinguals mainly in the verbal condition, whereas whole brain analyses found this association in both conditions. Frequency power analysis found activity related to interference trials was associated with recruitment of different neural resources for verbal and nonverbal conditions. Nonverbal results indicated beta activity for interference trials in bilinguals and the verbal condition showed this pattern in theta and gamma frequency bands as well, revealing more extensive brain activation in the verbal domain for bilinguals. For monolinguals, frequency power in beta, gamma, and theta were related to facilitation trials. These results suggest different strategies for allocating attention by monolingual and bilingual young adults.}

Using latent profile analysis (a type of mixture modeling), four profiles of DLLs were identified. Most DLLs were classified as English Dominant, followed by Balanced Average, Spanish Dominant, and Balanced Low, respectively. In general, the Balanced Average profile outperformed the other profiles in English and Spanish, and their norm-referenced standard scores provide additional evidence that bilingual development is not associated with educational risk.}
