ABSTRACT = {The paper presents a novel autotuning approach for finding locally-best parameters of controllers on board of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The controller tuning is performed fully autonomously during flight on the basis of predefined ranges of controller parameters. Required controller properties may be simply interpreted by a cost function, which is involved in the optimization process. For example, the sum of absolute values of the tracking error samples or performance indices, including weighed functions of control signal samples, can be penalized to achieve very precise position control, if required. The proposed method relies on an optimization procedure using Fibonacci-search technique fitted into bootstrap sequences, enabling one to obtain a global minimizer for a unimodal cost function. The approach is characterized by low computational complexity and does not require any UAV dynamics model (just periodical measurements from basic onboard sensors) to obtain proper tuning of a controller. In addition to the theoretical background of the method, an experimental verification in real-world outdoor conditions is provided. The experiments have demonstrated a high robustness of the method to in-environment disturbances, such as wind, and its easy deployability.},

ABSTRACT = {Natural disasters and terrorist attacks pose a significant threat to human society, and have stressed an urgent need for the development of comprehensive and efficient evacuation strategies. In this paper, a novel evacuation-planning mechanism is introduced to support the distributed and autonomous evacuation process within the operation of a public safety system, where the evacuees exploit the capabilities of the proposed ESCAPE service, towards making the most beneficial actions for themselves. The ESCAPE service was developed based on the principles of reinforcement learning and game theory, and is executed at two decision-making layers. Initially, evacuees are modeled as stochastic learning automata that select an evacuation route that they want to go based on its physical characteristics and past decisions during the current evacuation. Consequently, a cluster of evacuees is created per evacuation route, and the evacuees decide if they will finally evacuate through the specific evacuation route at the current time slot or not. The evacuees&rsquo; competitive behavior is modeled as a non-co-operative minority game per each specific evacuation route. A distributed and low-complexity evacuation-planning algorithm (i.e., ESCAPE) is introduced to implement both the aforementioned evacuee decision-making layers. Finally, the proposed framework is evaluated through modeling and simulation under several scenarios, and its superiority and benefits are revealed and demonstrated.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, regression trackers have drawn increasing attention in the visual-object tracking community due to their favorable performance and easy implementation. The tracker algorithms directly learn mapping from dense samples around the target object to Gaussian-like soft labels. However, in many real applications, when applied to test data, the extreme imbalanced distribution of training samples usually hinders the robustness and accuracy of regression trackers. In this paper, we propose a novel effective distractor-aware loss function to balance this issue by highlighting the significant domain and by severely penalizing the pure background. In addition, we introduce a full differentiable hierarchy-normalized concatenation connection to exploit abstractions across multiple convolutional layers. Extensive experiments were conducted on five challenging benchmark-tracking datasets, that is, OTB-13, OTB-15, TC-128, UAV-123, and VOT17. The experimental results are promising and show that the proposed tracker performs much better than nearly all the compared state-of-the-art approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {The ever increasing proliferation of wireless objects and consistent connectivity demands are creating significant challenges for battery-constrained wireless devices. The vision of massive IoT, involving billions of smart objects to be connected to the cellular network, needs to address the problem of uninterrupted power consumption while taking advantage of emerging high-frequency 5G communications. The problem of limited battery power motivates us to utilize radio frequency (RF) signals as the energy source for battery-free communications in next-generation wireless networks. Backscatter communication (BackCom) makes it possible to harvest energy from incident RF signals and reflect back parts of the same signals while modulating the data. Ambient BackCom (Amb-BackCom) is a type of BackCom that can harvest energy from nearby WiFi, TV, and cellular RF signals to modulate information. The objective of this article is to review BackCom as a solution to the limited battery life problem and enable future battery-free communications for combating the energy issues for devices in emerging wireless networks. We first highlight the energy constraint in existing wireless communications. We then investigate BackCom as a practical solution to the limited battery life problem. Subsequently, in order to take the advantages of omnipresent radio waves, we elaborate BackCom tag architecture and various types of BackCom. To understand encoding and data extraction, we demonstrate signal processing aspects that cover channel coding, interference, decoding, and signal detection schemes. Moreover, we also describe BackCom communication modes, modulation schemes, and multiple access techniques to accommodate maximum users with high throughput. Similarly, to mitigate the increased network energy, adequate data and power transfer schemes for BackCom are elaborated, in addition to reliability, security, and range extension. Finally, we highlight BackCom applications with existing research challenges and future directions for next-generation 5G wireless networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Brushless direct current (BLDC) motors are the source of flight power during the operation of rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and their working state directly affects the safety of the whole system. To predict and avoid motor faults, it is necessary to accurately understand the health degradation process of the motor before any fault occurs. However, in actual working conditions, due to the aerodynamic environmental conditions of the aircraft flight, the background noise components of the vibration signals characterizing the running state of the motor are complex and severely coupled, making it difficult for the weak degradation characteristics to be clearly reflected. To address these problems, a weak degradation characteristic extraction method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) was proposed in this study to precisely identify the degradation information in system health data, avoid the loss of critical information and the interference of redundant information, and to optimize the description of a motor&rsquo;s degradation process despite the presence of complex background noise. A validation experiment was conducted on a specific type of motor under operation with load, to obtain the degradation characteristics of multiple types of vibration signals, and to test the proposed method. The results proved that this method can improve the stability and accuracy of predicting motor health, thereby helping to predict the degradation state and to optimize the maintenance strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {With an increasing number of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), solutions supporting the improvement in their precision of operation and safety of autonomous flights are gaining importance. They are particularly crucial in transportation tasks, where control systems are required to provide a stable and controllable flight in various environmental conditions, especially after changing the total mass of the UAV (by adding extra load). In the paper, the problem of using only available basic sensory information for fast, locally best, iterative real-time auto-tuning of parameters of fixed-gain altitude controllers is considered. The machine learning method proposed for this purpose is based on a modified zero-order optimization algorithm (golden-search algorithm) and bootstrapping technique. It has been validated in numerous simulations and real-world experiments in terms of its effectiveness in such aspects as: the impact of environmental disturbances (wind gusts); flight with change in mass; and change of sensory information sources in the auto-tuning procedure. The main advantage of the proposed method is that for the trajectory primitives repeatedly followed by an UAV (for programmed controller gains), the method effectively minimizes the selected performance index (cost function). Such a performance index might, e.g., express indirect requirements about tracking quality and energy expenditure. In the paper, a comprehensive description of the method, as well as a wide discussion of the results obtained from experiments conducted in the AeroLab for a low-cost UAV (Bebop 2), are included. The results have confirmed high efficiency of the method at the expected, low computational complexity.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on one of the collision avoidance scenarios for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where the UAV needs to avoid collision with the enemy UAV during its flying path to the goal point. Such a type of problem is defined as the enemy avoidance problem in this paper. To deal with this problem, a learning based framework is proposed. Under this framework, the enemy avoidance problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and the maneuver policies for the UAV are learned based on a temporal-difference reinforcement learning method called Sarsa. To handle the enemy avoidance problem in continuous state space, the Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC) function approximation technique is embodied in the proposed framework. Furthermore, a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation environment is established. Simulation results show that the UAV agent can learn a satisfying policy under the proposed framework. Comparing with the random policy and the fixed-rule policy, the learned policy can achieve a far higher possibility in reaching the goal point without colliding with the enemy UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {State-of-the-art forest models are often complex, analytically intractable, and computationally expensive, due to the explicit representation of detailed biogeochemical and ecological processes. Different models often produce distinct results while predictions from the same model vary with parameter values. In this project, we developed a rigorous quantitative approach for conducting model intercomparisons and assessing model performance. We have applied our original methodology to compare two forest biogeochemistry models, the Perfect Plasticity Approximation with Simple Biogeochemistry (PPA-SiBGC) and Landscape Disturbance and Succession with Net Ecosystem Carbon and Nitrogen (LANDIS-II NECN). We simulated past-decade conditions at flux tower sites located within Harvard Forest, MA, USA (HF-EMS) and Jones Ecological Research Center, GA, USA (JERC-RD). We mined field data available from both sites to perform model parameterization, validation, and intercomparison. We assessed model performance using the following time-series metrics: Net ecosystem exchange, aboveground net primary production, aboveground biomass, C, and N, belowground biomass, C, and N, soil respiration, and species total biomass and relative abundance. We also assessed static observations of soil organic C and N, and concluded with an assessment of general model usability, performance, and transferability. Despite substantial differences in design, both models achieved good accuracy across the range of pool metrics. While LANDIS-II NECN showed better fidelity to interannual NEE fluxes, PPA-SiBGC indicated better overall performance for both sites across the 11 temporal and two static metrics tested (HF-EMS       R 2  &macr;  = 0.73 , + 0.07    ,       R M S E  &macr;  = 4.68 , &minus; 9.96    ; JERC-RD       R 2  &macr;  = 0.73 , + 0.01    ,       R M S E  &macr;  = 2.18 , &minus; 1.64    ). To facilitate further testing of forest models at the two sites, we provide pre-processed datasets and original software written in the R language of statistical computing. In addition to model intercomparisons, our approach may be employed to test modifications to forest models and their sensitivity to different parameterizations.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapid development of vision sensor based on artificial intelligence (AI) is reforming industries and making our world smarter. Among these trends, it is of great significance to adapt AI technologies into the intelligent agricultural management. In smart agricultural aviation spraying, the droplets&rsquo; distribution and deposition are important indexes for estimating effectiveness in plant protection process. However, conventional approaches are problematic, they lack adaptivity to environmental changes, and consumes non-reusable test materials. One example is that the machine vision algorithms they employ can&rsquo;t guarantee that the division of adhesive droplets thereby disabling the accurate measurement of critical parameters. To alleviate these problems, we put forward an intelligent visual droplet detection node which can adapt to the environment illumination change. Then, we propose a modified marker controllable watershed segmentation algorithm to segment those adhesive droplets, and calculate their characteristic parameters on the basis of the segmentation results, including number, coverage, coverage density, etc. Finally, we use the intelligent node to detect droplets, and then expound the situation that the droplet region is effectively segmented and marked. The intelligent node has better adaptability and robustness even under the condition of illumination changing. The large-scale distributed detection result indicates that our approach has good consistency with the non-recyclable water-sensitive paper approach. Our approach provides an intelligent and environmental friendly way of tests for spraying techniques, especially for plant protection with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.},

ABSTRACT = {Information gathering (IG) algorithms aim to intelligently select a mobile sensor actions required to efficiently obtain an accurate reconstruction of a physical process, such as an occupancy map, or a magnetic field. Many recent works have proposed algorithms for IG that employ Gaussian processes (GPs) as underlying model of the process. However, most algorithms discretize the state space, which makes them computationally intractable for robotic systems with complex dynamics. Moreover, they are not suited for online information gathering tasks as they assume prior knowledge about GP parameters. This paper presents a novel approach that tackles the two aforementioned issues. Specifically, our approach includes two intertwined steps: (i) a Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) search that allows a robot to identify unvisited locations, and to learn the GP parameters, and (ii) an RRT*-based informative path planning that guides the robot towards those locations by maximizing the information gathered while minimizing path cost. The combination of the two steps allows an online realization of the algorithm, while eliminating the need for discretization. We demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art both in simulations, and in a lab experiment in which a ground-based robot explores the magnetic field intensity within an indoor environment populated with obstacles.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote sensing image scene classification is one of the most challenging problems in understanding high-resolution remote sensing images. Deep learning techniques, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN), have improved the performance of remote sensing image scene classification due to the powerful perspective of feature learning and reasoning. However, several fully connected layers are always added to the end of CNN models, which is not efficient in capturing the hierarchical structure of the entities in the images and does not fully consider the spatial information that is important to classification. Fortunately, capsule network (CapsNet), which is a novel network architecture that uses a group of neurons as a capsule or vector to replace the neuron in the traditional neural network and can encode the properties and spatial information of features in an image to achieve equivariance, has become an active area in the classification field in the past two years. Motivated by this idea, this paper proposes an effective remote sensing image scene classification architecture named CNN-CapsNet to make full use of the merits of these two models: CNN and CapsNet. First, a CNN without fully connected layers is used as an initial feature maps extractor. In detail, a pretrained deep CNN model that was fully trained on the ImageNet dataset is selected as a feature extractor in this paper. Then, the initial feature maps are fed into a newly designed CapsNet to obtain the final classification result. The proposed architecture is extensively evaluated on three public challenging benchmark remote sensing image datasets: the UC Merced Land-Use dataset with 21 scene categories, AID dataset with 30 scene categories, and the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset with 45 challenging scene categories. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can lead to a competitive classification performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The advent of autonomous navigation, positioning, and general robotics technologies has enabled the improvement of small to miniature-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or &lsquo;drones&rsquo;) and their wide uses in engineering practice. Recent research endeavors further envision a systematic integration of aerial drones and traditional contact-based or ground-based sensors, leading to an aerial&ndash;ground wireless sensor network (AG-WSN), in which the UAV serves as both a gateway besides and a remote sensing platform. This paper serves two goals. First, we will review the recent development in architecture, design, and algorithms related to UAVs as a gateway and particularly illustrate its nature in realizing an opportunistic sensing network. Second, recognizing the opportunistic sensing need, we further aim to focus on achieving energy efficiency through developing an active radio frequency (RF)-based wake-up mechanism for aerial&ndash;ground data transmission. To prove the effectiveness of energy efficiency, several sensor wake-up solutions are physically implemented and evaluated. The results show that the RF-based wake-up mechanism can potentially save more than 98.4% of the energy that the traditional duty-cycle method would otherwise consume, and 96.8% if an infrared-receiver method is used.},

ABSTRACT = {A honeypot is a decoy tool for luring an attacker and interacting with it, further consuming its resources. Due to its fake property, a honeypot can be recognized by the adversary and loses its value. Honeypots equipped with dynamic characteristics are capable of deceiving intruders. However, most of their dynamic properties are reflected in the system configuration, rather than the location. Dynamic honeypots are faced with the risk of being identified and avoided. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic locations of honeypots and propose a distributed honeypot scheme. By periodically changing the services, the attacker cannot distinguish the real services from honeypots, and the illegal attack flow can be recognized. We adopt game theory to illustrate the effectiveness of our system. Gambit simulations are conducted to validate our proposed scheme. The game-theoretic reasoning shows that our system comprises an innovative system defense. Further simulation results prove that the proposed scheme improves the server’s payoff and that the attacker tends to abandon launching attacks. Therefore, the proposed distributed honeypot scheme is effective for network security.},

ABSTRACT = {Aircraft recognition in remote sensing images has long been a meaningful topic. Most related methods treat entire images as a whole and do not concentrate on the features of parts. In fact, a variety of aircraft types have small interclass variance, and the main evidence for classifying subcategories is related to some discriminative object parts. In this paper, we introduce the idea of fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) and attempt to make full use of the features from discriminative object parts. First, multiple class activation mapping (MultiCAM) is proposed to extract the discriminative parts of aircrafts of different categories. Second, we present a mask filter (MF) strategy to enhance the discriminative object parts and filter the interference of the background from original images. Third, a selective connected feature fusion method is proposed to fuse the features extracted from both networks, focusing on the original images and the results of MF, respectively. Compared with the single prediction category in class activation mapping (CAM), MultiCAM makes full use of the predictions of all categories to overcome the wrong discriminative parts produced by a wrong single prediction category. Additionally, the designed MF preserves the object scale information and helps the network to concentrate on the object itself rather than the interfering background. Experiments on a challenging dataset prove that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Hyperspectral image (HSI) provides both spatial structure and spectral information for classification, but many traditional methods simply concatenate spatial features and spectral features together that usually lead to the curse-of-dimensionality and unbalanced representation of different features. To address this issue, a new dimensionality reduction (DR) method, termed multi-feature manifold discriminant analysis (MFMDA), was proposed in this paper. At first, MFMDA explores local binary patterns (LBP) operator to extract textural features for encoding the spatial information in HSI. Then, under graph embedding framework, the intrinsic and penalty graphs of LBP and spectral features are constructed to explore the discriminant manifold structure in both spatial and spectral domains, respectively. After that, a new spatial-spectral DR model for multi-feature fusion is built to extract discriminant spatial-spectral combined features, and it not only preserves the similarity relationship between spectral features and LBP features but also possesses strong discriminating ability in the low-dimensional embedding space. Experiments on Indian Pines, Heihe and Pavia University (PaviaU) hyperspectral data sets demonstrate that the proposed MFMDA method performs significantly better than some state-of-the-art methods using only single feature or simply stacking spectral features and spatial features together, and the classification accuracies of it can reach 95.43%, 97.19% and 96.60%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers. At the same time, advances in technologies enable the generation or collection of large amounts of valuable data (e.g., sensor data) from various sources in different applications, such as those for the Internet of Things (IoT), which in turn aims towards the development of smart cities. With the availability of sensor data from various sources, sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article, we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors, including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system (GIS), accelerometers, as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS). The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens, which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities.

ABSTRACT = {This paper deals with the problem of autonomous navigation of a mobile robot in an unknown 2D environment to fully explore the environment as efficiently as possible. We assume a terrestrial mobile robot equipped with a ranging sensor with a limited range and     360 &deg;     field of view. The key part of the exploration process is formulated as the d-Watchman Route Problem which consists of two coupled tasks&mdash;candidate goals generation and finding an optimal path through a subset of goals&mdash;which are solved in each exploration step. The latter has been defined as a constrained variant of the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem and solved using an evolutionary algorithm. An evolutionary algorithm that uses an indirect representation and the nearest neighbor based constructive procedure was proposed to solve this problem. Individuals evolved in this evolutionary algorithm do not directly code the solutions to the problem. Instead, they represent sequences of instructions to construct a feasible solution. The problems with efficiently generating feasible solutions typically arising when applying traditional evolutionary algorithms to constrained optimization problems are eliminated this way. The proposed exploration framework was evaluated in a simulated environment on three maps and the time needed to explore the whole environment was compared to state-of-the-art exploration methods. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the compared ones in environments with a low density of obstacles by up to     12.5 %    , while it is slightly worse in office-like environments by     4.5 %     at maximum. The framework has also been deployed on a real robot to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed solution with real hardware.},

ABSTRACT = {Soil salinization is a global issue resulting in soil degradation, arable land loss and ecological environmental deterioration. Over the decades, multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing have enabled efficient and cost-effective monitoring of salt-affected soils. However, the potential of hyperspectral sensors installed on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate and map soil salinity has not been thoroughly explored. This study quantitatively characterized and estimated field-scale soil salinity using an electromagnetic induction (EMI) equipment and a hyperspectral camera installed on a UAV platform. In addition, 30 soil samples (0~20 cm) were collected in each field for the lab measurements of electrical conductivity. First, the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) values measured by EMI were calibrated using the lab measured electrical conductivity derived from soil samples based on empirical line method. Second, the soil salinity was quantitatively estimated using the random forest (RF) regression method based on the reflectance factors of UAV hyperspectral images and satellite multispectral data. The performance of models was assessed by Lin&rsquo;s concordance coefficient (CC), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and root mean square error (RMSE). Finally, the soil salinity of three study fields with different land cover were mapped. The results showed that bare land (field A) exhibited the most severe salinity, followed by dense vegetation area (field C) and sparse vegetation area (field B). The predictive models using UAV data outperformed those derived from GF-2 data with lower RMSE, higher CC and RPD values, and the most accurate UAV-derived model was developed using 62 hyperspectral bands of the image of the field A with the RMSE, CC, and RPD values of 1.40 dS m&minus;1, 0.94, and 2.98, respectively. Our results indicated that UAV-borne hyperspectral imager is a useful tool for field-scale soil salinity monitoring and mapping. With the help of the EMI technique, quantitative estimation of surface soil salinity is critical to decision-making in arid land management and saline soil reclamation.},

ABSTRACT = {Object detection on very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery has attracted a lot of attention in the field of image automatic interpretation. Region-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been vastly promoted in this domain, which first generate candidate regions and then accurately classify and locate the objects existing in these regions. However, the overlarge images, the complex image backgrounds and the uneven size and quantity distribution of training samples make the detection tasks more challenging, especially for small and dense objects. To solve these problems, an effective region-based VHR remote sensing imagery object detection framework named Double Multi-scale Feature Pyramid Network (DM-FPN) was proposed in this paper, which utilizes inherent multi-scale pyramidal features and combines the strong-semantic, low-resolution features and the weak-semantic, high-resolution features simultaneously. DM-FPN consists of a multi-scale region proposal network and a multi-scale object detection network, these two modules share convolutional layers and can be trained end-to-end. We proposed several multi-scale training strategies to increase the diversity of training data and overcome the size restrictions of the input images. We also proposed multi-scale inference and adaptive categorical non-maximum suppression (ACNMS) strategies to promote detection performance, especially for small and dense objects. Extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations on large-scale DOTA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which achieves mean average precision (mAP) value of 0.7927 on validation dataset and the best mAP value of 0.793 on testing dataset.},

ABSTRACT = {With the development of access technologies and artificial intelligence, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed into channel accessing and anti-jamming. Assuming the jamming modes are sweeping, comb, dynamic and statistic, the DRL-based method through training can almost perfectly avoid jamming signal and communicate successfully. Instead, in this paper, from the perspective of jammers, we investigate the performance of a DRL-based anti-jamming method. First of all, we design an intelligent jamming method based on reinforcement learning to combat the DRL-based user. Then, we theoretically analyze the condition when the DRL-based anti-jamming algorithm cannot converge, and provide the proof. Finally, in order to investigate the performance of DRL-based method, various scenarios where users with different communicating modes combat jammers with different jamming modes are compared. As the simulation results show, the theoretical analysis is verified, and the proposed RL-based jamming can effectively restrict the performance of DRL-based anti-jamming method.},

ABSTRACT = {Assisted driving and unmanned driving have been areas of focus for both industry and academia. Front-vehicle detection technology, a key component of both types of driving, has also attracted great interest from researchers. In this paper, to achieve front-vehicle detection in unmanned or assisted driving, a vision-based, efficient, and fast front-vehicle detection method based on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the front vehicle is proposed. First, a method to extract the motion vector of the front vehicle is put forward based on Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) and the spatial position constraint. Then, by analyzing the differences between the motion vectors of the vehicle and those of the background, feature points of the vehicle are extracted. Finally, a feature-point clustering method based on a combination of temporal and spatial characteristics are applied to realize front-vehicle detection. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified using a large number of videos.},

ABSTRACT = {To facilitate connectivity to the internet, the easiest way to establish communication infrastructure in areas affected by natural disaster and in remote locations with intermittent cellular services and/or lack of Wi-Fi coverage is to deploy an end-to-end connection over Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). However, the potentials of MANETs are yet to be fully realized as existing MANETs routing protocols still suffer some major technical drawback in the areas of mobility, link quality, and battery constraint of mobile nodes between the overlay connections. To address these problems, a routing scheme named Mobility, Residual energy and Link quality Aware Multipath (MRLAM) is proposed for routing in MANETs. The proposed scheme makes routing decisions by determining the optimal route with energy efficient nodes to maintain the stability, reliability, and lifetime of the network over a sustained period of time. The MRLAM scheme uses a Q-Learning algorithm for the selection of optimal intermediate nodes based on the available status of energy level, mobility, and link quality parameters, and then provides positive and negative reward values accordingly. The proposed routing scheme reduces energy cost by 33% and 23%, end to end delay by 15% and 10%, packet loss ratio by 30.76% and 24.59%, and convergence time by 16.49% and 11.34% approximately, compared with other well-known routing schemes such as Multipath Optimized Link State Routing protocol (MP-OLSR) and MP-OLSRv2, respectively. Overall, the acquired results indicate that the proposed MRLAM routing scheme significantly improves the overall performance of the network.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial fish-like robot is an important branch of underwater robot research. At present, most of fish-like robot research focuses on single robot mechanism behavior, some research pays attention to the influence of the hydro-environment on robot crowds but does not reach a unified conclusion on the efficiency of fish-like robots swarm. In this work, the fish-like robots swarm is studied by numerical simulation. Four different formations, including the tandem, the phalanx, the diamond, and the rectangle are conducted by changing the spacing between fishes. The results show that at close spacing, the fish in the back can obtain a large wake from the front fish, but suffers large lateral power loss from the lateral fish. On the contrary, when the spacing is large, both the wake and pressure caused by the front and side fishes become small. In terms of the average swimming efficiency of fish swarms, we find that when the fish spacing is less than     1.25 L     (L is the length of the fish body), the tandem swarm is the best choice. When the spacing is     1.25 L    , the tandem, diamond and rectangle swarms have similar efficiency. When the spacing is larger than     1.25 L    , the rectangle swarm is more efficient than other formations. The findings will provide significant guidance for the control of fish-like robots swarm.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have a wide range of applications, such as in the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G communications, and so forth. However, the communications between UAVs and UAVs to ground control stations mainly use radio channels, and therefore these communications are vulnerable to cyberattacks. With the advent of software-defined radio (SDR), smart attacks that can flexibly select attack strategies according to the defender&rsquo;s state information are gradually attracting the attention of researchers and potential attackers of UAV networks. The smart attack can even induce the defender to take a specific defense strategy, causing even greater damage. Inspired by symmetrical thinking, a solution using a software-defined network (SDN) to combat software-defined radio was proposed. We propose a network architecture which uses dual controllers, including a UAV flight controller and SDN controller, to achieve collaborative decision-making. Built on the top of the SDN, the state information of the whole network converges quickly and is fitted to an environment model used to develop an improved Dyna-Q-based reinforcement learning algorithm. The improved algorithm integrates the power allocation and track planning of UAVs into a unified action space. The simulation data showed that the proposed communication solution can effectively avoid smart jamming attacks and has faster learning efficiency and higher convergence performance than the compared algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Heterogeneous networks (HetNets), consisting of macro-cells and overlaying pico-cells, have been recognized as a promising paradigm to support the exponential growth of data traffic demands and high network energy efficiency (EE). However, for two-tier heterogeneous architecture deployment of HetNets, the inter-tier interference will be challenging. Time domain further-enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (FeICIC) proposed in 3GPP Release-11 becomes necessary to mitigate the inter-tier interference by applying low power almost blank subframe (ABS) scheme. Therefore, for HetNets deployment in reality, the pico-cell range expansion (CRE) bias, the power of ABS and the density of pico base stations (PBSs) are three important factors for the network EE improvement. Aiming to improve the network EE, the above three factors are jointly considered in this paper. In particular, we first derive the closed-form expression of the network EE as a function of pico CRE bias, power reduction factor of low power ABS and PBS density based on stochastic geometry model. Then, the approximate relationship between pico CRE bias and power reduction factor is deduced, followed by a linear search algorithm to get the near-optimal pico CRE bias and power reduction factor together at a given PBS density. Next, a linear search algorithm is further proposed to optimize PBS density based on fixed pico CRE bias and power reduction factor. Due to the fact that the above pico CRE bias and power reduction factor optimization and PBS density optimization are optimized separately, a heuristic algorithm is further proposed to optimize pico CRE bias, power reduction factor and PBS density jointly to achieve global network EE maximization. Numerical simulation results show that our proposed heuristic algorithm can significantly enhance the network EE while incurring low computational complexity.},

ABSTRACT = {Addressing the problems of visual surveillance for anti-UAV, a new flying small target detection method is proposed based on Gaussian mixture background modeling in a compressive sensing domain and low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition of local image. First of all, images captured by stationary visual sensors are broken into patches and the candidate patches which perhaps contain targets are identified by using a Gaussian mixture background model in a compressive sensing domain. Subsequently, the candidate patches within a finite time period are separated into background images and target images by low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition. Finally, flying small target detection is achieved over separated target images by threshold segmentation. The experiment results using visible and infrared image sequences of flying UAV demonstrate that the proposed methods have effective detection performance and outperform the baseline methods in precision and recall evaluation.},

ABSTRACT = {Quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles continue to play important roles in several applications and the improvement of their control performance has been explored in a great number of studies. In this paper, we present an altitude control algorithm for quadcopters that consists of a combination of nonlinear and linear controllers. The smooth transition between the nonlinear and linear modes are guaranteed through controller gains that are obtained based on mathematical analysis. The proposed controller takes advantage and addresses some known shortcomings of the conventional proportional&ndash;integral&ndash;derivative control method. The algorithm is simple to implement, and we prove its stability through the Lyapunov theory. By prescribing certain flight conditions, we use numerical simulations to compare the control performance of our control method to that of a conventional proportional&ndash;derivative&ndash;integral approach. Furthermore, we use a DJI-F450 drone equipped with a laser ranging sensor as the experimental quadcopter platform to evaluate the performance of our new controller in real flight conditions. Numerical simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {In cognitive electronic warfare, when a typical combat vehicle, such as an unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV), uses radar sensors to explore an unknown space, the target-searching fails due to an inefficient servoing/tracking system. Thus, to solve this problem, we developed an autonomous reasoning search method that can generate efficient decision-making actions and guide the UCAV as early as possible to the target area. For high-dimensional continuous action space, the UCAV&rsquo;s maneuvering strategies are subject to certain physical constraints. We first record the path histories of the UCAV as a sample set of supervised experiments and then construct a grid cell network using long short-term memory (LSTM) to generate a new displacement prediction to replace the target location estimation. Finally, we enable a variety of continuous-control-based deep reinforcement learning algorithms to output optimal/sub-optimal decision-making actions. All these tasks are performed in a three-dimensional target-searching simulator, i.e., the Explorer game. Please note that we use the behavior angle (BHA) for the first time as the main factor of the reward-shaping of the deep reinforcement learning framework and successfully make the trained UCAV achieve a 99.96% target destruction rate, i.e., the game win rate, in a 0.1 s operating cycle.},

ABSTRACT = {The control issue of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) is very challenging since the precise mathematical model of AUV is hard to establish due to its strong coupling and time-varying features. Meanwhile, AUV movement is easily interfered with by ocean currents and waves, causing anti-interference performance of traditional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control to be unsatisfactory. Aiming to solve those problems, an algorithm of fuzzy optimized model-free adaptive control (MFAC) based on auto-disturbance rejection control (ADRC) was proposed and used in AUV heading control. The MFAC is used to overcome the difficulty with establishing a precise mathematical model, and the ADRC is introduced to handle the interference of currents and waves. In this paper, MFAC and ADRC are combined. First, the MFAC is performed based only on the I/O data of the controlled object, which is simple to implement with low calculation complexity and strong robustness. Then, a tracking differentiator (TD) is employed to track the input signal to overcome the antinomy of rapidity and hypertonicity in MFAC. After that, an extended-state observer (ESO) is added to control the variables of MFAC to estimate all the disturbances, which can greatly improve the anti-interference ability of the system. Due to the complexity and diversity of the marine environment, a fuzzy optimized MFAC based on ADRC is proposed to improve the adaptability of AUV to the marine environment. Simulations and experiments were carried out to verify the control effect of this algorithm in complex sea conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are capable of serving as a data collector for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we investigate an energy-effective data gathering approach in UAV-aided WSNs, where each sensor node (SN) dynamically chooses the transmission modes, i.e., (1) waiting, (2) conventional sink node transmission, (3) uploading to UAV, to transmit sensory data within a given time. By jointly considering the SN&rsquo;s transmission policy and UAV trajectory optimization, we aim to minimize the transmission energy consumption of the SNs and ensure all sensory data completed collected within the given time. We take a two-step iterative approach and decouple the SN&rsquo;s transmission design and UAV trajectory optimization process. First, we design the optimal SNs transmission mode policy with preplanned UAV trajectory. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal transmission policy. Then, with the fixed transmission policy, we optimize the UAV&rsquo;s trajectory from the preplanned trace with recursive random search (RRS) algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant energy savings gain over the benchmark schemes.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper studies the problem of generating cooperative feasible paths for formation rendezvous of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Cooperative path-planning for multi-UAV formation rendezvous is mostly a complicated multi-objective optimization problem with many coupled constraints. In order to satisfy the kinematic constraints, i.e., the maximum curvature constraint and the requirement of continuous curvature of the UAV path, the Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curve is adopted as the parameterized path because of its curvature continuity and rational intrinsic properties. Inspired by the co-evolutionary theory, a distributed cooperative particle swarm optimization (DCPSO) algorithm with an elite keeping strategy is proposed to generate a flyable and safe path for each UAV. This proposed algorithm can meet the kinematic constraints of UAVs and the cooperation requirements among UAVs. Meanwhile, the optimal or sub-optimal paths can be obtained. Finally, numerical simulations in 2-D and 3-D environments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and stability of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the paths generated by the proposed DCPSO can not only meet the kinematic constraints of UAVs and safety requirements, but also achieve the simultaneous arrival and collision avoidance between UAVs for formation rendezvous. Compared with the cooperative co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CCGA), the proposed DCPSO has better stability and a higher searching success rate.},

ABSTRACT = {Small-scaled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) emerge as ideal image acquisition platforms due to their high maneuverability even in complex and tightly built environments. The acquired images can be utilized to generate high-quality 3D models using current multi-view stereo approaches. However, the quality of the resulting 3D model highly depends on the preceding flight plan which still requires human expert knowledge, especially in complex urban and hazardous environments. In terms of safe flight plans, practical considerations often define prohibited and restricted airspaces to be accessed with the vehicle. We propose a 3D UAV path planning framework designed for detailed and complete small-scaled 3D reconstructions considering the semantic properties of the environment allowing for user-specified restrictions on the airspace. The generated trajectories account for the desired model resolution and the demands on a successful photogrammetric reconstruction. We exploit semantics from an initial flight to extract the target object and to define restricted and prohibited airspaces which have to be avoided during the path planning process to ensure a safe and short UAV path, while still aiming to maximize the object reconstruction quality. The path planning problem is formulated as an orienteering problem and solved via discrete optimization exploiting submodularity and photogrammetrical relevant heuristics. An evaluation of our method on a customized synthetic scene and on outdoor experiments suggests the real-world capability of our methodology by providing feasible, short and safe flight plans for the generation of detailed 3D reconstruction models.},

Today, the use of multiple UAVs and UAV swarms are attracting more interest from the research community, leading to the exploration of topics such as UAV cooperation, multi-drone autonomous navigation, etc. In this work, we propose two approaches for UAV pursuit-evasion. The first approach uses deep reinforcement learning to predict the actions to apply to the follower UAV to keep track of the target UAV. The second approach uses a deep object detector and a search area proposal (SAP) to predict the position of the target UAV in the next frame for tracking purposes. The two approaches are promising and lead to a higher tracking accuracy with an intersection over union (IoU) above the selected threshold. We also show that the deep SAP-based approach improves the detection of distant objects that cover small areas in the image. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated in outdoor tracking scenarios using real UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {Feature tracking in image collections significantly affects the efficiency and accuracy of Structure from Motion (SFM). Insufficient correspondences may result in disconnected structures and incomplete components, while the redundant correspondences containing incorrect ones may yield to folded and superimposed structures. In this paper, we present a Superpixel-based feature tracking method for structure from motion. In the proposed method, we first propose to use a joint approach to detect local keypoints and compute descriptors. Second, the superpixel-based approach is used to generate labels for the input image. Third, we combine the Speed Up Robust Feature and binary test in the generated label regions to produce a set of combined descriptors for the detected keypoints. Fourth, the locality-sensitive hash (LSH)-based k nearest neighboring matching (KNN) is utilized to produce feature correspondences, and then the ratio test approach is used to remove outliers from the previous matching collection. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on several challenging benchmarking datasets including highly ambiguous and duplicated scenes. Experimental results show that the proposed method gets better performances with respect to the state of the art methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Public participation plays an important role of traffic planning and management, but it is a great challenge to collect and analyze public opinions for traffic problems on a large scale under traditional methods. Traffic management departments should appropriately adopt public opinions in order to formulate scientific and reasonable regulations and policies. At present, while increasing degree of public participation, data collection and processing should be accelerated to make up for the shortcomings of traditional planning. This paper focuses on text analysis using large data with temporal and spatial attributes of social network platform. Web crawler technology is used to obtain traffic-related text in mainstream social platforms. After basic treatment, the emotional tendency of the text is analyzed. Then, based on the probabilistic topic modeling (latent Dirichlet allocation model), the main opinions of the public are extracted, and the spatial and temporal characteristics of the data are summarized. Taking Nanjing Metro as an example, the existing problems are summarized from the public opinions and improvement measures are put forward, which proves the feasibility of providing technical support for public participation in public transport with social media big data.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes the development of a convolutional neural network for the control of a home monitoring robot (FumeBot). The robot is fitted with a Raspberry Pi for on board control and a Raspberry Pi camera is used as the data feed for the neural network. A wireless connection between the robot and a graphical user interface running on a laptop allows for the diagnostics and development of the neural network. The neural network, running on the laptop, was trained using a supervised training method. The robot was put through a series of obstacle courses to test its robustness, with the tests demonstrating that the controller has learned to navigate the obstacles to a reasonable level. The main problem identified in this work was that the neural controller did not have memory of past actions it took and a past state of the world resulting in obstacle collisions. Options to rectify this issue are suggested.},

ABSTRACT = {Scan matching is an important task, solved in the context of many high-level problems including pose estimation, indoor localization, simultaneous localization and mapping and others. Methods that are accurate and adaptive and at the same time computationally efficient are required to enable location-based services in autonomous mobile devices. Such devices usually have a wide range of high-resolution sensors but only a limited processing power and constrained energy supply. This work introduces a novel high-level scan matching strategy that uses a combination of two advanced algorithms recently used in this field: cross-correlation and differential evolution. The cross-correlation between two laser range scans is used as an efficient measure of scan alignment and the differential evolution algorithm is used to search for the parameters of a transformation that aligns the scans. The proposed method was experimentally validated and showed good ability to match laser range scans taken shortly after each other and an excellent ability to match laser range scans taken with longer time intervals between them.},

ABSTRACT = {Video streaming has become a kind of main information carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Unlike single transmission, when a cluster of UAVs execute the real-time video shooting and uploading mission, the insufficiency of wireless channel resources will lead to bandwidth competition among them and the competition will bring bad watching experience to the audience. Therefore, how to allocate uplink bandwidth reasonably in the cluster has become a crucial problem. In this paper, an intelligent and distributed allocation mechanism is designed for improving users&rsquo; video viewing satisfication. Each UAV in a cluster can independently adjust and select its video encoding rate so as to achieve flexible uplink allocation. This choice relies neither on the existence of the central node, nor on the large amount of information interaction between UAVs. Firstly, in order to distinguish video service from ordinary data, a utility function for the overall Quality of Experience (QoE) is proposed. Then, a potential game model is built around the problem. By a distributed self-learning algorithm with low complexity, all UAVs can iteratively update their own bandwidth strategy in a short time until equilibria, thus achieving the total quality optimization of all videos. Numeric simulation results indicate, after a few iterations, that the algorithm converges to a set of correlation equilibria. This mechanism not only solves the uplink allocation problem of video streaming in UAV cluster, but also guarantees the wireless resource providers in distinguishing and ensuring network service quality.},

ABSTRACT = {When examining density control learning methods for wireless sensor nodes, control time is often long and power consumption is usually very high. This paper proposes a node density control learning method for wireless sensor nodes and applies it to an environment based on Internet of Things architectures. Firstly, the characteristics of wireless sensors networks and the structure of mobile nodes are analyzed. Combined with the flexibility of wireless sensor networks and the degree of freedom of real-time processing and configuration of field programmable gate array (FPGA) data, a one-step transition probability matrix is introduced. In addition, the probability of arrival of signals between any pair of mobile nodes is also studied and calculated. Finally, the probability of signal connection between mobile nodes is close to 1, approximating the minimum node density at T. We simulate using a fully connected network identifying a worst-case test environment. Detailed experimental results show that our novel proposed method has shorter completion time and lower power consumption than previous attempts. We achieve high node density control as well at close to 90%.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) and Blockchain-based delivery framework, called DeliveryCoin, for drone-delivered services. The DeliveryCoin framework consists of four phases, including system initialization phase, creating the block, updating the blockchain, and intrusion detection phase. To achieve privacy-preservation, the DeliveryCoin framework employs hash functions and short signatures without random oracles and the Strong Diffie&ndash;Hellman (SDH) assumption in bilinear groups. To achieve consensus inside the blockchain-based delivery platform, we introduce a UAV-aided forwarding mechanism, named pBFTF. We also propose an IDS system in each macro eNB (5G) for detecting self-driving network attacks as well as false transactions between self-driving nodes. Furthermore, extensive simulations are conducted, and results confirm the efficiency of our proposed DeliveryCoin framework in terms of latency of blockchain consensus and accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {With the fast development of commercial unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, there are increasing research interests on UAV communications. In this work, the mobility and deployment flexibility of UAVs are exploited to form a buffer-aided relaying system assisting terrestrial communication that is blocked. Optimal UAV trajectory design of the UAV-enabled mobile relaying system with a randomly located eavesdropper is investigated from the physical-layer security perspective to improve the overall secrecy rate. Based on the mobility of the UAV relay, a wireless channel model that changes with the trajectory and is exploited for improved secrecy is established. The secrecy rate is maximized by optimizing the discretized trajectory anchor points based on the information causality and UAV mobility constraints. However, the problem is non-convex and therefore difficult to solve. To make the problem tractable, we alternatively optimize the increments of the trajectory anchor points iteratively in a two-dimensional space and decompose the problem into progressive convex approximate problems through the iterative procedure. Convergence of the proposed iterative trajectory optimization technique is proved analytically by the squeeze principle. Simulation results show that finding the optimal trajectory by iteratively updating the displacements is effective and fast converging. It is also shown by the simulation results that the distribution of the eavesdropper location influences the security performance of the system. Specifically, an eavesdropper further away from the destination is beneficial to the system&rsquo;s overall secrecy rate. Furthermore, it is observed that eavesdropper being further away from the destination also results in shorter trajectories, which implies it being energy-efficient as well.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a primary role in a plethora of technical and scientific fields owing to their wide range of applications. In particular, the provision of emergency services during the occurrence of a crisis event is a vital application domain where such aerial robots can contribute, sending out valuable assistance to both distressed humans and rescue teams. Bearing in mind that time constraints constitute a crucial parameter in search and rescue (SAR) missions, the punctual and precise detection of humans in peril is of paramount importance. The paper in hand deals with real-time human detection onboard a fully autonomous rescue UAV. Using deep learning techniques, the implemented embedded system was capable of detecting open water swimmers. This allowed the UAV to provide assistance accurately in a fully unsupervised manner, thus enhancing first responder operational capabilities. The novelty of the proposed system is the combination of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) techniques and computer vision algorithms for both precise human detection and rescue apparatus release. Details about hardware configuration as well as the system&rsquo;s performance evaluation are fully discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Railyards are one of the most challenging and complex workplace environments in any industry. Railyard workers are constantly surrounded by dangerous moving objects, in a noisy environment where distractions can easily result in accidents or casualties. Throughout the years, yards have been contributing 20&ndash;30% of the total accidents that happen in railroads. Monitoring the railyard workspace to keep personnel safe from falls, slips, being struck by large object, etc. and preventing fatal accidents can be particularly challenging due to the sheer number of factors involved, such as the need to protect a large geographical space, the inherent dynamicity of the situation workers find themselves in, the presence of heavy rolling stock, blind spots, uneven surfaces and a plethora of trip hazards, just to name a few. Since workers spend the majority of time outdoors, weather conditions also play an important role, i.e., snow, fog, rain, etc. Conventional sensor deployments in yards thus fail to consistently monitor this workspace. In this paper, the authors have identified these challenges and addressed them with a novel detection method using a multi-sensor approach. They have also proposed novel algorithms to detect, classify and remotely monitor Employees-on-Duty (EoDs) without hindering real-time decision-making of the EoD. In the proposed solution, the authors have used a fast spherical-to-rectilinear transform algorithm on fish-eye images to monitor a wide area and to address blindspots in visual monitoring, and employed Software-Defined RADAR (SDRADAR) to address the low-visibility problem. The sensors manage to monitor the workspace for 100 m with blind detection and classification. These algorithms have successfully maintained real-time processing delay of &le;0.1 s between consecutive frames for both SDRADAR and visual processing.},

ABSTRACT = {Small unmanned aircraft vehicles (SUAVs) or drones are very useful for visual detection and tracking due to their efficiency in capturing scenes. This paper addresses the detection and tracking of moving pedestrians with an SUAV. The detection step consists of frame subtraction, followed by thresholding, morphological filter, and false alarm reduction, taking into consideration the true size of targets. The center of the detected area is input to the next tracking stage. Interacting multiple model (IMM) filtering estimates the state of vectors and covariance matrices, using multiple modes of Kalman filtering. In the experiments, a dozen people and one car are captured by a stationary drone above the road. The Kalman filter and the IMM filter with two or three modes are compared in the accuracy of the state estimation. The root-mean squared errors (RMSE) of position and velocity are obtained for each target and show the good accuracy in detecting and tracking the target position&mdash;the average detection rate is 96.5%. When the two-mode IMM filter is used, the minimum average position and velocity RMSE obtained are around 0.8 m and 0.59 m/s, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The millimeter-wave (mmWave) antenna array plays an important role in the excellent performance of wireless sensors networks (WSN) or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters. However, the array elements are easily damaged in its harsh working environment but hard to be repaired or exchanged timely, resulting in a serious decline in the beamforming performance. Thus, accurate self-diagnosis of the failed elements is of great importance. In previous studies, there are still significant difficulties for large-scale arrays under extremely low SNR. In this paper, a diagnosis algorithm with low complexity and high reliability for the failed elements is proposed, which is based on a joint decision of communication signal and sensing echoes. Compared with the previous studies, the complexity of the algorithm is reduced by the construction of low-dimensional feature vectors for classification, the decoupling of the degree of arrival (DOA) estimation and the failed pattern diagnosis, with the help of the sub-array division. Simulation results show that, under an ultra-low SNR of &minus;12.5 dB for communication signals and &minus;16 dB for sensing echoes, an accurate self-diagnosis with a block error rate lower than 8% can be realized. The study in this paper will effectively promote the long-term and reliable operation of the mmWave antenna array in WSN, UAV clusters and other similar fields.},

ABSTRACT = {Semantic segmentation in high-resolution remote-sensing (RS) images is a fundamental task for RS-based urban understanding and planning. However, various types of artificial objects in urban areas make this task quite challenging. Recently, the use of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) with multiscale information fusion has demonstrated great potential in enhancing performance. Technically, however, existing fusions are usually implemented by summing or concatenating feature maps in a straightforward way. Seldom do works consider the spatial importance for global-to-local context-information aggregation. This paper proposes a Learnable-Gated CNN (L-GCNN) to address this issue. Methodologically, the Taylor expression of the information-entropy function is first parameterized to design the gate function, which is employed to generate pixelwise weights for coarse-to-fine refinement in the L-GCNN. Accordingly, a Parameterized Gate Module (PGM) was designed to achieve this goal. Then, the single PGM and its densely connected extension were embedded into different levels of the encoder in the L-GCNN to help identify the discriminative feature maps at different scales. With the above designs, the L-GCNN is finally organized as a self-cascaded end-to-end architecture that is able to sequentially aggregate context information for fine segmentation. The proposed model was evaluated on two public challenging benchmarks, the ISPRS 2Dsemantic segmentation challenge Potsdam dataset and the Massachusetts building dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibited significant improvement compared with several related segmentation networks, including the FCN, SegNet, RefineNet, PSPNet, DeepLab and GSN.For example, on the Potsdam dataset, our method achieved a 93.65%     F 1     score and 88.06%     I o U     score for the segmentation of tiny cars in high-resolution RS images. As a conclusion, the proposed model showed potential for object segmentation from the RS images of buildings, impervious surfaces, low vegetation, trees and cars in urban settings, which largely varies in size and have confusing appearances.},

ABSTRACT = {How to generate a safe and high-quality path for a moving robot is a classical issue. The relative solution is also suitable for computer games and animation. To make the problem simpler, it is common to discretize the continuous planning space into grids, with blocked cells to represent obstacles. However, grid-based path-finding algorithms usually cannot find the truly shortest path because the extending paths are constrained to grid edges. Meanwhile, Line-of-Sight Check (LoS-Check) is an efficient operation to find the shorter any-angle path by relaxing the constraint of grid edges, which has been successfully used in Theta*. Through reducing the number of LoS-Check operations in Theta*, a variant version called LazyTheta* speeds up the planning especially in the 3D environment. We propose Late LoS-Check A* (LLA*) to further reduce the LoS-Check amount. It uses the structure of the prioritized trees to partially update the gvalues of different successors that share the same parent (i.e., the parent of the current vertex waiting to be extended). The sufficient experiments on various benchmark maps show that LLA* costs less execution time than Lazy Theta* while generating shorter paths. If we just delay the LoS-Check, the path planned by LLA* will hardly be shorter than that of Lazy Theta*. Therefore, the key of LLA* is the discriminatory strategy, and we empirically explain the reason why both the path length and execution time of LLA* are shorter than those of Lazy Theta*.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a power control method is proposed for a buffer-aided relay node (RN) to enhance the energy efficiency of the RN system. By virtue of a buffer, the RN can reserve the data at the buffer when the the channel gain between an RN and a destination node (DN) is weaker than that between SN and RN. The RN then opportunistically forward the reserved data in the buffer according to channel condition between the RN and the DN. By exploiting the buffer, RN reduces transmit power when it reduces the transmit data rate and reserve the data in the buffer. Therefore, without any total throughput reduction, the power consumption of RN can be reduced, resulting in the energy efficiency (EE) improvement of the RN system. Furthermore, for the power control, we devise a simple power control method based on a two-dimensional surface fitting model of an optimal transmit power of RN. The proposed RN power control method is readily and locally implementable at the RN, and it can significantly improve EE of the RN compared to the fixed power control method and the spectral efficiency based method as verified by the rigorous numerical results.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly growing in popularity. Initially introduced for military purposes, over the past few years, UAVs and related technologies have successfully transitioned to a whole new range of civilian applications such as delivery, logistics, surveillance, entertainment, and so forth. They have opened new possibilities such as allowing operation in otherwise difficult or hazardous areas, for instance. For all applications, one foremost concern is the selection of the paths and trajectories of UAVs, and at the same time, UAVs control comes with many challenges, as they have limited energy, limited load capacity and are vulnerable to difficult weather conditions. Generally, efficiently operating a drone can be mathematically formalized as a path optimization problem under some constraints. This shares some commonalities with similar problems that have been extensively studied in the context of urban vehicles and it is only natural that the recent literature has extended the latter to fit aerial vehicle constraints. The knowledge of such problems, their formulation, the resolution methods proposed—through the variants induced specifically by UAVs features—are of interest for practitioners for any UAV application. Hence, in this study, we propose a review of existing literature devoted to such UAV path optimization problems, focusing specifically on the sub-class of problems that consider the mobility on a macroscopic scale. These are related to the two existing general classic ones—the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. We analyze the recent literature that adapted the problems to the UAV context, provide an extensive classification and taxonomy of their problems and their formulation and also give a synthetic overview of the resolution techniques, performance metrics and obtained numerical results.},

ABSTRACT = {Modern Public Safety Networks (PSNs) are assisted by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to provide a resilient communication paradigm during catastrophic events. In this context, we propose a distributed user-centric risk-aware resource management framework in UAV-assisted PSNs supported by both a static UAV and a mobile UAV. The mobile UAV is entitled to a larger portion of the available spectrum due to its capability and flexibility to re-position itself, and therefore establish better communication channel conditions to the users, compared to the static UAV. However, the potential over-exploitation of the mobile UAV-based communication by the users may lead to the mobile UAV&rsquo;s failure to serve the users due to the increased levels of interference, consequently introducing risk in the user decisions. To capture this uncertainty, we follow the principles of Prospect Theory and design a user&rsquo;s prospect-theoretic utility function that reflects user&rsquo;s risk-aware behavior regarding its transmission power investment to the static and/or mobile UAV-based communication option. A non-cooperative game among the users is formulated, where each user determines its power investment strategy to the two available communication choices in order to maximize its expected prospect-theoretic utility. The existence and uniqueness of a Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) is proven and the convergence of the users&rsquo; strategies to it is shown. An iterative distributed and low-complexity algorithm is introduced to determine the PNE. The performance of the proposed user-centric risk-aware resource management framework in terms of users&rsquo; achievable data rate and spectrum utilization, is achieved via modeling and simulation. Furthermore, its superiority and benefits are demonstrated, by comparing its performance against other existing approaches with regards to UAV selection and spectrum utilization.},

ABSTRACT = {Reinforcement learning (RL) based techniques have been employed for the tracking and adaptive cruise control of a small-scale vehicle with the aim to transfer the obtained knowledge to a full-scale intelligent vehicle in the near future. Unlike most other control techniques, the purpose of this study is to seek a practical method that enables the vehicle, in the real environment and in real time, to learn the control behavior on its own while adapting to the changing circumstances. In this context, it is necessary to design an algorithm that symmetrically considers both time efficiency and accuracy. Meanwhile, in order to realize adaptive cruise control specifically, a set of symmetrical control actions consisting of steering angle and vehicle speed needs to be optimized simultaneously. In this paper, firstly, the experimental setup of the small-scale intelligent vehicle is introduced. Subsequently, three model-free RL algorithm are conducted to develop and finally form the strategy to keep the vehicle within its lanes at constant and top velocity. Furthermore, a model-based RL strategy is compared that incorporates learning from real experience and planning from simulated experience. Finally, a Q-learning based adaptive cruise control strategy is intermixed to the existing tracking control architecture to allow the vehicle slow-down in the curve and accelerate on straightaways. The experimental results show that the Q-learning and Sarsa (&lambda;) algorithms can achieve a better tracking behavior than the conventional Sarsa, and Q-learning outperform Sarsa (&lambda;) in terms of computational complexity. The Dyna-Q method performs similarly with the Sarsa (&lambda;) algorithms, but with a significant reduction of computational time. Compared with a fine-tuned proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller, the good-balanced Q-learning is seen to perform better and it can also be easily applied to control problems with over one control actions.},

ABSTRACT = {Natural-language-based scene understanding can enable heterogeneous robots to cooperate efficiently in large and unconstructed environments. However, studies on symbolic planning rarely consider the semantic knowledge acquisition problem associated with the surrounding environments. Further, recent developments in deep learning methods show outstanding performance for semantic scene understanding using natural language. In this paper, a cooperation framework that connects deep learning techniques and a symbolic planner for heterogeneous robots is proposed. The framework is largely composed of the scene understanding engine, planning agent, and knowledge engine. We employ neural networks for natural-language-based scene understanding to share environmental information among robots. We then generate a sequence of actions for each robot using a planning domain definition language planner. JENA-TDB is used for knowledge acquisition storage. The proposed method is validated using simulation results obtained from one unmanned aerial and three ground vehicles.},

ABSTRACT = {The optimal tracking problem is addressed in the robotics literature by using a variety of robust and adaptive control approaches. However, these schemes are associated with implementation limitations such as applicability in uncertain dynamical environments with complete or partial model-based control structures, complexity and integrity in discrete-time environments, and scalability in complex coupled dynamical systems. An online adaptive learning mechanism is developed to tackle the above limitations and provide a generalized solution platform for a class of tracking control problems. This scheme minimizes the tracking errors and optimizes the overall dynamical behavior using simultaneous linear feedback control strategies. Reinforcement learning approaches based on value iteration processes are adopted to solve the underlying Bellman optimality equations. The resulting control strategies are updated in real time in an interactive manner without requiring any information about the dynamics of the underlying systems. Means of adaptive critics are employed to approximate the optimal solving value functions and the associated control strategies in real time. The proposed adaptive tracking mechanism is illustrated in simulation to control a flexible wing aircraft under uncertain aerodynamic learning environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, model predictive control (MPC) is increasingly applied to path tracking of mobile devices, such as mobile robots. The characteristics of these MPC-based controllers are not identical due to the different approaches taken during design. According to the differences in the prediction models, we believe that the existing MPC-based path tracking controllers can be divided into four categories. We named them linear model predictive control (LMPC), linear error model predictive control (LEMPC), nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), and nonlinear error model predictive control (NEMPC). Subsequently, we built these four controllers for the same mobile robot and compared them. By comparison, we got some conclusions. The real-time performance of LMPC and LEMPC is good, but they are less robust to reference paths and positioning errors. NMPC performs well when the reference velocity is high and the radius of the reference path is small. It is also robust to positioning errors. However, the real-time performance of NMPC is slightly worse. NEMPC has many disadvantages. Like LMPC and LEMPC, it performs poorly when the reference velocity is high and the radius of the reference path is small. Its real-time performance is also not good enough.},

ABSTRACT = {The current autonomous navigation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) heavily depends on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). However, in challenging environments, such as deep urban areas, GNSS signals can be easily interrupted, so that UAS may lose navigation capability at any instant. For urban positioning and navigation, Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been considered a promising signal of opportunity due to its dense network in urban areas, and there has recently been great advancement in LTE positioning technology. However, the current LTE positioning accuracy is found to be insufficient for safe UAS navigation in deep urban areas. This paper evaluates the positioning performance of the current network of LTE base stations in a selected deep urban area and investigates the effectiveness of LTE augmentations using dedicated short range communication (DSRC) transceivers through the optimization of the ground LTE/DSRC network and cooperative positioning among UAS. The analysis results based on simulation using an urban canyon model and signal line of sight propagations show that the addition of four or five DSRC transceivers to the existing LTE base station network could provide better than 4&ndash;6 m horizontal positioning accuracy (95%) in the selected urban canyon at a position of 150 ft above the ground, while a dense LTE network alone may result in a 15&ndash;20 m horizontal positioning error. Additionally, the simulation results of cooperative positioning with inter-UAS ranging measurements in the DSRC augmented LTE network were shown to provide horizontal positioning accuracy better than 1 m in most flight space, assuming negligible time-synchronization errors in inter-UAS ranging measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {Interference alignment (IA) is an innovative wireless transmission strategy that has shown to be a promising technique for achieving optimal capacity scaling of a multiuser interference channel at asymptotically high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Transmitters exploit the availability of multiple signaling dimensions in order to align their mutual interference at the receivers. Most of the research has focused on developing algorithms for determining alignment solutions as well as proving interference alignment&rsquo;s theoretical ability to achieve the maximum degrees of freedom in a wireless network. Cognitive radio, on the other hand, is a technique used to improve the utilization of the radio spectrum by opportunistically sensing and accessing unused licensed frequency spectrum, without causing harmful interference to the licensed users. With the increased deployment of wireless services, the possibility of detecting unused frequency spectrum becomes diminished. Thus, the concept of introducing interference alignment in cognitive radio has become a very attractive proposition. This paper provides a survey of the implementation of IA in cognitive radio under the main research paradigms, along with a summary and analysis of results under each system model.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous grasping with an aerial manipulator in the applications of aerial transportation and manipulation is still a challenging problem because of the complex kinematics/dynamics and motion constraints of the coupled rotors-manipulator system. The paper develops a novel aerial manipulation system with a lightweight manipulator, an X8 coaxial octocopter and onboard visual tracking system. To implement autonomous grasping control, we develop a novel and efficient approach that includes trajectory planning, visual trajectory tracking and kinematic compensation. Trajectory planning for aerial grasping control is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, while motion constraints and collision avoidance are considered in the optimization. A genetic method is applied to obtain the optimal solution. A kinematic compensation-based visual trajectory tracking is introduced to address the coupled affection between the manipulator and octocopter, with the advantage of discarding the complex dynamic parameter calibration. Finally, several experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

ABSTRACT = {The performance achievable by using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for a large variety of civil and military applications, as well as the extent of applicable mission scenarios, can significantly benefit from the exploitation of formations of vehicles able to fly in a coordinated manner (swarms). In this respect, visual cameras represent a key instrument to enable coordination by giving each UAV the capability to visually monitor the other members of the formation. Hence, a related technological challenge is the development of robust solutions to detect and track cooperative targets through a sequence of frames. In this framework, this paper proposes an innovative approach to carry out this task based on deep learning. Specifically, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection system is integrated within an original processing architecture in which the machine-vision algorithms are aided by navigation hints available thanks to the cooperative nature of the formation. An experimental flight test campaign, involving formations of two multirotor UAVs, is conducted to collect a database of images suitable to assess the performance of the proposed approach. Results demonstrate high-level accuracy, and robustness against challenging conditions in terms of illumination, background and target-range variability.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a Next Best View (NBV) approach with a profiling stage and a novel utility function for 3D reconstruction using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is proposed. The proposed approach performs an initial scan in order to build a rough model of the structure that is later used to improve coverage completeness and reduce flight time. Then, a more thorough NBV process is initiated, utilizing the rough model in order to create a dense 3D reconstruction of the structure of interest. The proposed approach exploits the reflectional symmetry feature if it exists in the initial scan of the structure. The proposed NBV approach is implemented with a novel utility function, which consists of four main components: information theory, model density, traveled distance, and predictive measures based on symmetries in the structure. This system outperforms classic information gain approaches with a higher density, entropy reduction and coverage completeness. Simulated and real experiments were conducted and the results show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep- and reinforcement-learning techniques have increasingly required large sets of real data to achieve stable convergence and generalization, in the context of image-recognition, object-detection or motion-control strategies. On this subject, the research community lacks robust approaches to overcome unavailable real-world extensive data by means of realistic synthetic-information and domain-adaptation techniques. In this work, synthetic-learning strategies have been used for the vision-based autonomous following of a noncooperative multirotor. The complete maneuver was learned with synthetic images and high-dimensional low-level continuous robot states, with deep- and reinforcement-learning techniques for object detection and motion control, respectively. A novel motion-control strategy for object following is introduced where the camera gimbal movement is coupled with the multirotor motion during the multirotor following. Results confirm that our present framework can be used to deploy a vision-based task in real flight using synthetic data. It was extensively validated in both simulated and real-flight scenarios, providing proper results (following a multirotor up to 1.3 m/s in simulation and 0.3 m/s in real flights).},

ABSTRACT = {For a conventional narrow-band radar system, the detectable information of the target is limited, and it is difficult for the radar to accurately identify the target type. In particular, the classification probability will further decrease when part of the echo data is missed. By extracting the target features in time and frequency domains from multi-wave gates sparse echo data, this paper presents a classification algorithm in conventional narrow-band radar to identify three different types of aircraft target, i.e., helicopter, propeller and jet. Firstly, the classical sparse reconstruction algorithm is utilized to reconstruct the target frequency spectrum with single-wave gate sparse echo data. Then, the micro-Doppler effect caused by rotating parts of different targets is analyzed, and the micro-Doppler based features, such as amplitude deviation coefficient, time domain waveform entropy and frequency domain waveform entropy, are extracted from reconstructed echo data to identify targets. Thirdly, the target features extracted from multi-wave gates reconstructed echo data are weighted and fused to improve the accuracy of classification. Finally, the fused feature vectors are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) model for classification. By contrast with the conventional algorithm of aircraft target classification, the proposed algorithm can effectively process sparse echo data and achieve higher classification probability via weighted features fusion of multi-wave gates echo data. The experiments on synthetic data are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present a portable camera-based method for helping visually impaired (VI) people to recognize multiple objects in images. This method relies on a novel multi-label convolutional support vector machine (CSVM) network for coarse description of images. The core idea of CSVM is to use a set of linear SVMs as filter banks for feature map generation. During the training phase, the weights of the SVM filters are obtained using a forward-supervised learning strategy unlike the backpropagation algorithm used in standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To handle multi-label detection, we introduce a multi-branch CSVM architecture, where each branch will be used for detecting one object in the image. This architecture exploits the correlation between the objects present in the image by means of an opportune fusion mechanism of the intermediate outputs provided by the convolution layers of each branch. The high-level reasoning of the network is done through binary classification SVMs for predicting the presence/absence of objects in the image. The experiments obtained on two indoor datasets and one outdoor dataset acquired from a portable camera mounted on a lightweight shield worn by the user, and connected via a USB wire to a laptop processing unit are reported and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the last few years, several researchers have been developing protocols and applications in order to autonomously land unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, most of the proposed protocols rely on expensive equipment or do not satisfy the high precision needs of some UAV applications such as package retrieval and delivery or the compact landing of UAV swarms. Therefore, in this work, a solution for high precision landing based on the use of ArUco markers is presented. In the proposed solution, a UAV equipped with a low-cost camera is able to detect ArUco markers sized     56 &times; 56     cm from an altitude of up to 30 m. Once the marker is detected, the UAV changes its flight behavior in order to land on the exact position where the marker is located. The proposal was evaluated and validated using both the ArduSim simulation platform and real UAV flights. The results show an average offset of only 11 cm from the target position, which vastly improves the landing accuracy compared to the traditional GPS-based landing, which typically deviates from the intended target by 1 to 3 m.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper demonstrates the use of Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), together with Raspberry Pi3 B+ (RP3) as the brain (or the decision making engine), to develop a distributed wireless network in which nodes can communicate with other nodes independently and make decision autonomously. In other words, each USRP node (i.e., sensor) is embedded with separate processing units (i.e., RP3), which has not been investigated in the literature, so that each node can make independent decisions in a distributed manner. The proposed testbed in this paper is compared with the traditional distributed testbed, which has been widely used in the literature. In the traditional distributed testbed, there is a single processing unit (i.e., a personal computer) that makes decisions in a centralized manner, and each node (i.e., USRP) is connected to the processing unit via a switch. The single processing unit exchanges control messages with nodes via the switch, while the nodes exchange data packets among themselves using a wireless medium in a distributed manner. The main disadvantage of the traditional testbed is that, despite the network being distributed in nature, decisions are made in a centralized manner. Hence, the response delay of the control message exchange is always neglected. The use of such testbed is mainly due to the limited hardware and monetary cost to acquire a separate processing unit for each node. The experiment in our testbed has shown the increase of end-to-end delay and decrease of packet delivery ratio due to software and hardware delays. The observed multihop transmission is performed using device-to-device (D2D) communication, which has been enabled in 5G. Therefore, nodes can either communicate with other nodes via: (a) a direct communication with the base station at the macrocell, which helps to improve network performance; or (b) D2D that improve spectrum efficiency, whereby traffic is offloaded from macrocell to small cells. Our testbed is the first of its kind in this scale, and it uses RP3 as the distributed decision-making engine incorporated into the USRP/GNU radio platform. This work provides an insight to the development of a 5G network.},

ABSTRACT = {Flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a self-organizing wireless network that enables inexpensive, flexible, and easy-to-deploy flying nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to communicate among themselves in the absence of fixed network infrastructure. FANET is one of the emerging networks that has an extensive range of next-generation applications. Hence, FANET plays a significant role in achieving application-based goals. Routing enables the flying nodes to collaborate and coordinate among themselves and to establish routes to radio access infrastructure, particularly FANET base station (BS). With a longer route lifetime, the effects of link disconnections and network partitions reduce. Routing must cater to two main characteristics of FANETs that reduce the route lifetime. Firstly, the collaboration nature requires the flying nodes to exchange messages and to coordinate among themselves, causing high energy consumption. Secondly, the mobility pattern of the flying nodes is highly dynamic in a three-dimensional space and they may be spaced far apart, causing link disconnection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the limited research work of routing schemes in FANETs. Different aspects, including objectives, challenges, routing metrics, characteristics, and performance measures, are covered. Furthermore, we present open issues.},

ABSTRACT = {Collaboration between multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to establish a Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) is a growing trend since future applications claim for more autonomous and rapidly deployable systems. In this context, Software-Defined Networking FANET (SDN-FANET ) separates the control and data plane and provides network programmability, which considers a centralized controller to perform all FANET control functions based on global UAV context information, such as UAV positions, movement trajectories, residual energy, and others. However, control message dissemination in an SDN-FANET with low overhead and high performance is not a trivial task due to FANET particular characteristics, i.e., high mobility, failures in UAV to UAV communication, and short communication range. With this in mind, it is essential to predict UAV information for control message dissemination as well as consider hierarchical network architecture, reducing bandwidth consumption and signaling overhead. In this article, we present a Cluster-bAsed control Plane messages management in sOftware-defined flying ad-hoc NEtwork, called CAPONE. Based on UAV contextual information, the controller can predict UAV information without control message transmission. In addition, CAPONE divides the FANET into groups by computing the number of clusters using the Gap statistics method, which is input for a Fuzzy C-means method to determine the group leader and members. In this way, CAPONE reduces the bandwidth consumption and signaling overhead, while guaranteeing the control message delivering in FANET scenarios. Extensive simulations are used to show the gains of the CAPONE in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio, overhead, and energy compared to existing SDN-FANET architectures.},

ABSTRACT = {Information gathering (IG) algorithms aim to intelligently select the mobile robotic sensor actions required to efficiently obtain an accurate reconstruction of a physical process, such as an occupancy map, a wind field, or a magnetic field. Recently, multiple IG algorithms that benefit from multi-robot cooperation have been proposed in the literature. Most of these algorithms employ discretization of the state and action spaces, which makes them computationally intractable for robotic systems with complex dynamics. Moreover, they cannot deal with inter-robot restrictions such as collision avoidance or communication constraints. This paper presents a novel approach for multi-robot information gathering (MR-IG) that tackles the two aforementioned restrictions: (i) discretization of robot&rsquo;s state space, and (ii) dealing with inter-robot constraints. Here we propose an algorithm that employs: (i) an underlying model of the physical process of interest, (ii) sampling-based planners to plan paths in a continuous domain, and (iii) a distributed decision-making algorithm to enable multi-robot coordination. In particular, we use the max-sum algorithm for distributed decision-making by defining an information-theoretic utility function. This function maximizes IG, while fulfilling inter-robot communication and collision avoidance constraints. We validate our proposed approach in simulations, and in a field experiment where three quadcopters explore a simulated wind field. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability with respect to the number of robots of our approach.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to protect human lives and infrastructure, as well as to minimize the risk of damage, it is important to predict and respond to natural disasters in advance. However, currently, the standardized disaster response system in South Korea still needs further advancement, and the response phase systems need to be improved to ensure that they are properly equipped to cope with natural disasters. Existing studies on intelligent disaster management systems (IDSSs) in South Korea have focused only on storms, floods, and earthquakes, and they have not used past data. This research proposes a new conceptual framework of an IDSS for disaster management, with particular attention paid to wildfires and cold/heat waves. The IDSS uses big data collected from open application programming interface (API) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to help decision-makers make faster and more accurate decisions. In addition, a simple example of the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect fire in surveillance video has been developed, which can be used for automatic fire detection and provide an appropriate response. The system will also consider connecting to open source intelligence (OSINT) to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and develop more robust security policies than those currently in place to prevent cyber-attacks.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, deep learning-based visual object trackers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on several visual object tracking benchmarks. However, most tracking benchmarks are focused on ground level videos, whereas aerial tracking presents a new set of challenges. In this paper, we compare ten trackers based on deep learning techniques on four aerial datasets. We choose top performing trackers utilizing different approaches, specifically tracking by detection, discriminative correlation filters, Siamese networks and reinforcement learning. In our experiments, we use a subset of OTB2015 dataset with aerial style videos; the UAV123 dataset without synthetic sequences; the UAV20L dataset, which contains 20 long sequences; and DTB70 dataset as our benchmark datasets. We compare the advantages and disadvantages of different trackers in different tracking situations encountered in aerial data. Our findings indicate that the trackers perform significantly worse in aerial datasets compared to standard ground level videos. We attribute this effect to smaller target size, camera motion, significant camera rotation with respect to the target, out of view movement, and clutter in the form of occlusions or similar looking distractors near tracked object.},

ABSTRACT = {Based on the 3D Reduced Inertial Sensor System (3D-RISS) and the Machine Learning Enhanced Visual Data (MLEVD), an integrated vehicle navigation system is proposed in this paper. In demanding conditions such as outdoor satellite signal interference and indoor navigation, this work incorporates vehicle smooth navigation. Firstly, a landmark is set up and both of its size and position are accurately measured. Secondly, the image with the landmark information is captured quickly by using the machine learning. Thirdly, the template matching method and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) are then used to correct the errors of the Inertial Navigation System (INS), which employs the 3D-RISS to reduce the overall cost and ensuring the vehicular positioning accuracy simultaneously. Finally, both outdoor and indoor experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the 3D-RISS/MLEVD integrated navigation technology. Results reveal that the proposed method can effectively reduce the accumulated error of the INS with time while maintaining the positioning error within a few meters.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the problems such as low efficiency, difficulty in resolving local conflicts and lack of practical application scenarios, existing in the interaction model of multi-agent systems in a distributed environment, a multi-master multi-slave interaction model was designed based on the Stackelberg game, which is applied to the interaction game problem between the controller and the participant in the command and control process. Through optimizing the Stackelberg game model and multi-attribute decision-making, the multi-master, multi-slave, multi-agent system of the Stackelberg game was designed, and the closed loop problem under the Stackelberg game is solved for dimension reduction and optimal function value. Finally, through the numerical derivation simulation and the training results of related system data, the high efficiency and strong robustness of the model were verified from multiple perspectives, and this model algorithm was proved to be true and highly efficient.},

ABSTRACT = {Modern elevation-determining remote sensing technologies such as light-detection and ranging (LiDAR) produce a wealth of topographic information that is increasingly being used in a wide range of disciplines, including archaeology and geomorphology. However, automated methods for mapping topographic features have remained a significant challenge. Deep learning (DL) mask regional-convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNN), which provides context-based instance mapping, offers the potential to overcome many of the difficulties of previous approaches to topographic mapping. We therefore explore the application of Mask R-CNN to extract valley fill faces (VFFs), which are a product of mountaintop removal (MTR) coal mining in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States. LiDAR-derived slopeshades are provided as the only predictor variable in the model. Model generalization is evaluated by mapping multiple study sites outside the training data region. A range of assessment methods, including precision, recall, and F1 score, all based on VFF counts, as well as area- and a fuzzy area-based user&rsquo;s and producer&rsquo;s accuracy, indicate that the model was successful in mapping VFFs in new geographic regions, using elevation data derived from different LiDAR sensors. Precision, recall, and F1-score values were above 0.85 using VFF counts while user&rsquo;s and producer&rsquo;s accuracy were above 0.75 and 0.85 when using the area- and fuzzy area-based methods, respectively, when averaged across all study areas characterized with LiDAR data. Due to the limited availability of LiDAR data until relatively recently, we also assessed how well the model generalizes to terrain data created using photogrammetric methods that characterize past terrain conditions. Unfortunately, the model was not sufficiently general to allow successful mapping of VFFs using photogrammetrically-derived slopeshades, as all assessment metrics were lower than 0.60; however, this may partially be attributed to the quality of the photogrammetric data. The overall results suggest that the combination of Mask R-CNN and LiDAR has great potential for mapping anthropogenic and natural landscape features. To realize this vision, however, research on the mapping of other topographic features is needed, as well as the development of large topographic training datasets including a variety of features for calibrating and testing new methods.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, and robust deep deterministic policy gradient (Robust-DDPG), is proposed for developing a controller that allows robust flying of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in dynamic uncertain environments. This technique is applicable in many fields, such as penetration and remote surveillance. The learning-based controller is constructed with an actor-critic framework, and can perform a dual-channel continuous control (roll and speed) of the UAV. To overcome the fragility and volatility of original DDPG, three critical learning tricks are introduced in Robust-DDPG: (1) Delayed-learning trick, providing stable learnings, while facing dynamic environments; (2) adversarial attack trick, improving policy&rsquo;s adaptability to uncertain environments; (3) mixed exploration trick, enabling faster convergence of the model. The training experiments show great improvement in its convergence speed, convergence effect, and stability. The exploiting experiments demonstrate high efficiency in providing the UAV a shorter and smoother path. While, the generalization experiments verify its better adaptability to complicated, dynamic and uncertain environments, comparing to Deep Q Network (DQN) and DDPG algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {The autonomous landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on a marker is one of the most challenging problems in robotics. Many solutions have been proposed, with the best results achieved via customized geometric features and external sensors. This paper discusses for the first time the use of deep reinforcement learning as an end-to-end learning paradigm to find a policy for UAVs autonomous landing. Our method is based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm that splits a task into sequential sub-tasks, each one assigned to a Deep Q-Network (DQN), hence the name Sequential Deep Q-Network (SDQN). Each DQN in an SDQN is activated by an internal trigger, and it represents a component of a high-level control policy, which can navigate the UAV towards the marker. Different technical solutions have been implemented, for example combining vanilla and double DQNs, and the introduction of a partitioned buffer replay to address the problem of sample efficiency. One of the main contributions of this work consists in showing how an SDQN trained in a simulator via domain randomization, can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios of increasing complexity. The performance of SDQNs is comparable with a state-of-the-art algorithm and human pilots while being quantitatively better in noisy conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {The proper utilization of road information can improve the performance of relay-node selection methods. However, the existing schemes are only applicable to a specific road structure, and this limits their application in real-world scenarios where mostly more than one road structure exists in the Region of Interest (RoI), even in the communication range of a sender. In this paper, we propose an adaptive relay-node selection (ARNS) method based on the exponential partition to implement message broadcasting in complex scenarios. First, we improved a relay-node selection method in the curved road scenarios through the re-definition of the optimal position considering the distribution of the obstacles. Then, we proposed a criterion of classifying road structures based on their broadcast characteristics. Finally, ARNS is designed to adaptively apply the appropriate relay-node selection method based on the exponential partition in realistic scenarios. Simulation results on a real-world map show that the end-to-end broadcast delay of ARNS is reduced by at least 13.8% compared to the beacon-based relay-node selection method, and at least 14.0% compared to the trinary partitioned black-burst-based broadcast protocol (3P3B)-based relay-node selection method. The broadcast coverage is increased by 3.6&ndash;7% in curved road scenarios, with obstacles benefitting from the consideration of the distribution of obstacles. Moreover, ARNS achieves a higher and more stable packet delivery ratio (PDR) than existing methods profiting from the adaptive selection mechanism.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep Learning (DL) is the state-of-the-art machine learning technology, which shows superior performance in computer vision, bioinformatics, natural language processing, and other areas.

However, with the increase of dense scenes in reality, due to severe occlusions, and small size of objects, the analysis of dense scenes becomes particularly challenging. To overcome these problems, DL recently has been increasingly applied to dense scenes and has begun to be used in dense agricultural scenes. The purpose of this review is to explore the applications of DL for dense scenes analysis in agriculture. In order to better elaborate the topic, we first describe the types of dense scenes in agriculture, as well as the challenges. Next, we introduce various popular deep neural networks used in these dense scenes. Then, the applications of these structures in various agricultural tasks are comprehensively introduced in this review, including recognition and classification, detection, counting and yield estimation. Finally, the surveyed DL applications, limitations and the future work for analysis of dense images in agriculture are summarized.},

ABSTRACT = {A reactive three-dimensional maneuver strategy for a multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is proposed based on the collision cone approach to avoid potential collision with a single moving obstacle detected by an onboard sensor. A Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) system is assumed to be mounted on a hexacopter to obtain the obstacle information from the collected point clouds. The collision cone approach is enhanced to appropriately deal with the moving obstacle with the help of a Kalman filter. The filter estimates the position, velocity, and acceleration of the obstacle by using the LiDAR data as the associated measurement. The obstacle state estimate is utilized to predict the future trajectories of the moving obstacle. The collision detection and obstacle avoidance maneuver decisions are made considering the predicted trajectory of the obstacle. Numerical simulations, including a Monte Carlo campaign, are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed collision avoidance algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {Perfect channel state information (CSI) is required in most of the classical physical-layer security techniques, while it is difficult to obtain the ideal CSI due to the time-varying wireless fading channel. Although imperfect CSI has a great impact on the security of MIMO communications, deep learning is becoming a promising solution to handle the negative effect of imperfect CSI. In this work, we propose two types of deep learning-based secure MIMO detectors for heterogeneous networks, where the macro base station (BS) chooses the null-space eigenvectors to prevent information leakage to the femto BS. Thus, the bit error rate of the associated user is adopted as the metric to evaluate the system performance. With the help of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the macro BS obtains the refined version from the imperfect CSI. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed algorithms. The impacts of system parameters, such as the correlation factor of imperfect CSI, the normalized doppler frequency, the number of antennas is investigated in different setup scenarios. The results show that considerable performance gains can be obtained from the deep learning-based detectors compared with the classical maximum likelihood algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous motion planning (AMP) of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is aimed at enabling a UAV to safely fly to the target without human intervention.

This paper proposes a multiple experience pools (MEPs) framework leveraging human expert experiences for DRL to speed up the learning process. Based on the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a MEP&ndash;DDPG algorithm was designed using model predictive control and simulated annealing to generate expert experiences. On applying this algorithm to a complex unknown simulation environment constructed based on the parameters of the real UAV, the training experiment results showed that the novel DRL algorithm resulted in a performance improvement exceeding 20% as compared with the state-of-the-art DDPG. The results of the experimental testing indicate that UAVs trained using MEP&ndash;DDPG can stably complete a variety of tasks in complex, unknown environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted relay mobile edge computing (MEC) network is a prominent concept, where network deployment is flexible and network coverage is wide. In scenarios such as emergency communications and low-cost coverage, optimization of offloading methods and resource utilization are important ways to improve system effectiveness due to limited terminal and UAV energy and hardware equipment. A multilevel edge computing network resource optimization model on the basis of UAV fusion that provides relay forwarding and offload services is established by considering the initial energy state of the UAV, the green energy charging function, and the reliability of computing offload. With normalized system utility function maximization as the goal, a Markov decision process algorithm meets the needs of the practical application scene and provides a flexible and effective unloading mode. This algorithm is adopted to solve the optimal offloading mode and the optimal resource utilization scheme. Simulations verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed multilevel offloading model. The proposed model can optimize system resource allocation and effectively improve the utility function and user experience of computing offloading systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) received an unprecedented surge of people&rsquo;s interest worldwide in recent years. This paper investigates the specific problem of cooperative mission planning for multiple UAVs on the battlefield from a hierarchical decision-making perspective. From the view of the actual mission planning issue, the two key problems to be solved in UAV collaborative mission planning are mission allocation and route planning. In this paper, both of these problems are taken into account via a hierarchical decision-making model. Firstly, we use a target clustering algorithm to divide the original targets into target subgroups, where each target subgroup contains multiple targets. Secondly, a fuzzy ant colony algorithm is used to calculate the global path between target subgroups for a single-target group. Thirdly, a fuzzy ant colony algorithm is also used to calculate the local path between multiple targets for a single-target subgroup. After three levels of decision-making, the complete path for multiple UAVs can be obtained. In order to improve the efficiency of a collaborative task between different types of UAVs, a cooperative communication strategy is developed, which can reduce the number of UAVs performing tasks. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative mission planning and cooperative communication strategy for multiple UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {The optimization issues connected to a landing task of an unmanned aerial vehicle are discussed in the paper, based on a model of a mini-class drone. Three landing scenarios are considered, including minimum-time landing, landing with minimum energy consumption, and planned landing. With the use of classical dynamic programming techniques, including the minimum principle of Pontryagin, as well as the calculus of variations, the optimal altitude reference trajectories are found, to form the altitude control system in such a way as to mimic the profile of the reference trajectory by the actual altitude of the UAV. The simulation results conducted with the use of the Simulink Support Package for Parrot Minidrones verify the correctness and effectiveness of the method, and open the research directions for further analysis, especially to tune altitude controller in a way, as to track the reference profile. Up to this point, optimization tasks considered in the literature, with respect to the drones, were connected to swarm formation optimization, optimization of the take-off process or landing process limited to optimal path planning. This paper thus considers a new topic in the field.},

In this paper, the simulation platform for the hybrid unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been built by establishing the subsystem models of the UAV power system. Under the two chosen working conditions, the conventional cruise flight mission and the terrain tracking mission, the power tracking control and Q-Learning method have been used to design the energy management controller for the hybrid UAV. The fuel consumption and pollutant emissions under each working condition were calculated. The results show that the hybrid system can improve the efficiency of the UAV system, reduce the fuel consumption of the UAV, and so reduce the emissions of CO2, NOx, and other pollutants. This contributes to improving of environmental quality, energy-saving, and emission reduction, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of aviation.},

ABSTRACT = {Today, industrial robots are used in dangerous environments in all sectors, including the sustainable energy sector. Sensors and processors collect and transmit information and data from users as a result of the application of robot control systems and sensory feedback. This paper proposes that the estimation of a collaborative robot system&rsquo;s performance can be achieved by evaluating the mobility of robots. Scenarios have been determined in which an autonomous system has been used for intervention in crisis situations due to fire. The experimental model consists of three autonomous vehicles, two of which are ground vehicles and the other is an aerial vehicle. The conclusion of the research described in this paper highlights the fact that the integration of robotic systems made up of autonomous vehicles working in unstructured environments is difficult and at present there is no unitary analytical model.},

ABSTRACT = {A groundbreaking design of radio access networks (RANs) is needed to fulfill 5G traffic requirements. To this aim, a cost-effective and flexible strategy consists of complementing terrestrial RANs with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, several problems must be solved in order to effectively deploy such UAV-based RANs (U-RANs). Indeed, due to the high complexity and heterogeneity of these networks, model-based design approaches, often relying on restrictive assumptions and constraints, exhibit severe limitation in real-world scenarios. Moreover, design of a set of appropriate protocols for such U-RANs is a highly sophisticated task. In this context, machine learning (ML) emerges as a useful tool to obtain practical and effective solutions. In this paper, we discuss why, how, and which types of ML methods are useful for designing U-RANs, by focusing in particular on supervised and reinforcement learning strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Trailing edge flaps (TEFs) are high-lift devices that generate changes in the lift and drag coefficients of an airfoil. A large number of 2D simulations are performed in this study, in order to measure these changes in aerodynamic coefficients and to analyze them for a given Reynolds number. Three different airfoils, namely NACA 0012, NACA 64(3)-618, and S810, are studied in relation to three combinations of the following parameters: angle of attack, flap angle (deflection), and flaplength. Results are in concordance with the aerodynamic results expected when studying a TEF on an airfoil, showing the effect exerted by the three parameters on both aerodynamic coefficients lift and drag. Depending on whether the airfoil flap is deployed on either the pressure zone or the suction zone, the lift-to-drag ratio, CL/CD, will increase or decrease, respectively. Besides, the use of a larger flap length will increase the higher values and decrease the lower values of the CL/CD ratio. In addition, an artificial neural network (ANN) based prediction model for aerodynamic forces was built through the results obtained from the research.},

ABSTRACT = {On the issues of global environment protection, the renewable energy systems have been widely considered. The photovoltaic (PV) system converts solar power into electricity and significantly reduces the consumption of fossil fuels from environment pollution. Besides introducing new materials for the solar cells to improve the energy conversion efficiency, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms have been developed to ensure the efficient operation of PV systems at the maximum power point (MPP) under various weather conditions. The integration of reinforcement learning and deep learning, named deep reinforcement learning (DRL), is proposed in this paper as a future tool to deal with the optimization control problems. Following the success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in several fields, the deep Q network (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) are proposed to harvest the MPP in PV systems, especially under a partial shading condition (PSC). Different from the reinforcement learning (RL)-based method, which is only operated with discrete state and action spaces, the methods adopted in this paper are used to deal with continuous state spaces. In this study, DQN solves the problem with discrete action spaces, while DDPG handles the continuous action spaces. The proposed methods are simulated in MATLAB/Simulink for feasibility analysis. Further tests under various input conditions with comparisons to the classical Perturb and observe (P&amp;O) MPPT method are carried out for validation. Based on the simulation results in this study, the performance of the proposed methods is outstanding and efficient, showing its potential for further applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Photogrammetry involves aerial photography of the Earth&rsquo;s surface and subsequently processing the images to provide a more accurate depiction of the area (Orthophotography). It is used by the Spanish Instituto Geogr&aacute;fico Nacional to update road cartography but requires a significant amount of manual labor due to the need to perform visual inspection of all tiled images. Deep learning techniques (artificial neural networks with more than one hidden layer) can perform road detection but it is still unclear how to find the optimal network architecture. Our main goal is the automatic design of deep neural network architectures with grammar-guided genetic programming. In this kind of evolutive algorithm, all the population individuals (here candidate network architectures) are constrained to rules specified by a grammar that defines valid and useful structural patterns to guide the search process. Grammar used includes well-known complex structures (e.g., Inception-like modules) combined with a custom designed mutation operator (dynamically links the mutation probability to structural diversity). Pilot results show that the system is able to design models for road detection that obtain test accuracies similar to that reached by state-of-the-art models when evaluated over a dataset from the Spanish National Aerial Orthophotography Plan.},

ABSTRACT = {As avionics technologies have advanced, it is possible to perform many aerial applications which demand cooperative work with multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Since one of the basic applications is reconnaissance, we focus on efficient cooperative reconnaissance. While random mobility models are useful for multi-UAVs reconnaissance, they suffer from overlapped reconnaissance problem that two or more UAVs reconnoiter a region at the same time. The overlapped reconnaissance also leads to imbalanced reconnaissance in which an area scanned by one UAV may be re-visited soon by the other UAV. Thus, we provide overlap avoidance schemes for the existing reconnaissance mobility models and enhance their performance. Throughout the simulations, we evaluate the effect of applying overlap avoidance in the existing models. The simulation results show that overlapped area is reduced by up to 20 times and 90%-coverage reaching time is improved by up to 19%.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based nonlinear integral backstepping (NIB) in combination with model free control (MFC) for pitch angle control of variable speed wind turbine. In particular, the controller has been presented as a digital twin (DT) concept, which is an increasingly growing method in a variety of applications. In DDPG-NIB-MFC, the pitch angle is considered as the control input that depends on the optimal rotor speed, which is usually derived from effective wind speed. The system stability according to the Lyapunov theory can be achieved by the recursive nature of the backstepping theory and the integral action has been used to compensate for the steady-state error. Moreover, due to the nonlinear characteristics of wind turbines, the MFC aims to handle the un-modeled system dynamics and disturbances. The DDPG algorithm with actor-critic structure has been added in the proposed control structure to efficiently and adaptively tune the controller parameters embedded in the NIB controller. Under this effort, a digital twin of a presented controller is defined as a real-time and probabilistic model which is implemented on the digital signal processor (DSP) computing device. To ensure the performance of the proposed approach and output behavior of the system, software-in-loop (SIL) and hardware-in-loop (HIL) testing procedures have been considered. From the simulation and implementation outcomes, it can be concluded that the proposed backstepping controller based DDPG is more effective, robust, and adaptive than the backstepping and proportional-integral (PI) controllers optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances.},

ABSTRACT = {Generating Digital Elevation Models (DEM) from satellite imagery or other data sources constitutes an essential tool for a plethora of applications and disciplines, ranging from 3D flight planning and simulation, autonomous driving and satellite navigation, such as GPS, to modeling water flow, precision farming and forestry. The task of extracting this 3D geometry from a given surface hitherto requires a combination of appropriately collected corresponding samples and/or specialized equipment, as inferring the elevation from single image data is out of reach for contemporary approaches. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have experienced unprecedented growth in recent years as they can extrapolate rules in a data-driven manner and retrieve convoluted, nonlinear one-to-one mappings, such as an approximate mapping from satellite imagery to DEMs. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end Deep Learning (DL) approach to construct this mapping and to generate an absolute or relative point cloud estimation of a DEM given a single RGB satellite (Sentinel-2 imagery in this work) or drone image. The model has been readily extended to incorporate available information from the non-visible electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike existing methods, we only exploit one image for the production of the elevation data, rendering our approach less restrictive and constrained, but suboptimal compared to them at the same time. Moreover, recent advances in software and hardware allow us to make the inference and the generation extremely fast, even on moderate hardware. We deploy Conditional Generative Adversarial networks (CGAN), which are the state-of-the-art approach to image-to-image translation. We expect our work to serve as a springboard for further development in this field and to foster the integration of such methods in the process of generating, updating and analyzing DEMs.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been successfully applied in mapless navigation. An important issue in DRL is to design a reward function for evaluating actions of agents. However, designing a robust and suitable reward function greatly depends on the designer&rsquo;s experience and intuition. To address this concern, we consider employing reward shaping from trajectories on similar navigation tasks without human supervision, and propose a general reward function based on matching network (MN). The MN-based reward function is able to gain the experience by pre-training through trajectories on different navigation tasks and accelerate the training speed of DRL in new tasks. The proposed reward function keeps the optimal strategy of DRL unchanged. The simulation results on two static maps show that the DRL converge with less iterations via the learned reward function than the state-of-the-art mapless navigation methods. The proposed method performs well in dynamic maps with partially moving obstacles. Even when test maps are different from training maps, the proposed strategy is able to complete the navigation tasks without additional training.},

ABSTRACT = {Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (clustering, genetic, and principal component analysis) automate Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) missions as well as the creation and refinement of iterative 3D photogrammetric models with a next best view (NBV) approach. The novel approach uses Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to achieve convergence to a specified orthomosaic resolution by identifying edges in the point cloud and planning cameras that &ldquo;view&rdquo; the holes identified by edges without requiring an initial model. This iterative UAV photogrammetric method successfully runs in various Microsoft AirSim environments. Simulated ground sampling distance (GSD) of models reaches as low as     3.4     cm per pixel, and generally, successive iterations improve resolution. Besides analogous application in simulated environments, a field study of a retired municipal water tank illustrates the practical application and advantages of automated UAV iterative inspection of infrastructure using     63 %     fewer photographs than a comparable manual flight with analogous density point clouds obtaining a GSD of less than 3 cm per pixel. Each iteration qualitatively increases resolution according to a logarithmic regression, reduces holes in models, and adds details to model edges.},

ABSTRACT = {With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, Intelligent UAV will be widely used in future autonomous aerial combat. Previous researches on autonomous aerial combat within visual range (WVR) have limitations due to simplifying assumptions, limited robustness, and ignoring sensor errors. In this paper, in order to consider the error of the aircraft sensors, we model the aerial combat WVR as a state-adversarial Markov decision process (SA-MDP), which introduce the small adversarial perturbations on state observations and these perturbations do not alter the environment directly, but can mislead the agent into making suboptimal decisions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel autonomous aerial combat maneuver strategy generation algorithm with high-performance and high-robustness based on state-adversarial deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (SA-DDPG), which add a robustness regularizers related to an upper bound on performance loss at the actor-network. At the same time, a reward shaping method based on maximum entropy (MaxEnt) inverse reinforcement learning algorithm (IRL) is proposed to improve the aerial combat strategy generation algorithm&rsquo;s efficiency. Finally, the efficiency of the aerial combat strategy generation algorithm and the performance and robustness of the resulting aerial combat strategy is verified by simulation experiments. Our main contributions are three-fold. First, to introduce the observation errors of UAV, we are modeling air combat as SA-MDP. Second, to make the strategy network of air combat maneuver more robust in the presence of observation errors, we introduce regularizers into the policy gradient. Third, to solve the problem that air combat&rsquo;s reward function is too sparse, we use MaxEnt IRL to design a shaping reward to accelerate the convergence of SA-DDPG.},

ABSTRACT = {During the last few years, various Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications have emerged with numerous network elements interconnected using wired and wireless communication technologies and equipped with strategically placed sensors and actuators. This paper justifies why non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) will bring the IIoT vision closer to reality by providing improved data acquisition and massive connectivity to sensor fields in large and remote areas. NTNs are engineered to utilize satellites, airships, and aircrafts, which can be employed to extend the radio coverage and provide remote monitoring and sensing services. Additionally, this paper describes indicative delay-tolerant massive IIoT and delay-sensitive mission-critical IIoT applications spanning a large number of vertical markets with diverse and stringent requirements. As the heterogeneous nature of NTNs and the complex and dynamic communications scenarios lead to uncertainty and a high degree of variability, conventional wireless communication technologies cannot sufficiently support ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) and offer ubiquitous and uninterrupted interconnectivity. In this regard, this paper sheds light on the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in the provision of challenging NTN-based IIoT services and provides a thorough review of the relevant research works. By adding intelligence and facilitating the decision-making and prediction procedures, the NTNs can effectively adapt to their surrounding environment, thus enhancing the performance of various metrics with significantly lower complexity compared to typical optimization methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Determining the distance of the line-of-sight (LOS) of a small drone is essential in both regulating drone operation and drone operator training considering public safety. A field experiment was conducted to determine the LOS distance and visual angle of a small drone. Human participants were requested to observe a drone in one of the predetermined locations in the air. They responded whether they could see and hear the drone using a five-point scale. It was found that auditory signals were insignificant in drone detection because most of the participants could not hear the drone while they could still see the drone in most of the test locations. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to predict the probability of catching the drone visually. Two models were built considering the &ldquo;definitely yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;definitely or probably yes&rdquo; criteria of visual detection. These models may be used to estimate the LOS distance and visual angle. Assuming a 50% probability of visual catching and the &ldquo;definitely or probably yes&rdquo; criterion, the distance and visual angle of the LOS for the Mavic Air drone without a protector were approximately 307 m and 0.065&deg;, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, methods are presented for designing a quadrotor attitude control system with disturbance rejection ability, wherein only one parameter needs to be tuned for each axis. The core difference between quadrotor platforms are extracted as critical gain parameters (CGPs). Reinforcement learning (RL) technology is introduced in order to automatically optimize the controlling law for quadrotors with different CGPs, and the CGPs are used to extend the RL state list. A deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithm that is based on an actor-critic structure in a model-free style is used as the learning algorithm. Mirror sampling and reward shaping methods are designed in order to eliminate the steady-state errors of the RL controller and accelerate the training process. Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is applied to reject unknown external disturbances. A set of extended state observers (ESOs) is designed to estimate the total disturbance to the roll and pitch axes. The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm is used to automatically tune the ESO parameters and improve the final performance. The complete controller is tested on an F550 quadrotor in both simulation and real flight environments. The quadrotor can hover and move around stably and accurately in the air, even with a severe disturbance.},

ABSTRACT = {Multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collaboration has great potential. To increase the intelligence and environmental adaptability of multi-UAV control, we study the application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms in the field of multi-UAV cooperative control. Aiming at the problem of a non-stationary environment caused by the change of learning agent strategy in reinforcement learning in a multi-agent environment, the paper presents an improved multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm&mdash;the multiagent joint proximal policy optimization (MAJPPO) algorithm with the centralized learning and decentralized execution. This algorithm uses the moving window averaging method to make each agent obtain a centralized state value function, so that the agents can achieve better collaboration. The improved algorithm enhances the collaboration and increases the sum of reward values obtained by the multiagent system. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, we use the MAJPPO algorithm to complete the task of multi-UAV formation and the crossing of multiple-obstacle environments. To simplify the control complexity of the UAV, we use the six-degree of freedom and 12-state equations of the dynamics model of the UAV with an attitude control loop. The experimental results show that the MAJPPO algorithm has better performance and better environmental adaptability.},

ABSTRACT = {Several heterogeneous, intelligent, and distributed devices can be connected to interact with one another over the Internet in what is termed internet of things (IoT). Also, the concept of IoT can be exploited in the industrial environment for enhancing the production of goods and services and for mitigating the risk of disaster occurrences. This application of IoT for enhancing industrial production is known as industrial IoT (IIoT). Emergent configuration (EC) is a technology that can be adopted to enhance the operation and collaboration of IoT connected devices in order to improve the efficiency of the connected IoT systems for maximum user satisfaction. To meet user goals, the connected devices are required to cooperate with one another in an adaptive, interoperable, and homogeneous manner. In this paper, a survey of the concept of IoT is presented in addition to a review of IIoT systems. The application of ubiquitous computing-aided software define networking (SDN)-based EC architecture is propounded for enhancing the throughput of oil and gas production in the maritime ecosystems by managing the exploration process especially in emergency situations that involve anthropogenic oil and gas spillages.},

ABSTRACT = {Crowd surveillance plays a key role to ensure safety and security in public areas. Surveillance systems traditionally rely on fixed camera networks, which suffer from limitations, as coverage of the monitored area, video resolution and analytic performance. On the other hand, a smart camera network provides the ability to reconfigure the sensing infrastructure by incorporating active devices such as pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras and UAV-based cameras, thus enabling the network to adapt over time to changes in the scene. We propose a new decentralised approach for network reconfiguration, where each camera dynamically adapts its parameters and position to optimise scene coverage. Two policies for decentralised camera reconfiguration are presented: a greedy approach and a reinforcement learning approach. In both cases, cameras are able to locally control the state of their neighbourhood and dynamically adjust their position and PTZ parameters. When crowds are present, the network balances between global coverage of the entire scene and high resolution for the crowded areas. We evaluate our approach in a simulated environment monitored with fixed, PTZ and UAV-based cameras.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the models in the literature for modeling the behavior of the brain is the Bayesian attractor model, which is a kind of machine-learning algorithm. According to this model, the brain assigns stochastic variables to possible decisions (attractors) and chooses one of them when enough evidence is collected from sensory systems to achieve a confidence level high enough to make a decision. In this paper, we introduce a software defined networking (SDN) application based on a brain-inspired Bayesian attractor model for identification of the current traffic pattern for the supervision and automation of Internet of things (IoT) networks that exhibit a limited number of traffic patterns. In a real SDN testbed, we demonstrate that our SDN application can identify the traffic patterns using a limited set of fluctuating network statistics of edge link utilization. Moreover, we show that our application can improve core link utilization and the power efficiency of IoT networks by immediately applying a pre-calculated network configuration optimized by traffic engineering with network slicing for the identified pattern.},

ABSTRACT = {The quest to create machines that can solve problems as humans do leads us to intelligent control. This field encompasses control systems that can adapt to changes and learn to improve their actions&mdash;traits typically associated with human intelligence. In this work we seek to determine how intelligent these classes of control systems are by quantifying their level of adaptability and learning. First we describe the stages of development towards intelligent control and present a definition based on literature. Based on the key elements of this definition, we propose a novel taxonomy of intelligent control methods, which assesses the extent to which they handle uncertainties in three areas: the environment, the controller, and the goals. This taxonomy is applicable to a variety of robotic and other autonomous systems, which we demonstrate through several examples of intelligent control methods and their classifications. Looking at the spread of classifications based on this taxonomy can help researchers identify where control systems can be made more intelligent.},

ABSTRACT = {The problem of multi-agent remote sensing for the purposes of finding survivors or surveying points of interest in GPS-denied and partially observable environments remains a challenge. This paper presents a framework for multi-agent target-finding using a combination of online POMDP based planning and Deep Reinforcement Learning based control. The framework is implemented considering planning and control as two separate problems. The planning problem is defined as a decentralised multi-agent graph search problem and is solved using a modern online POMDP solver. The control problem is defined as a local continuous-environment exploration problem and is solved using modern Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques. The proposed framework combines the solution to both of these problems and testing shows that it enables multiple agents to find a target within large, simulated test environments in the presence of unknown obstacles and obstructions. The proposed approach could also be extended or adapted to a number of time sensitive remote-sensing problems, from searching for multiple survivors during a disaster to surveying points of interest in a hazardous environment by adjusting the individual model definitions.},

ABSTRACT = {Siamese network-based trackers consider tracking as features cross-correlation between the target template and the search region. Therefore, feature representation plays an important role for constructing a high-performance tracker. However, all existing Siamese networks extract the deep but low-resolution features of the entire patch, which is not robust enough to estimate the target bounding box accurately. In this work, to address this issue, we propose a novel high-resolution Siamese network, which connects the high-to-low resolution convolution streams in parallel as well as repeatedly exchanges the information across resolutions to maintain high-resolution representations. The resulting representation is semantically richer and spatially more precise by a simple yet effective multi-scale feature fusion strategy. Moreover, we exploit attention mechanisms to learn object-aware masks for adaptive feature refinement, and use deformable convolution to handle complex geometric transformations. This makes the target more discriminative against distractors and background. Without bells and whistles, extensive experiments on popular tracking benchmarks containing OTB100, UAV123, VOT2018 and LaSOT demonstrate that the proposed tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance and runs in real time, confirming its efficiency and effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, fuzzy proportional integral derivative (PID) controller schemes, which include simplified fuzzy reasoning decision methodologies and PID parameters, are broadly and efficaciously practiced in various fields from industrial applications, military service, to rescue operations, civilian information and also horticultural observation and agricultural surveillance. A fusion particle swarm optimization (PSO)&ndash;evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm, which is an improved version of the stochastic optimization strategy PSO, was presented for designing and optimizing controller gains in this study. The mathematical calculations of this study include the reproduction of EP with PSO. By minimizing the integral of the absolute error (IAE) criterion that is used for estimating the system response as a fitness function, the obtained integrated design of the fusion PSO&ndash;EP algorithm generated and updated the new elite parameters for proposed controller schemes. This progression was used for the complicated non-linear systems of the attitude-control pilot models of a tricopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to demonstrate an improvement on the performance in terms of rapid response, precision, reliability, and stability.},

ABSTRACT = {The vegetation index (VI) has been successfully used to monitor the growth and to predict the yield of agricultural crops. In this paper, a long-term observation was conducted for the yield prediction of maize using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and estimations of chlorophyll contents using SPAD-502. A new vegetation index termed as modified red blue VI (MRBVI) was developed to monitor the growth and to predict the yields of maize by establishing relationships between MRBVI- and SPAD-502-based chlorophyll contents. The coefficients of determination (R2s) were 0.462 and 0.570 in chlorophyll contents&rsquo; estimations and yield predictions using MRBVI, and the results were relatively better than the results from the seven other commonly used VI approaches. All VIs during the different growth stages of maize were calculated and compared with the measured values of chlorophyll contents directly, and the relative error (RE) of MRBVI is the lowest at 0.355. Further, machine learning (ML) methods such as the backpropagation neural network model (BP), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were adopted for predicting the yields of maize. All VIs calculated for each image captured during important phenological stages of maize were set as independent variables and the corresponding yields of each plot were defined as dependent variables. The ML models used the leave one out method (LOO), where the root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 2.157, 1.099, 1.146, and 1.698 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) were 1.739, 0.886, 0.925, and 1.356 (g/hundred grain weight) for BP, SVM, RF, and ELM, respectively. Thus, the SVM method performed better in predicting the yields of maize than the other ML methods. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the MRBVI calculated from images acquired at different growth stages integrated with advanced ML methods should be used for agricultural- and ecological-related chlorophyll estimation and yield predictions.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, unmanned aerial vehicles, such as drones, are becoming a part of our lives and extend to many areas of society, including the industrialized world. A common alternative for controlling the movements and actions of the drone is through unwired tactile interfaces, for which different remote control devices are used. However, control through such devices is not a natural, human-like communication interface, which sometimes is difficult to master for some users. In this research, we experimented with a domain-based speech recognition architecture to effectively control an unmanned aerial vehicle such as a drone. The drone control was performed in a more natural, human-like way to communicate the instructions. Moreover, we implemented an algorithm for command interpretation using both Spanish and English languages, as well as to control the movements of the drone in a simulated domestic environment. We conducted experiments involving participants giving voice commands to the drone in both languages in order to compare the effectiveness of each, considering the mother tongue of the participants in the experiment. Additionally, different levels of distortion were applied to the voice commands to test the proposed approach when it encountered noisy input signals. The results obtained showed that the unmanned aerial vehicle was capable of interpreting user voice instructions. Speech-to-action recognition improved for both languages with phoneme matching in comparison to only using the cloud-based algorithm without domain-based instructions. Using raw audio inputs, the cloud-based approach achieves 74.81% and 97.04% accuracy for English and Spanish instructions, respectively. However, with our phoneme matching approach the results are improved, yielding 93.33% accuracy for English and 100.00% accuracy for Spanish.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied for pesticide spraying as they have high efficiency and operational flexibility. However, the pesticide droplet drift caused by wind may decrease the pesticide spraying efficiency and pollute the environment. A precision spraying system based on an airborne meteorological monitoring platform on manned agricultural aircrafts is not adaptable for. So far, there is no better solution for controlling droplet drift outside the target area caused by wind, especially by wind gusts. In this regard, a UAV trajectory adjustment system based on Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) for pesticide drift control was proposed in this research. By collecting data from ground WSN, the UAV utilizes the wind speed and wind direction as inputs to autonomously adjust its trajectory for keeping droplet deposition in the target spraying area. Two optimized algorithms, namely deep reinforcement learning and particle swarm optimization, were applied to generate the newly modified flight route. At the same time, a simplified pesticide droplet drift model that includes wind speed and wind direction as parameters was developed and adopted to simulate and compute the drift distance of pesticide droplets. Moreover, an LSTM-based wind speed prediction model and a RNN-based wind direction prediction model were established, so as to address the problem of missing the latest wind data caused by communication latency or a lack of connection with the ground nodes. Finally, experiments were carried out to test the communication latency between UAV and ground WSN, and to evaluate the proposed scheme with embedded Raspberry Pi boards in UAV for feasibility verification. Results show that the WSN-assisted UAV trajectory adjustment system is capable of providing a better performance of on-target droplet deposition for real time pesticide spraying with UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous tracking and landing is playing an increasingly important role in military and civil applications. In particular, machine learning has been successfully introduced to robotics-related tasks. A novel UAV autonomous tracking and landing approach based on a deep reinforcement learning strategy is presented in this paper, with the aim of dealing with the UAV motion control problem in an unpredictable and harsh environment. Instead of building a prior model and inferring the landing actions based on heuristic rules, a model-free method based on a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is proposed. In the POMDP model, the UAV automatically learns the landing maneuver by an end-to-end neural network, which combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) algorithm and heuristic rules. A Modular Open Robots Simulation Engine (MORSE)-based reinforcement learning framework is designed and validated with a continuous UAV tracking and landing task on a randomly moving platform in high sensor noise and intermittent measurements. The simulation results show that when the moving platform is moving in different trajectories, the average landing success rate of the proposed algorithm is about 10% higher than that of the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) method. As an indirect result, a state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning-based UAV control method is validated, where the UAV can learn the optimal strategy of a continuously autonomous landing and perform properly in a simulation environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Cellular Vehicle to Everything (V2X) has redefined the vehicular communication architecture as something that needs an ultra-reliable link, high capacity, and fast message delivery in vehicular networks. The V2X scenarios are broadly categorized as Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle to Pedestrians (V2P), and Vehicle to Network (V2N). Vulnerable pedestrians belong to the V2P category and hence require an ultra-reliable link and a fast message delivery in case the moving vehicle is in the close proximity of the pedestrian. However, congestion in the network calls for an optimized resource allocation that would allow a fast and secure connection between a vehicle and the pedestrian. In this paper, we have proposed a distance-based resource allocation that classifies the pedestrians in different categories, performs a one-to-many weighted bipartite matching, and finally a reinforcement learning based power allocation.},

ABSTRACT = {5G networks and Internet of Things (IoT) offer a powerful platform for ubiquitous environments with their ubiquitous sensing, high speeds and other benefits. The data, analytics, and other computations need to be optimally moved and placed in these environments, dynamically, such that energy-efficiency and QoS demands are best satisfied. A particular challenge in this context is to preserve privacy and security while delivering quality of service (QoS) and energy-efficiency. Many works have tried to address these challenges but without a focus on optimizing all of them and assuming fixed models of environments and security threats. This paper proposes the UbiPriSEQ framework that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to adaptively, dynamically, and holistically optimize QoS, energy-efficiency, security, and privacy. UbiPriSEQ is built on a three-layered model and comprises two modules. UbiPriSEQ devises policies and makes decisions related to important parameters including local processing and offloading rates for data and computations, radio channel states, transmit power, task priority, and selection of fog nodes for offloading, data migration, and so forth. UbiPriSEQ is implemented in Python over the TensorFlow platform and is evaluated using a real-life application in terms of SINR, privacy metric, latency, and utility function, manifesting great promise.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, almost all robot state estimation and localization systems are based on the Kalman filter (KF) and its derived methods, in particular the unscented Kalman filter (UKF). When applying the UKF alone, the estimate of the state is not sufficiently precise. In this paper, a new hierarchical infrared navigational algorithm hybridization (HIRNAH) system is developed to provide better state estimation and localization for mobile robots. Two navigation subsystems (inertial navigation system (INS) and, using a novel infrared navigation algorithm (NIRNA), Odom-NIRNA) and an RPLIDAR-A3 scanner cooperation to build HIRNAH. The robot pose (position and orientation) errors are estimated by a system filtering module (SFM) and used to smooth the robot&rsquo;s final poses. A prototype (two rotary encoders, one smartphone-based robot sensing model and one RPLIDAR-A3 scanner) has been built and mounted on a four-wheeled mobile robot (4-WMR). Simulation results have motivated real-life experiments, and obtained results are compared to some existent research (hardware and control technology navigation (HCTNav), rapid exploring random tree (RRT) and in stand-alone mode (INS)) for performance measurements. The experimental results confirm that HIRNAH presents a more accurate estimation and a lower mean square error (MSE) of the robot&rsquo;s state than those calculated by the previously cited HCTNav, RRT and INS.},

ABSTRACT = {Backstepping is a control technique based on Lyapunov&rsquo;s theory that has been successfully implemented in the control of motors and robots by several nonlinear methods. However, there are no standardized methods for tuning control gains (unlike the PIDs). This paper shows the tuning gains of the backstepping controller, using Genetic Algorithms (GA), for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), quadrotor type, designed for autonomous trajectory tracking. First, a dynamic model of the vehicle is obtained through the Newton‒Euler methodology. Then, the control law is obtained, and self-tuning is performed, through which we can obtain suitable values of the gains in order to achieve the design requirements. In this work, the establishment time and maximum impulse are considered as such. The tuning and simulations of the system response were performed using the MATLAB-Simulink environment, obtaining as a result the compliance of the design parameters and the correct tracking of different trajectories. The results show that self-tuning by means of genetic algorithms satisfactorily adjusts for the gains of a backstepping controller applied to a quadrotor and allows for the implementation of a control system that responds appropriately to errors of different magnitude.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imaging systems have recently gained significant attention from researchers and practitioners as a cost-effective means for agro-environmental applications. In particular, machine learning algorithms have been applied to UAV-based remote sensing data for enhancing the UAV capabilities of various applications. This systematic review was performed on studies through a statistical meta-analysis of UAV applications along with machine learning algorithms in agro-environmental monitoring. For this purpose, a total number of 163 peer-reviewed articles published in 13 high-impact remote sensing journals over the past 20 years were reviewed focusing on several features, including study area, application, sensor type, platform type, and spatial resolution. The meta-analysis revealed that 62% and 38% of the studies applied regression and classification models, respectively. Visible sensor technology was the most frequently used sensor with the highest overall accuracy among classification articles. Regarding regression models, linear regression and random forest were the most frequently applied models in UAV remote sensing imagery processing. Finally, the results of this study confirm that applying machine learning approaches on UAV imagery produces fast and reliable results. Agriculture, forestry, and grassland mapping were found as the top three UAV applications in this review, in 42%, 22%, and 8% of the studies, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of monitoring sensors is increasingly present in the context of precision agriculture. Usually, these sensor nodes (SNs) alternate their states between periods of activation and hibernation to reduce battery usage. When employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from SNs distributed over a large agricultural area, we must synchronize the UAV route with the activation period of each SN. In this article, we address the problem of optimizing the UAV path through all the SNs to reduce its flight time, while also maximizing the SNs&rsquo; lifetime. Using the concept of timeslots for time base management combined with the idea of flight prohibition list, we propose an efficient algorithm for discovering and reconfiguring the activation time of the SNs. Experimental results were obtained through the development of our own simulator&mdash;UAV Simulator. These results demonstrate a considerable reduction in the distance traveled by the UAV and also in its flight time. In addition, the model provides a reduction in transmission time by SNs after reconfiguration, thus ensuring a longer lifetime for the SNs in the monitoring environment, as well as improving the freshness and continuity of the gathered data, which support the decision-making process.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aircraft vehicle frequency hopping (UAV-FH) systems face multiple types of jamming, and one anti-jamming method cannot cope with all types of jamming. Therefore, the jamming signals of the environment where the UAV-FH system is located must be identified and classified; moreover, anti-jamming measures must be selected in accordance with different jamming types. First, the algorithm extracts the Sevcik fractal dimension from the frequency domain (SFDF) and the degree of energy concentration from the fractional Fourier domain of various types of jamming. Then, these parameters are combined into a two-dimensional feature vector and used as a feature parameter for classification and recognition. Lastly, a binary tree-based support vector machine (BT-SVM) multi-classifier is used to classify the jamming signal. Simulation results show that the feature parameters extracted by the proposed method have good separation and strong stability. Compared with the existing box-dimensional recognition algorithm, the new algorithm not only can quickly and accurately identify the type of jamming signal but also has more advantages when the jamming-to-noise ratio (JNR) is low.},

ABSTRACT = {With the tremendous increase of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the different service requirements of these IoT applications, machine-type communication (MTC) has attracted considerable attention from both industry and academia. Owing to the prominent advantages of supporting pervasive connectivity and wide area coverage, the cellular network is advocated as the potential wireless solution to realize IoT deployment for MTC, and this creative network paradigm is called the cellular IoT (C-IoT). In this paper, we propose the three-layer structured C-IoT architecture for MTC and review the challenges for deploying green C-IoT. Then, effective strategies for realizing green C-IoT are presented, including the energy efficient and energy harvesting schemes. We put forward several strategies to make the C-IoT run in an energy-saving manner, such as efficient random access and barring mechanisms, self-adapting machine learning predictions, scheduling optimization, resource allocation, fog computing, and group-oriented transmission. As for the energy harvesting schemes, the ambient and dedicated energy harvesting strategies are investigated. Afterwards, we give a detailed case study, which shows the effectiveness of reducing power consumption for the proposed layered C-IoT architecture. Additionally, for real-time and non-real-time applications, the power consumption of different on-off states for MTC devices is discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Neural network classifiers (NNCs) are known to be vulnerable to malicious adversarial perturbations of inputs including those modifying a small fraction of the input features named sparse or L0 attacks. Effective and fast L0 attacks, such as the widely used Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) are practical to fool NNCs but also to improve their robustness. In this paper, we show that penalising saliency maps of JSMA by the output probabilities and the input features of the NNC leads to more powerful attack algorithms that better take into account each input&rsquo;s characteristics. This leads us to introduce improved versions of JSMA, named Weighted JSMA (WJSMA) and Taylor JSMA (TJSMA), and demonstrate through a variety of white-box and black-box experiments on three different datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTSRB), that they are both significantly faster and more efficient than the original targeted and non-targeted versions of JSMA. Experiments also demonstrate, in some cases, very competitive results of our attacks in comparison with the Carlini-Wagner (CW) L0 attack, while remaining, like JSMA, significantly faster (WJSMA and TJSMA are more than 50 times faster than CW L0 on CIFAR-10). Therefore, our new attacks provide good trade-offs between JSMA and CW for L0 real-time adversarial testing on datasets such as the ones previously cited.},

ABSTRACT = {Aerial robots are widely used in search and rescue applications because of their small size and high maneuvering. However, designing an autonomous exploration algorithm is still a challenging and open task, because of the limited payload and computing resources on board UAVs. This paper presents an autonomous exploration algorithm for the aerial robots that shows several improvements for being used in the search and rescue tasks. First of all, an RGB-D sensor is used to receive information from the environment and the OctoMap divides the environment into obstacles, free and unknown spaces. Then, a clustering algorithm is used to filter the frontiers extracted from the OctoMap, and an information gain based cost function is applied to choose the optimal frontier. At last, the feasible path is given by A* path planner and a safe corridor generation algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been tested and compared with baseline algorithms in three different environments with the map resolutions of 0.2 m, and 0.3 m. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a shorter exploration path and can save more exploration time when compared with the state of the art. The algorithm has also been validated in the real flight experiments.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, more and more smart homes have become one of important parts of home infrastructure. However, most of the smart home applications are not interconnected and remain isolated. They use the cloud center as the control platform, which increases the risk of link congestion and data security. Thus, in the future, smart homes based on edge computing without using cloud center become an important research area. In this paper, we assume that all applications in a smart home environment are composed of edge nodes and users. In order to maximize the utility of users, we assume that all users and edge nodes are placed in a market and formulate a pricing resource allocation model with utility maximization. We apply the Lagrangian method to analyze the model, so an edge node (provider in the market) allocates its resources to a user (customer in the market) based on the prices of resources and the utility related to the preference of users. To obtain the optimal resource allocation, we propose a pricing-based resource allocation algorithm by using low-pass filtering scheme and conform that the proposed algorithm can achieve an optimum within reasonable convergence times through some numerical examples.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are increasingly used in precision agriculture to collect crop health related data. UAS can capture data more often and more cost-effectively than sending human scouts into the field. However, in large crop fields, flight time, and hence data collection, is limited by battery life. In a conventional UAS approach, human operators are required to exchange depleted batteries many times, which can be costly and time consuming. In this study, we developed a novel, fully autonomous aerial scouting approach that preserves battery life by sampling sections of a field for sensing and predicting crop health for the whole field. Our approach uses reinforcement learning (RL) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accurately and autonomously sample the field. To develop and test the approach, we ran flight simulations on an aerial image dataset collected from an 80-acre corn field. The excess green vegetation Index was used as a proxy for crop health condition. Compared to the conventional UAS scouting approach, the proposed scouting approach sampled 40% of the field, predicted crop health with 89.8% accuracy, reduced labor cost by 4.8&times; and increased agricultural profits by 1.36&times;.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with meta-learning and proposes a novel approach, named meta twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (Meta-TD3), to realize the control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), allowing a UAV to quickly track a target in an environment where the motion of a target is uncertain. This approach can be applied to a variety of scenarios, such as wildlife protection, emergency aid, and remote sensing. We consider a multi-task experience replay buffer to provide data for the multi-task learning of the DRL algorithm, and we combine meta-learning to develop a multi-task reinforcement learning update method to ensure the generalization capability of reinforcement learning. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), experimental results show that the Meta-TD3 algorithm has achieved a great improvement in terms of both convergence value and convergence rate. In a UAV target tracking problem, Meta-TD3 only requires a few steps to train to enable a UAV to adapt quickly to a new target movement mode more and maintain a better tracking effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Measuring and monitoring the height of vegetation provides important insights into forest age and habitat quality. These are essential for the accuracy of applications that are highly reliant on up-to-date and accurate vegetation data. Current vegetation sensing practices involve ground survey, photogrammetry, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and airborne light detection and ranging sensors (LiDAR). While these methods provide high resolution and accuracy, their hardware and collection effort prohibits highly recurrent and widespread collection. In response to the limitations of current methods, we designed Y-NET, a novel deep learning model to generate high resolution models of vegetation from highly recurrent multispectral aerial imagery and elevation data. Y-NET&rsquo;s architecture uses convolutional layers to learn correlations between different input features and vegetation height, generating an accurate vegetation surface model (VSM) at 1&times;1 m resolution. We evaluated Y-NET on 235 km2 of the East San Francisco Bay Area and find that Y-NET achieves low error from LiDAR when tested on new locations. Y-NET also achieves an R2 of 0.83 and can effectively model complex vegetation through side-by-side visual comparisons. Furthermore, we show that Y-NET is able to identify instances of vegetation growth and mitigation by comparing aerial imagery and LiDAR collected at different times.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, deploying fixed terrestrial infrastructures is not cost-effective in temporary circumstances, such as natural disasters, hotspots, and so on. Thus, we consider a system of caching-based UAV-assisted communications between multiple ground users (GUs) and a local station (LS). Specifically, a UAV is exploited to cache data from the LS and then serve GUs&rsquo; requests to handle the issue of unavailable or damaged links from the LS to the GUs. The UAV can harvest solar energy for its operation. We investigate joint cache scheduling and power allocation schemes by using the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique to maximize the long-term downlink rate. Two scenarios for the network are taken into account. In the first, the harvested energy distribution of the GUs is assumed to be known, and we propose a partially observable Markov decision process framework such that the UAV can allocate optimal transmission power for each GU based on proper content caching over each flight period. In the second scenario where the UAV does not know the environment&rsquo;s dynamics in advance, an actor-critic-based scheme is proposed to achieve a solution by learning with a dynamic environment. Afterwards, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods, compared to baseline approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {The article presents a throughput maximization approach for UAV assisted ground networks. Throughput maximization involves minimizing delay and packet loss through UAV trajectory optimization, reinforcing the congested nodes and transmission channels. The aggressive reinforcement policy is achieved by characterizing nodes, links, and overall topology through delay, loss, throughput, and distance. A position-aware graph neural network (GNN) is used for characterization, prediction, and dynamic UAV trajectory enhancement. To establish correctness, the proposed approach is validated against optimized link state routing (OLSR) driven UAV assisted ground networks. The proposed approach considerably outperforms the classical approach by demonstrating significant gains in throughput and packet delivery ratio with notable decrements in delay and packet loss. The performance analysis of the proposed approach against software-defined UAVs (U-S) and UAVs as base stations (U-B) verifies the consistency and gains in average throughput while minimizing delay and packet loss. The scalability test of the proposed approach is performed by varying data rates and the number of UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {To perform precise approach and landing concerning an aircraft in automatic mode, local airfield-based landing systems are used. For joint processing of measurements of the onboard inertial navigation systems (INS), altimeters and local landing systems, the Kalman filter is usually used. The application of the quadratic criterion in the Kalman filter entails the well-known problem of high sensitivity of the estimate to anomalous measurement errors. During the automatic approach phase, abnormal navigation errors can lead to disaster, so the data fusion algorithm must automatically identify and isolate abnormal measurements. This paper presents a recurrent filtering algorithm that is resistant to anomalous errors in measurements and considers its application in the data fusion problem for landing system measurements with onboard sensor measurements&mdash;INS and altimeters. The robustness of the estimate is achieved through the combined use of the least modulus method and the Kalman filter. To detect and isolate failures the chi-square criterion is used. It makes possible the customization of the algorithm in accordance with the requirements for false alarm probability and the alarm missing probability. Testing results of the robust filtering algorithm are given both for synthesized data and for real measurements.},

ABSTRACT = {As systems grow more automatized, the human operator is all too often overlooked. Although human-robot interaction (HRI) can be quite demanding in terms of cognitive resources, the mental states (MS) of the operators are not yet taken into account by existing systems. As humans are no providential agents, this lack can lead to hazardous situations. The growing number of neurophysiology and machine learning tools now allows for efficient operators&rsquo; MS monitoring. Sending feedback on MS in a closed-loop solution is therefore at hand. Involving a consistent automated planning technique to handle such a process could be a significant asset. This perspective article was meant to provide the reader with a synthesis of the significant literature with a view to implementing systems that adapt to the operator&rsquo;s MS to improve human-robot operations&rsquo; safety and performance. First of all, the need for this approach is detailed regarding remote operation, an example of HRI. Then, several MS identified as crucial for this type of HRI are defined, along with relevant electrophysiological markers. A focus is made on prime degraded MS linked to time-on-task and task demands, as well as collateral MS linked to system outputs (i.e., feedback and alarms). Lastly, the principle of symbiotic HRI is detailed and one solution is proposed to include the operator state vector into the system using a mixed-initiative decisional framework to drive such an interaction.},

ABSTRACT = {In Industry 4.0 compatible workshops, the demand for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) used in indoor logistics systems has increased remarkably. In these indoor logistics systems, it may be necessary to execute multiple transport tasks simultaneously using multiple AGVs. However, some challenges require special solutions for AGVs to be used in industrial autonomous transportation. These challenges can be addressed under four main headings: positioning, optimum path planning, collision avoidance and optimum task allocation. The solutions produced for these challenges may require special studies that vary depending on the type of tasks and the working environment in which AGVs are used. This study focuses on the problem of automated indoor logistics carried out in the simultaneous production of textile finishing enterprises. In the study, a centralized cloud system that enables multiple AGVs to work in collaboration has been developed. The finishing enterprise of a denim manufacturing factory was handled as a case study and modelling of mapping-planning processes was carried out using the developed cloud system. In the cloud system, RestFul APIs, for mapping the environment, and WebSocket methods, to track the locations of AGVs, have been developed. A collaboration module in harmony with the working model has been developed for AGVs to be used for fabric transportation. The collaboration module consists of task definition, battery management-optimization, selection of the most suitable batch trolleys (provides mobility of fabrics for the finishing mills), optimum task distribution and collision avoidance stages. In the collaboration module, all the finishing processes until the product arrives the delivery point are defined as tasks. A task allocation algorithm has been developed for the optimum performance of these tasks. The multi-fitness function that optimizes the total path of the AGVs, the elapsed time and the energy spent while performing the tasks have been determined. An assignment matrix based on K nearest neighbor (k-NN) and permutation possibilities was created for the optimal task allocation, and the most appropriate row was selected according to the optimal path totals of each row in the matrix. The D* Lite algorithm has been used to calculate the optimum path between AGVs and goals by avoiding static obstacles. By developing simulation software, the problem model was adapted and the operation of the cloud system was tested. Simulation results showed that the developed cloud system was successfully implemented. Although the developed cloud system has been applied as a case study in fabric finishing workshops with a complex structure, it can be used in different sectors as its logistic processes are similar.},

ABSTRACT = {In scientific and technical diving, the survey of unknown or partially unexplored areas is a common task that requires an accurate planning for ensuring the optimal use of resources and the divers&rsquo; safety. In particular, in any kind of diving activity, it is essential to foresee the &ldquo;dive profile&rdquo; that represents the diver&rsquo;s exposure to pressure over time, ensuring that the dive plan complies with the specific safety rules that have to be applied in accordance with the diver&rsquo;s qualification and the environmental conditions. This paper presents a novel approach to dive planning based on an original underwater pathfinding algorithm that computes the best 3D path to follow during the dive in order to be able to maximise the number of points of interest (POIs) visited, while taking into account the safety limitations. The proposed approach, for the first time, considers the morphology of the 3D space in which the dive takes place to compute the best path, taking into account the decompression limits and avoiding the obstacles through the analysis of a 3D map of the site. Moreover, three different cost functions are proposed and evaluated to identify the one that could suit the divers&rsquo; needs better.},

ABSTRACT = {In rescue operations, the full time of action plays important role. It is the sum of the planning, travel, and manipulation (in the action place) phase times. The time minimization of the first two phases by autonomous vehicle for remote action is considered in the paper. For a known a priori map, the path planning consists of local optimal decisions collected next in the general algorithm of the optimal path. Such an approach significantly reduces time of path planning. The robot features and known sparse obstacles reduce the allowable robot speeds. The time of travel is calculated from an allowable velocity profile. Therefore, it can be used to estimate the travel performance. Genetic algorithm and random search-based methods for path finding with travel time optimization are used and compared in the paper. All the proposed time optimization solutions of rescue operations are checked during computer simulations, and results of the simulations are presented.},

ABSTRACT = {The Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) of air and space vehicles has been one of the spearheads of research in the aerospace field in recent times. Using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and inertial navigation systems, accuracy may be detached from range. However, these sensor-based GNC systems may cause significant errors in determining attitude and position. These effects can be ameliorated using additional sensors, independent of cumulative errors. The quadrant photodetector semiactive laser is a good candidate for such a purpose. However, GNC systems&rsquo; development and construction costs are high. Reducing costs, while maintaining safety and accuracy standards, is key for development in aerospace engineering. Advanced algorithms for getting such standards while eliminating sensors are cornerstone. The development and application of machine learning techniques to GNC poses an innovative path for reducing complexity and costs. Here, a new nonlinear hybridization algorithm, which is based on neural networks, to estimate the gravity vector is presented. Using a neural network means that once it is trained, the physical-mathematical foundations of flight are not relevant; it is the network that returns dynamics to be fed to the GNC algorithm. The gravity vector, which can be accurately predicted, is used to determine vehicle attitude without calling for gyroscopes. Nonlinear simulations based on real flight dynamics are used to train the neural networks. Then, the approach is tested and simulated together with a GNC system. Monte Carlo analysis is conducted to determine performance when uncertainty arises. Simulation results prove that the performance of the presented approach is robust and precise in a six-degree-of-freedom simulation environment.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based path following strategy for underactuated airships with magnitude and rate saturation. The Markov decision process (MDP) model for the control problem is established. Then an error bounded line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is investigated to restrain the state space. Subsequently, a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is employed to approximate the optimal action policy through trial and error. Since the optimal action policy is generated from the action space, the magnitude and rate saturation can be avoided. The simulation results, involving circular, general, broken-line, and anti-wind path following tasks, demonstrate that the proposed control scheme can transfer to new tasks without adaptation, and possesses satisfying real-time performance and robustness.},

ABSTRACT = {In this investigation, the nonlinear swing-up problem associated with the cart-pole system modeled as a multibody dynamical system is solved by developing a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of the deep RL controller applied to the cart-pole swing-up problem is carried out. To this end, the influence of modifying the physical properties of the system and the presence of dry friction forces are analyzed employing the cumulative reward during the task. Extreme limits for the modifications of the parameters are determined to prove that the neural network architecture employed in this work features enough learning capability to handle the task under modifications as high as 90% on the pendulum mass, as well as a 100% increment on the cart mass. As expected, the presence of dry friction greatly affects the performance of the controller. However, a post-training of the agent in the modified environment takes only thirty-nine episodes to find the optimal control policy, resulting in a promising path for further developments of robust controllers.},

We proved the theoretical feasibility of this method through theoretical derivation. We carried out extensive experiments in two classic real indoor environments. Experimental results show that reverse fingerprinting can be achieved. In 95% of cases, the positioning accuracy can be guaranteed to be less than 10 cm.},

ABSTRACT = {There is a significant amount of synergy between virtual reality (VR) and the field of robotics. However, it has only been in approximately the past five years that commercial immersive VR devices have been available to developers. This new availability has led to a rapid increase in research using VR devices in the field of robotics, especially in the development of VR interfaces for operating robots. In this paper, we present a systematic review on VR interfaces for robot operation that utilize commercially available immersive VR devices. A total of 41 papers published between 2016&ndash;2020 were collected for review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Papers are discussed and categorized into five categories: (1) Visualization, which focuses on displaying data or information to operators; (2) Robot Control and Planning, which focuses on connecting human input or movement to robot movement; (3) Interaction, which focuses on the development of new interaction techniques and/or identifying best interaction practices; (4) Usability, which focuses on user experiences of VR interfaces; and (5) Infrastructure, which focuses on system architectures or software to support connecting VR and robots for interface development. Additionally, we provide future directions to continue development in VR interfaces for operating robots.},

ABSTRACT = {During the last decade, the Internet of Things acted as catalyst for the big data phenomenon. As result, modern edge devices can access a huge amount of data that can be exploited to build useful services. In such a context, artificial intelligence has a key role to develop intelligent systems (e.g., intelligent cyber physical systems) that create a connecting bridge with the physical world. However, as time goes by, machine and deep learning applications are becoming more complex, requiring increasing amounts of data and training time, which makes the use of centralized approaches unsuitable. Federated learning is an emerging paradigm which enables the cooperation of edge devices to learn a shared model (while keeping private their training data), thereby abating the training time. Although federated learning is a promising technique, its implementation is difficult and brings a lot of challenges. In this paper, we present an extension of Stack4Things, a cloud platform developed in our department; leveraging its functionalities, we enabled the deployment of federated learning on edge devices without caring their heterogeneity. Experimental results show a comparison with a centralized approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of both training time and model accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, as UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) have become smaller and higher-performance, they play a very important role in the Internet of Things (IoT). Especially, UAVs are currently used not only in military fields but also in various private sectors such as IT, agriculture, logistics, construction, etc. The range is further expected to increase. Drone-related techniques need to evolve along with this change. In particular, there is a need for the development of an autonomous system in which a drone can determine and accomplish its mission even in the absence of remote control from a GCS (Ground Control Station). Responding to such requirements, there have been various studies and algorithms developed for autonomous flight systems. Especially, many ML-based (Machine-Learning-based) methods have been proposed for autonomous path finding. Unlike other studies, the proposed mechanism could enable autonomous drone path finding over a large target area without size limitations, one of the challenges of ML-based autonomous flight or driving in the real world. Specifically, we devised Multi-Layer HVIN (Hierarchical VIN) methods that increase the area applicable to autonomous flight by overlaying multiple layers. To further improve this, we developed Fisheye HVIN, which applied an adaptive map compression ratio according to the drone’s location. We also built an autonomous flight training and verification platform. Through the proposed simulation platform, it is possible to train ML-based path planning algorithms in a realistic environment that takes into account the physical characteristics of UAV movements.},

ABSTRACT = {A way to reduce the uncertainty at the output of a Kalman filter embedded into a tracker connected to an automotive RADAR sensor consists of the adaptive selection of parameters during the tracking process. Different informed strategies for automatically tuning the tracker&rsquo;s parameters and to jointly learn the parameters and state/output sequence using: expectation maximization; optimization approaches, including the simplex algorithm; coordinate descent; genetic algorithms; nonlinear programming using finite differencing to estimate the gradient; Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning; automatically tuning hyper-parameters in the least squares, were already proposed. We develop here a different semi-blind post-processing approach, which is faster and more robust. Starting from the conjecture that the trajectory is polynomial in Cartesian coordinates, our method supposes to fit the data obtained at the output of the tracker to a polynomial. We highlight, by simulations, the improvement of the estimated trajectory&rsquo;s accuracy using the polynomial fitting for single and multiple targets. We propose a new polynomial fitting method based on wavelets in two steps: denoising and polynomial part extraction, which compares favorably with the classical polynomial fitting method. The effect of the proposed post-processing methods is visible, the accuracy of targets&rsquo; trajectories estimations being hardly increased.},

This work presents a complete survey of firefighters on the current problems in their work and the potential technological solutions. Additionally, it reviews the efforts performed by the academy and industry to apply different types of robots in the context of firefighting missions. Finally, all this information is used to propose a concept of operation for the comprehensive application of drone swarms in firefighting. The proposed system is a fleet of quadcopters that individually are only able to visit waypoints and use payloads, but collectively can perform tasks of surveillance, mapping, monitoring, etc. Three operator roles are defined, each one with different access to information and functions in the mission: mission commander, team leaders, and team members. These operators take advantage of virtual and augmented reality interfaces to intuitively get the information of the scenario and, in the case of the mission commander, control the drone swarm.},

ABSTRACT = {Advances in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have paved the way for progressively higher levels of intelligence and autonomy, supporting new modes of operation, such as the one-to-many (OTM) concept, where a single human operator is responsible for monitoring and coordinating the tasks of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper presents the development and evaluation of cognitive human-machine interfaces and interactions (CHMI2) supporting adaptive automation in OTM applications. A CHMI2 system comprises a network of neurophysiological sensors and machine-learning based models for inferring user cognitive states, as well as the adaptation engine containing a set of transition logics for control/display functions and discrete autonomy levels. Models of the user&rsquo;s cognitive states are trained on past performance and neurophysiological data during an offline calibration phase, and subsequently used in the online adaptation phase for real-time inference of these cognitive states. To investigate adaptive automation in OTM applications, a scenario involving bushfire detection was developed where a single human operator is responsible for tasking multiple UAV platforms to search for and localize bushfires over a wide area. We present the architecture and design of the UAS simulation environment that was developed, together with various human-machine interface (HMI) formats and functions, to evaluate the CHMI2 system&rsquo;s feasibility through human-in-the-loop (HITL) experiments. The CHMI2 module was subsequently integrated into the simulation environment, providing the sensing, inference, and adaptation capabilities needed to realise adaptive automation. HITL experiments were performed to verify the CHMI2 module&rsquo;s functionalities in the offline calibration and online adaptation phases. In particular, results from the online adaptation phase showed that the system was able to support real-time inference and human-machine interface and interaction (HMI2) adaptation. However, the accuracy of the inferred workload was variable across the different participants (with a root mean squared error (RMSE) ranging from 0.2 to 0.6), partly due to the reduced number of neurophysiological features available as real-time inputs and also due to limited training stages in the offline calibration phase. To improve the performance of the system, future work will investigate the use of alternative machine learning techniques, additional neurophysiological input features, and a more extensive training stage.},

ABSTRACT = {The high performance and efficiency of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (multi-USV) promote the further civilian and military applications of coordinated USV. As the basis of multiple USVs&rsquo; cooperative work, considerable attention has been spent on developing the decentralized formation control of the USV swarm. Formation control of multiple USV belongs to the geometric problems of a multi-robot system. The main challenge is the way to generate and maintain the formation of a multi-robot system. The rapid development of reinforcement learning provides us with a new solution to deal with these problems. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized structure of the multi-USV system and employ reinforcement learning to deal with the formation control of a multi-USV system in a leader&ndash;follower topology. Therefore, we propose an asynchronous decentralized formation control scheme based on reinforcement learning for multiple USVs. First, a simplified USV model is established. Simultaneously, the formation shape model is built to provide formation parameters and to describe the physical relationship between USVs. Second, the advantage deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (ADDPG) is proposed. Third, formation generation policies and formation maintenance policies based on the ADDPG are proposed to form and maintain the given geometry structure of the team of USVs during movement. Moreover, three new reward functions are designed and utilized to promote policy learning. Finally, various experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed formation control scheme. Simulation results and contrast experiments demonstrate the efficiency and stability of the formation control scheme.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, solutions for precise maneuvering of an autonomous small (e.g., 350-class) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are designed and implemented from smart modifications of non expensive mass market technologies. The considered class of vehicles suffers from light load, and, therefore, only a limited amount of sensors and computing devices can be installed on-board. Then, to make the prototype capable of moving autonomously along a fixed trajectory, a &ldquo;cyber-pilot&rdquo;, able on demand to replace the human operator, has been implemented on an embedded control board. This cyber-pilot overrides the commands thanks to a custom hardware signal mixer. The drone is able to localize itself in the environment without ground assistance by using a camera possibly mounted on a 3 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) gimbal suspension. A computer vision system elaborates the video stream pointing out land markers with known absolute position and orientation. This information is fused with accelerations from a 6-DOF Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to generate a &ldquo;virtual sensor&rdquo; which provides refined estimates of the pose, the absolute position, the speed and the angular velocities of the drone. Due to the importance of this sensor, several fusion strategies have been investigated. The resulting data are, finally, fed to a control algorithm featuring a number of uncoupled digital PID controllers which work to bring to zero the displacement from the desired trajectory.},

ABSTRACT = {Path planning is necessary in many applications using unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs). The main class of tasks is the planning of safe routes with minimal energy costs and/or minimal levels of emitted physical and information signals. Since the action planner is on board the UUV, the main focus is on methods and algorithms that allow it to build reference trajectories while minimizing the number of calculations. The study is devoted to the problem of the optimal route planning for a UUV with a non-uniform radiation pattern. The problem is stated in the form of two point variational problem for which necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are proved. Particular attention is paid to cases where optimality conditions are not met. These cases are directly related to found specific forms of a radiation pattern. Sufficient optimality conditions are extended on the class of two-link and multi-link motion paths. Software tools have been developed and computer simulations have been performed for various types of radiation patterns.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered a promising technique for the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication networks because of its high spectrum efficiency. In NOMA, by using successive interference cancellation (SIC) techniques at the receivers, multiple users with different channel gain can be multiplexed together in the same subchannel for concurrent transmission in the same spectrum. The simultaneously multiple transmission achieves high system throughput in NOMA. However, it also leads to more energy consumption, limiting its application in many energy-constrained scenarios. As a result, the enhancement of energy efficiency becomes a critical issue in NOMA systems. This paper focuses on efficient user clustering strategy and power allocation design of downlink NOMA systems. The energy efficiency maximization of downlink NOMA systems is formulated as an NP-hard optimization problem under maximum transmission power, minimum data transmission rate requirement, and SIC requirement. For the approximate solution with much lower complexity, we first exploit a quick suboptimal clustering method to assign each user to a subchannel. Given the user clustering result, the optimal power allocation problem is solved in two steps. By employing the Lagrangian multiplier method with Karush&ndash;Kuhn&ndash;Tucker optimality conditions, the optimal power allocation is calculated for each subchannel. In addition, then, an inter-cluster dynamic programming model is further developed to achieve the overall maximum energy efficiency. The theoretical analysis and simulations show that the proposed schemes achieve a significant energy efficiency gain compared with existing methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a promising paradigm for the fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) networks. Although D2D communication provides several benefits, including limited interference, energy efficiency, reduced delay, and network overhead, it faces a lot of technical challenges such as network architecture, and neighbor discovery, etc. The complexity of configuring D2D links and managing their interference, especially when using millimeter-wave (mmWave), inspire researchers to leverage different machine-learning (ML) techniques to address these problems towards boosting the performance of D2D networks. In this paper, a comprehensive survey about recent research activities on D2D networks will be explored with putting more emphasis on utilizing mmWave and ML methods. After exploring existing D2D research directions accompanied with their existing conventional solutions, we will show how different ML techniques can be applied to enhance the D2D networks performance over using conventional ways. Then, still open research directions in ML applications on D2D networks will be investigated including their essential needs. A case study of applying multi-armed bandit (MAB) as an efficient online ML tool to enhance the performance of neighbor discovery and selection (NDS) in mmWave D2D networks will be presented. This case study will put emphasis on the high potency of using ML solutions over using the conventional non-ML based methods for highly improving the average throughput performance of mmWave NDS.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep reinforcement learning is a promising method for training a nonlinear attitude controller for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. Until now, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated successful attitude control in simulation. However, detailed experimental investigations have not yet been conducted. This study applied deep reinforcement learning for one-degree-of-freedom pitch control in wind tunnel tests with the aim of gaining practical understandings of attitude control application. Three controllers with different discrete action choices, that is, elevator angles, were designed. The controllers with larger action rates exhibited better performance in terms of following angle-of-attack commands. The root mean square errors for tracking angle-of-attack commands decreased from 3.42&deg; to 1.99&deg; as the maximum action rate increased from 10&deg;/s to 50&deg;/s. The comparison between experimental and simulation results showed that the controller with a smaller action rate experienced the friction effect, and the controllers with larger action rates experienced fluctuating behaviors in elevator maneuvers owing to delay. The investigation of the effect of friction and delay on pitch control highlighted the importance of conducting experiments to understand actual control performances, specifically when the controllers were trained with a low-fidelity model.},

ABSTRACT = {The size and location of agricultural fields that are in active use and the type of use during the growing season are among the vital information that is needed for the careful planning and forecasting of agricultural production at national and regional scales. In areas where such data are not readily available, an independent seasonal monitoring method is needed. Remote sensing is a widely used tool to map land use types, although there are some limitations that can partly be circumvented by using, among others, multiple observations, careful feature selection and appropriate analysis methods. Here, we used Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) over the land area of Norway to map three agricultural land use classes: cereal crops, fodder crops (grass) and unused areas. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and two variants of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are implemented on SITS data of four different temporal resolutions. These enabled us to compare twelve model-dataset combinations to identify the model-dataset combination that results in the most accurate predictions. The CNN is implemented in the spectral and temporal dimensions instead of the conventional spatial dimension. Rather than using existing deep learning architectures, an autotuning procedure is implemented so that the model hyperparameters are empirically optimized during the training. The results obtained on held-out test data show that up to 94% overall accuracy and 90% Cohen&rsquo;s Kappa can be obtained when the 2D CNN is applied on the SITS data with a temporal resolution of 7 days. This is closely followed by the 1D CNN on the same dataset. However, the latter performs better than the former in predicting data outside the training set. It is further observed that cereal is predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by grass. Predicting the unused areas has been found to be difficult as there is no distinct surface condition that is common for all unused areas.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a novel visual tracking method for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in aerial scenery. To track the UAVs robustly, we present a new object proposal method that can accurately determine the object regions that are likely to exist. The proposed object proposal method is robust to small objects and severe background clutter. For this, we vote on candidate areas of the object and increase or decrease the weight of the area accordingly. Thus, the method can accurately propose the object areas that can be used to track small-sized UAVs with the assumption that their motion is smooth over time. Experimental results verify that UAVs are accurately tracked even when they are very small and the background is complex. The proposed method qualitatively and quantitatively delivers state-of-the-art performance in comparison with conventional object proposal-based methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The monitoring of heritage objects is necessary due to their continuous deterioration over time. Therefore, the joint use of the most up-to-date inspection techniques with the most innovative data processing algorithms plays an important role to apply the required prevention and conservation tasks in each case study. InfraRed Thermography (IRT) is one of the most used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques in the cultural heritage field due to its advantages in the analysis of delicate objects (i.e., undisturbed, non-contact and fast inspection of large surfaces) and its continuous evolution in both the acquisition and the processing of the data acquired. Despite the good qualitative and quantitative results obtained so far, the lack of automation in the IRT data interpretation predominates, with few automatic analyses that are limited to specific conditions and the technology of the thermographic camera. Deep Learning (DL) is a data processor with a versatile solution for highly automated analysis. Then, this paper introduces the latest state-of-the-art DL model for instance segmentation, Mask Region-Convolution Neural Network (Mask R-CNN), for the automatic detection and segmentation of the position and area of different surface and subsurface defects, respectively, in two different artistic objects belonging to the same family: Marquetry. For that, active IRT experiments are applied to each marquetry. The thermal image sequences acquired are used as input dataset in the Mask R-CNN learning process. Previously, two automatic thermal image pre-processing algorithms based on thermal fundamentals are applied to the acquired data in order to improve the contrast between defective and sound areas. Good detection and segmentation results are obtained regarding state-of-the-art IRT data processing algorithms, which experience difficulty in identifying the deepest defects in the tests. In addition, the performance of the Mask R-CNN is improved by the prior application of the proposed pre-processing algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {With the advancement of technology scaling, multi/many-core platforms are getting more attention in embedded systems due to the ever-increasing performance requirements and power efficiency. This feature size scaling, along with architectural innovations, has dramatically exacerbated the rate of manufacturing defects and physical fault-rates. As a result, in addition to providing high parallelism, such hardware platforms have introduced increasing unreliability into the system. Such systems need to be well designed to ensure long-term and application-specific reliability, especially in mixed-criticality systems, where incorrect execution of applications may cause catastrophic consequences. However, the optimal allocation of applications/tasks on multi/many-core platforms is an increasingly complex problem. Therefore, reliability-aware resource management is crucial while ensuring the application-specific Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements and optimizing other system-level performance goals. This article presents a survey of recent works that focus on reliability-aware resource management in multi-/many-core systems. We first present an overview of reliability in electronic systems, associated fault models and the various system models used in related research. Then, we present recent published articles primarily focusing on aspects such as application-specific reliability optimization, mixed-criticality awareness, and hardware resource heterogeneity. To underscore the techniques’ differences, we classify them based on the design space exploration. In the end, we briefly discuss the upcoming trends and open challenges within the domain of reliability-aware resource management for future research.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper describes a bioinspired neural-network-based approach to solve a coverage planning problem for a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles exploring critical areas. The main goal is to fully cover the map, maintaining a uniform distribution of the fleet on the map, and avoiding collisions between vehicles and other obstacles. This specific task is suitable for surveillance applications, where the uniform distribution of the fleet in the map permits them to reach any position on the map as fast as possible in emergency scenarios. To solve this problem, a bioinspired neural network structure is adopted. Specifically, the neural network consists of a grid of neurons, where each neuron has a local cost and has a local connection only with neighbor neurons. The cost of each neuron influences the cost of its neighbors, generating an attractive contribution to unvisited neurons. We introduce several controls and precautions to minimize the risk of collisions and optimize coverage planning. Then, preliminary simulations are performed in different scenarios by testing the algorithm in four maps and with fleets consisting of 3 to 10 vehicles. Results confirm the ability of the proposed approach to manage and coordinate the fleet providing the full coverage of the map in every tested scenario, avoiding collisions between vehicles, and uniformly distributing the fleet on the map.},

ABSTRACT = {This study provides an operational solution to directly connect drones to internet by means of 4G telecommunications and exploit drone acquired data, including telemetry and imagery but focusing on video transmission. The novelty of this work is the application of 4G connection to link the drone directly to a data server where video (in this case to monitor road traffic) and imagery (in the case of linear infrastructures) are processed. However, this framework is appliable to any other monitoring purpose where the goal is to send real-time video or imagery to the headquarters where the drone data is processed, analyzed, and exploited. We describe a general framework and analyze some key points, such as the hardware to use, the data stream, and the network coverage, but also the complete resulting implementation of the applied unmanned aerial system (UAS) communication system through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) featuring a long-range telemetry high-capacity video link (up to 15 Mbps, 720 p video at 30 fps with 250 ms of latency). The application results in the real-time exploitation of the video, obtaining key information for traffic managers such as vehicle tracking, vehicle classification, speed estimation, and roundabout in-out matrices. The imagery downloads and storage is also performed thorough internet, although the Structure from Motion postprocessing is not real-time due to photogrammetric workflows. In conclusion, we describe a real-case application of drone connection to internet thorough 4G network, but it can be adapted to other applications. Although 5G will -in time- surpass 4G capacities, the described framework can enhance drone performance and facilitate paths for upgrading the connection of on-board devices to the 5G network.},

ABSTRACT = {Advances in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have led to an exponential increase in their market, thanks to the development of innovative technological solutions aimed at a wide range of applications and services, such as emergencies and those related to fires. In addition, the expansion of this market has been accompanied by the birth and growth of the so-called UAV swarms. Currently, the expansion of these systems is due to their properties in terms of robustness, versatility, and efficiency. Along with these properties there is an aspect, which is still a field of study, such as autonomous and cooperative navigation of these swarms. In this paper we present an architecture that includes a set of complementary methods that allow the establishment of different control layers to enable the autonomous and cooperative navigation of a swarm of UAVs. Among the different layers, there are a global trajectory planner based on sampling, algorithms for obstacle detection and avoidance, and methods for autonomous decision making based on deep reinforcement learning. The paper shows satisfactory results for a line-of-sight based algorithm for global path planner trajectory smoothing in 2D and 3D. In addition, a novel method for autonomous navigation of UAVs based on deep reinforcement learning is shown, which has been tested in 2 different simulation environments with promising results about the use of these techniques to achieve autonomous navigation of UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a fuzzy adaptive linear active disturbance rejection control (Fuzzy-LADRC) is proposed for strong coupling and nonlinear quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). At present, UAV conveys new opportunities in the industry, such as power line inspection, petroleum conduit patrolling, and defects detection for the wind turbine, because of its advantages in flexibility, high efficiency, and economy. Usually, the scene of the UAV mission has a high risk, and there are internal sensor noise and unknown external disturbance. Thus, the attitude stability and anti-interference ability of UAV are especially essential. To solve the strong coupling problem of UAV, the dynamics model of UAV is established via the Newton-Euler method, and the coupling part of dynamics is modeled as an internal disturbance. According to the function of linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) parameters, a Fuzzy-LADRC is proposed to improve the dynamic performance of the system. The proposed control method makes full use of the adaptive ability of the fuzzy controller and the anti-interference ability of LADRC to the nonlinear and strong coupling systems. As we know, this is the first time that Fuzzy-LADRC has been used in UAV control. In the simulation, the performance indicators of four controllers, including Fuzzy-LADRC, LADRC, PID, and Fuzzy-PID are compared and analyzed. The results indicate that the average response speed of Fuzzy-LADRC is 12.65% faster than LADRC, and it is 29.25% faster than PID. The average overshoot of Fuzzy-LADRC is 17% less than LADRC and 77.75% less than PID. The proposed control method can significantly improve the response speed and anti-interference ability of UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in search and rescue (SAR) missions due to their high flexibility. A key problem in SAR missions is to search and track moving targets in an area of interest. In this paper, we focus on the problem of Cooperative Multi-UAV Observation of Multiple Moving Targets (CMUOMMT). In contrast to the existing literature, we not only optimize the average observation rate of the discovered targets, but we also emphasize the fairness of the observation of the discovered targets and the continuous exploration of the undiscovered targets, under the assumption that the total number of targets is unknown. To achieve this objective, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is proposed under the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework, where each UAV maintains four observation history maps, and maps from different UAVs within a communication range can be merged to enhance UAVs’ awareness of the environment. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to process the merged maps and generate the control commands to UAVs. The simulation results show that our policy can enable UAVs to balance between giving the discovered targets a fair observation and exploring the search region compared with other methods.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper demonstrates a route selection mechanism on a testbed with heterogeneous device-to-device (D2D) wireless communication for a 5G network scenario. The source node receives information about the primary users’ (PUs’) (or licensed users’) activities and available routes from the macrocell base station (or a central controller) and makes a decision to select a multihop route to the destination node. The source node from small cells can either choose: (a) a route with direct communication with the macrocell base station to improve the route performance; or (b) a route with D2D communication among nodes in the small cells to offload traffic from the macrocell to improve spectrum efficiency. The selected D2D route has the least PUs’ activities. The route selection mechanism is investigated on our testbed that helps to improve the accuracy of network performance measurement. In traditional testbeds, each node (e.g., Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) that serves as the front-end communication block) is connected to a single processing unit (e.g., a personal computer) via a switch using cables. In our testbed, each USRP node is connected to a separate processing unit, i.e., raspberry Pi3 B+ (or RP3), which offers three main advantages: (a) control messages and data packets are exchanged via the wireless medium; (b) separate processing units make decisions in a distributed and heterogeneous manner; and (c) the nodes are placed further apart from one another. Therefore, in the investigation of our route selection scheme, the response delay of control message exchange and the packet loss caused by the operating environment (e.g., ambient noise) are implied in our end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio measurement. Our results show an increase of end-to-end delay and a decrease of packet delivery ratio due to the transmission of control messages and data packets in the wireless medium in the presence of the dynamic PUs’ activities. Furthermore, D2D communication can offload 25% to 75% traffic from macrocell base station to small cells.},

ABSTRACT = {Path planning is one of the most important issues in the robotics field, being applied in many domains ranging from aerospace technology and military tasks to manufacturing and agriculture. Path planning is a branch of autonomous navigation. In autonomous navigation, dynamic decisions about the path have to be taken while the robot moves towards its goal. Among the navigation area, an important class of problems is Coverage Path Planning (CPP). The CPP technique is associated with determining a collision-free path that passes through all viewpoints in a specific area. This paper presents a method to perform CPP in 3D environment for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) applications, namely 3D dynamic for CPP applications (3DD-CPP). The proposed method can be deployed in an unknown environment through a combination of linear optimization and heuristics. A model to estimate cost matrices accounting for UAV power usage is proposed and evaluated for a few different flight speeds. As linear optimization methods can be computationally demanding to be used on-board a UAV, this work also proposes a distributed execution of the algorithm through fog-edge computing. Results showed that 3DD-CPP had a good performance in both local execution and fog-edge for different simulated scenarios. The proposed heuristic is capable of re-optimization, enabling execution in environments with local knowledge of the environments.},

A novel approach to generation of a reference altitude trajectory is presented, which is then tracked in a standard, though optimized, control loop. Three landing scenarios are considered, namely: minimum-time, minimum-energy, and velocity-penalized landing scenarios.

ABSTRACT = {Autopilot technology in the field of aviation has developed over many years. However, it is difficult for an autopilot system to autonomously operate a civil aircraft under bad weather conditions. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using multimodal data and preprocessing data to have a civil aircraft take off autonomously under crosswind conditions. The multimodal data include the common flight status and visual information. The preprocessing is a new design that maps some flight data by nonlinear functions based on the general flight dynamics before these data are fed into the RL model. Extensive experiments under different crosswind conditions with a professional flight simulator demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively control a civil aircraft to take off under various crosswind conditions and achieve better performance than trials without visual information or preprocessing data.},

ABSTRACT = {The number of smart cities is increasing rapidly around the world with the continuous increase of governments’ interest in exploiting Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to solve issues arising from rapid urbanization. Most smart city services rely fundamentally on ubiquitous sensing, enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies. However, WSNs in smart cities are naturally vulnerable to unavoidable external challenges like storms, fires, and other natural disasters. Such challenges pose a great threat to smart city infrastructure, including WSNs, as they might affect network connectivity or result in complete blockages of network services. However, some particular smart city services are critical, to the point where they must remain available in all situations, especially during disasters; to monitor the disaster and obtain sensory information needed for controlling it, limiting its danger, or for decision-making during rescue operations. Thus, it is crucial to design a smart-city network to maintain connectivity against such challenges. In this paper, we introduce MPResiSDN, a MultiPath Resilient routing system based on Software Defined Networking (SDN). The system introduced exploits SDN’s capabilities and aided-multipath routing to reactively provide connectivity in smart city networks in the presence of challenges. We evaluated our proposed system under simulations of different natural disasters. The results demonstrate that the system improved data delivery under the challenges by as much as 100% compared to the Spanning Tree Protocol when a suitable value for k diverse paths was selected.},

ABSTRACT = {The World Health Organization has reported that the number of worldwide urban residents is expected to reach 70% of the total world population by 2050. In the face of challenges brought about by the demographic transition, there is an urgent need to improve the accuracy of urban land-use mappings to more efficiently inform about urban planning processes. Decision-makers rely on accurate urban mappings to properly assess current plans and to develop new ones. This study investigates the effects of including conventional spectral signatures acquired by different sensors on the classification of airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds using multiple feature spaces. The proposed method applied three machine learning algorithms—ML (Maximum Likelihood), SVM (Support Vector Machines), and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network)—to classify LiDAR point clouds of a residential urban area after being geo-registered to aerial photos. The overall classification accuracy passed 97%, with height as the only geometric feature in the classifying space. Misclassifications occurred among different classes due to independent acquisition of aerial and LiDAR data as well as shadow and orthorectification problems from aerial images. Nevertheless, the outcomes are promising as they surpassed those achieved with large geometric feature spaces and are encouraging since the approach is computationally reasonable and integrates radiometric properties from affordable sensors.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper proposes a novel coordinated multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm for energy sharing among multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in order to conduct big-data processing in a distributed manner. For realizing UAV-assisted aerial surveillance or flexible mobile cellular services, robust wireless charging mechanisms are essential for delivering energy sources from charging towers (i.e., charging infrastructure) to their associated UAVs for seamless operations of autonomous UAVs in the sky. In order to actively and intelligently manage the energy resources in charging towers, a MADRL-based coordinated energy management system is desired and proposed for energy resource sharing among charging towers. When the required energy for charging UAVs is not enough in charging towers, the energy purchase from utility company (i.e., energy source provider in local energy market) is desired, which takes high costs. Therefore, the main objective of our proposed coordinated MADRL-based energy sharing learning algorithm is minimizing energy purchase from external utility companies to minimize system-operational costs. Finally, our performance evaluation results verify that the proposed coordinated MADRL-based algorithm achieves desired performance improvements.},

ABSTRACT = {The resource management in wireless networks with massive Internet of Things (IoT) users is one of the most crucial issues for the advancement of fifth-generation networks. The main objective of this study is to optimize the usage of resources for IoT networks. Firstly, the unmanned aerial vehicle is considered to be a base station for air-to-ground communications. Secondly, according to the distribution and fluctuation of signals; the IoT devices are categorized into urban and suburban clusters. This clustering helps to manage the environment easily. Thirdly, real data collection and preprocessing tasks are carried out. Fourthly, the deep reinforcement learning approach is proposed as a main system development scheme for resource management. Fifthly, K-means and round-robin scheduling algorithms are applied for clustering and managing the users’ resource requests, respectively. Then, the TensorFlow (python) programming tool is used to test the overall capability of the proposed method. Finally, this paper evaluates the proposed approach with related works based on different scenarios. According to the experimental findings, our proposed scheme shows promising outcomes. Moreover, on the evaluation tasks, the outcomes show rapid convergence, suitable for heterogeneous IoT networks, and low complexity.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, the problem of exploring an unknown environment with a team of agents and search different targets on it is considered. The key problem to be solved in multiple agents is choosing appropriate target points for the individual agents to simultaneously explore different regions of the environment. An intelligent approach is presented to coordinate several agents using a market-based model to identify the appropriate task for each agent. It is proposed to compare the fitting of the market utility function using neural networks and optimize this function using genetic algorithms to avoid heavy computation in the Non-Polynomial (NP: nondeterministic polynomial time) path-planning problem. An indoor environment inspires the proposed approach with homogeneous physical agents, and its performance is tested in simulations. The results show that the proposed approach allocates agents effectively to the environment and enables them to carry out their mission quickly.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we address the application of the flying Drone Base Stations (DBS) in order to improve the network performance. Given the high degrees of freedom of a DBS, it can change its position and adapt its trajectory according to the users movements and the target environment. A two-hop communication model, between an end-user and a macrocell through a DBS, is studied in this work. We propose Q-learning and Deep Q-learning based solutions to optimize the drone’s trajectory. Simulation results show that, by employing our proposed models, the drone can autonomously fly and adapts its mobility according to the users’ movements. Additionally, the Deep Q-learning model outperforms the Q-learning model and can be applied in more complex environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Improving the detection efficiency and maintenance benefits is one of the greatest challenges in road testing and maintenance. To address this problem, this paper presents a method for combining the you only look once (YOLO) series with 3D ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images to recognize the internal defects in asphalt pavement and compares the effectiveness of traditional detection and GPR detection by evaluating the maintenance benefits. First, traditional detection is conducted to survey and summarize the surface conditions of tested roads, which are missing the internal information. Therefore, GPR detection is implemented to acquire the images of concealed defects. Then, the YOLOv5 model with the most even performance of the six selected models is applied to achieve the rapid identification of road defects. Finally, the benefits evaluation of maintenance programs based on these two detection methods is conducted from economic and environmental perspectives. The results demonstrate that the economic scores are improved and the maintenance cost is reduced by $49,398/km based on GPR detection; the energy consumption and carbon emissions are reduced by 792,106 MJ/km (16.94%) and 56,289 kg/km (16.91%), respectively, all of which indicates the effectiveness of 3D GPR in pavement detection and maintenance.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing population across the globe makes it essential to link smart and sustainable city planning with the logistics of transporting people and goods, which will significantly contribute to how societies will face mobility in the coming years. The concept of smart mobility emerged with the popularity of smart cities and is aligned with the sustainable development goals defined by the United Nations. A reduction in traffic congestion and new route optimizations with reduced ecological footprint are some of the essential factors of smart mobility; however, other aspects must also be taken into account, such as the promotion of active mobility and inclusive mobility, encouraging the use of other types of environmentally friendly fuels and engagement with citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain and Big Data technology will serve as the main entry points and fundamental pillars to promote the rise of new innovative solutions that will change the current paradigm for cities and their citizens. Mobility-as-a-service, traffic flow optimization, the optimization of logistics and autonomous vehicles are some of the services and applications that will encompass several changes in the coming years with the transition of existing cities into smart cities. This paper provides an extensive review of the current trends and solutions presented in the scope of smart mobility and enabling technologies that support it. An overview of how smart mobility fits into smart cities is provided by characterizing its main attributes and the key benefits of using smart mobility in a smart city ecosystem. Further, this paper highlights other various opportunities and challenges related to smart mobility. Lastly, the major services and applications that are expected to arise in the coming years within smart mobility are explored with the prospective future trends and scope.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a real-time deep learning-based framework for detecting and tracking Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in video streams captured by a fixed-wing UAV is proposed. The proposed framework consists of two steps, namely intra-frame multi-UAV detection and the inter-frame multi-UAV tracking. In the detection step, a new multi-scale UAV detection Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture based on a shallow version of You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3-tiny) widened by Inception blocks is designed to extract local and global features from input video streams. Here, the widened multi-UAV detection network architecture is termed as FastUAV-NET and aims to improve UAV detection accuracy while preserving computing time of one-step deep detection algorithms in the context of UAV-UAV tracking. To detect UAVs, the FastUAV-NET architecture uses five inception units and adopts a feature pyramid network to detect UAVs. To obtain a high frame rate, the proposed method is applied to every nth frame and then the detected UAVs are tracked in intermediate frames using scalable Kernel Correlation Filter algorithm. The results on the generated UAV-UAV dataset illustrate that the proposed framework obtains 0.7916 average precision with 29 FPS performance on Jetson-TX2. The results imply that the widening of CNN network is a much more effective way than increasing the depth of CNN and leading to a good trade-off between accurate detection and real-time performance. The FastUAV-NET model will be publicly available to the research community to further advance multi-UAV-UAV detection algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {This research presents a way to improve the autonomous maneuvering capability of a four-degrees-of-freedom (4DOF) autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to perform trajectory tracking tasks in a disturbed underwater environment. This study considers four second-order input-affine nonlinear equations for the translational (x,y,z) and rotational (heading) dynamics of a real AUV subject to hydrodynamic parameter uncertainties (added mass and damping coefficients), unknown damping dynamics, and external disturbances. We proposed an identification-control scheme for each dynamic named Dynamic Neural Control System (DNCS) as a combination of an adaptive neural controller based on nonparametric identification of the effect of unknown dynamics and external disturbances, and on parametric estimation of the added mass dependent input gain. Several numerical simulations validate the satisfactory performance of the proposed DNCS tracking reference trajectories in comparison with a conventional feedback controller with no adaptive compensation. Some graphics showing dynamic approximation of the lumped disturbance as well as estimation of the parametric uncertainty are depicted, validating effective operation of the proposed DNCS when the system is almost completely unknown.},

ABSTRACT = {How to operate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) safely and efficiently in an interactive environment is challenging. A large amount of research has been devoted to improve the intelligence of a UAV while performing a mission, where finding an optimal maneuver decision-making policy of the UAV has become one of the key issues when we attempt to enable the UAV autonomy. In this paper, we propose a maneuver decision-making algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, which generates efficient maneuvers for a UAV agent to execute the airdrop mission autonomously in an interactive environment. Particularly, the training set of the learning algorithm by the Prioritized Experience Replay is constructed, that can accelerate the convergence speed of decision network training in the algorithm. It is shown that a desirable and effective maneuver decision-making policy can be found by extensive experimental results.},

ABSTRACT = {The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem has been extensively studied in order to address real-world challenges related to sequential decision making. In this setting, an agent selects the best action to be performed at time-step t, based on the past rewards received by the environment. This formulation implicitly assumes that the expected payoff for each action is kept stationary by the environment through time. Nevertheless, in many real-world applications this assumption does not hold and the agent has to face a non-stationary environment, that is, with a changing reward distribution. Thus, we present a new MAB algorithm, named f-Discounted-Sliding-Window Thompson Sampling (f-dsw TS), for non-stationary environments, that is, when the data streaming is affected by concept drift. The f-dsw TS algorithm is based on Thompson Sampling (TS) and exploits a discount factor on the reward history and an arm-related sliding window to contrast concept drift in non-stationary environments. We investigate how to combine these two sources of information, namely the discount factor and the sliding window, by means of an aggregation function f(.). In particular, we proposed a pessimistic (f=min), an optimistic (f=max), as well as an averaged (f=mean) version of the f-dsw TS algorithm. A rich set of numerical experiments is performed to evaluate the f-dsw TS algorithm compared to both stationary and non-stationary state-of-the-art TS baselines. We exploited synthetic environments (both randomly-generated and controlled) to test the MAB algorithms under different types of drift, that is, sudden/abrupt, incremental, gradual and increasing/decreasing drift. Furthermore, we adapt four real-world active learning tasks to our framework—a prediction task on crimes in the city of Baltimore, a classification task on insects species, a recommendation task on local web-news, and a time-series analysis on microbial organisms in the tropical air ecosystem. The f-dsw TS approach emerges as the best performing MAB algorithm. At least one of the versions of f-dsw TS performs better than the baselines in synthetic environments, proving the robustness of f-dsw TS under different concept drift types. Moreover, the pessimistic version (f=min) results as the most effective in all real-world tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is based on a numerical optimization method considering the target system dynamics as constraints. This optimization process requires large amount of computation power and the computation time is often unpredictable which may cause the control update rate to overrun. Therefore, the performance must be carefully balanced against the computational time. To solve the computation problem, we propose a data-based control technique based on a deep neural network (DNN). The DNN is trained with closed-loop driving data of an NMPC. The proposed "DNN control technique based on NMPC driving data" achieves control characteristics comparable to those of a well-tuned NMPC within a reasonable computation period, which is verified with an experimental scaled-car platform and realistic numerical simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {In geostationary orbit, long eclipses and the seasonal variations in the direction and intensity of the solar input can cause damage to sensitive equipment during attitude maneuvers, which may inadvertently point the equipment towards the Sun. The requirement that transmitting and receiving antennae remain pointed towards the Earth creates further restrictions to pointing directions. The aim of the study is to construct a novel geometric and reinforcement-learning-based method to determine attitude guidance maneuvers that maintain the equipment in safe and operational orientations throughout an attitude maneuver. The attitude trajectory is computed numerically using the geometric framing of Pontryagin’s maximum principle applied to the vehicle kinematics using the global matrix Lie group representation on SO(3), and the angular velocities are shaped using free parameters. The values of these free parameters are determined by a reinforcement learning algorithm to avoid the forbidden areas while maintaining the pointing in operational areas (modeled as subsets of the two-sphere of all possible pointing directions of a particular axis). The method is applied to a model geosynchronous satellite and demonstrated in a simulation.},

ABSTRACT = {Deploying of Fifth Generation and Beyond Fifth Generation (5G/B5G) wireless networks will require wider coverage, flexible connectivity, low latency, support for a large number of user devices, and more bandwidth. This article explores the paradigm that Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPASs) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are integrated as a communication platform with cellular networks using radio access. It is important to know the possibilities and ways of such integration for effective interaction with RPASs. This paper studies the issues of ensuring the required Quality of Service (QoS) during heavy traffic and the choice of necessary data transmission modes for this. Models of RPAS communication channels with different architectures were created. The relationships between models’ performance and traffic parameters were obtained using the NetCracker Professional 4.1 software. The dependencies of the Average Utilization (AU) on the Transaction Size (TS) were analyzed. The effects of different bandwidths and the Bit Error Rate (BER) were studied. The traffic characteristics in all models were compared.},

In this study, we propose a transformed structural properties method to determine the controllability and observability of robots, which is the combination of the linearization and the structural properties methods. The proposed method uses a transformation in the robot model to obtain a linear robot model with the gravity terms and uses the linearization of the gravity terms to obtain the linear robot model; this linear robot model is used to determine controllability and observability. The described combination evades the structural conditions requirement and decreases the approximation error. The proposed method is better than previous methods because the proposed method can obtain more precise controllability and observability results. The modified structural properties method is compared with the linearization method to determine the controllability and observability of three robots.},

ABSTRACT = {Current investigations into urban aerial mobility, as well as the continuing growth of global air transportation, have renewed interest in conflict detection and resolution (CD&amp;R) methods. The use of drones for applications such as package delivery, would result in traffic densities that are orders of magnitude higher than those currently observed in manned aviation. Such densities do not only make automated conflict detection and resolution a necessity, but will also force a re-evaluation of aspects such as coordination vs. priority, or state vs. intent. This paper looks into enabling a safe introduction of drones into urban airspace by setting travelling rules in the operating airspace which benefit tactical conflict resolution. First, conflicts resulting from changes of direction are added to conflict resolution with intent trajectory propagation. Second, the likelihood of aircraft with opposing headings meeting in conflict is reduced by separating traffic into different layers per heading–altitude rules. Guidelines are set in place to make sure aircraft respect the heading ranges allowed at every crossed layer. Finally, we use a reinforcement learning agent to implement variable speed limits towards creating a more homogeneous traffic situation between cruising and climbing/descending aircraft. The effects of all of these variables were tested through fast-time simulations on an open source airspace simulation platform. Results showed that we were able to improve the operational safety of several scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous navigation and collision avoidance missions represent a significant challenge for robotics systems as they generally operate in dynamic environments that require a high level of autonomy and flexible decision-making capabilities. This challenge becomes more applicable in micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) due to their limited size and computational power. This paper presents a novel approach for enabling a micro aerial vehicle system equipped with a laser range finder to autonomously navigate among obstacles and achieve a user-specified goal location in a GPS-denied environment, without the need for mapping or path planning. The proposed system uses an actor–critic-based reinforcement learning technique to train the aerial robot in a Gazebo simulator to perform a point-goal navigation task by directly mapping the noisy MAV’s state and laser scan measurements to continuous motion control. The obtained policy can perform collision-free flight in the real world while being trained entirely on a 3D simulator. Intensive simulations and real-time experiments were conducted and compared with a nonlinear model predictive control technique to show the generalization capabilities to new unseen environments, and robustness against localization noise. The obtained results demonstrate our system’s effectiveness in flying safely and reaching the desired points by planning smooth forward linear velocity and heading rates.},

ABSTRACT = {Collision-free distributed path planning for the swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a stochastic and dynamic environment is an emerging and challenging subject for research in the field of a communication system. Monitoring the methods and approaches for multi-UAVs with full area surveillance is needed in both military and civilian applications, in order to protect human beings and infrastructure, as well as their social security. To perform the path planning for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles, we propose a trajectory planner based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to derive a distributed full coverage optimal path planning, and a trajectory planner is developed using a dynamic fitness function. In this paper, to obtain dynamic fitness, we implemented the PSO algorithm independently in each UAV, by maximizing the fitness function and minimizing the cost function. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed path planning algorithm generates feasible optimal trajectories and update maps for the swarm of UAVs to surveil the entire area of interest.},

ABSTRACT = {Most Coverage Path Planning (CPP) strategies based on the minimum width of a concave polygonal area are very likely to generate non-optimal paths with many turns. This paper introduces a CPP method based on a Region Optimal Decomposition (ROD) that overcomes this limitation when applied to the path planning of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a port environment. The principle of the approach is to first apply a ROD to a Google Earth image of a port and combining the resulting sub-regions by an improved Depth-First-Search (DFS) algorithm. Finally, a genetic algorithm determines the traversal order of all sub-regions. The simulation experiments show that the combination of ROD and improved DFS algorithm can reduce the number of turns by 4.34%, increase the coverage rate by more than 10%, and shorten the non-working distance by about 29.91%. Overall, the whole approach provides a sound solution for the CPP and operations of UAVs in port environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are a class of aircraft without the presence of pilots on board. UAVs have the ability to reduce the time and cost of deliveries and to respond to emergency situations. Currently, UAVs are extensively used for data delivery and/or collection to/from dangerous or inaccessible sites. However, trajectory planning is one of the major UAV issues that needs to be solved. To address this question, we focus in this paper on determining the optimized routes to be followed by the drones for data pickup and delivery with a time window with an intermittent connectivity network, while also having the possibility to recharge the drones’ batteries on the way to their destinations. To do so, we formulated the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, and we showed how to use the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to solve this problem. Several experiments were conducted to validate the proposed algorithm by considering different scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a novel online learning-based fault detection designed for underwater robotic thruster health monitoring. In the fault detection algorithm, we build a mathematical model between the control variable and the propeller speed by fitting collected online work status data to the model. To improve the accuracy of online modeling, a multi-center PSO algorithm with memory ability is utilized to optimize the modeling parameters. Additionally, a model online update mechanism is designed to accommodate the model to the change of thruster work status and sea environment. During the operation, propeller speed of the underwater robot is predicted through the online learning-based model, and the model residuals are used for thruster health monitoring. To avoid false alarm, an adaptive fault detection strategy is established based on model online update mechanism. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated using different underwater robotics, through a sea trial data simulation, a pool test fault detection experiment and a sea trial fault detection experiment. Compared with fixed model-based method, speed prediction MAE of the online learning model is at least 37.9% lower than that of the fixed model. The online learning-based method show no misdiagnosis in experiments, while the fixed model-based method is misdiagnosed. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and robustness.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) architecture, based on which a number of vehicles are served by UAVs equipped with computation resource. Each vehicle has to offload its computing tasks to the proper MEC server on the UAV due to the limited computation ability. To counter the problems above, we first model and analyze the transmission model and the security assurance model from the vehicle to the MEC server on UAV, and the task computation model of the local vehicle and the edge UAV. Then, the vehicle offloading problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem by jointly considering the task offloading, the resource allocation, and the security assurance. For tackling this hard problem, we decouple the multi-objective optimization problem as two subproblems and propose an efficient iterative algorithm to jointly make the MEC selection decision based on the criteria of load balancing and optimize the offloading ratio and the computation resource according to the Lagrangian dual decomposition. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves significant performance superiority compared with other schemes in terms of the successful task processing ratio and the task processing delay.},

ABSTRACT = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), a UAV is employed as a mobile sink to gather data from sensor nodes. Incorporating UAV helps prolong the network lifetime and avoid the energy-hole problem faced by sensor networks. In emergency applications, timely data collection from sensor nodes and transferal of the data to the base station (BS) is a prime requisite. The timely and safe path of UAV is one of the fundamental premises for effective UWSN operations. It is essential and challenging to identify a suitable path in an environment comprising various obstacles and to ensure that the path can efficiently reach the target point. This paper proposes a hybrid path planning (HPP) algorithm for efficient data collection by assuring the shortest collision-free path for UAV in emergency environments. In the proposed HPP scheme, the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm is used to design the shortest trajectory map and the optimized artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to improve different path constraints in a three-dimensional environment. Our simulation results show that the proposed HPP outperforms the PRM and conventional ABC schemes significantly in terms of flight time, energy consumption, convergence time, and flight path.},
