ABSTRACT = {In this paper, an encryption and trust evaluation model is proposed on the basis of a blockchain in which the identities of the Aggregator Nodes (ANs) and Sensor Nodes (SNs) are stored. The authentication of ANs and SNs is performed in public and private blockchains, respectively. However, inauthentic nodes utilize the network&rsquo;s resources and perform malicious activities. Moreover, the SNs have limited energy, transmission range and computational capabilities, and are attacked by malicious nodes. Afterwards, the malicious nodes transmit wrong information of the route and increase the number of retransmissions due to which the SNs&rsquo; energy is rapidly consumed. The lifespan of the wireless sensor network is reduced due to the rapid energy dissipation of the SNs. Furthermore, the throughput increases and packet loss increase with the presence of malicious nodes in the network. The trust values of SNs are computed to eradicate the malicious nodes from the network. Secure routing in the network is performed considering residual energy and trust values of the SNs. Moreover, the Rivest&ndash;Shamir&ndash;Adleman (RSA), a cryptosystem that provides asymmetric keys, is used for securing data transmission. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of high packet delivery ratio.},

ABSTRACT = {Social distancing is crucial to restrain the spread of diseases such as COVID-19, but complete adherence to safety guidelines is not guaranteed. Monitoring social distancing through mass surveillance is paramount to develop appropriate mitigation plans and exit strategies. Nevertheless, it is a labor-intensive task that is prone to human error and tainted with plausible breaches of privacy. This paper presents a privacy-preserving adaptive social distance estimation and crowd monitoring solution for camera surveillance systems. We develop a novel person localization strategy through pose estimation, build a privacy-preserving adaptive smoothing and tracking model to mitigate occlusions and noisy/missing measurements, compute inter-personal distances in the real-world coordinates, detect social distance infractions, and identify overcrowded regions in a scene. Performance evaluation is carried out by testing the system&rsquo;s ability in person detection, localization, density estimation, anomaly recognition, and high-risk areas identification. We compare the proposed system to the latest techniques and examine the performance gain delivered by the localization and smoothing/tracking algorithms. Experimental results indicate a considerable improvement, across different metrics, when utilizing the developed system. In addition, they show its potential and functionality for applications other than social distancing.},

ABSTRACT = {Marine hydrological elements are of vital importance in marine surveys. The evolution of these elements can have a profound effect on the relationship between human activities and marine hydrology. Therefore, the detection and explanation of the evolution laws of marine hydrological elements are urgently needed. In this paper, a novel method, named Evolution Trend Recognition (ETR), is proposed to recognize the trend of ocean fronts, being the most important information in the ocean dynamic process. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the task of ocean-front trend classification. A novel classification algorithm is first proposed for recognizing the ocean-front trend, in terms of the ocean-front scale and strength. Then, the GoogLeNet Inception network is trained to classify the ocean-front trend, i.e., enhancing or attenuating. The ocean-front trend is classified using the deep neural network, as well as a physics-informed classification algorithm. The two classification results are combined to make the final decision on the trend classification. Furthermore, two novel databases were created for this research, and their generation method is described, to foster research in this direction. These two databases are called the Ocean-Front Tracking Dataset (OFTraD) and the Ocean-Front Trend Dataset (OFTreD). Moreover, experiment results show that our proposed method on OFTreD achieves a higher classification accuracy, which is 97.5%, than state-of-the-art networks. This demonstrates that the proposed ETR algorithm is highly promising for trend classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate roof information of buildings can be obtained from UAV high-resolution images. The large-scale accurate recognition of roof types (such as gabled, flat, hipped, complex and mono-pitched roofs) of rural buildings is crucial for rural planning and construction. At present, most UAV high-resolution optical images only have red, green and blue (RGB) band information, which aggravates the problems of inter-class similarity and intra-class variability of image features. Furthermore, the different roof types of rural buildings are complex, spatially scattered, and easily covered by vegetation, which in turn leads to the low accuracy of roof type identification by existing methods. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a method for identifying roof types of complex rural buildings based on visible high-resolution remote sensing images from UAVs. First, the fusion of deep learning networks with different visual features is investigated to analyze the effect of the different feature combinations of the visible difference vegetation index (VDVI) and Sobel edge detection features and UAV visible images on model recognition of rural building roof types. Secondly, an improved Mask R-CNN model is proposed to learn more complex features of different types of images of building roofs by using the ResNet152 feature extraction network with migration learning. After we obtained roof type recognition results in two test areas, we evaluated the accuracy of the results using the confusion matrix and obtained the following conclusions: (1) the model with RGB images incorporating Sobel edge detection features has the highest accuracy and enables the model to recognize more and more accurately the roof types of different morphological rural buildings, and the model recognition accuracy (Kappa coefficient (KC)) compared to that of RGB images is on average improved by 0.115; (2) compared with the original Mask R-CNN, U-Net, DeeplabV3 and PSPNet deep learning models, the improved Mask R-CNN model has the highest accuracy in recognizing the roof types of rural buildings, with F1-score, KC and OA averaging 0.777, 0.821 and 0.905, respectively. The method can obtain clear and accurate profiles and types of rural building roofs, and can be extended for green roof suitability evaluation, rooftop solar potential assessment, and other building roof surveys, management and planning.},

ABSTRACT = {The high data rates detail that internet-connected devices have been increasing exponentially. Cognitive radio (CR) is an auspicious technology used to address the resource shortage issue in wireless IoT networks. Resource optimization is considered a non-convex and nondeterministic polynomial (NP) complete problem within CR-based Internet of Things (IoT) networks (CR-IoT). Moreover, the combined optimization of conflicting objectives is a challenging issue in CR-IoT networks. In this paper, energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) are considered as conflicting optimization objectives. This research work proposed a hybrid tabu search-based stimulated algorithm (HTSA) in order to achieve Pareto optimality between EE and SE. In addition, the fuzzy-based decision is employed to achieve better Pareto optimality. The performance of the proposed HTSA approach is analyzed using different resource allocation parameters and validated through simulation results.},

ABSTRACT = {Analyzing data related to the conditions of city streets and avenues could help to make better decisions about public spending on mobility. Generally, streets and avenues are fixed as soon as they have a citizen report or when a major incident occurs. However, it is uncommon for cities to have real-time reactive systems that detect the different problems they have to fix on the pavement. This work proposes a solution to detect anomalies in streets through state analysis using sensors within the vehicles that travel daily and connecting them to a fog-computing architecture on a V2I network. The system detects and classifies the main road problems or abnormal conditions in streets and avenues using Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA), comparing roughness against a flat reference. An instrumented vehicle obtained the reference through accelerometry sensors and then sent the data through a mid-range communication system. With these data, the system compared an Artificial Neural Network (supervised MLA) and a K-Nearest Neighbor (Supervised MLA) to select the best option to handle the acquired data. This system makes it desirable to visualize the streets&rsquo; quality and map the areas with the most significant anomalies.},

ABSTRACT = {Following the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Space (IoS), we are now approaching IoP (Internet of People), or the Internet of Individuals, with the integration of chips inside people that link to other chips and the Internet. Low latency is required in order to achieve great service quality in these ambient assisted living facilities. Failures, on the other hand, are not tolerated, and assessing the performance of such systems in a real-world setting is difficult. Analytical models may be used to examine these types of systems even in the early phases of design. The performance of aged care monitoring systems is evaluated using an M/M/c/K queuing network. The model enables resource capacity, communication, and service delays to be calibrated. The proposed model was shown to be capable of predicting the system&rsquo;s MRT (mean response time) and calculating the quantity of resources required to satisfy certain user requirements. To analyze data from IoT solutions, the examined architecture incorporates cloud and fog resources. Different circumstances were analyzed as case studies, with four main characteristics taken into consideration. These case studies look into how cloud and fog resources differ. Simulations were also run to test various routing algorithms with the goal of improving performance metrics. As a result, our study can assist in the development of more sophisticated health monitoring systems without incurring additional costs.},

ABSTRACT = {Internet of Things (IoT) provides large-scale solutions for efficient resource monitoring and management. As such, the technology has been heavily integrated into domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and utilities, which led to the emergence of sustainable smart cities. The success of smart cities depends on the availability of data, as well as the quality of the data management infrastructure. IoT introduced numerous new software, hardware, and networking technologies designed for efficient and low-cost data transport, storage, and processing. However, proper selection and integration of the correct technologies is crucial to ensuring a positive return on investment for such systems.

ABSTRACT = {Traffic accident detection is an important strategy governments can use to implement policies intended to reduce accidents. They usually use techniques such as image processing, RFID devices, among others. Social network mining has emerged as a low-cost alternative. However, social networks come with several challenges such as informal language and misspellings. This paper proposes a method to extract traffic accident data from Twitter in Spanish. The method consists of four phases. The first phase establishes the data collection mechanisms. The second consists of vectorially representing the messages and classifying them as accidents or non-accidents. The third phase uses named entity recognition techniques to detect the location. In the fourth phase, locations pass through a geocoder that returns their geographic coordinates. This method was applied to Bogota city and the data on Twitter were compared with the official traffic information source; comparisons showed some influence of Twitter on the commercial and industrial area of the city. The results reveal how effective the information on accidents reported on Twitter can be. It should therefore be considered as a source of information that may complement existing detection methods.},

ABSTRACT = {With the emergence of networked devices, from the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes and cellular phones to vehicles connected to the Internet, there has been an ever-growing expansion of attack surfaces in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). In the past decade, there has been a rapid growth in the automotive industry as network-enabled and electronic devices are now integral parts of vehicular ecosystems. These include the development of automobile technologies, namely, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) and electric vehicles. Attacks on IoV may lead to malfunctioning of Electronic Control Unit (ECU), brakes, control steering issues, and door lock issues that can be fatal in CAV. To mitigate these risks, there is need for a lightweight model to identify attacks on vehicular systems. In this article, an efficient model of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is developed to detect anomalies in the vehicular system. The dataset used in this study is an In-Vehicle Network (IVN) communication protocol, i.e., Control Area Network (CAN) dataset generated in a real-time environment. The model classifies different types of attacks on vehicles into reconnaissance, Denial of Service (DoS), and fuzzing attacks. Experimentation with performance metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score are compared across a variety of classification models. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other classification models.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, technology has advanced to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), where the Internet of things (IoTs), fog computing, computer security, and cyberattacks have evolved exponentially on a large scale. The rapid development of IoT devices and networks in various forms generate enormous amounts of data which in turn demand careful authentication and security. Artificial intelligence (AI) is considered one of the most promising methods for addressing cybersecurity threats and providing security. In this study, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) that categorize, map and survey the existing literature on AI methods used to detect cybersecurity attacks in the IoT environment. The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation on most AI trending techniques in cybersecurity and state-of-art solutions. A systematic search was performed on various electronic databases (SCOPUS, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI). Out of the identified records, 80 studies published between 2016 and 2021 were selected, surveyed and carefully assessed. This review has explored deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques used in IoT security, and their effectiveness in detecting attacks. However, several studies have proposed smart intrusion detection systems (IDS) with intelligent architectural frameworks using AI to overcome the existing security and privacy challenges. It is found that support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) are among the most used methods, due to high accuracy detection another reason may be efficient memory. In addition, other methods also provide better performance such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural networks (NN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). This analysis also provides an insight into the AI roadmap to detect threats based on attack categories. Finally, we present recommendations for potential future investigations.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful technology that can be utilized throughout a construction project lifecycle. Transition to incorporate AI technologies in the construction industry has been delayed due to the lack of know-how and research. There is also a knowledge gap regarding how the public perceives AI technologies, their areas of application, prospects, and constraints in the construction industry. This study aims to explore AI technology adoption prospects and constraints in the Australian construction industry by analyzing social media data. This study adopted social media analytics, along with sentiment and content analyses of Twitter messages (n = 7906), as the methodological approach. The results revealed that: (a) robotics, internet-of-things, and machine learning are the most popular AI technologies in Australia; (b) Australian public sentiments toward AI are mostly positive, whilst some negative perceptions exist; (c) there are distinctive views on the opportunities and constraints of AI among the Australian states/territories; (d) timesaving, innovation, and digitalization are the most common AI prospects; and (e) project risk, security of data, and lack of capabilities are the most common AI constraints. This study is the first to explore AI technology adoption prospects and constraints in the Australian construction industry by analyzing social media data. The findings inform the construction industry on public perceptions and prospects and constraints of AI adoption. In addition, it advocates the search for finding the most efficient means to utilize AI technologies. The study helps public perceptions and prospects and constraints of AI adoption to be factored in construction industry technology adoption.},

ABSTRACT = {Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm such that client data are processed at the periphery of the network, as close as possible to the originating source. Since the 21st century has come to be known as the century of data due to the rapid increase in the quantity of exchanged data worldwide (especially in smart city applications such as autonomous vehicles), collecting and processing such data from sensors and Internet of Things devices operating in real time from remote locations and inhospitable operating environments almost anywhere in the world is a relevant emerging need. Indeed, edge computing is reshaping information technology and business computing. In this respect, the paper is aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of what edge computing is as well as the most relevant edge use cases, tradeoffs, and implementation considerations. In particular, this review article is focused on highlighting (i) the most recent trends relative to edge computing emerging in the research field and (ii) the main businesses that are taking operations at the edge as well as the most used edge computing platforms (both proprietary and open source). First, the paper summarizes the concept of edge computing and compares it with cloud computing. After that, we discuss the challenges of optimal server placement, data security in edge networks, hybrid edge-cloud computing, simulation platforms for edge computing, and state-of-the-art improved edge networks. Finally, we explain the edge computing applications to 5G/6G networks and industrial internet of things. Several studies review a set of attractive edge features, system architectures, and edge application platforms that impact different industry sectors. The experimental results achieved in the cited works are reported in order to prove how edge computing improves the efficiency of Internet of Things networks. On the other hand, the work highlights possible vulnerabilities and open issues emerging in the context of edge computing architectures, thus proposing future directions to be investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {Manual work accounts for one of the largest workgroups in the European manufacturing sector, and improving the training capacity, quality, and speed brings significant competitive benefits to companies. In this context, this paper presents an informed tree search on top of a Markov chain that suggests possible next assembly steps as a key component of an innovative assembly training station for manual operations. The goal of the next step suggestions is to provide support to inexperienced workers or to assist experienced workers by providing choices for the next assembly step in an automated manner without the involvement of a human trainer on site. Data stemming from 179 experiment participants, 111 factory workers, and 68 students, were used to evaluate different prediction methods. From our analysis, Markov chains fail in new scenarios and, therefore, by using an informed tree search to predict the possible next assembly step in such situations, the prediction capability of the hybrid algorithm increases significantly while providing robust solutions to unseen scenarios. The proposed method proved to be the most efficient for next assembly step prediction among all the evaluated predictors and, thus, the most suitable method for an adaptive assembly support system such as for manual operations in industry.},

ABSTRACT = {Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems, and makes application of technologies and advanced data processing techniques in agricultural field possible. Digital farming aims to use available information from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges for addressing food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The digital approaches are expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making supports. Digital twin in agriculture is a virtual representation of a farm with great potential for enhancing productivity and efficiency while declining energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of digital twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural contexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation, robotics, farm machineries, and food post-harvest processing in agricultural field. Data recording, modeling including artificial intelligence, big data, simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed. Digital twin systems can support farmers as a next generation of digitalization paradigm by continuous and real-time monitoring of physical world (farm) and updating the state of virtual world.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate short-term load forecasting can ensure the safe operation of the grid. Decomposing load data into smooth components by decomposition algorithms is a common approach to address data volatility. However, each component of the decomposition must be modeled separately for prediction, which leads to overly complex models. To solve this problem, a VMD-WSLSTM load prediction model based on Shapley values is proposed in this paper. First, the Shapley value is used to select the optimal set of special features, and then the VMD decomposition method is used to decompose the original load into several smooth components. Finally, WSLSTM is used to predict each component. Unlike the traditional LSTM model, WSLSTM can simplify the prediction model and extract common features among the components by sharing the parameters among the components. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, several control groups were used for experiments. The results show that the proposed method has higher prediction accuracy and training speed compared with traditional prediction methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to the value and importance of patient health records (PHR), security is the most critical feature of encryption over the Internet. Users that perform keyword searches to gain access to the PHR stored in the database are more susceptible to security risks. Although a blockchain-based healthcare system can guarantee security, present schemes have several flaws. Existing techniques have concentrated exclusively on data storage and have utilized blockchain as a storage database. In this research, we developed a unique deep-learning-based secure search-able blockchain as a distributed database using homomorphic encryption to enable users to securely access data via search. Our suggested study will increasingly include secure key revocation and update policies. An IoT dataset was used in this research to evaluate our suggested access control strategies and compare them to benchmark models. The proposed algorithms are implemented using smart contracts in the hyperledger tool. The suggested strategy is evaluated in comparison to existing ones. Our suggested approach significantly improves security, anonymity, and monitoring of user behavior, resulting in a more efficient blockchain-based IoT system as compared to benchmark models.},

ABSTRACT = {Big data analytics can be used by smart cities to improve their citizens&rsquo; liveability, health, and wellbeing. Social surveys and also social media can be employed to engage with their communities, and these can require sophisticated analysis techniques. This research was focused on carrying out a sentiment analysis from social surveys. Data analysis techniques using RStudio and Python were applied to several open-source datasets, which included the 2018 Social Indicators Survey dataset published by the City of Melbourne (CoM) and the Casey Next short survey 2016 dataset published by the City of Casey (CoC). The qualitative nature of the CoC dataset responses could produce rich insights using sentiment analysis, unlike the quantitative CoM dataset. RStudio analysis created word cloud visualizations and bar charts for sentiment values. These were then used to inform social media analysis via the Twitter application programming interface. The R codes were all integrated within a Shiny application to create a set of user-friendly interactive web apps that generate sentiment analysis both from the historic survey data and more immediately from the Twitter feeds. The web apps were embedded within a website that provides a customisable solution to estimate sentiment for key issues. Global sentiment was also compared between the social media approach and the 2016 survey dataset analysis and showed some correlation, although there are caveats on the use of social media for sentiment analysis. Further refinement of the methodology is required to improve the social media app and to calibrate it against analysis of recent survey data.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, the information provided by digital photographs is very complete and very relevant in different professional fields, such as scientific or forensic photography. Taking this into account, it is possible to determine the date when they were taken, as well as the type of device that they were taken with, and thus be able to locate the photograph in a specific context. This is not the case with analog photographs, which lack any information regarding the date they were taken. Extracting this information is a complicated task, so classifying each photograph according to the date it was taken is a laborious task for a human expert. Artificial intelligence techniques make it possible to determine the characteristics and classify the images automatically. Within the field of artificial intelligence, convolutional neural networks are one of the most widely used methods today. This article describes the application of convolutional neural networks to automatically classify photographs according to the year they were taken. To do this, only the photograph is used, without any additional information. The proposed method divides each photograph into several segments that are presented to the network so that it can estimate a year for each segment. Once all the segments of a photograph have been processed, a general year for the photograph is calculated from the values generated by the network for each of its segments. In this study, images taken between 1960 and 1999 were analyzed and classified using different architectures of a convolutional neural network. The computational results obtained indicate that 44% of the images were classified with an error of less than 5 years, 20.25% with a marginal error between 5 and 10 years, and 35.75% with a higher marginal error of more than 10 years. Due to the complexity of the problem, the results obtained are considered good since 64.25% of the photographs were classified with an error of less than 10 years. Another important result of the study carried out is that it was found that the color is a very important characteristic when classifying photographs by date. The results obtained show that the approach given in this study is an important starting point for this type of task and that it allows placing a photograph in a specific temporal context, thus facilitating the work of experts dedicated to scientific and forensic photography.},

ABSTRACT = {The IoT refers to the interconnection of things to the physical network that is embedded with software, sensors, and other devices to exchange information from one device to the other. The interconnection of devices means there is the possibility of challenges such as security, trustworthiness, reliability, confidentiality, and so on. To address these issues, we have proposed a novel group theory (GT)-based binary spring search (BSS) algorithm which consists of a hybrid deep neural network approach. The proposed approach effectively detects the intrusion within the IoT network. Initially, the privacy-preserving technology was implemented using a blockchain-based methodology. Security of patient health records (PHR) is the most critical aspect of cryptography over the Internet due to its value and importance, preferably in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Search keywords access mechanism is one of the typical approaches used to access PHR from a database, but it is susceptible to various security vulnerabilities. Although blockchain-enabled healthcare systems provide security, it may lead to some loopholes in the existing state of the art. In literature, blockchain-enabled frameworks have been presented to resolve those issues. However, these methods have primarily focused on data storage and blockchain is used as a database. In this paper, blockchain as a distributed database is proposed with a homomorphic encryption technique to ensure a secure search and keywords-based access to the database. Additionally, the proposed approach provides a secure key revocation mechanism and updates various policies accordingly. As a result, a secure patient healthcare data access scheme is devised, which integrates blockchain and trust chain to fulfill the efficiency and security issues in the current schemes for sharing both types of digital healthcare data. Hence, our proposed approach provides more security, efficiency, and transparency with cost-effectiveness. We performed our simulations based on the blockchain-based tool Hyperledger Fabric and OrigionLab for analysis and evaluation. We compared our proposed results with the benchmark models, respectively. Our comparative analysis justifies that our proposed framework provides better security and searchable mechanism for the healthcare system.},

ABSTRACT = {This article reviews the use of wearable sensors for the monitoring of physical activity (PA) for different purposes, including assessment of gait and balance, prevention and/or detection of falls, recognition of various PAs, conduction and assessment of rehabilitation exercises and monitoring of neurological disease progression. The article provides in-depth information on the retrieved articles and discusses study shortcomings related to demographic factors, i.e., age, gender, healthy participants vs patients, and study conditions. It is well known that motion patterns change with age and the onset of illnesses, and that the risk of falling increases with age. Yet, studies including older persons are rare. Gender distribution was not even provided in several studies, and others included only, or a majority of, men. Another shortcoming is that none of the studies were conducted in real-life conditions. Hence, there is still important work to be done in order to increase the usefulness of wearable sensors in these areas. The article highlights flaws in how studies based on previously collected datasets report on study samples and the data collected, which makes the validity and generalizability of those studies low. Exceptions exist, such as the promising recently reported open dataset FallAllD, wherein a longitudinal study with older adults is ongoing.},

ABSTRACT = {Only one third of studies on the Industry 4.0&ndash;sustainability link have been conducted in manufacturing, despite its centrality to &ldquo;ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns&rdquo; (UN Sustainable Development Goal nr. 12). The European Ecodesign Directive singled out machine tools as key to the sustainability transition, not least due to their high energy usage and their increasingly becoming enmeshed in cyber-physical production systems. This paper aims to find out whether the digital transformation underway in machine tools is sustainable as well as to identify its central technological pathways. Externalities in machine tools are tracked over three decades (1990&ndash;2018) by means of a multi-method setting: (1) mapping the Technological Innovation System (TIS) of machine tools; (2) co-occurrence analysis of transnational patent families, in order to reduce geographical and market distortions (Questel&rsquo;s FAMPAT); and (3) analysis of the incidence of digital and sustainable technologies in machine tools patent applications (WIPO PATENTSCOPE). A smart sustainability transition is currently not hampered by a lack of smart technologies but rather by the sluggish introduction of sustainable machine tools. Cyber-physical and robot machine tools have been found to be central pathways to a smart sustainability transition. Implications for harnessing externalities reach beyond the machine tools industry.},

ABSTRACT = {The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the energy sector. The new behavior of industrial and non-commercial consumers changes the energy consumption model. In addition, the constraints associated with the coronavirus crisis have led to environmental effects from declining economic activity. The research is based on evidence from around the world showing significant reductions in emissions and improved air quality. This situation requires rethinking the energy development strategy, particularly the construction of smart grids as a leading direction of energy development. Evaluating the efficiency of smart grids is a vital tool for disseminating successful experience in improving their management. This paper proposes an approach to a comprehensive assessment of smart grids based on a comparative analysis of existing methods, taking into account the changes that need to be considered after the experience gained from the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach provides an accurate set of efficiency indicators for assessing smart grids to account for the direct and indirect effects of smart grids&rsquo; implementation. This evaluation approach can be helpful to policymakers in developing energy efficiency programs and implementing energy policy.},

ABSTRACT = {Data hiding is the technique of embedding data into video or audio media. With the development of deep neural networks (DNN), the quality of images generated by novel data hiding methods based on DNN is getting better. However, there is still room for the similarity between the original images and the images generated by the DNN models which were trained based on the existing hiding frameworks to improve, and it is hard for the receiver to distinguish whether the container image is from the real sender. We propose a framework by introducing a key_img for using the over-fitting characteristic of DNN and combined with difference image grafting symmetrically, named difference image grafting deep hiding (DIGDH). The key_img can be used to identify whether the container image is from the real sender easily. The experimental results show that without changing the structures of networks, the models trained based on the proposed framework can generate images with higher similarity to original cover and secret images. According to the analysis results of the steganalysis tool named StegExpose, the container images generated by the hiding model trained based on the proposed framework is closer to the random distribution.},

ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, there is tremendous growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) applications in our everyday lives. The proliferation of smart devices, sensors technology, and the Internet makes it possible to communicate between the digital and physical world seamlessly for distributed data collection, communication, and processing of several applications dynamically. However, it is a challenging task to monitor and track objects in real-time due to the distinct characteristics of the IoT system, e.g., scalability, mobility, and resource-limited nature of the devices. In this paper, we address the significant issue of IoT object tracking in real time. We propose a system called &lsquo;TrackInk&rsquo; to demonstrate our idea. TrackInk will be capable of pointing toward and taking pictures of visible satellites in the night sky, including but not limited to the International Space Station (ISS) or the moon. Data will be collected from sensors to determine the system&rsquo;s geographical location along with its 3D orientation, allowing for the system to be moved. Additionally, TrackInk will communicate with and send data to ThingSpeak for further cloud-based systems and data analysis. Our proposed system is lightweight, highly scalable, and performs efficiently in a resource-limited environment. We discuss a detailed system&rsquo;s architecture and show the performance results using a real-world hardware-based experimental setup.},

ABSTRACT = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a new multiple access method that has been considered in 5G cellular communications in recent years, and can provide better throughput than traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) to save communication bandwidth. Device-to-device (D2D) communication, as a key technology of 5G, can reuse network resources to improve the spectrum utilization of the entire communication network. Combining NOMA technology with D2D is an effective solution to improve mobile edge computing (MEC) communication throughput and user access density. Considering the estimation error of channel, we investigate the power of the transmit nodes optimization problem of NOMA-based D2D networks under the rates outage probability (OP) constraints of all single users. Specifically, under the channel statistical error model, the total system transmit power is minimized with the rate OP constraint of a single device. Unfortunately, the problem presented is thorny and non-convex. After equivalent transformation of the rate OP constraints by the Bernstein inequality, an algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) can efficiently solve this challenging non-convex problem. Numerical results show that the channel estimation error increases the power consumption of the system. We also compare NOMA with the OMA mode, and the numerical results show that the D2D offloading systems based on NOMA are superior to OMA.},

ABSTRACT = {The complexity of network intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is increasing due to the continuous increases in network traffic, various attacks and the ever-changing network environment. In addition, network traffic is asymmetric with few attack data, but the attack data are so complex that it is difficult to detect one. Many studies on improving intrusion detection performance using feature engineering have been conducted. These studies work well in the dataset environment; however, it is challenging to cope with a changing network environment. This paper proposes an intrusion detection hyperparameter control system (IDHCS) that controls and trains a deep neural network (DNN) feature extractor and k-means clustering module as a reinforcement learning model based on proximal policy optimization (PPO). An IDHCS controls the DNN feature extractor to extract the most valuable features in the network environment, and identifies intrusion through k-means clustering. Through iterative learning using the PPO-based reinforcement learning model, the system is optimized to improve performance automatically according to the network environment, where the IDHCS is used. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the system performance using the CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15 datasets. In CICIDS2017, an F1-score of 0.96552 was achieved and UNSW-NB15 achieved an F1-score of 0.94268. An experiment was conducted by merging the two datasets to build a more extensive and complex test environment. By merging datasets, the attack types in the experiment became more diverse and their patterns became more complex. An F1-score of 0.93567 was achieved in the merged dataset, indicating 97% to 99% performance compared with CICIDS2017 and UNSW-NB15. The results reveal that the proposed IDHCS improved the performance of the IDS by automating learning new types of attacks by managing intrusion detection features regardless of the network environment changes through continuous learning.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has emerged in many aspects of life, such as transportation, healthcare, and even education. IoT technology incorporates several tasks to achieve the goals for which it was developed through smart services. These services are intelligent activities that allow devices to interact with the physical world to provide suitable services to users anytime and anywhere. However, the remarkable advancement of this technology has increased the number and the mechanisms of attacks. Attackers often take advantage of the IoTs&rsquo; heterogeneity to cause trust problems and manipulate the behavior to delude devices&rsquo; reliability and the service provided through it. Consequently, trust is one of the security challenges that threatens IoT smart services. Trust management techniques have been widely used to identify untrusted behavior and isolate untrusted objects over the past few years. However, these techniques still have many limitations like ineffectiveness when dealing with a large amount of data and continuously changing behaviors. Therefore, this paper proposes a model for trust management in IoT devices and services based on the simple multi-attribute rating technique (SMART) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm. The SMART is used for calculating the trust value, while LSTM is used for identifying changes in the behavior based on the trust threshold. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using accuracy, loss rate, precision, recall, and F-measure on different data samples with different sizes. Comparisons with existing deep learning and machine learning models show superior performance with a different number of iterations. With 100 iterations, the proposed model achieved 99.87% and 99.76% of accuracy and F-measure, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet is an essential part of daily life with the expansion of businesses for maximizing profits. This technology has intensely altered the traditional shopping style in online shopping. Convenience, quick price comparison, saving traveling time, and avoiding crowds are the reasons behind the abrupt adoption of online shopping. However, in many situations, the product provided does not meet the quality, which is the primary concern of every customer. To ensure quality product provision, the whole food supply chain should be examined and managed properly. In food traceability systems, sensors are used to gather product information, which is forwarded to fog computing. However, the product information forwarded by the sensors may not be similar, as it can be modified by intruders/hackers. Moreover, consumers are interested in the product location, as well as its status, i.e., manufacturing date, expiry date, etc. Therefore, in this paper, data and account security techniques were introduced to efficiently secure product information through the Twofish algorithm and dual attestation for account verification. To improve the overall working, the proposed mechanism integrates fog computing with novel modules to efficiently monitor the product, along with increasing the efficiency of the whole working process. To validate the performance of the proposed system, a comparative simulation was performed with existing approaches in which Twofish showed notably better results in terms of encryption time, computational cost, and the identification of modification attacks.},

ABSTRACT = {Behavior modeling has multiple applications in the intelligent environment domain. It has been used in different tasks, such as the stratification of different pathologies, prediction of the user actions and activities, or modeling the energy usage. Specifically, behavior prediction can be used to forecast the future evolution of the users and to identify those behaviors that deviate from the expected conduct. In this paper, we propose the use of embeddings to represent the user actions, and study and compare several behavior prediction approaches. We test multiple model (LSTM, CNNs, GCNs, and transformers) architectures to ascertain the best approach to using embeddings for behavior modeling and also evaluate multiple embedding retrofitting approaches. To do so, we use the Kasteren dataset for intelligent environments, which is one of the most widely used datasets in the areas of activity recognition and behavior modeling.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing need for food in recent years means that environmental protection and sustainable agriculture are necessary. For this, smart agricultural systems and autonomous robots have become widespread. One of the most significant and persistent problems related to robots is 3D path planning, which is an NP-hard problem, for mobile robots. In this paper, efficient methods are proposed by two metaheuristic algorithms (Incremental Gray Wolf Optimization (I-GWO) and Expanded Gray Wolf Optimization (Ex-GWO)). The proposed methods try to find collision-free optimal paths between two points for robots without human intervention in an acceptable time with the lowest process costs and efficient use of resources in large-scale and crowded farmlands. Thanks to the methods proposed in this study, various tasks such as tracking crops can be performed efficiently by autonomous robots. The simulations are carried out using three methods, and the obtained results are compared with each other and analyzed. The relevant results show that in the proposed methods, the mobile robots avoid the obstacles successfully and obtain the optimal path cost from source to destination. According to the simulation results, the proposed method based on the Ex-GWO algorithm has a better success rate of 55.56% in optimal path cost.},

The cultivation of saffron has been immensely affected in the past few years due to the changing climate. Despite the use of different artificial methods for cultivation, hydroponic approaches using the IoT prove to give the best results. The presented study consists of potential artificial approaches used for cultivation and the selection of hydroponics as the best approach out of these based on different parameters. This paper also provides a comparative analysis of six present hydroponic approaches. The research work on different factors of saffron, such as the parameters responsible for growth, reasons for the decline in growth, and different agronomical variables, has been shown graphically. A smart hydroponic system for saffron cultivation has been proposed using the NFT (nutrient film technique) and renewable sources of energy.},

ABSTRACT = {Ever since the introduction of fifth generation (5G) mobile communications, the mobile telecommunications industry has been debating whether 5G is an &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; or &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; from the previous legacy mobile networks, but now that 5G has been commercially available for the past few years, the research direction has recently shifted towards the upcoming generation of mobile communication system, known as the sixth generation (6G), which is expected to drastically provide significant and evolutionary, if not revolutionary, improvements in mobile networks. The promise of extremely high data rates (in terabits), artificial intelligence (AI), ultra-low latency, near-zero/low energy, and immense connected devices is expected to enhance the connectivity, sustainability, and trustworthiness and provide some new services, such as truly immersive &ldquo;extended reality&rdquo; (XR), high-fidelity mobile hologram, and a new generation of entertainment. Sixth generation and its vision are still under research and open for developers and researchers to establish and develop their directions to realize future 6G technology, which is expected to be ready as early as 2028. This paper reviews 6G mobile technology, including its vision, requirements, enabling technologies, and challenges. Meanwhile, a total of 11 communication technologies, including terahertz (THz) communication, visible light communication (VLC), multiple access, coding, cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) zero-energy interface, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), and infusion of AI/machine learning (ML) in wireless transmission techniques, are presented. Moreover, this paper compares 5G and 6G in terms of services, key technologies, and enabling communications techniques. Finally, it discusses the crucial future directions and technology developments in 6G.},

ABSTRACT = {The growing importance and widespread adoption of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies have helped the enhancement of smart environments in numerous sectors such as manufacturing, smart cities, transportation and Internet of Things by providing pervasive real-time applications. In this survey, we analyze the existing research trends with respect to Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in WSN and the possible use of these methods for WSN enhancement. The main goal of data collection, aggregation and dissemination algorithms is to gather and aggregate data in an energy efficient manner so that network lifetime is enhanced. In this paper, we highlight data collection, aggregation and dissemination challenges in WSN and present a comprehensive discussion on the recent studies that utilized various AI methods to meet specific objectives of WSN, during the span of 2010 to 2021. We compare and contrast different algorithms on the basis of optimization criteria, simulation/real deployment, centralized/distributed kind, mobility and performance parameters. We conclude with possible future research directions. This would guide the reader towards an understanding of up-to-date applications of AI methods with respect to data collection, aggregation and dissemination challenges in WSN. Then, we provide a general evaluation and comparison of different AI methods used in WSNs, which will be a guide for the research community in identifying the mostly adapted methods and the benefits of using various AI methods for solving the challenges related to WSNs. Finally, we conclude the paper stating the open research issues and new possibilities for future studies.},

ABSTRACT = {Federated learning (FL) is a type of distributed machine learning approacs that trains global models through the collaboration of participants. It protects data privacy as participants only contribute local models instead of sharing private local data. However, the performance of FL highly relies on the number of participants and their contributions. When applying FL over conventional computer networks, attracting more participants, encouraging participants to contribute more local resources, and enabling efficient and effective collaboration among participants become very challenging. As software-defined networks (SDNs) enable open and flexible networking architecture with separate control and data planes, SDNs provide standardized protocols and specifications to enable fine-grained collaborations among devices. Applying FL approaches over SDNs can take use such advantages to address challenges. A SDN control plane can have multiple controllers organized in layers; the controllers in the lower layer can be placed in the network edge to deal with the asymmetries in the attached switches and hosts, and the controller in the upper layer can supervise the whole network centrally and globally. Applying FL in SDNs with a layered-distributed control plane may be able to protect the data privacy of each participant while improving collaboration among participants to produce higher-quality models over asymmetric networks. Accordingly, this paper aims to make a comprehensive survey on the related mechanisms and solutions that enable FL in SDNs. It highlights three major challenges, an incentive mechanism, privacy and security, and model aggregation, which affect the quality and quantity of participants, the security and privacy in model transferring, and the performance of the global model, respectively. The state of the art in mechanisms and solutions that can be applied to address such challenges in the current literature are categorized based on the challenges they face, followed by suggestions of future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first effort in surveying the state of the art in combining FL with SDNs.},

ABSTRACT = {Atmospheric pollution has recently drawn significant attention due to its proven adverse effects on public health and the environment. This concern has been aggravated specifically in Southeast Asia due to increasing vehicular use, industrial activity, and agricultural burning practices. Consequently, elevated PM2.5 concentrations have become a matter of intervention for national authorities who have addressed the needs of monitoring air pollution by operating ground stations. However, their spatial coverage is limited and the installation and maintenance are costly. Therefore, alternative approaches are necessary at national and regional scales. In the current paper, we investigated interpolation models to fuse PM2.5 measurements from ground stations and satellite data in an attempt to produce spatially continuous maps of PM2.5 nationwide over Thailand. Four approaches are compared, namely the inverse distance weighted (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), random forest (RF), and random forest combined with OK (RFK) leveraging on the NO2, SO2, CO, HCHO, AI, and O3 products from the Sentinel-5P satellite, regulatory-grade ground PM2.5 measurements, and topographic parameters. The results suggest that RFK is the most robust, especially when the pollution levels are moderate or extreme, achieving an RMSE value of 7.11 &mu;g/m3 and an R2 value of 0.77 during a 10-day long period in February, and an RMSE of 10.77 &mu;g/m3 and R2 and 0.91 during the entire month of March. The proposed approach can be adopted operationally and expanded by leveraging regulatory-grade stations, low-cost sensors, as well as upcoming satellite missions such as the GEMS and the Sentinel-5.},

ABSTRACT = {The proper inspection of a cracks pattern over time is a critical diagnosis step to provide a thorough knowledge of the health state of a structure. When monitoring cracks propagating on a planar surface, adopting a single-image-based approach is a more convenient (costly and logistically) solution compared to subjective operators-based solutions. Machine learning (ML)- based monitoring solutions offer the advantage of automation in crack detection; however, complex and time-consuming training must be carried out. This study presents a simple and automated ML-based crack monitoring approach implemented in open sources software that only requires a single image for training. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed conducting work in controlled and real case study sites. For both sites, the generated outputs are significant in terms of accuracy (~1 mm), repeatability (sub-mm) and precision (sub-pixel). The presented results highlight that the successful detection of cracks is achievable with only a straightforward ML-based training procedure conducted on only a single image of the multi-temporal sequence. Furthermore, the use of an innovative camera kit allowed exploiting automated acquisition and transmission fundamental for Internet of Things (IoTs) for structural health monitoring and to reduce user-based operations and increase safety.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to meet the requirements of high-tech enterprises for high power quality, high-quality operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) in smart distribution networks (SDN) is becoming increasingly important. As a significant element in enhancing the high-quality O&amp;M of SDN, situation awareness (SA) began to excite the significant interest of scholars and managers, especially after the integration of intermittent renewable energy into SDN. Specific to high-quality O&amp;M, the paper decomposes SA into three stages: detection, comprehension, and projection. In this paper, the state-of-the-art knowledge of SND SA is discussed, a review of critical technologies is presented, and a five-layer visualization framework of the SDN SA is constructed. SA detection aims to improve the SDN observability, SA comprehension is associated with the SDN operating status, and SA projection pertains to the analysis of the future SDN situation. The paper can provide researchers and utility engineers with insights into the technical achievements, barriers, and future research directions of SDN SA.},

ABSTRACT = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a sensing paradigm that allows ordinary citizens to use mobile and wearable technologies and become active observers of their surroundings. MCS services generate a massive amount of data due to the vast number of devices engaging in MCS tasks, and the intrinsic mobility of users can quickly make information obsolete, requiring efficient data processing. Our previous work shows that the Bloom filter (BF) is a promising technique to reduce the quantity of redundant data in a hierarchical edge-based MCS ecosystem, allowing users engaging in MCS tasks to make autonomous informed decisions on whether or not to transmit data. This paper extends the proposed BF algorithm to accept multiple data readings of the same type at an exact location if the MCS task requires such functionality. In addition, we thoroughly evaluate the overall behavior of our approach by taking into account the overhead generated in communication between edge servers and end-user devices on a real-world dataset. Our results indicate that using the proposed algorithm makes it possible to significantly reduce the amount of transmitted data and achieve energy savings up to 62% compared to a baseline approach.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital twin (DT) is gaining increasing attention due to its ability to present digital replicas of existing assets, processes and systems. DT can integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create real-time simulation models. These models learn and update from multiple data sources to predict their physical counterparts&rsquo; current and future conditions. This has promoted its relevance in various industries, including the construction industry (CI). However, recognising the existence of a distinct set of factors driving its adoption has not been established. Therefore, this study aims to identify the drivers and integrate them into a classification framework to enhance its understanding. Utilising popular databases, including Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, a systematic literature review of 58 relevant DT adoptions in the CI research was conducted. From the review, the drivers for DT adoption in the CI were identified and classified. The results show that developed countries such as the UK, US, Australia, and Italy have been the top countries in advancing DT adoption in the CI, while developing countries have made commendable contributions. A conceptual framework has been developed to enhance the successful adoption of DT in the CI based on 50 identified drivers. The major categories of the framework include concept-oriented drivers, production-driven drivers, operational success drivers, and preservation-driven drivers. The developed framework serves as a guide to propel DT adoption in the CI. Furthermore, this study contributes to the body of knowledge about DT adoption drivers, which is essential for DT promotion in the CI.},

ABSTRACT = {Electrical load forecasting study is required in electric power systems for different applications with respect to the specific time horizon, such as optimal operations, grid stability, Demand Side Management (DSM) and long-term strategic planning. In this context, machine learning and data analytics models represent a valuable tool to cope with the intrinsic complexity and especially design future demand-side advanced services. The main novelty in this paper is that the combination of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques is proposed to improve the forecasting capability of the hourly load on an electric power substation. A historical dataset of measured loads related to a 33/11 kV MV substation is considered in India as a case study, in order to properly validate the designed method. Based on the presented numerical results, the proposed approach proved itself to accurately predict loads with a reduced dimensionality of input data, thus minimizing the overall computational effort.},
