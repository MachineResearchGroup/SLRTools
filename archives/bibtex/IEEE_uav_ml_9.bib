abstract={Aiming at the problem of fast topology updating and low network communication efficiency in drone cluster networking, this paper proposes a new clustering routing protocol MPC-R. Based on the grey-WNN(Wavelet Neural Network) joint forecasting model, the mobile state movement factor is obtained by applying the prediction results to the direction, speed, and position evaluation factors. The clustering algorithm selects cluster heads by calculating the mobility factor and link retention time comprehensively. Passive routing discovery mechanism between clusters and active routing discovery mechanism between cluster members are used by the routing protocol for decreasing routing overhead. According to simulation, the result shows that the WNN improves forecast accuracy and improve packet delivery rate by 3 to 4 percentage points.},

abstract={Recently Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Drones have gained enormous attention in applications like military, agriculture, industry, etc. One approach of controlling the operation of a drone is using hand gestures, which enables designing a low-cost system. However, the accuracy of such a system highly depends on the gesture recognition models. We can use a neural network-based gesture recognition model, which is a widely accepted image recognition scheme. In this work, we first design three deep neural network-based gesture recognition models: simple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG-16, and ResNet-50 to uncover the best model for drone control. We evaluate the proposed models over our generated hand-gesture images in terms of their accuracy, precision, and complexity. The analysis reveals that each of the three models has its advantages and disadvantages while balancing between accuracy and complexity. For example, Simple CNN offers 92% accuracy on the testing set validation with the lowest validation loss compared to VGG-16 and ResNet-50. Thus, users can choose one of the proposed models to match their drone application.},

abstract={A novel framework is proposed for the trajectory design of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on the prediction of users' mobility information. The problem of joint trajectory design and power control is formulated for maximizing the instantaneous sum transmit rate while satisfying the rate requirement of users. In an effort to solve this pertinent problem, a three-step approach is proposed which is based on machine learning techniques. Firstly, a multi-agent Q-learning based placement algorithm is proposed for determining the optimal positions of the UAVs based on the initial location of the users. Secondly, in an effort to determine the mobility information of users based on a real dateset, their position data is collected from Twitter to describe the anonymous user- trajectories in the physical world. In the meantime, an echo state network (ESN) based prediction algorithm is proposed for predicting the future positions of users based on the real dataset. Thirdly, a proposed multi-agent Q-learning based algorithm is invoked for predicting the position of UAVs in each time slot based on the movement of users. The algorithm is proved to be able to converge to an optimal state equation. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that as the size of the reservoir pool increases, the proposed ESN approach improves the prediction accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that throughput gains of about 17% are achieved.},

abstract={Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is an promising technology for non-cooperative communication systems in both military and civilian scenarios. Recently, deep learning (DL) based AMC methods have been proposed with outstanding performances. However, both high computing cost and large model sizes are the biggest hinders for deployment of the conventional DL based methods, particularly in the application of internet-of-things (IoT) networks and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided systems. In this correspondence, a novel DL based lightweight AMC (LightAMC) method is proposed with smaller model sizes and faster computational speed. We first introduce a scaling factor for each neuron in convolutional neural network (CNN) and enforce scaling factors sparsity via compressive sensing. It can give an assist to screen out redundant neurons and then these neurons are pruned. Experimental results show that the proposed LightAMC method can effectively reduce model sizes and accelerate computation with the slight performance loss.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized to serve on-ground users with various services, e.g., computing, communication and caching, due to their mobility and flexibility. The main focus of many recent studies on UAVs is to deploy a set of homogeneous UAVs with identical capabilities controlled by one UAV owner/company to provide services. However, little attention has been paid to the issue of how to enable different UAV owners to provide services with differentiated service capabilities in a shared area. To address this issue, we propose a multi-agent imitation learning enabled UAV deployment approach to maximize both profits of UAV owners and utilities of on-ground users. Specially, a Markov game is formulated among UAV owners and we prove that a Nash equilibrium exists based on the full knowledge of the system. For online scheduling with incomplete information, we design agent policies by imitating the behaviors of corresponding experts. A novel neural network model, integrating convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks and a gradient-based policy, can be trained and executed in a fully decentralized manner with a guaranteed -Nash equilibrium. Performance results show that our algorithm has significant superiority on average profits, utilities and execution time compared with other representative algorithms.},

abstract={Aerial imaging of an open-pit mine integrated with the visual analytics offers a novel approach for routine monitoring of tension cracks for mine safety. Tension cracks may occur on work- or catch-benches that are excavated according to a computer aided design (CAD) model. The size of the tension cracks, their locations, and evolutions is commonly used to predict slope failures and to assure the mine safety operations. The goal of this research was to replace the current manual interventions with an automated platform for routine report generations for the mine controller. First, a drone was flown on a preprogrammed flight trajectory at a constant elevation to generate a mosaic and a depth map image. Next, work-, catch-benches, and access roads were automatically identified and represented by their medial axes. Subsequently, the waypoints from each medial axis were sequentially uploaded into the drone for scanning the corresponding regions at high-resolution. These high-resolution images were then used to delineate tension cracks. The delineation of tension cracks was performed using steerable filters, ENet, and UNet deep learning models for comparison. The ENet model, with the leave-one-out cross-validation method, produced the best performance profile with an Aggregated Jaccard Index and F1-Score of 0.51 and 0.79, respectively.},

abstract={With the increasing usage of UAV in reconnaissance, agriculture, logistics and entertainment, it's necessary for multi-UAV to automatically avoid the dynamic obstacles in order to ensure the safety of drones and livings in environment. The automatic obstacle avoidance is a classic multiple agent decision-making problem. Traditional algorithms, limited in the method of state classification and policy selection, are not applicable in such a complex scene including randomly dynamic scene and cooperative decision-making. In this paper, Advantaged Actor-Critic Algorithm is introduced to train multi-UAVs to automatically avoid obstacles and optimize avoidance decision-making model. Deep Q Learning, Actor-Critic (AC) and Advantaged Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm are compared. And to further maximize the performance, we specifically improved A2C algorithm towards the multi-UAV scene by sharing experiences between UAVs to expedite the training process. Our experimental result shows our Experience-shared A2C (ES-A2C) algorithm leads to a higher performance and a shorter training period.},

Even if the main goal of GNSS signal processing is the positioning, multifrequency signals are a rich source of information about the propagation environment surrounding the mobile vehicle. In urban and harsh environment, situational awareness is essential to tailor the operations and take proper countermeasure to harsh propagation conditions. Given this framework the present paper will describe the use of GNSS as signals of opportunity for the characterization of the operative environment by processing the GNSS observables through Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that can be used as efficient features extractors. The paper will present some case studies of operational scenarios for UGVs and for a static monitoring station, showing how through combining DSP techniques with both unsupervised and supervised ML algorithms (K-means classes, Support Vector Machines) it is possible to retrieve the information about the propagation scenario for multipath, interference and atmospheric limitations.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be integrated into the next generation wireless networks as new aerial mobile users, which can provide various live streaming applications such as surveillance, reconnaissance, etc. For such applications, due to the dynamic characteristics of traffic and wireless channels, how to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) is a challenging task. In this paper, with recent advances in scalable video coding (SVC), we study secure video streaming in wireless networks with UAVs. By jointly optimizing video levels selection and power allocation, the research tries to maximize the energy efficiency, which is the ratio of video quality to power consumption, while satisfying the secrecy timeout probability (STP) requirement. The aforementioned problem is modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). And then, the study employs a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, namely safe deep Q-learning network (safe-DQN), to solve the CMDP problem, in which a safety policies set is induced by constructing a Lyapunov function. Extensive simulation results with different system parameters show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with other existing reinforcement learning algorithms.},

abstract={Real-time tracking of a maneuvering aircraft is a challenging issue in the literature. For effective tracking, an accurate and complete transfer of data from aviation to ground systems is needed. However, possible data loss caused by telemetry or data acquisition system makes aircraft tracking difficult. To mitigate this problem, efficient tracking systems are proposed in the literature. Accordingly, we first present a brief survey of aircraft tracking systems by splitting them according to their approaches as mathematical, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based approaches. After examining the existing studies, we offer a real-time Deep learning-based Aircraft Tracking (DeepAT) system that enables real-time tracking of an aircraft. Deep learning models are employed to predict the next location of aircraft. Accordingly, the radar angle of the antenna is determined to the antenna or radar system directs to the next location. When the proposed model is analyzed through two potential use case scenarios which are flight tests and military applications, DeepAT offers promising solutions to prevent data loss in different applications.},

abstract={In this article, quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (QUAVs) are organized as a two-layer structure, where the first layer is leader QUAVs and the second layer is follower QUAVs. In this structure, only the leader QUAVs can receive the desired tracking information of position and attitude. Although the followers cannot obtain the given tracking information directly, they can obtain the corresponding information from leaders and other followers through the communication network based on the graph theory. In terms of this case, a distributed formation-containment (FC) control method is proposed to handle the related flight problems. We aim to develop a formation control for the leader QUAVs and a containment control for the follower QUAVs with the graph theory. Furthermore, a neural network (NN) technique is utilized to cope with the uncertainty of each QUAV. In order to guarantee good flight performance when tracking, the finite-time stability theorem is introduced into the control design to make each QUAV achieve satisfactory tacking performance in finite time. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted in the platform of two-layer 16 QUAVs to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed NN-based finite-time FC control.},

abstract={The demand for mission critical tasks, especially for tracking on the UAVs, has been increasing due to their superior mobility. Out of necessity, the ability of processing large images emerges for object detection or tracking with UAVs. As such, the requirements of low latency and lack of Internet access under some circumstances become the major challenges. In this paper, we present a modeling method of CNN that is dedicated to single object detection on the UAV without any transfer learning model. Not limited to the features learned by the transfer learning model, the single object can be selected arbitrarily and specifically, even can be distinguished from those other objects in the same category. Our modeling method introduces the inducing neural network that follows the traditional CNN and plays the role of guiding the training in a fast and efficient way with respect to the training convergence and the model capacity. Using the dataset released by DAC 2018, which contains 98 classes and 96,408 images taken by UAVs, we present how our modeling method develops the inducing neural network that integrates multi-task learning drawn from the state-of-the-art works to achieve about 50% of IoU (Intersection over Union of the ground-truth bounding boxes and predicted bounding boxes) and 20 FPS running on NVIDIA Jetson TX2. Experimental results demonstrated fast inference of an image in size of 720x1280 and the UAV navigated itself to track the target (car) using the inference result.},

abstract={In disaster areas, a large amount of data (e.g., rescue commands, road damage, and rescue experience) should be delivered among ground rescuing vehicles for safe driving and efficient rescue. When communication infrastructures are destroyed by disasters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to perform immediate rescue missions in destroyed areas and assist data sharing for ground Internet of vehicles (IoV). However, in such UAV-assisted IoV under disaster situation, there exist potential security threats on data sharing among vehicles and UAVs because of the untrusted network environment, unreliable misbehavior tracing, and low-quality shared data. To address these issues, in this article, we develop a lightweight vehicular blockchain-enabled secure (LVBS) data sharing framework in UAV-aided IoV for disaster rescue. First, we propose a novel UAV and blockchain-assisted collaborative aerial-ground network architecture in disaster areas. Second, we develop a credit-based consensus algorithm in the lightweight vehicular blockchain to securely and immutably trace misbehaviors and record data transactions for UAVs and vehicles with improved efficiency and security in reaching consensus. Third, since UAVs and vehicles have little explicit knowledge of the whole network, we develop reinforcement learning-based algorithms to optimally schedule the pricing and quality of data sharing strategies for both data contributor and data consumer via trial and error. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted, which demonstrate that LVBS can effectively improve the security of consensus phase and promote high-quality data sharing.},

abstract={To mitigate the long-term spectrum crunch problem, the FCC recently opened up the 6 GHz frequency band for unlicensed use. However, the existing spectrum sharing strategies cannot support the operation of access points in moving vehicles such as cars and UAVs. This is primarily because of the directionality-based spectrum sharing among the incumbent systems in this band and the high mobility of the moving vehicles, which together make it challenging to control the cross-system interference. In this paper we propose SwarmShare, a mobility-resilient spectrum sharing framework for swarm UAV networking in the 6 GHz band. We first present a mathematical formulation of the SwarmShare problem, where the objective is to maximize the spectral efficiency of the UAV network by jointly controlling the flight and transmission power of the UAVs and their association with the ground users, under the interference constraints of the incumbent system. We find that there are no closed-form mathematical models that can be used characterize the statistical behaviors of the aggregate interference from the UAVs to the incumbent system. Then we propose a data-driven three-phase spectrum sharing approach, including Initial Power Enforcement, Offline-dataset Guided Online Power Adaptation, and Reinforcement Learning-based UAV Optimization. We validate the effectiveness of SwarmShare through an extensive simulation campaign. Results indicate that, based on SwarmShare, the aggregate interference from the UAVs to the incumbent system can be effectively controlled below the target level without requiring the real-time cross-system channel state information. The mobility resilience of SwarmShare is also validated in coexisting networks with no precise UAV location information.},

abstract={In the process of UAV inspection, jitter often occurs, which leads to motion blur of camera when shooting images. Image blur will cause image content distortion, and even lead to the loss of edge information of target objects. The lack of image detail information will make the subsequent image processing extremely difficult and reduce the accuracy of image target detection, which hinders the popularization and practicability of UAV inspection technology. In this paper, the generation mechanism of image motion blur is studied, and a scale cycle network based image deblurring method is proposed. In this method, the image deblurring is divided into three sub problems, and three scale networks are used to realize image deblurring step by step, and LSTM network is used to realize sharing and continuous optimization of network parameters of different scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively remove image blur and suppress image ringing effect. Compare to the traditional methods, more complex motion blur problems can be solved.},

abstract={The outdoor high voltage insulators are some of the essential parts for electrical and mechanical assistance of transmission lines. Monitoring the insulators’ health frequently on a regular basis is an indispensable routine for ensuring uninterrupted power transmission. Traditionally, the monitoring is accomplished manually by linemen, which is time-consuming and implies additional logistics costs due to the long distances and various terrains associated with transmission lines. One of the most economic solutions can be condition monitoring by analysis of insulators’ images using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this regard, this study focuses on outdoor high-voltage insulators’ health monitoring by deep learning-based classification of hazardous surface conditions. To this end, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with hyperparameter optimization as well as fine-tuning pretrained deep learning models are employed to classify insulator surface conditions into one of the following four categories: clean, or covered either with snow, ice, or dust. Applying cross-validation external to the CNN hyperparameter optimization and the fine-tuning process of pretrained models yielded remarkable accuracies of 92.07% and 97.80%, respectively.},

abstract={Flowering time (time to flower after planting) is important for estimating plant development and grain yield for many crops including sorghum. Flowering time of sorghum can be approximated by counting the number of panicles (clusters of grains on a branch) across multiple dates. Traditional manual methods for panicle counting are time-consuming and tedious. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating flowering time and rapidly counting panicles using RGB images acquired by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We evaluate three different deep neural network structures for panicle counting and location.

abstract={In this paper, we present a generic fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy via reinforcement learning (RL). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The fault-tolerant control policy is trained to handle actuator and sensor fault/attack. Unlike traditional FTC, this policy does not require fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) nor tailoring the controller for specific attack scenarios. Instead, the policy is running simultaneously alongside the stabilizing controller without the need for on- detection activation. The effectiveness of the policy is compared with traditional active and passive FTC strategies against actuator and sensor faults. We compare their performance in position control tasks via simulation and experiments on quadcopters. The result shows that the strategy can effectively tolerate different types of attacks/faults and maintain the vehicle's position, outperforming the other two methods.},

abstract={Nowadays unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV's) are increasingly considered in several engineering and safety applications to explore unknown environments. Forest environments are among these environments of interest where autonomous exploration and navigation is desirable with the caveat that GPS may not be accessible for localization of the drone. Motivated by the latter, in this paper we present a methodology for autonomous navigation of UAV in forest environments, paying particular attention to competences desired in autonomous navigation, namely detection and evasion of trees. Obstacle detection is performed using a deep neural network approach trained with a limited database but that exploits transferred learning from a well-known network architecture called Alexnet. In addition to the detection of a tree, a direction of avoidance is also recognized, this is, evasion to the left or to the right is obtained with the same learning scheme. Our approached was assessed in simulation by using the simulator Gazebo and also in a real outdoors scenario populated with trees.},

pages={4757-4769},
abstract={Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) that are considered as a subset of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) can be applied in the field of transportation especially in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The routing process in these networks is a challenging task due to rapid topology changes, high vehicle mobility and frequent disconnection of links. Therefore, developing an efficient routing protocol that satisfies restriction of delay and minimum overhead is faced with many difficulties and limitations. Also, the detection of malicious vehicles is a significant task in VANETs. To address these issues, using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be helpful to cope with these limitations. In this paper, operation of UAVs in ad hoc mode and their cooperation with vehicles in VANETs are studied to help in the process of routing and detection of malicious vehicles. A routing protocol named VRU is proposed that includes two distinct ways of routing of data: (1) delivering packets of data between vehicles with the help of UAVs using a protocol named VRU_vu, and (2) routing packet of data between UAVs using a protocol named VRU_u. The NS-2.35 simulator under Linux Ubuntu 12.04 is utilized in order to appraise the performance of VRU routing components in an urban scenario. Also, VanetMobiSim generator of mobility and MobiSim are used to produce the motions of vehicles and to produce the motions of UAVs, respectively. The performance analysis displays that VRU protocol can improve the packet delivery ratio by 16% and detection ratio by 7% compared to other reviewed routing protocol. Also, VRU protocol decreases end-to-end delay by an average of 13% and overhead by 40%.},

pages={2326-2344},
abstract={Due to the advanced capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components such as vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs) and smart devices as well as the increasing amount of data generated, Federated Learning (FL) becomes a promising tool given that it enables privacy-preserving machine learning that can be implemented in the IoV. However, the performance of the FL suffers from the failure of communication links and missing nodes, especially when continuous exchanges of model parameters are required. Therefore, we propose the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the communications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources to provide services for all iterations of the FL process. In this paper, we present a joint auction-coalition formation framework to solve the allocation of UAV coalitions to groups of IoV components. Specifically, the coalition formation game is formulated to maximize the sum of individual profits of the UAVs. The joint auction-coalition formation algorithm is proposed to achieve a stable partition of UAV coalitions in which an auction scheme is applied to solve the allocation of UAV coalitions. The auction scheme is designed to take into account the preferences of IoV components over heterogeneous UAVs. The simulation results show that the grand coalition, where all UAVs join a single coalition, is not always stable due to the profit-maximizing behavior of the UAVs. In addition, we show that as the cooperation cost of the UAVs increases, the UAVs prefer to support the IoV components independently and not to form any coalition.},

abstract={Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN) is considered as the key structure of the next generation network. The space satellites and air nodes are the potential candidates to assist and offload the terrain transmissions. However, due to the high mobility of space and air nodes as well as the high dynamic of network traffic, the conventional traffic offloading strategy is not applicable for the high dynamic SAGIN. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning based traffic offloading for SAGIN by considering the high mobility of nodes as well as frequent changing network traffic and link state. In the proposal, a double Q-learning algorithm with improved delay-sensitive replay memory algorithm (DSRPM) is proposed to train the node to decide offloading strategy based on the local and neighboring historical information. Furthermore, a joint information collection with hello package and offline training mechanism is proposed to assist the proposed offloading algorithm. The simulation shows that the proposal outperforms conventional offloading algorithms in terms of signaling overhead, dynamic adaptivity, packet drop rate and transmission delay.},

abstract={Sustainable agriculture is an important field where not much attention is given though it is highly necessary, so as to monitor the growth of crops for their efficient growth in most nutritious ways. For effective growth of crops, lot of chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides are used, however, excessive usage of them results in damage to land and water resources. The attack of pests is a major criteria which affect crop yield. Various crop monitoring technologies are available which are highly expensive and not all farmers can afford. Moreover in India, farmers are not capable of understanding the operation and handling of such sophisticated technology. In this paper, we propose a system which is cheaper and easy to operate with multiple application. The proposed system uses a technology which utilizes machine learning and ANN algorithms using UAV that helps us to locate regions that are affected by diseases and pesticides so that we can particularly focus on the regions that are affected and apply chemicals only in that particular area, with the entire system being cost effective. For this purpose, we divide the entire area into n x n segments and using image processing, the segmented areas are analysed and processed using Ardupilot and a central operating system to monitor using python and open CV, giving the simplest user interface for monitoring purposes.},

year={2021},
volume={51},
number={4},
pages={1913-1928},
abstract={This paper studies the fault-tolerant control (FTC) problem for unknown affine nonlinear systems with actuators faults. The considered types of faults are stuck (lock-in-place), loss-in-effectiveness (LIE), and bias, under which a part of the actuators is disabled. The objective is to find the remaining (not fully LIE) actuators, and manipulate them to obtain the best achievable performance in real time. First, considering that the best achievable performance is determined by the remaining actuators, a set of basic policies is predesigned with multiple levels of performances for different groups of activated actuators. Second, an identifier is designed based on history data to find the remaining actuators and, thus, the suitable predesigned basic policy. Third, to further accommodate the partial LIEs and biases, a compensator works together with the selected basic policy, to build the predesigned performance. In addressing the FTC problem, several techniques are developed: adjustable mechanisms are novelly integrated to deal with the state-dependent nonlinearities in neural network (NN) approximation, disturbances, and mismatch errors; history data are newly applied to estimate the faulty parameters; and a compensator is specially designed to deal with LIEs and biases in different input channels. Also in theory, the convergences of algorithms and the stability of closed-loop systems are proved, by formally giving the invariant sets of the initial state and the NN weights. Unlike the existing FTC methods dealing with LIE and bias based on model information to optimize the tracking error, this result can handle stuck faults without knowing system dynamics and satisfy different levels of performances described by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Finally, a simulation example of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FTC scheme.},

abstract={The new era of small UAVs necessitates intelligent approaches towards the issue of fault diagnosis to ensure a safe flight. A recent attempt to accommodate quite a number of UAVs in the airspace requires to assure a safety level. The hardware limitations for these small vehicles point the utilization of analytical redundancy rather than the usual practice of hardware redundancy in the conventional flights. In the course of this study, fault detection and diagnosis for aircraft is reviewed. An approach of implementing machine learning practices to diagnose faults on a small fixed-wing is selected. The selection criteria behind is that, data-driven fault diagnosis enables avoiding the burden of accurate modeling needed in model-based fault diagnosis. In this study, first, a model of an aircraft is simulated. This model is not used for the design of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) algorithms, but instead utilized to generate data and test the designed algorithms. The measurements are simulated using the statistics of the hardware in the house. Simulated data is opted instead of flight data to isolate the probable effects of the controller on the diagnosis, which will complicate this preliminary study on FDD for drones. A supervised classification method, SVM (Support Vector Machines) is used to classify the faulty and nominal flight conditions. The features selected are the gyro and accelerometer measurements. The fault considered is loss of effectiveness in the control surfaces of the drone. Principle component analysis is used to investigate the data by reducing the feature space dimension. The training is held offline due to the need of labeled data. The results show that for simulated measurements, SVM gives very accurate results on the classification of loss of effectiveness fault on the control surfaces.},

abstract={In this paper, we present JanusNet, an efficient CNN model that can perform online background subtraction and robustly detect moving targets using resource-constrained computational hardware on-board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Most of the existing work on background sub-traction either assume that the camera is stationary or make limiting assumptions about the motion of the camera, the structure of the scene under observation, or the apparent motion of the background in video. JanusNet does not have these limitations and therefore, is applicable to a variety of UAV applications. JanusNet learns to extract and combine motion and appearance features to separate background and foreground to generate accurate pixel-wise masks of the moving objects. The network is trained using a simulated video dataset (generated using Unreal Engine 4) with ground-truth labels. Results on UCF Aerial and Kaggle Drone videos datasets show that the learned model transfers well to real UAV videos and can robustly detect moving targets in a wide variety of scenarios. Moreover, experiments on CDNet dataset demonstrate that even without explicitly assuming that the camera is stationary, the performance of JanusNet is comparable to traditional background subtraction methods.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are emerging as a powerful tool for various industrial and smart city applications. UAVs coupled with various sensors can perform many cognitive tasks such as object detection, surveillance, traffic management, and urban planning. Deep learning has emerged as a popular technique to speed up the processing of high-dimensional data like images and videos, which has led to several applications in surveillance and autonomous driving. However, the area of aerial object detection has been understudied. This work proposes a deep learning approach for detection of objects in aerial scenes captured by UAVs. Our work first categorizes the current methods for aerial object detection using deep learning techniques and discusses how the task is different from general object detection scenarios. We delineate the specific challenges involved and experimentally demonstrate the key design decisions that significantly affect the accuracy and robustness of models. We further propose an optimized architecture that utilizes these optimal design choices along with the recent Res-NeSt backbone to achieve superior performance in aerial object detection. Lastly, we propose several research directions to inspire further advancement in aerial object detection.},

abstract={To solve the problem of repeated search, static targets and low efficiency in cooperative search for multi-DAVs, a method based on pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) and Markov is proposed. Firstly, a honeycomb environmental model similar to the sensor detect region is established to reduce repeated search for the area. Secondly, Markov chain with the Gaussian distribution is used to represent dynamic movement of targets. Thirdly, the Cauchy mutation and Gaussian mutation are introduced into the map and compass operator and the landmark operator of PIO, respectively. Meanwhile, simulated annealing (SA) mechanism is exploited to reserve the worse individual, so as to effectively reduce the problem that PIO is easy to fall into local optimum. Finally, the algorithm is compared with other swarm intelligence algorithms through simulation experiments. The results show that the new method is effective and available.},

abstract={With the spread of novel coronavirus, global health concerns have increased as it has flattened the curve of mortality worldwide. To handle such a containment of disease, multi-swarm Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with 5G can be used to reduce human intervention with major benefits of high bandwidth, ultra-low-latency, and reliability. Multi-swarm UAVs sends a huge amount of data to ground stations with real-time connection density of 107/km2, which is a bottleneck on 5G networks; data security is another issue in sharing sensitive data. Motivated by these issues, in this article, we propose a blockchain-envisioned softwarized multi-swarming UAV communication scheme based on a 6G network with intelligent connectivity, Terahertz (THz) frequency bands, and virtualization of link and physical-level protocols. Softwarization makes the communication infrastructure flexible, agile, and easily configurable, and the potential of blockchain supports data security. Results show that the proposed scheme performs better in terms of processing delay, packet loss reduction, and throughput compared to exiting 4G/5G-based systems.},

To address these concerns, robust UAV detection systems are required. In this work, we propose an UAV detection framework based on video images. Depending on whether the video images are recorded by static cameras or moving cameras, we initially detect regions that are likely to contain an object by median background subtraction or a deep learning based object proposal method, respectively. Then, the detected regions are classified into UAV or distractors, such as birds, by applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier. To train this classifier, we use our own dataset comprised of crawled and self-acquired drone images, as well as bird images from a publicly available dataset. We show that, even across a significant domain gap, the resulting classifier can successfully identify UAVs in our target dataset. We evaluate our UAV detection framework on six challenging video sequences that contain UAVs at different distances as well as birds and background motion.},

abstract={Autonomous navigation systems on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multiple sensors are essential to various applications in the smart city and intelligent transportation. However, the general autonomous navigation models are markedly influenced by the prior knowledge from training environments, which in turn are not applicable in unknown environments. To address this issue, we propose an online autonomous UAV navigation system named as multi-sensor data-fusion-based autonomous navigation (MDFAN) system for unknown flight environments, including the collision avoidance and path planning. Specifically, first, the newly MDFAN system formulates the navigation problem as a decision-making path planning problem to reduce the dependence of prior knowledge of the flight environment. Secondly, we develop a multi-sensor data-fusion-based method to extract more effective local environment information for mining the inherent inter-relationship between the local environment information and the current state of the UAV. Thirdly, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method for handling uncertain situations of the unknown environment. Finally, we validated our method both on the simulated and real-world environments.},

We modeled Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS) integrated navigation system and then trained the estimator using IMU and GNSS data which is sampled in real flight. Further, we tested the proposed algorithm on another real-sampled dataset of UAV and compared its performance with classical KF and Sage-Husa adaptive Filter (SHF).

abstract={As one of today's popular research field, autonomous unmanned systems are widely used in entertainment, search and rescue, health, military, agriculture and many other fields with the advantages of technological developments. Object detection is one of the methods used for autonomous vehicles to gather and report information about its environment during mission. With the ability to detect and classify objects, an unmanned vehicle can determine the type and number of objects around it and use this information in its autonomous motion and path planning or reporting the objects with the desired features. In an indoor environment, the data coming from an optic sensor provides enough capability to detect crossing points for an intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle such as doors, windows and stairs. However, sliding objects like windows and doors need to be classified as open or closed if this information will be used for path planning. Moreover, the crossing point's width needs to be calculated to ensure it is safe to go through it. So as to provide a robust navigation plan, LIDAR sensor data can be used to ensure object classification. In this study, a method to fuse LIDAR and optic sensors data has been developed and by the way a stronger object detection method is created. A crossing point is classified as an open/closed and determined whether to have enough space or not to pass through. This method was operated in a developer board mountable in a flying quadrotor which makes it possible to use it in a real-time scenario. The success of the approach has been shown with different scenarios.},

abstract={With the development of technology, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are getting closer to peoples life. Multiple UAV nodes form the Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET). Due to the high mobility of the UAV nodes, the topology of the flight ad hoc network also changes rapidly. Aiming at the problem of the high average number of hops and low link connectivity, this paper adopts a fuzzy logic reinforcement learning-based routing algorithm for flying ad hoc networks. The fuzzy logic mainly determines the neighbor nodes of a node in real time. Reinforcement learning reduces the average number of hops of the route determined by fuzzy logic through continuous training. Compared with the ant colony algorithm optimization(ACO), the proposed FANET routing algorithm has significant improvement in both link success rate and average hop count. The situation is more perfect and it can better meet the requirements of the network.},

abstract={This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based motion control method to provide unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with additional flexibility while flying across dynamic unknown environments autonomously. This method is applicable in both military and civilian fields such as penetration and rescue. The autonomous motion control problem is addressed through motion planning, action interpretation, trajectory tracking, and vehicle movement within the DRL framework. Novel DRL algorithms are presented by combining two difference-amplifying approaches with traditional DRL methods and are used for solving the motion planning problem. An improved Lyapunov guidance vector field (LGVF) method is used to handle the trajectory-tracking problem and provide guidance control commands for the UAV. In contrast to conventional motion-control approaches, the proposed methods directly map the sensorbased detections and measurements into control signals for the inner loop of the UAV, i.e., an end-to-end control. The training experiment results show that the novel DRL algorithms provide more than a 20% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art DRL algorithms. The testing experiment results demonstrate that the controller based on the novel DRL and LGVF, which is only trained once in a static environment, enables the UAV to fly autonomously in various dynamic unknown environments. Thus, the proposed technique provides strong flexibility for the controller.},

abstract={When a certain UAV conduct a predetermined task, its flying track is planned in advance. The accumulated historical data of position information and respective state of the error can be used to diagnose the real time motion and position information deviation of the UAV-born inertial navigation devices through BP-Adaboost methods. The relationship between the position information deviation and characteristic parameters of UAV-born Inertial Navigation Device are in a high level of nonlinearity. As an efficacious non-linear classifier, BP neural network is capable of delineating the above nonlinear relationship. However, the performance and preciseness of the BP network are sensitively subject to the infuence of its initial weights, which is likely to incur the relatively unstable training outcomes. In order to address the contradiction and attain the training results we want, this paper provides a new approach to the UAV-born inertial navigation devices failure diagnosis based on BPAdaboost model. The first step is utilizing BP neural network as a weak classifier to discern the relationship between the failure states and the parameters. Each of the several BP networks chosen beforehand are applied to the repeated training process to become weak classifier one by one. Secondly, Adaboost algorithm is conducted by amalgamating the volidated weak classifier aiming at a strong classifier to diagnose the failure of UAV-born Inertial Navigation Device. Then, application of the BP-Adaboost method to a practical cases evinces that the failure diagnosis model of the strong classifier gains more satisfied accuracy than the weak classifiers, which can meet the requirements of the practices and offer another reference for the position deviation judgment during some repeating tasks for UAV-born inertial navigation devices, especially under the condition that GPS and inertial navigation devices are not stable and reliable.},

The proposal is evaluated using a database of real scene images, which were classified by K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and prepared with the support of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Experimental tests show a low relative error of approximately 1.65% compared to manual mapping in the planting regions.

abstract={Due to the advanced capabilities of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) components such as vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs) and smart devices as well as the increasing amount of data generated, Federated Learning (FL) becomes a promising tool given that it enables privacy-preserving machine learning. However, the performance of the FL suffers from the failure of communication links and missing nodes. Therefore, we propose the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as wireless relays to facilitate the communications between the IoV components and the FL server and thus improving the accuracy of the FL. However, a single UAV may not have sufficient resources for all iterations of the FL process. In this paper, we present a joint auction-coalition formation framework. The joint auctioncoalition formation algorithm is proposed to achieve a stable partition of UAV coalitions in which an auction scheme is applied. The auction scheme is designed to take into account the preferences of IoV components over heterogeneous UAVs. The simulation results show that the grand coalition, where all UAVs join a single coalition, is not always stable due to the profitmaximizing behavior of the UAVs. In addition, we show that as the cooperation cost of the UAVs increases, the UAVs prefer not to form any coalition.},

abstract={Modern surveillance networks are able to provide trajectories of all kind of vessels and aircrafts within worldwide or at least extended environment. Most widely used are Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B) and (Satellite-) Automatic Identification System (AIS) used within air and maritime surveillance. Both of them are cooperative systems. Besides these systems, sensor networks based on ground installations or mounted on airborne and space-based platforms deliver object trajectories independent of any cooperation. Examples include GMTI radar-based systems operating on UAV platforms and coastal or air traffic control sensor network installations. These surveillance systems provide mid- and long-term trajectories. The challenging part is the related situational awareness and the estimation of the intent of the tracked objects. New technologies include activity-based intelligence and the determination of patterns of life. An approach for these technologies can be found in the advanced analysis of those trajectories, which are extracted by the mentioned surveillance systems. Trajectories are partitioned into specific segments of interest using cluster algorithms. This helps to decode their pattern of life based on unsupervised machine learning. Trajectories are aggregated into different routes with dedicated representatives. Calculated probabilities indicate the frequentation of these routes. This allows predictive analytics and the identification of anomalous behaviour. Finally, these new data analytic techniques have to be integrated in existing near real time surveillance systems. This requires specific system architectures as well as a completely new software and hardware landscape. So, trajectory-based Machine Learning is embedded in local or global clouds and uses dedicated mechanisms for distributed and parallel processing.},

abstract={Most of the drone-based applications require a time-limited access to the spectrum to complete data transmission due to limited battery capacity of these flying units. This paper proposes an efficient spectrum and energy management solution by integrating the overlay cognitive radio technology. Therefore, we aim to use the drone as a secondary node and target to determine an optimized three-dimensional location and a resource control solution by which it can complete its data transfer and in parallel support the primary communication. To this end, a non-convex optimization problem is developed. The obtained solution minimizes the total energy consumption of the drone and, at the same time, maintains the required data rate level of the spectrum's owner. A resource allocation procedure and swarm intelligence-based positioning algorithm are jointly designed for this purpose. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed approach in terms of energy consumption savings and additional transmission opportunities as compared to other schemes.},

abstract={Many software engineering tasks, such as testing, debugging, and anomaly detection can benefit from the ability to infer a behavioral model of the software. Most existing inference approaches assume access to code to collect execution sequences. In this paper, we investigate a black-box scenario, where the system under analysis cannot be instrumented, in this fashion. This scenario is particularly prevalent with control systems log analysis in the form of continuous signals. In this situation, an execution trace amounts to a multivariate time-series of input and output signals, where different states of the system correspond to different phases in the time-series. From an inference perspective, the challenge is to detect when these phase changes take place. Unfortunately, most existing solutions are either univariate, make assumptions on the data distribution, or have limited learning power. Therefore, we propose a hybrid deep neural network that accepts as input a multivariate time series and applies a set of convolutional and recurrent layers to learn the non-linear correlations between signals and the patterns over time. We show how this approach can be used to accurately detect state changes, and how the inferred {\color{blue}machine learning} models can be successfully applied to transfer-learning scenarios, to accurately process traces from different products with similar execution characteristics. Our experimental results on two UAV autopilot case studies (one industrial and one open-source) indicate that our approach is highly accurate (over 90\% F1 score for state classification) and significantly improves baselines (by up to 102\% for change point detection). Using transfer learning we also show that up to 90\% of the maximum achievable F1 scores in the open-source case study can be achieved by reusing the trained models from the industrial case and only fine tuning them using as low as 5 labeled samples, which reduces the manual labeling effort by 98\%.},

abstract={This paper presents a review of the various control strategies that have been conducted to address and resolve several challenges for a particular category of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the emphasis of which is on the rotorcraft or rotary-wing systems. Initially, a brief overview of the important relevant definitions, configurations, components, advantages/disadvantages, and applications of the UAVs is first introduced in general, encompassing a wide spectrum of the flying machines. Subsequently, the focus is more on the two most common and versatile rotorcraft UAVs, namely, the twin-rotor and quadrotor systems. Starting with a brief background on the dual-rotor helicopter and a quadcopter, the full detailed mathematical dynamic model of each system is derived based on the Euler-Lagrange and Newton-Euler methods, considering a number of assumptions and considerations. Then, a state-of-the-art review of the diverse control strategies for controlling the rotorcraft systems with conceivable solutions when the systems are subjected to the different impediments is demonstrated. To counter some of these limitations and adverse operating/loading conditions in the UAVs, several innovative control techniques are particularly highlighted, and their performance are duly analyzed, discussed, and compared. The applied control techniques are deemed to produce a useful contribution to their successful implementation in the wake of varied constraints and demanding environments that result in a degree of robustness and efficacy. Some of the off-the-shelf developments in the rotorcraft systems for research and commercial applications are also presented.},

However, a critical issue, collision avoidance, must be fully considered in this scenario. Herein, we study the efficient UAV navigation problem considering the safety issue near an airport. In detail, we first define the safe separation between the UAV and airplanes according to related aviation regulations. Thereafter, an effective tree-based scheme for navigating the UAV has been proposed to cope with the extra uncertainties induced by keeping the safe separation. An analytical derivation of the UAV's flying time is conducted to determine the optimal battery life.

abstract={Military radar can not only provide kinematic information (position, speed, and course) of land, sea, and air targets during day and night in all weather conditions, but also provides information about the type of target using micro Doppler properties. The micro -Doppler properties of a target are determined by the moving parts on the target body. The number, location, and type of motion of these parts are specific for a given target type and consequently the related micro -Doppler signature can be exploited for classification. Analysis of the micro -Doppler signature may provide detailed properties of rotating parts, such as the rotation rate, number of blades, and blade length. However, for operators and/or image analysts, the interpretation and understanding of radar micro -Doppler spectrograms is much more difficult and time-consuming than the analysis of optical images because of the different nature of the radar imaging principle and target scattering mechanisms. Consequently, there is a need for automatic target recognition (ATR) in radar using micro -Doppler spectrograms.},

abstract={Using airborne cameras and guiding UAVs to track moving ground targets is an important aspect of the applications of UAVs. In this paper, a visual target tracking algorithm for airborne cameras is designed based on such application scenarios. During the dynamic changes in the relative positions of the target and UAV, the algorithm continuously uses the current target image to simulate and generate the possible pseudo-image of the target after rotation, which is a linear rotate subspace, and generate pseudo-filters. In the process of tracking it determines whether to update the target image and the corresponding filter by tracking performance, and thus improves the stability of visual tracking. The proposed algorithm is tested on the data set from the UAV tracking perspective, and results show that the tracking accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm are higher than those of the current mainstream tracking algorithms.},

abstract={Object tracking remains one of the fundamental problems of computer vision since it becomes difficult under some realistic conditions such as fast camera movement, occlusion and similar of objects to the tracked targets. As a real-world application, tracking objects using cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become very popular. With the increasing availability of small single board computers with high parallel processing power capabilities, tracking of objects by using onboard computers within UAVs in real-time has become feasible. Although these onboard computers allow a wide variety of computer vision methods to be executed on a UAV, there is still a need to optimize these methods for running time and power consumption. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method for a UAV to detect and track other UAVs efficiently. To detect the target UAV at the beginning of the video and in the case where the tracked UAV has been lost, we use the deep learning-based YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-Tiny models, which provide one of the best trade-offs between speed and accuracy in the literature. To track the detected UAVs in real-time, a kernelized correlation filter is used. Combining these two methods provides high accuracy and speed even on onboard computers. To train the neural nets and test our method, we have collected a new dataset composed of videos of various UAVs in flight, captured from another UAV. The performance of the proposed method has been compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the literature on this dataset. Additionally, we also tested the proposed trackers on aerial videos captured from UAVs. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid trackers achieve the state-of-the-art performance on all tested datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/bdrhn9/hybrid-tracker.},

In this paper, type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic controllers (TSK-FLCs) are tuned by reinforcement learning (RL), and implemented on quadcopters. The controllers are successfully tested on a variety of pursuit-evasion scenarios which provide a suitable basis for the utilization of RL since they consist of conflicting aims. A number of comparative results are presented for several case studies with different quadcopters, different initial points and under noisy conditions.},

abstract={The flying ad-hoc network (FANET) is a decentralized communication network for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Because of the wireless nature and the unique network properties, FANET remains vulnerable to jamming attack with additional challenges. First, a decision from a centralized knowledge base is unsuitable because of the communication and power constraints in FANET. Second, the high mobility and the low density of the UAVs in FANET require constant adaptation to newly explored spatial environments containing unbalanced data; rendering a distributed jamming detection mechanism inadequate. Third, taking model-based jamming defense actions in a newly explored environment, without a precise estimation of the transitional probabilities, is challenging. Therefore, we propose an adaptive federated reinforcement learning-based jamming attack defense strategy. We developed a model-free Q-learning mechanism with an adaptive exploration-exploitation epsilon-greedy policy, directed by an ondevice federated jamming detection mechanism. The simulation results revealed that the proposed adaptive federated reinforcement learning-based defense strategy outperformed the baseline methods by significantly reducing the number of en route jammer location hop counts. The results also showed that the average accuracy of the federated jamming detection mechanism, leveraged in the defense strategy, was 39.9% higher than that of the distributed mechanism verified with the standard CRAWDAD jamming attack dataset and the ns-3 simulated FANET jamming attack dataset.},

abstract={The integration of space and air components considering satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into terrestrial networks in a space-terrestrial integrated network (STIN) has been envisioned as a promising solution to enhancing the terrestrial networks in terms of fairness, performance, and network resilience. However, employing UAVs introduces some key challenges, among which backhaul connectivity, resource management, and efficient three-dimensional (3D) trajectory designs of UAVs are very crucial. In this paper, low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are employed to alleviate the backhaul connectivity issues with UAV networks, where we address the problem of jointly determining backhaul-aware 3D trajectories of UAVs, resource management, and associations between users, satellites and base stations (BSs) in an STIN while satisfying ground users' quality-of-experience requirements and provisioning fairness concerning users' data rates. The proposed approach maximizes a novel objective function with joint consideration for BS's load and fairness, which can be categorized as a non-deterministic polynomial time hard (NP-hard) problem. To tackle this issue, we leverage a reinforcement learning framework, in which our problem is modeled as a multi-armed bandit problem. Accordingly, BSs learn the environment and its dynamics and then make decisions under an upper confidence bound based method. Simulation results show that our proposed approach outperforms the benchmark methods in terms of fairness, throughput, and load.},

abstract={Deep Learning-based object detectors enhance the capabilities of remote sensing platforms, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in a wide spectrum of machine vision applications. However, the integration of deep learning introduces heavy computational requirements, preventing the deployment of such algorithms in scenarios that impose low-latency constraints during inference, in order to make mission-critical decisions in real-time. In this paper, we address the challenge of efficient deployment of region-based object detectors in aerial imagery, by introducing an informed methodology for extracting candidate detection regions (proposals). Our approach considers information from the UAV on-board sensors, such as flying altitude and light-weight computer vision filters, along with prior domain knowledge to intelligently decrease the number of region proposals by eliminating false-positives at an early stage of the computation, reducing significantly the computational workload while sustaining the detection accuracy. We apply and evaluate the proposed approach on the task of vehicle detection. Our experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detection models can achieve up to 2.6x faster inference by employing our altitude-aware data-driven methodology. Alongside, we introduce and provide to the community a novel vehicle-annotated and altitude-stamped dataset of real UAV imagery, captured at numerous flying heights under a wide span of traffic scenarios.},

abstract={Traffic surveillance using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV`s) has gained a lot of attraction in civilian applications and remote sensing tasks. Thanks to its high mobility and large field of view and ability to cover regions at different altitudes UAVs have made a mark in recent years for surveillance. The primary purpose of UAV in traffic surveillance is to monitor the daily activities in the busy traffic areas and report the abnormal activities which may take place. In recent years, many gated campuses such as educational institutions, organizations, shopping malls, etc. have taken steps to keep a track of vehicles trespassing within its vicinity. Vehicle counting is one of the monitoring tasks performed in surveillance to estimate the density of vehicles in an event or areas where traffic congestion is common. In this paper, a vehicle counting framework is proposed to eliminate the problem of redundant vehicle information count when a vehicle has appeared in successive frames of UAV videos. This work demonstrates that the comparison of concatenated three features vectors (Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Local Binary Pattern, and mean RGB value) can be used to recognize identical vehicles in UAV aerial videos.},

A good simulator provides a realistic environment for simulated aircraft. It also provides the ability to invoke and fly various models of aircraft. The ML algorithm, in turn, allows to find an appropriate set of control inputs that can be useful in flying the aircraft autonomously. Creating UAVs in this way has certain obvious benefits. The process of development can be accelerated largely by employing a testbed that allows a seamless dovetailing between the flight simulator and an ML algorithm of choice. However, an extensive testbed is largely missing from the academic landscape both in terms of implementation and technical details.

abstract={In this article, we present a novel machine learning based angle estimation and field of view (FoV) enhancement techniques for mmWave FMCW radars operating in the frequency range of 77 - 81 GHz. Field of view is enhanced in both azimuth and elevation. The Elevation FoV enhancement is achieved by keeping the orientation of antenna elements in elevation. In this orientation, radar focuses the beam in vertical direction there by enhancing the elevation FoV. An Azimuth FoV enhancement is achieved by mechanically rotating the radar horizontally, which has antenna elements in the elevation. With the proposed angle estimation technique for such rotating radars, root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.56 degrees is achieved. These proposed techniques will be highly useful for several applications in cost-effective and reliable autonomous systems such as ground station traffic monitoring and control systems for both on ground and aerial vehicles.},

abstract={Characterized by broad communication coverage, powerful processing capability, and ease of deployment, edge server enabled Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising paradigm to provide computing services to task-intensive user devices. To cope with complex communication networks and diverse user computing requirements, the UAVs may take machine learning to adjust their edge service strategies. However, the strategy training process always costs a long time, which seriously undermines UAVs' service efficiency. We propose a transfer learning empowered aerial edge network that improving training efficiency through knowledge sharing among cooperative UAVs to address this drawback.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are often used in mission-critical applications, requiring a critical criterion in flight time. Unfortunately, severe power fluctuations, caused by specific flight patterns, degrade the deliverable capacity of the battery and hamper the flight time. A common approach to mitigating power fluctuations is to employ a hybrid energy storage system using a Li-ion battery with an ultracapacitor (UC). However, the conventional scheme poses inherent problems of low-energy density and power leakage due to the use of the UC and the supplementary hardware required for hybrid storage. In this article, we propose Hydrone, a reconfigurable battery architecture that maximizes the flight time of UAVs, overcoming the previous limitations. Hydrone addresses two key challenges that arise when hybrid energy storage is utilized in UAVs: 1) capacity loss and 2) power leakage. First, the proposed scheme compromises the capacity loss of hybrid storage by using a minimal capacity UC for use as a buffer to counteract the power fluctuations. Second, the power leakage of the hybrid battery is minimized by draining power from the UC only when it is necessary. To this end, the Hydrone architecture provides reconfigurability in hardware and offers two modes of battery operation, i.e., a battery-only mode and a hybrid mode. An appropriate operation is then selected at runtime depending on the flight situation and battery status. To switch modes, we employed a reinforcement learning-based switch control, reflecting the power fluctuation adequately on the flight and battery states. We implemented a hardware prototype to demonstrate the efficiency of Hydrone. Our extensive evaluation shows that the flight time of a UAV is prolonged up to 39% in our experiment setup.},

abstract={The authentication of flight data in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is highly critical because processing fake commands by the on-board flight controller can cause fatal consequences. Depending on the criticality level of the UAV mission, multi-layer authentication techniques can be useful to assure higher security levels. This paper proposes a technique for continuous authentication of flight data based on the behavior of the UAV operator, who flies the vehicle in a manual mode. In contrast to one-time authentication, this technique allows for an on-the-fly identification of malicious commands aiming at manipulating, hijacking, or crashing the UAV. The operator behavior is defined by the sequence of flight commands sent to the drone using a standard radio control transmitter. This is based on our assumption that every UAV operator has a distinctive pattern when it comes to controlling a UAV using transmitter's levers or joysticks. To verify this assumption, we captured 22,402 commands from five different operators, who flew a small multicopter UAV using a standard flight transmitter. Machine learning was applied to train a random forest classifier. The results show that the UAV operators can be identified with accuracies between 76% and 88% in a 10-tree configuration. These promising results pave the way for a comprehensive study towards implementing a real-time classifier on the UAV embedded system.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed in the air to provide high probabilities of line of sight (LoS) transmission, thus UAVs bring much gain for wireless communication systems. In this paper, we study a UAVs-aided self-organized device-to-device (D2D) network. Relay deployment, channel allocation and relay assignment are jointly optimized, aiming to maximize the capacity of the relay network. On account of the coupled relationship between the three optimization variables, an alternating optimization approach is proposed to solve this problem. The original problem is divided into two sub-problems. The first one is that of optimizing the channel allocation and relay assignment with fixed relay deployment. Considering without central controller, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to solve this sub-problem. The second sub-problem is that of optimizing the relay deployment with fixed channel allocation and relay assignment. Assuming no knowledge of channel model and exact positions of the communication nodes, an online learning algorithm based on real-time capacity is proposed to solve this sub-problem. By solving the two sub-problems alternately and iteratively, the original problem is finally solved. Simulation results show that the UAVs-aided D2D network can achieve a high capacity via the joint optimization of relay deployment, channel allocation, and relay assignment.},

abstract={This paper presents drone classification at millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars using the deep learning (DL) technique. The adoption mmWave technology in radar systems enables better resolution and aid in detecting smaller drones. Using radar cross-section (RCS) signature enables us to detect malicious drones and suitable action can be taken by respective authorities. Existing drone classification converts the RCS signature into images and then performs drone classification using a convolution neural network (CNN). Converting every signature into an image induces additional computation overhead; further CNN model is trained considering fixed learning rate. Thus, when using CNN-based drone classification under a highly dynamic environment exhibit poor classification accuracy. This paper present an improved long short-term memory (LSTM) by introducing a weight optimization model that can reduce computation overhead by not allowing the gradient to not flow through hidden states of the LSTM model. Further, present adaptive learning rate optimizing (ALRO) model for training the LSTM model. Experiment outcome shows LSTM-ALRO achieves much better drone detection accuracies of 99.88% when compared with the existing CNN-based drone classification model.},

abstract={The rapid development of flight control technology has made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) widely used in high-precision strikes on the battlefield. The premise of this is to achieve accurate target recognition using UAV-based radars. Aiming at three typical ground targets including pedestrians, wheeled vehicles and tracked vehicles, the micro-Doppler modulation caused by the random vibration of the UAV is analyzed in this paper for the first time. To improve the recognition accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), Doppler signals are transformed into time-frequency images and a deep convolutional denoising encoder (DCDE) is designed to effectively remove the noise without suppressing micro-Doppler characteristics. To avoid the complicated micro-Doppler feature extraction, deep residual learning which can reduce the burden of network training and gain higher learning efficiency when compared with traditional deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) is adopted. Recognition results under various occasions using denoised micro-Doppler images and designed residual learning network indicate that the proposed method has higher precision and better robustness than current methods. Even when the SNR is only -16dB, the overall recognition accuracy still exceeds 90%.},

abstract={The emergence of drones has added a new dimension to privacy and security issues. There are little or no strict regulations on the people that can purchase or own a drone. For this reason, people can take advantage of these aircraft to intrude into restricted or private areas. A drone detection and identification (DDI) system is one of the ways of detecting and identifying the presence of a drone in an area. DDI systems can employ different sensing techniques such as radio frequency (RF) signals, video, sounds, and thermal imaging for detecting an intruding drone. In this work, we propose a machine learning RF-based DDI system that uses low band RF signals from drone-to-flight controller communication. We develop three machine learning models using the XGBoost algorithm to detect and identify the presence of a drone, the type of the drone, and the operational mode of drones. For these three XGBoost models, we evaluated the models using 10-fold cross validation and we achieve average accuracy of 99.96%, 90.73%, and 70.09% respectively.},

abstract={The applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military, intelligent transportation, agriculture, rescue operations, natural environment mapping, and many other allied domains has increased exponentially during the past few years. Some of the use cases of their applications range from aerial surveillance, data retrieval to their use in real-time communicative networks. Though UAVs were traditionally used only outdoors, many of its indoor applications like for rescue operations, inventory tracking in warehouses, etc., have recently emerged and these use cases are being actively explored. One of the major challenges for indoor drone applications is navigation and obstacle avoidance. Due to indoor operations, the global positioning system fails in accurate localization and navigation. To address this issue, we introduce a scheme that facilitates the autonomous navigation of UAVs (which have an onboard camera) in the indoor corridors of a building using deep-neural-networks-based processing of images. For a deep neural network, the selection of a good combination of hyperparameters for a better prediction is a complicated task. In this article, the hyperparameters tuning of a convolutional neural network is achieved by using genetic algorithms. The proposed architecture (DCNN-GA) is compared with state-of-the-art ImageNet models. The experimental results show the minimum loss and high performance of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract={The demand for accurate and fast trajectory tracking for multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have grown recently due to advances in UAV avionics technology and application domains. In many applications, the multirotor UAV is required to accurately perform aggressive maneuvers in challenging scenarios like the presence of external wind disturbances or in-flight payload changes. In this paper, we propose a systematic controller tuning approach based on identification results obtained by a recently developed Deep Neural Networks with the Modified Relay Feedback Test (DNN-MRFT) algorithm. We formulate a linear equivalent representation suitable for DNN-MRFT using feedback linearization. This representation enables the analytical investigation of different controller structures and tuning settings, and captures the non-linearity trends of the system. With this approach, the trade-off between performance and robustness in design was made possible which is convenient for the design of controllers of UAVs operating in uncertain environments. We demonstrate that our approach is adaptive and robust through a set of experiments, where accurate trajectory tracking is maintained despite significant changes to the UAV aerodynamic characteristics and the application of wind disturbance. Due to the model-based system design, it was possible to obtain low discrepancy between simulation and experimental results which is beneficial for potential use of the proposed approach for real-time model-based planning and fault detection tasks. We obtained RMSE of 3.59 cm when tracking aggressive trajectories in the presence of strong wind, which is on par with state-of-the-art.},

To improve the efficiency of the path planning method, the DQN approach is utilized in the target tracking tasks. The issue is modeled as follows: the UAV can be seen as the agent, who needs to find a safe and valid way to the destnation. The process of that can be designed as a Markov decision problem. As a deep reinforcenment learning way, DQN has deep networks to approximate the Q value accurately, and the Q(λ) algorithm makes it possible to make the right decisions in path planning process. It is a remarkable fact that even if the environment is unknown, DQN approach is also effective. Numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the suggested system.},

abstract={Small object is one of the primary challenges in the field of object detection, which is notably pronounced to the detection in the images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Existing detectors based on deep-learning methods usually apply the feature extraction networks with a large down-sampling factor to obtain higher-level features. However, such big stride tends to make the feature information of small objects become the little point or even vanish in the low-resolution feature maps due to the limitation of pixels. Therefore, a novel structure called Multi-branch Parallel Feature Pyramid Networks (MPFPN) is proposed in this article, which aims to extract more abundant feature information of the objects with a small size. Specifically, the parallel branch is designed to recover the features that missed in the deeper layers. Meanwhile, a supervised spatial attention module (SSAM) is applied to weaken the impact of background noise inference and focus object information. Furthermore, we adopt cascade architecture in the Fast R-CNN stage for a more powerful localization capability. Experiments on the public drone-based datasets named VisDrone-DET demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art detection algorithms.},

Beam switching to unblocked direction is an effective solution to overcome blockage and restore communication links. To this end, a set of candidate beams for beam switching should be selected before the beam is blocked. However, due to the high speed movement of the UAV, identifying the appropriate beam for an UAV with any position is not trivial. In this work, a fast link recovery approach is proposed. Specifically, our proposed beam selection method considers the spatial correlation, estimated reliability probability of the beams and signal quality.

abstract={Most of the remote sensing image captioning (IC) models are based on encoder-decoder frameworks where a convolutional neural network (CNN) encodes the image information and a recurrent neural network (RNN) decodes the image information into a sentence description. In order to achieve good accuracies, encoder-decoder frameworks relying on RNNs typically require a huge amount of annotated samples. Furthermore, they demand high and expensive computational power in order to have reasonable training and testing time. In this article, we aim to address these issues by introducing a novel decoder that is based on support vector machines (SVMs). In particular, instead of RNNs, we propose a novel network of SVMs to decode the image information into a sentence description. The proposed IC system is particularly interesting when just a limited amount of training samples is available. Experiments conducted on four different IC datasets confirm the promising capability of the proposed IC system to generate descriptions that are highly correlated with the image content. The proposed IC system is characterized by short training and inference times compared to other state-of-the-art models.},

abstract={Flying ad-hoc network (FANET) is one of the applications of next-generation wireless networks, including fifth generation (5G) networks. Due to the availability of high data rate and low latency, 5G supports applications with high resource requirement including FANET. In FANETs, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communicate with each other to form a network, however due to their high mobility and dynamicity, network topology varies frequently. UAVs have limited energy resources, and their energy is consumed for communication, such as data transmission and reception. In this paper, the optimal route is identified by considering UAVs with higher residual energy and stability in a 5G network in order to increase network lifetime, as well as reduce energy consumption and the number of broken links. The proposed algorithm applies an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning, and the effects of different learning rates are investigated.},

abstract={The classification and segmentation of small region of interest from ground images is important in many domains: flood detection and evaluation, crop monitoring, environment monitoring, defense, etc. The paper uses a fusion scheme to classify small regions from remote images in four classes (different for satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle -UAVs). As novelty, two neural networks, considered as primary classifiers, AlexNet and Perceptron (the last based on ten textural image features) are combined in a convolutional scheme to make up the global classifier. The weights from the convolutional layer are calculated according to the performances of the primary classifiers in a validation phase. Two datasets with different images are used for classifier learning, validation, and testing, one consisting in images from satellite and another consisting in images from UAVs. The global system performances were better than those of the individual neural network (system components) accuracies.},

abstract={Recently, most object detection under videos have increasingly relied on the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms because of UAVs' timeliness, pertinence, and high flexibility in data acquisition. Convolution neural networks, especially for YOLO v3, have proved to be effective in intelligent pedestrian detection. However, two problems need to be solved in pedestrian detection of UAV images. One is more small pedestrian objects in UAV images; the other is the complex structure of Darknet53 in YOLO v3, which requires massive computation. To solve these problems, an improved lightweight network MobileNetv3 based on YOLO v3 is proposed. First, the improved MobileNetv3 takes place of the Darknet53 for feature extraction to reduce algorithm complexity and model simplify. Second, complete IoU loss by incorporating the overlap area, central point distance and aspect ratio in bounding box regression, is introduced into YOLO v3 to lead to faster convergence and better performance. Moreover, a new attention module SESAM is constructed by channel attention and spatial attention in MobileNetv3. It can effectively judge long-distance and small-volume objects. The experimental results have shown that the proposed model improves the performance of pedestrian detection of UAV images.},
