abstract = {The handling of vehicle interactions is a challenge in the research into the traveling of autonomous vehicles. This paper focuses on collision-free motion design of autonomous vehicles to guarantee their minimum traveling time in intersections. First, a decision logic of the order of the vehicles in intersections is proposed. Based on the decision logic a constrained nonlinear optimization method is also proposed, with which the minimum traveling time of the vehicles without their collision is guaranteed. Since the on-line solution of the nonlinear optimization task can be numerically complex, a neural network based approximation of the optimal solution is developed. The efficiency of the method with various intersection scenarios is shown in the CarSim simulation environment.}

The growing availability of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in public and private organizations also provide intelligent and secure surveillance solutions for real-time monitoring in public spaces. This article introduces an IoT-based crowd surveillance system that uses a deep learning model to detect and count people using an overhead view perspective. The Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) model with Mobilenetv2 as the basic network is used for the detection of people. The detection model’s accuracy is enhanced with a transfer learning approach. Two virtual lines are defined to count how many people are leaving and entering the scene. In order to assess performance, experiments are performed using different video clips. Results indicate that transfer learning increases the overall detection performance of the system with an accuracy of 95%.}

This is more evident when we focus on people with some accessibility needs. Based on the user profile, it is possible to transcode or modify contents (e.g., adapt text fonts) so as to meet the user preferences. The problem is that applying such a kind of transformations to the whole content might significantly alter Web pages that might become unreadable, hence making matters worse. We present a system that employs Web intelligence to perform automatic adaptations on single elements composing a Web page. A reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to manage user profiles. We evaluate our system through simulation and a real assessment where elderly users where asked to use for a time period our system prototype. Results confirm the feasibility of the proposal.}

It is no longer one-way or two- way communication. Instead, via networked all-to-all communication channels, our citizens engage on urban issues in a complex and more connected way than ever before. So government needs new ways to listen to its citizens. The paper comprises three components. Firstly, we build on the growing discussions in the literature focused on smart cities, on one hand, and social media research, on the other, to capture the diversity of citizen voices and better inform decision-making. Secondly, with the support of the Australian Federal Government and in collaboration with the local government partners, we collect citizen voices from Twitter on selected urban projects. Thirdly, we present preliminary findings in terms of quantity and quality of publicly available online data representing citizen concerns on the urban matters. By analyzing the sentiments of the citizen voices captured online, clustering them into topic areas, and then reevaluating citizen's sentiments within each cluster, we elaborate the scope and value of technologically-enabled opportunities in terms of enabling participatory local government decision making processes.}

abstract = {As a hot spot, the diffusion of the smart city has been more and more popular and widespread all over the world. The concept of smart city has supported a higher quality of urban spaces and a better offering of public services. Smart grid is an important component and the energy supply of smart city. The health of the smart grid will directly affect the health of the smart city. Efficient and accurate prediction about icing level of transmission lines provides a reliable basis for anti-icing and deicing of power grids. The prediction can not only significantly enhance the reliability, safety and stability of transmission networks, but also timely provide the state monitoring of ice on wires to the workers to make proper decisions and to prevent freezing disasters so as to effectively protect people’s safety and build a stable and friendly society. To reduce catastrophic damages caused by the iced transmission lines of the grid, this paper proposed a novel hybrid model called PR-KELM, an integration of Principal Component Analysis, ReliefF and Kernel based ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) method to predict the icing level of transmission lines. This hybrid model covered two stages including: 1) structured and unstructured data feature extraction by local binary patterns, principal component analysis and ReliefF; 2) radial basis function Kernel based ELM predicting the processed data. The experimental data adopted in this paper were from the online monitoring system of South China State Grid Online Monitoring System by terminal CC0289 between December 1, 2011 and March 1, 2016. Experimental results indicated: compared with Elman neural network model, random forest model, support vector machine model and Bayesian networks model, PR-KELM approach demonstrated high accuracy and lower prediction error in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), and R (Coefficient of Correlation) while applied to predicting in real datasets.}

abstract = {In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has gained much popularity due to its potential ability to integrate the physical world with the digital world. However, this digital revolution is driving an insatiable demand for wireless spectrum, leading the upcoming novel personal, social and industrial IoT applications competing for limited spectrum resources. One of the main challenges that may hinder the vision of IoT is the scarcity of radio spectrum. Therefore, in order to cope with the challenge of spectrum scarcity brought about by the unprecedented number of IoT devices, this paper proposes to integrate cognitive radio (CR) technology with the IoT paradigm (CR-IoTNet). The CR is realized as a promising solution to improve the spectrum utilization and alleviate the spectrum scarcity in wireless networks. In CR, spectrum sensing is widely recognized as a key technology that enables secondary users (SUs) to detect spectrum holes and have the opportunity to access unoccupied spectrum. The CR-IoTNet, which is composed of multiple primary user (PU) base-stations and SU devices as IoT smart objects, performs the joint spectrum sensing and optimal allocation of spectrum to the requesting SU-IoT devices in the network through an intelligent fusion center (IFC). Furthermore, we employ support vector machines (SVM) in CR-IoTNet, enabling it to learn and adapt to the changing network dynamics, and identify the PU spectrum usage based on the established multi-class (J×6)-D feature set. The performance of CR-IoTNet is evaluated across several key factors, where simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed framework in achieving high reliable identification, classification and allocation of unoccupied frequency bands in PU spectrum, especially in key areas of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, the trained SVM classifier obtained 95.11% accuracy, with 92.67% true positive rate and 96.34% true negative rate in CR-IoTNet, reflecting the optimal allocation of PU nodes for spectrum access.}

A centrally controlled and automated screening system across multiple app stores is inevitable to prevent the release of copyrighted or cloned copies of these apps. In this paper, we proposed IoT-enabled green city architecture for clone detection in android markets using a deep learning approach. First, the proposed system obtained an original APK file together with potential candidate cloned APKs via the cloud network. For each subject software, the system uses an APK Extractor tool to retrieve Dalvik Executable (DEX) files. The Jdex decompiler is utilized to retrieve Java source files through Dalvik Executables. Second, the AST features are extracted using ANother Tool for Language Recognition (ANTLR) parser. Third, the linear features are mined from these hierarchical structures, and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) is applied to estimate the significance of each feature. Finally, the deep learning model is configured to detect cloned apps. The deep learning model is fine-tuned to get better accuracy. The proposed approach is analyzed on five different cloned applications collected from different android markets. The main objective of this system is to avoid the release of pirated apps with various pirated labels in multiple app markets.}

abstract = {Due to the impact of air quality on health, the use of low-cost gas sensor systems in air quality monitoring has increased. The deficiencies of low-cost gas sensors such as cross-sensitivities, interferences with environmental factors, and unit-to-unit variability have led to multidimensional calibration approaches with machine learning applied to field data. However, the trustworthiness of measurement results remains a concern, since sensor aging and concept drift are common problems. While most machine learning algorithms do not disclose the reliability and trustworthiness of measurement results, Bayesian models offer integrated sanity checking of predictions. Motivated by recent advancements in variational inference, this publication evaluates the potential of variational Bayesian linear regression and variational Bayesian neural networks for the calibration of low-cost gas sensors and sensor systems using laboratory as well as published field data. With the performed analysis, it can be shown that raw sensor measurements outside confidence regions, implicitly defined by the calibration input data, are detectable. In such situations, the uncertainty of the posterior predictive distribution increases, suggesting less trustworthy measurement results and necessity for maintenance.}

This paper proposes an incremental tensor-based fuzzy c-means approach (IT-FCM) for obtaining smart data from continuously generated big data. Specifically, a weighted version of the tensor-based fuzzy c-means approach (T-FCM) is firstly proposed to cluster the dataset that combines the previous cluster centroids and the new generated data. Aiming to improve the clustering efficiency, the old data objects are represented by the centroids to avoid repeat clustering. Furthermore, this paper presents an edge-cloud-aided clustering scheme to fuse big data from different sources and perspectives and further to implement co-clustering on the fused datasets for exploring smart data. Finally, the proposed IT-FCM approach is evaluated by comparing with T-FCM regarding clustering accuracy and efficiency on two different datasets in the experiments. The results state that IT-FCM outperforms T-FCM in clustering streaming big data in terms of accuracy and efficiency for obtaining smart data.}

The huge data and the limited resources in IoT and cloud system ascertain the real need for efficient congestion control scheme especially in real-time fog computing applications. In this paper, a Proportional-Integrator-Differentiator (PID) controller is used and tuned in a rate-based congestion control scheme to be implemented for IoT applications data communication. The tuning strategy is based on reformulating the problem to be as an optimization problem with a compact fitness function reflecting the control requirements. The main contribution of this paper is to adopt an enhanced hybrid immune-hill-climbing immune algorithm as the tuning process. Then, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is built and trained in order to be used instead of the repetitive and exhausting retuning. The proposed method works in a cascaded manner; the immune algorithm is used for coarse tuning and then the hill climbing algorithm is triggered for fine-tuning. For the purpose of comparison, a simplified network model is built and simulated using two control methods, namely the control scheme and the well-known single-bit indicator scheme. The experimental results prove that the PID controller tuned by the immune-hill-climbing algorithm is superior in terms of the stability of both, buffer occupancy in the switch and the source rate. Both the transient behavior and the steady-state response for the PID controller are shown to be much better than the single-bit indicator scheme. Consequently, the proposed control scheme outperforms the single-bit indicator in terms of link utilization, buffer utilization, packet drop and robustness against any burst change in fog and cloud computing systems. It is shown that using trained ANN instead of the repetitive and exhausting retuning is improving the response time.}

Existing approaches, however, either exploit the global shape feature without paying attention to the local features or hierarchically exploit local features with little attention to the global shape feature. In this paper, we proposed Fused Feature Point Network (FFPointNet), a deep neural network for learning on raw point clouds that exploits both local and global shape features. Specifically, we designed a novel module, ChannelNet, a simple and effective module that exploits global shape features using 1D convolutions. ChannelNet uses only 0.041 million parameters, making it easy to plug in the generic PointNet++ backbone to exploits both local and global shape structures for better contextual representation. Experiments carried out showed that by fusing PointNet++ feature with ChannelNet feature, we gained an improved classification accuracy over PointNet++ by 2.2% on the popular ModelNet40 dataset; and an improved class mean intersection over union of 1.4% on the popular ShapeNetParts dataset.}

The main objective of this study is to minimize the total number of drones required to monitor an environment while providing the maximum coverage, which in turn leads to significant reduction in cost. Our simulation results show that by increasing the battery capacity of the drones, the drones’ visibility range would also increase and thus, the number of drones would be reduced. Moreover, when the targets are sparsely distributed across a large number of different regions, a further increase to the targets does not require an increase in the number of drones needed to monitor them.}

One of the core functions of a smart city consists in the continuous monitoring of events, assets and people and the use of this information and intelligence for the streamlining of the city’s operations. Public opinion represents one type of intelligence of particular importance and value. By monitoring public opinion, governments seek to understand prevalent views about the current events and policies, as well as identify extreme views and trends that may represent problematic situations or precursors to violent actions. Ultimately, maintaining a constant awareness of public opinion means that authorities can better assess and predict public reactions in relation to ongoing events, and thus take appropriate actions to maintain public safety. Due to the popular use of social media to express sentiments and emotions about current events, social media content analysis has been contemplated as a promising solution to capture public opinion. However, existing approaches take a coarse-grained retrospective approach to social media content analysis. Furthermore, those approaches suffer from the lack of scalability and efficiency, as they necessitate the collection and analysis of large volumes of social media content (often millions of posts), to come up with relevant conclusions. In this work, we address those limitations by proposing a novel framework for the real-time monitoring of public opinion. To ensure efficiency and scalability, our framework focuses on the analysis of high impact social media content generated by opinion leaders and their followers as means to offer in-depth insights and sentiment intelligence reports about events, as they are occurring in real time. The proposed framework was implemented and tested on data harvested from 52 economic opinion leaders, with a focus on the China-US trade war as case study. The results show that the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier used for sentiment analysis yielded a classification accuracy of 86% when differentiating between four sentiment categories: Support, strong support, dissent, and strong dissent. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier employed to perform in-depth emotional analysis attained an accuracy of 82% when differentiating between five emotions: Angry, depressed, excited, happy, and worried. Unlike existing retrospective social media analysis approaches that require the analysis of millions of posts, our approach focuses on the analysis of high-impact social media content in real-time, thus constituting an efficient, sustainable, and timely solution to public opinion monitoring.}

IEEE 802.11n and IEEE 802.11ac support a large pool of parameter set such as increased number of spatial streams via multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communications, channel bonding, guard intervals, different modulation and coding schemes, several levels of frame aggregation, block acknowledgement etc. As a consequence, they boost up physical data rate in the order of Gigabits per second. However, all these enhancements have their internal trade-offs with the channel quality, as explored in the existing literature. For example, higher channel bonding levels result in poor performance under high bit error rate. In a free wireless environment, multiple heterogeneous stations share the wireless channel which is again a time-varying system. Consequently, none of these link level parameters provide an optimal performance for all channel quality instances. Therefore, to practically meet the theoretical high throughput, each wireless device should adapt its physical data transmission rate dynamically by an appropriate tuning of different link parameters. Otherwise, high transmission failure may arise. In this paper, we design an adaptive automated on-line learning mechanism, called “Smart Link Adaptation” (SmartLA), for dynamic selection of link parameters, motivated by “State-Action-Reward-State-Action” (SARSA) model, a variant of reinforcement learning. SmartLA can make a wireless station quite intelligent to cope up with various network conditions by exploiting the best suited data rate observed so far for various channel conditions from the past experience as well as by exploring different possible set of parameters. We analyze the performance of SmartLA in both from simulation analysis and over a 26 nodes IEEE 802.11ac testbed (6 access points and 20 client devices). We observe that the proposed link adaptation mechanism performs significantly better compared to other competing mechanisms mentioned in the literature.}

The majority of reported investigations using the ECG biometric method are usually based on fiducial or nonfiducial methods, which are always accompanied by a series of issues, such as locating fiducial points accurately is difficult, feature selection is subjective, and classifiers are limited by the quantity and structure of data. This paper proposes a new biometric authentication system for human identification that uses ECG signals as a biometric trait and integrates a generalized S-transformation and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, we first introduce a blind segmentation strategy that effectively avoids difficult data-specific heartbeat recognition and segmentation techniques. Then, a generalized S-transformation is performed on the blind signal-processed ECG signal, capturing the ECG trajectory at each time point in the frequency domain. Next, the getframe technology is used to capture an image of the ECG trajectories and convert the one-dimensional signal to a two-dimensional image, which serves as the input layer of the CNN, thus fully reflecting the changing trend in the ECG signal spectrum characteristics over a continuous period. Finally, the CNN is used for automatic discriminative feature learning and representations, which avoids a tedious feature extraction algorithm. In addition, considering the possible impact of ECG signals with different signal behaviors on identification, experiments are performed on three ECG databases with diverse features, comprising normal individuals, atrial fibrillation patients, and a noisy database, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Promising identification rates of 99%, 98%, and 99% were achieved, respectively. Thus, our proposed ECG authentication system can be effectively used for identity recognition under various conditions.}

This study proposes a new model to estimate the disc cutter life (Hf) by integrating a group method of data handling (GMDH)-type neural network (NN) with a genetic algorithm (GA). The efficiency and effectiveness of the GMDH network structure are optimized by the GA, which enables each neuron to search for its optimum connections set from the previous layer. With the proposed model, monitoring data including the shield performance database, disc cutter consumption, geological conditions, and operational parameters can be analyzed. To verify the performance of the proposed model, a case study in China is presented and a database is adopted to illustrate the excellence of the hybrid model. The results indicate that the hybrid model predicts disc cutter life with high accuracy. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the penetration rate (PR) has a significant influence on disc cutter life. The results of this study can be beneficial in both the planning and construction stages of shield tunneling.}

The difficulty of pedestrian segmentation lies in the scene’s complexity where the pedestrian is located, including the pedestrian’s shooting angle, light, and obstructions, which makes it difficult to distinguish accurately. This paper proposes an S-Mask-RCNN network that integrates spatial attention mechanisms for pedestrian segmentation. Mask-RCNN uses residual neural networks in the feature extraction network, and the effect of model feature extraction is not ideal. Based on transfer learning, a spatial attention mechanism is introduced to focus more spatially on areas that need attention. The force mechanism focuses more on the areas that need attention in space. Experiments show that the S-Mask-RCNN method proposed in this paper has better performance than traditional Mask-RCNN in pedestrian segmentation. Experiments show that the S-Mask-RCNN method proposed in this paper has better performance than traditional Mask-RCNN in pedestrian segmentation, also can provide more comprehensive and practical information for the construction of cyber–physical systems.}

Wet-bulb globe-temperature (WBGT) is used as a heat stress indicator and standard effective temperature (SET) is used as a thermal comfort index for assessment of thermal comfort in indoor and outdoor environments. These indices are usually evaluated point-wise which could be sufficient for relatively small spaces, but not suitable for large outdoor environments. This research proposes using a system combining climate sensors readings and thermal imaging to globally evaluate WBGT and SET values for outdoor environments. The algorithm derives air temperature from surface temperature values obtained using a thermal imaging camera. The obtained results were validated using readings of available sensors. Point-wise validation showed that the proposed methodology yielded results with a maximum average error of 11.4% compared to the average of point-wise local measurement for the WBGT, and an error of 8.5% for the SET. To minimize the error, an error reduction model based on artificial neural networks has been implemented. The error was further reduced to a maximum average error of 1.76% and 1.25% for WBGT and SET respectively.}

However, when access to technology is limited, the security forces can quickly become overwhelmed. Fortunately, more and more important smart cities are adopting the concept of intelligent surveillance systems. In these situations, intelligent surveillance systems require the most advanced techniques of crowd analysis to monitor crowd events properly. In this review, we explore various studies related to crowd analysis. Crowd analysis is commonly broken down into two major branches: crowd statistics and crowd behavior analysis. When crowd statistics determines the Level Of Service (LoS) of a crowded scene, crowd behavior analysis describes the motion patterns and the activities that are observed in a scene. One of the hottest topics of crowd analysis is anomaly detection. Although a unanimous definition of anomaly has not yet been met, each of crowd analysis subtopics can be subjected to abnormality. The purpose of our review is to find subareas, in crowd analysis, that are still unexplored or that seem to be rarely addressed through the prism of Deep Learning.}

In this study, the exergy analysis of a hybrid renewable system, with on-site thermal and electric energy forms, sensible and latent heat storages, was investigated, in terms of technical feasibility of proposed active cooling solutions. The contradiction between the increased electricity consumption of active cooling facilities and the enhancement of renewable generations has been presented, discussed, together with effective solutions, from the perspective of exergy. A machine-learning based optimisation methodology was proposed and used, to address the contradiction and to maximise the overall exergy, with the integration of an advanced optimisation algorithm. The results showed that, in regard to the contradiction, effective solutions include the active water-based cooling and the optimal design of the geometric and operating parameters. Furthermore, with the adoption of optimal parameters through the machine-learning based optimisation, the overall exergy of the hybrid renewable system is 872.06 kWh, which is 2.6% higher than the maximum overall exergy through the Taguchi standard orthogonal array (849.9 kWh). This study demonstrates an effective solution to the contradiction of an active renewable system, together with a machine-learning based optimisation methodology, which can promote the practical feasibility and applicability of active renewable systems in renewable and sustainable buildings.}

Provided that these factors were investigated without theoretical association, this study examined the barriers to the adoption of IoT-based smart meters technology by developing a model representing the users’ intention to adopt smart meters by drawing on the variables of the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance And Use of Technology (UTAUT2). Data were collected from 318 users of smart meter from two cities in Malaysia, while the model was validated using a multi-analytic approach using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), and the results from SEM were used as inputs for a neural network model to predict acceptance factors. As a result, it was found that technology awareness and eco-effective feedback were the important determinants with a positive impact on the adoption of smart meter technology, while privacy concerns led to an adverse impact. Overall, these study findings contribute useful insights and implications for users, utilities; regulators, and policymakers.}

abstract = {The fault detection of rotating machinery systems especially its typical components such as bearings and gears is of special importance for maintaining machine systems working normally and safely. However, due to the change of working conditions, the disturbance of environment noise, the weakness of early features and various unseen compound failure modes, it is quite hard to achieve high-accuracy intelligent failure monitoring task of rotating machinery using existing intelligent fault diagnosis approaches in real industrial applications. In the paper, a novel and high-accuracy fault detection approach named WT-GAN-CNN for rotating machinery is presented based on Wavelet Transform (WT), Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed WT-GAN-CNN approach includes three parts. To begin with, WT is employed for extracting time-frequency image features from one-dimension raw time domain signals. Secondly, GANs are used to generate more training image samples. Finally, the built CNN model is used to accomplish the fault detection of rotating machinery by the original training time-frequency images and the generated fake training time-frequency images. Two experiment studies are implemented to assess the effectiveness of our proposed approach and the results demonstrate it is higher in testing accuracy than other intelligent failure detection approaches in the literatures even in the interference of strong environment noise or when working conditions are changed. Furthermore, its result in the stability of testing accuracy is also quite excellent.}

abstract = {The evolving 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) wireless technologies are envisioned to provide ubiquitous connectivity and great heterogeneity in communication infrastructure by connecting diverse devices and providing multifarious services. Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are realized as an essential component of the upcoming 5G/B5G networks, enabling enhanced communication capacity, high reliability, low latency, and massive connectivity. However, one limiting factor in the expansion of 5G/B5G technology is the finite radio spectrum, which necessitates managing the anticipated spectrum crunch for future wireless networks. One potential solution is to develop intelligent cognitive methods to dynamically optimize the use of spectrum in 5G/B5G networks to solve the imminent problem of spectrum congestion and improve radio efficiency. This paper addresses the opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) problem in the 5G/B5G cognitive radio (CR) network of IoTs and UAVs through the novel deep learning-based detector, dubbed as Deep-CRNet. The proposed detector employs residual connections with cascaded multi-kernel convolutions to identify the primary user (PU) spectrum usage by extracting the inherent multi-scale signal and noise features in the sensed transmission patterns. Thereby, Deep-CRNet intelligently learns and locates the spectrum holes so that secondary users (SUs) and PUs can dynamically share network spectrum resources. The efficacy of Deep-CRNet is validated through simulation results, where it achieved 99.74% accuracy with 99.65% precision and 99.83% recall in accurately classifying the PU status. In addition, the average correct detection probability of Deep-CRNet in the low signal-to-noise ratio (−20 dB to −15 dB) range is 38.21% higher than the second best-performing detector.}

However, at the same time, various security threats arise due to insecure communication happening among various entities in an IoV-based smart city deployment. To address this issue, we aim to design a novel blockchain-enabled batch authentication scheme in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-envisioned IoV-based smart city deployment. The latest trends and revolutions in technologies incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML) in blockchaining to produce a secure, efficient and intelligent blockchain based system. The data stored in the blocks in the blockchain are authentic and genuine, which makes the AI/ML algorithms to work at their exceptions in order produce correct predictions on the blockchain data. Through the signing phase of the proposed scheme, each vehicle in a dynamically formed cluster broadcasts a message to its own member and respective road-side unit (RSU). In the proposed scheme, two types of authentication take place: vehicle to vehicle (V2V) authentication allows a vehicle to authenticate its neighbor vehicles in its cluster, while batch authentication permits a group of cluster vehicles to be authenticated by their RSU. At the end, a group key is established among the vehicles and RSU in their cluster. RSU then gathers securely data from its vehicles and form several transactions including the information of vehicles and its own given information to the cluster member vehicles. The transactions are formed later by the nearby fog server associated with RSU and then by the cloud server to form a complete block. The created blocks are mined by the cloud servers in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud server network through the voting-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authentic and genuine data of the blockchain are utilized for Big data analytics through AI/ML algorithms. It is shown that the proposed scheme is highly robust against various attacks through formal and informal security analysis, and also through formal security verification tool. A detailed comparative analysis reveals that the proposed scheme achieves superior security and functionality features, and offers comparable storage, communication and computational costs as compared to other existing competing schemes. Finally, the blockchain implementation has been carried out on the proposed scheme to show its effectiveness.}

The knowledge graph grows via automated link predictions using genetic programming that are validated by humans for improving transparency and calibrating accuracy. The knowledge graph builder is designed for pervasive devices such as smartphones and preserves privacy by localizing all computations.

abstract = {The exponential growth of the use of insecure stationary and portable devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) network of the smart city has made the security of the smart city against cyber-attacks a vital issue. Various mechanisms for detecting security attacks that rely on centralized and distributed architectures have already been proposed, but they tend to be inefficient due to such problems as storage constraints, the high cost of computation, high latency, and a single point of failure. Moreover, existing security mechanisms are faced with the issue of monitoring and collecting historic data throughout the entire IoT network of the smart city in order to deliver optimal security and defense against cyberattacks. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized security architecture based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) coupled with a blockchain technology for IoT network in the smart city that relies on the three core technologies of SDN, Blockchain, and Fog and mobile edge computing in order to detect attacks in the IoT network more effectively. Thus, in the proposed architecture, SDN is liable to continuous monitoring and analysis of traffic data in the entire IoT network in order to provide an optimal attack detection model; Blockchain delivers decentralized attack detection to mitigate the “single point of failure” problem inherent to the existing architecture; and Fog and mobile edge computing supports attack detection at the fog node and, subsequently, attack mitigation at the edge node, thus enabling early detection and mitigation with lesser storage constraints, cheaper computation, and low latency. To validate the performance of the proposed architecture, it was subjected to an experimental evaluation, the results of which show that it outperforms both centralized and distributed architectures in terms of accuracy and detection time.}

This research work focuses on one such application in the field of IoT together with cloud computing. More number of sensors that are deployed in human body is used to collect patient related data such as deviation in body temperature and others which leads to variation in blood cells that turned to be cancerous cells. Main intention of this work is design a cancer prediction system using Internet of Things upon extracting the details of blood results to test whether it is normal or abnormal. In addition to this, encryption is done on the blood results of cancer affected patient and store it in cloud for quick reference through Internet for the doctor or healthcare nurse to handle the patient data secretly. This research work concentrates on enhancing the health care computations and processing. It provides a framework to enhance the performance of the existing health care industry across the globe. As the entire medical data has to be saved in cloud, the traditional medical treatment limitations can be overcome. Encryption and decryption is done using AES algorithm in order to provide authentication and security in handling cancer patients. The main focus is to handle healthcare data effectively for the patient when they are away from the home town since the needed cancer treatment details are stored in cloud.

The proposed strategy is inserted inside the core a hybrid metaheuristic model, applied for learning patterns from an important mini/microgrid forecasting problem, the household electricity demand forecasting. The future smart cities will surely rely on distributed energy generation, in which citizens should be aware about how to manage and control their own resources. In this sense, energy disaggregation research will be part of several typical and useful microgrid applications. Computational results show that the proposed GPU learning strategy is scalable as the number of training rounds increases, emerging as a promising deep learning tool to be embedded into smart sensors.}

However, the necessary use of limited bandwidth networks and battery-powered devices makes their optimal configuration challenging. An over-usage of periodic sensors (i.e. too frequent measurements) may easily lead to network congestion or battery drain effects, and conversely, a lower usage is likely to cause poor measurement quality. In this paper we propose a middleware that continuously generates and exposes to the sensor network an energy-efficient sensors configuration based on data live observations. Using a live learning process, our contributions dynamically act on two configuration points: (i) sensors sampling frequency, which is optimized based on machine-learning predictability from previous measurements, (ii) network usage optimization according to the frequency of requests from deployed software applications. As a major outcome, we obtain a self-adaptive platform with an extended sensors battery life while ensuring a proper level of data quality and freshness. Through theoretical and experimental assessments, we demonstrate the capacity of our approach to constantly find a near-optimal tradeoff between sensors and network usage, and measurement quality. In our experimental validation, we have successfully scaled up the battery lifetime of a temperature sensor from a monthly to a yearly basis.}

In this context, meteorology plays a more important role in the control of these phenomena. It is thus important to search resources allowing to contribute to the improvement of the numerical model for the predictions of weather and climate. The objective of this work is to look for the weaknesses of the models in the simulation of exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. These exchanges are quantified by sensible and latent heat fluxes. The preprocessing is done through the combined use of k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) and Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model in order to estimate missing values. The processing is performed with the learning of the association rules and the knowledge extracted enables us to make some comparisons between observations and simulations by the numerical model. The postprocessing is made by logical and graphical reasoning that facilitates the visualization of links between the obtained rules. This method is deployed on a database containing measured variables (sensible and latent heat flux, temperature and humidity of the air, wind speed and direction, rain, global radiation, etc.) at the experimental site of the Centre de Recherches Atmosphériques (CRA) which is one of the two sites composing the Pyrenean Plateforme for the Observation of the Atmosphere (P2OA) in France. The obtained and expressed results in the form of association rules have made it possible to highlight that the differences between model and observations from a surface flux point of view are often concomitant with an important difference on global radiation. The expected profits are relative to the generation of knowledge useful for the improvement in the quality of the prediction with a better analysis of the important concomitant factors during errors on a weather model.}

IDNet is the first system that exploits a deep learning approach as universal feature extractors for gait recognition, and that combines classification results from subsequent walking cycles into a multi-stage decision making framework. Experimental results show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art techniques, leading to misclassification rates (either false negatives or positives) smaller than 0.15% with fewer than five walking cycles. Design choices are discussed and motivated throughout, assessing their impact on the user authentication performance.}

In the last decade, the research has seen a transition from feature centric classification approach to a classifier centric approach. The performance of conventional approach based classifiers such as probabilistic neural networks, support vector machines, is highly dependent on the performance of pre-processing and feature extraction modules. Whereas, modern approach based classifiers such as deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, do not need handcrafted features. They can generate characteristic features automatically from raw ECG signal. This paper aims to provide a comparative analysis of conventional and modern approaches. Further, deep learning based classifier models have been investigated to design a road-map for researcher new to this field.}

Just like 19th century industrial innovations, the new tools of the information age appear to be largely centripetal forces that boost the demand for urban proximity. But also like earlier industrial innovations, information technology has also disrupted shared urban spaces, such as downtown commercial districts that have lost customers to electronic vendors. Both this essay, and this special issue of Land Use Policy, emphasize the ways in which information technology can complement good land use policy and address both longstanding urban challenges at the nexus of digital tools and urban life as well as the new difficulties that have emerged during the information age.}

abstract = {This paper suggests a novel framework to co-optimize the power and heat in smart cities considering the local air pollution from energy generation units and traffic fumes. To achieve the aim, a smart city comprised of power and heat generation units is addressed. The energy system of the smart city can be connected to the main grid or be operated as a stand-alone power system. Connecting to the main grid, the city trades power in the wholesale electricity market with price uncertainty. In order to co-optimize the operation cost of energy units and to control the pollution levels of the urban area, a Combined Economic Pollution Dispatch Problem (CEPDP) is developed. The CEPDP is optimized under air pollution constraints from both energy generation units and traffic fumes. Increasing the applicability of the suggested approach, pollution density is addressed using the Box model while the wind speed and surface roughness influence on it. To solve the CEPDP, a multi-objective Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA II) is proposed. The suggested approach is implemented in a virtually-designed smart city located in the center of Iran. The results show that although the use of distributed generation decreases the global emission all over the world, it transmits the air pollution from suburban areas to cities increasing the local pollution. The two conflict objectives, i.e. global and local pollutions, may change the operation of distributed generation to meet the local environment requirements of cities.}

Meanwhile, disaster detection based on the Internet of Things(IoT) has become a hot spot benefited by the established development of smart city construction. And the IoT is visibly sensitive to the management and monitor of disasters, but massive amounts of monitoring data have brought huge challenges to data storage and data analysis. This article develops a new and much more general framework for disaster emergency management under the IoT environment. The framework is a bottom-up integration of highly scalable Raw Data Storages(RD-Stores) technology, hybrid indexing and queries technology, and machine learning technology for emergency disasters. Experimental results show that hybrid index and query technology have better performance under the condition of supporting multi-modal retrieval, and providing a better solution to offer real-time retrieval for the massive sensor sampling data in the IoT. In addition, further works to evaluate the top-level sub-application system in this framework were performed based on the GPS trajectory data of 35,000 Beijing taxis and the volumetric ground truth data of 7,500 images. The results show that the framework has desirable scalability and higher utility.}

The purpose of the observer is described in terms similar to the information extracted by video surveillance systems, so they can be compared. This helps identify what type of information is better suited to control the flow of information to multiple observers, without compromising the privacy of the individuals.

Intrusion detection is an important part of the cybersecurity technology with the goal of monitoring and analyzing network traffic from various resources and detect malicious activities. In recent years, deep learning base deep neural network (DNN) techniques have been utilized as the key solution to detect malicious attacks and among many DNNs, deep belief network (DBN) has been the most influential technique. There have been many attempts to survey wide range of machine learning and deep learning technique based intrusion detection research works, including DBN, but failed to provide a complete review of all the aspects related to the DBN based intrusion detection models. Unlike previous survey papers, we first provide basic concepts on data set, performance metric, and restricted Boltzmann machines, to help understand the basic DBN based intrusion detection model. Finally, a complete review and analysis on the previously published works on DBN based IDS models is provided.}

This infrequent connectivity is due to lack of network infrastructure and random mobility models followed by devices. These attributes of the network make routing in OppIoT, an increasingly complex problem. Moreover OppIoT shares its unique network characteristics with another class of networks called Opportunistic Networks (OppNets). This commonality enables the same routing designs to be applicable to both OppNets and OppIoT. Increased research interest in Machine Learning (ML) has led to its successful application in routing solutions for OppNets through protocols like KNNR and MLPROPH. In this paper we pursue utilizing ML to automate routing decisions in OppIoT. To this end we use Gaussian Mixture Models, an ML based soft clustering mechanism, to develop the proposed routing protocol called GMMR. The design of GMMR is such that it combines the advantages of both context-aware and context-free routing protocols. We compare the performance of GMMR with that of KNNR, HBPR, MLPROPH, and PROPHET using simulations run on Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator. The performance criteria for this comparison includes delivery probability, network overhead ratio, average hop count and number of messages dropped. We will show through the results of the simulations, that GMMR outperforms all of the aforementioned routing protocols in terms of every performance parameter.}

The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has been extensively applied to several sectors in the last years, ranging from industry to smart cities. In the health domain, IoT makes possible new scenarios of healthcare delivery as well as collecting and processing health data in real time from sensors in order to make informed decisions. However, this domain is complex and presents several technological challenges. Despite the extensive literature about this topic, the application of IoT in healthcare scarcely covers requirements of this sector.
Methods
A literature review from January 2010 to February 2021 was performed resulting in 12,108 articles. After filtering by title, abstract, and content, 86 were eligible and examined according to three requirement themes: data lifecycle; trust, security, and privacy; and human-related issues.
Results
The analysis of the reviewed literature shows that most approaches consider IoT application in healthcare merely as in any other domain (industry, smart cities…), with no regard of the specific requirements of this domain.
Conclusions
Future efforts in this matter should be aligned with the specific requirements and needs of the health domain, so that exploiting the capabilities of the IoT paradigm may represent a meaningful step forward in the application of this technology in healthcare.}

In this context, farm management and appropriate monitoring of farm parameters are now indispensable for productive farming in smart cities or rural areas. In this paper, an IoT based Smart AgroTech system is proposed in the context of urban farming that considers humidity, temperature, and soil moisture as necessary farming parameters. The proposed system decides whether the irrigation action should begin or stop depending on the farming land condition and provides the monitoring facility and remote control to the farm owner. The system's reliability is verified by determining the error percentage between actual data and observed data at different observations. The average error rate for humidity and soil moisture is below 3% and for temperature is below 1.5%. The system ascertains a feasible Smart AgroTech system that provides advantages to the farming activities in future cities than other conventional methods.}

Traditionally, each base network in an NNE is trained individually, which may result in network redundancy and expensive training overhead. This paper proposes a new adaptive niching evolutionary algorithm, which possesses promising performance in finding multiple optima in terms of good accuracy and diversity. By means of this algorithm, all NNs in an NNE can be trained simultaneously. In particular, the proposed algorithm is named adaptive niching differential evolution (ANDE), which is characterized by a heuristic clustering method to enable iteratively cluster subpopulations that track and locate multiple optima, a parameter adaptation strategy to adaptively adjust parameters according to the subpopulation states, and an auxiliary movement scheme to promote the equilibrium between exploration and exploitation. Experimental results validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed ANDE on the benchmark test suite of multimodal optimization. Furthermore, ANDE is extended to concurrently train multiple base NNs for ensemble and the experiments show a promising performance of ANDE-NNE.}

Effective utilization of deep learning relies considerably on the number of labeled samples, which restricts the application of deep learning in an environment with a small sample size. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) combined with a deep neural network (DNN). First, the original samples were divided into a training set and a test set. The GAN was trained with the training set to generate synthetic sample data, which enlarged the training set. Next, the DNN classifier was trained with the synthetic samples. Finally, the classifier was tested with the test set, and the effectiveness of the approach for multi-classification with a small sample size was validated by the indicators. As an empirical case, the approach was then applied to identify the stages of cancers with a small labeled sample size. The experimental results verified that the proposed approach achieved a greater accuracy than traditional methods. This research was an attempt to transform the classical statistical machine-learning classification method based on original samples into a deep-learning classification method based on data augmentation. The use of this approach will contribute to an expansion of application scenarios for the new generation of artificial intelligence based on deep learning, and to an increase in application effectiveness. This research is also expected to contribute to the comprehensive promotion of new-generation artificial intelligence.}

Moreover, (2) the influence mechanism of anti-pandemic measures in cities could be divided into the workforce, financial, and material effects, and their contribution rates were 26.15%, 32.55%, and 37.20%, respectively; namely, the effective/timely assistance from Chinese central government regarding the workforce, financial, and material resources in key pandemic areas and nationwide played a major role in pandemic control.

It means researchers should focus on energy systems to enhance their overall efficiency. One of the effective solution to move from suboptimal energy systems to optimal ones is analyzing energy system in Energy Hub (EH) framework. In EH framework, interactions between different energy carriers are considered in supplying the required loads. The couplings and selecting proper combinations of inputs energy carriers lead to more optimized and intelligent consumption. The appropriate combination is found by solving an optimization problem at each time step. Utilizing intelligent technologies such as Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMIs) inevitably facilitate the decision making processes. This paper modifies the classic Energy Hub model to present an upgraded model in the smart environment entitling “Smart Energy Hub” and optimizes the operation of a residential customer equipped with combined heat and power (CHP), auxiliary boiler, electricity storage and heating storage in this framework. Supporting real time, two-way communication between utility companies and smart energy hubs, and allowing AMIs at both ends to manage power consumption necessitates large-scale real-time computing capabilities to handle the communication and the storage of huge transferable data. To address this concern and reduce the amount of calculations, Reinforcement Learning (RL) method is employed to find a near optimal solution, which does not need massive computations. Finally, communications to large numbers of endpoints in a secure, scalable, and highly-available environment, in this paper, we propose a cloud computing (CC) architecture. Simulation results show that by applying RL technique in smart energy hub framework for a residential customer, efficiency of the energy system is increased substantially and leads to decrease energy bills and electricity peak load.}

Developing conventional ML models that can be generalized well in unseen design cases requires an effective feature engineering and selection. Identifying generalizable features calls for good domain knowledge by the ML model developer. Therefore, developing ML models for all design performance parameters with conventional ML will be a time-consuming and expensive process. Automation in terms of feature engineering and selection will accelerate the use of ML models in design. Deep learning models extract features from data, which aid in model generalization. In this study, we (1) evaluate the deep learning model’s capability to predict the heating and cooling demand on unseen design cases and (2) obtain an understanding of extracted features. Results indicate that deep learning model generalization is similar to or better than that of a simple neural network with appropriate features. The reason for the satisfactory generalization using the deep learning model is its ability to identify similar design options within the data distribution. The results also indicate that deep learning models can filter out irrelevant features, reducing the need for feature selection.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way future cities are planned. The concept of embedding intelligence into spaces and objects makes it possible to build all sorts of smart and distributed systems that automate and improve everyday operations in the fields of health, energy, manufacturing, and transport, amongst others. One of the most significant visions to come out of the IoT revolution is Smart Cities. Equipped with sensing and communication technologies and powered by renewable energy sources, Smart Cities could be the key to protecting environmental resources and ensuring sustainable urbanization as the world population continues to grow. Of the various available renewable energy sources, solar is one of the most popular and promising. However, solar energy is a function of its environment, and sudden changes in meteorological conditions can cause intermittency and disrupt power generation. In desert regions where solar energy is the most plausible option for renewable energy, dust-based soiling remains the biggest obstacle. The accumulation of dust particles on the surface of PV modules can obstruct the absorption of radiation by the module, effectively reducing its output. One common method to measure soiling loss is to perform Current-Voltage (IV) Tracing; where the characteristics of a PV module are used to evaluate the performance of the module. However, solar facilities in smart cities are often distributed in the form of small farms, rooftop installations, and parking lot shades in order to make use of the available space and reduce power lines. This represents a challenge to monitoring and maintaining soiled panels due to the scale and distribution of the installations. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an IoT-based solar monitoring system for city-wide, large-scale, and distributed solar facilities in smart cities. The system uses low-cost hardware and IoT networking technologies to remotely perform and communicate IV curves from individual modules or strings in a remote facility. A prototype was implemented and used to evaluate soiling loss in Sharjah, UAE, over the period of two months under harsh summer weather conditions. The prototype was able to successfully and reliably collect IV tracing and communicate it back to a cloud-based server for researchers to view and analyze. The obtained results show that soiling has a major impact on PV modules efficiency with up to 40 % power loss after two months of soiling. The PV soiling index and PV soiling loss are evaluated to allow solar facility operators to reduce cleaning costs, optimize power output, and enable preventative maintenance in city-wide distributed solar facilities.}

Efficient energy consumption in Smart Cities has a massive impact on the environment. But, computational power is increasing rapidly in the cloud computing environment. Enormous energy consumption (EC) and Service Level Agreement violation (SLAV) becomes a key concern. The Virtual Machine (VM) consolidation approach can significantly reduce EC, SLA violation (SLAV), and increase resource utilization. However, dynamic VM consolidation may produce performance degradation of Physical Machines (PMs) and SLAV. Therefore, it becomes essential to find a trade-off between EC and SLAV. Herein, a novel New Linear Regression(NLR) prediction model, host overload/underload, and VM placement policy have been proposed to reduce EC and SLAV. The NLR model’s primary intention is to take that the model goes through a straight line and a mean point. Future CPU utilization is predicted based on the proposed NLR model. Evaluation of proposed algorithms has been accomplished by extending CloudSim Simulator. The experiment shows that proposed algorithms reduced EC and SLAV in cloud data centers and can be used to construct a smart and sustainable environment for Smart Cities.}

To reduce the carbon emissions and use energy more efficiently in the building sector, home energy management system (HEMS) is proposed and used. In the HEMS, the prediction of electricity consumption in the short-term future is used to support the decision makings in the HEMS. Although there existed a number of studies in the prediction of electricity consumption in buildings, there lacks a spatial analysis in the prediction performance, especially on the appliance or sub-meter level and household level. The authors made an assumption that by the performance of household energy consumption prediction can be significantly improved if the prediction is aggregated from the prediction data at the appliance or sub-meter level. Next, two typical datasets are used to validate the assumption by comparing the prediction performance of aggregating the prediction data at appliance level and the one of making direct prediction at the household level. The models used for the prediction are standard stateful long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, which have been proofed to be promising in load prediction by previous studies. The results from the comparison validated the assumption, showing that the prediction performance can be significantly improved if prediction is made at the appliance-level first and then aggregated to get the household-level prediction. Therefore, the authors conclude that prediction at the finer appliance granularity level can significantly improve the performance of household-level electricity prediction.}

The proposed framework follows two main phases: a local prediction scheme for recruitments' success at the level of a single job placement, and a mathematical model that provides a global recruitment optimization scheme for the organization, taking into account multilevel considerations. In the first phase, a key property of the proposed prediction approach is the interpretability of the machine learning (ML) model, which in this case is obtained by applying the Variable-Order Bayesian Network (VOBN) model to the recruitment data. Specifically, we used a uniquely large dataset that contains recruitment records of hundreds of thousands of employees over a decade and represents a wide range of heterogeneous populations. Our analysis shows that the VOBN model can provide both high accuracy and interpretability insights to HR professionals. Moreover, we show that using the interpretable VOBN can lead to unexpected and sometimes counter-intuitive insights that might otherwise be overlooked by recruiters who rely on conventional methods. We demonstrate that it is feasible to predict the successful placement of a candidate in a specific position at a pre-hire stage and utilize predictions to devise a global optimization model. Our results show that in comparison to actual recruitment decisions, the devised framework is capable of providing a balanced recruitment plan while improving both diversity and recruitment success rates, despite the inherent trade-off between the two.}

To improve the accuracy of object segmentation and to solve the problem of inadequate edge recognition, a joint-learning segmentation scheme was designed that combines the conditional random field (CRF) model with an improved U-net model. It employs the improved U-net model as the front-end model of the joint-learning framework for feature fusion and the CRF model as the back-end of the joint-learning framework for transforming to gradient optimization-based recurrent neural networks. The joint-learning framework enables the front and back parts to interact with each other to obtain the location of the target and its classification information accurately. The joint-learning framework was realized on open datasets and compared with state-of-the-art remote-sensing image segmentation algorithms.

In this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset, generated from ∼1.3 billion records collected by up to 272 sensors deployed in Fortaleza, Brazil, and use it to experimentally assess the effectiveness and resilience of prediction models built according to the three aforementioned approaches. The results show that the global and cluster-based approaches provide very accurate prediction models that prove to be robust to changes in traffic behavior and in the structure of sensor networks.}

abstract = {Building energy data analysis is a major branch of smart city development research. The usual back propagation neural network model for building energy prediction has problems of unclear physical significance, poor data generalization and low fitting accuracy. Therefore, a composite prediction model of building power consumption based on FCM-GWO-BP neural network was proposed. According to the similar statistical distribution characteristics of data, the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm (FCM) was used to cluster the historical power consumption data. BP neural network prediction model was established for different categories to reduce the impact of relevant noise in the sample data on the modeling accuracy. Then, according to the train and test data sets of each category, the corresponding grey wolf algorithm was established to optimize the error back propagation neural network prediction model (GWO-BP). The experimental results showed that compared with the sample prediction accuracy index root mean square percentage error (RMSPE), the GWO-BP neural network after FCM clustering was reduced by about 0.225 compared with the BP model, and was reduced by about 0.135 compared with the GWO-BP model, so its prediction accuracy was improved by 75% at most. Respectively, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was reduced by 14.41% and 6.48%. It can be seen that this model has strong generalization ability, better prediction accuracy and reliability, and absolutely can meet the needs of practical engineering.}

While in power load prediction, the potential relationships between the time series of power load data and the characteristics of temperature, weather and date, have not been explored comprehensively, which degrades the accuracy of load prediction in smart grid. In order to extract the generalized features and latent relationships in power load related edge sensing data, a power load prediction scheme based on edge sensing data-imaging conversion (DIC) is proposed to improve the forecasting accuracy in smart cites and society. DIC employs empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for power load time series data and combines it with characteristic time series including temperature, weather and date to form an image-like structure. And a DIC-based convolutional neural network (DI-CNN) is presented to implement convolution. Experimental results show that, compared with long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM), and CNN, the proposed DIC scheme improves the training speed by 61.7 %, reduces root mean square error (RMSE) by 32.9 % at least, and enhances the prediction accuracy by 1.4 %.}

They become vulnerable to the diverse security attacks that can adversely influence their proper functionalities at any time.

Several convolutional layers are used to capture the signal’s fine time structure and learn diverse filters that are relevant to the classification task. The proposed approach can deal with audio signals of any length as it splits the signal into overlapped frames using a sliding window. Different architectures considering several input sizes are evaluated, including the initialization of the first convolutional layer with a Gammatone filterbank that models the human auditory filter response in the cochlea. The performance of the proposed end-to-end approach in classifying environmental sounds was assessed on the UrbanSound8k dataset and the experimental results have shown that it achieves 89% of mean accuracy. Therefore, the proposed approach outperforms most of the state-of-the-art approaches that use handcrafted features or 2D representations as input. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms all approaches that use raw audio signal as input to the classifier. Furthermore, the proposed approach has a small number of parameters compared to other architectures found in the literature, which reduces the amount of data required for training.}

However, facing the challenge of the step size sequence selection in MB-SARAH, we introduce an online step size sequence based on the hypergradient descent (HD) method, which only requires little additional computation. For the proposed method, referred to as MB-SARAH-HD, we provide a general convergence analysis and prove linear convergence for strongly convex problems in expectation. Specifically, we prove that the proposed method has sublinear convergence rate in a single outer loop. We also prove that the iteration complexity outperforms several variants of the state-of-the-art stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method under suitable conditions. Numerical experiments on standard datasets are provided to demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of our MB-SARAH-HD method over existing approaches in the literature.}

Learning strategies can significantly enhance the performance of IoT systems at different stages, including at IoT node level, local communication, long-range communication, edge gateway, cloud platform, and corporate data centers. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of learning strategies for IoT systems. We categorize learning paradigms for communication and computing technologies in IoT systems into reinforcement learning, Bayesian algorithms, stochastic learning, and miscellaneous. We then present research in IoT with the integration of learning strategies from the optimization perspective where the optimization objectives are categorized into maximization and minimization along with corresponding applications. Learning strategies are discussed to illustrate how these strategies can enhance the performance of IoT applications.

Its focus is to explore spatial disparities of households’ energy burden and their exposure to ambient particulate matters (PM2.5 as end point) in supporting energy efficiency goals of cities. In this study, energy burden is defined as energy affordability of households for paying energy costs. And natural ventilation (NV) is examined as a catalyst of building energy efficiency to measure tradeoffs between energy burden mitigation and exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution. The framework is built upon a five-step workflow using spatiotemporal land use regression (LUR) with gradient boosting machine (GBM) and bringing human behavioral patterns along with array of urban big data from smart cities platforms into the model to improve the explanatory capacities of the exposure model. We tested Chicago, IL as a case study. Findings indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in integrating urban energy and human health systems for envisioning urban building energy reduction goals. A web-based interactive platform is designed to communicate the results. iEnEx framework can assist designers, engineers, planners, and policymakers in better understanding these systems from environmental and social lenses in the context of equity within the built environment to ensure future sustainable cities.}

abstract = {Data mining in social networks brings an indispensable role for the construction of smart cities from the perspective of social development. Link prediction is an important task of data mining, especially in the knowledge graph, which is also called knowledge graph completion. Link prediction aims to find missing links or predict potential links according to the current social network. The most existing link prediction methods focus on static information in social networks, such as topology and node attributes, which are partly provided by users. When users are unwilling to provide or intentionally hide these static features, traditional link prediction methods cannot achieve ideal performance. The dynamic information of social influence propagation in social networks can avoid the user's subjective impact and better reflect the relationship between users. In addition, users show different degrees of interest and authority on various topics in the real world, leading to different influence propagation patterns. Therefore, we use context of social influence to optimize the topic-aware influence propagation model to improve the performance of link prediction. In this paper, we propose a new multi-output graph neural network framework to capture influence propagation in social networks and model the influence of users in different roles. In this way, the underlying information of influence between users can be used to construct new features to improve the performance of link prediction. Our experiments conduct the method on multiple benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the modeling of context is effective, and our model outperforms the compared state-of-the-art link prediction methods.}
