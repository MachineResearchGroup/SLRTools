abstract={In recent years, fuzzy portfolio selection theory has been well developed and widely applied. Based on the credibility theory, several fuzzy portfolio selection models have been proposed. The fuzzy Mean-CVaR portfolio model is one of the state-of-the-art. However, its' fuzzy nature which increases the computational complexity makes it take a long time to solve. In order to solve the fuzzy Mean-CVaR portfolio model efficiently, a hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed by integrating Genetic Algorithm(GA) with adaptive penalty function, Simulated Annealing Resilient Back Propagation (SARPROP) neural network and fuzzy simulation techniques, and to accelerate the computation speed further, we parallelize the hybrid intelligent algorithm with MPI technology. In order to demonstrate its validity and efficiency, we achieve numerical experiments on the Era supercomputer, and the results are compared with the method which is obtained by integrating traditional GA and fuzzy simulation directly. The results show that hybrid intelligent algorithm can get better performance. Experiments under different processor cores also achieved on the Era supercomputer demonstrate the scalability of the parallel hybrid intelligent algorithm.},

abstract={We have identified a need in visual relationship detection and biometrics related research for a dataset and model which focuses on person-clothing pairs. Previous to our Relatable Clothing dataset, there were no publicly available datasets usable for “worn” and “unworn” clothing detection. In this paper we propose a novel visual relationship model architecture for “worn” and “unworn” clothing detection that makes use of a soft attention mechanism for feature fusion between a conventional ResNet backbone and our novel person-clothing mask feature extraction architecture. The best proposed model achieves 98.62% accuracy, 99.50% precision, 98.31% recall, and 99.14% specificity on the Relatable Clothing dataset, outperforming our previous iterations.

abstract={Accurate prediction of inventory can improve inventory value, speed up the capital turnover and improve the profitability of enterprises. It has become a hot research topic in recent years. Taking the business process of agricultural enterprise as the research background. Using multiple imputation methods to optimize the BP (Back Propagation) neural network inventory forecasting model, and combined with the demand of the inventory business personnel and functional units, we propose a novel inventory prediction method based on BP neural network. The method takes the four factors of conventional, policy, drug resistance and market as the BP neural network to predict the inventory requirements of the input layer samples. When the input layer lack of sample data, this method uses multiple imputation method for missing data for each value instead of fetching the collection, by exploring each value instead of the prediction error trend under the combination to find a better value. After data filtering and missing data interpolation, the sample data is input into the BP neural network prediction model. The simulation results show that the proposed method has less error and has the advantages and advantages than the existing methods.},

abstract={Objective manual dexterity assessment is useful for early detection of age-related functional decline and for prediction of cognitive decline. Such assessments are carried out by clinicians using traditional tests and scales. The Box and Blocks Test (BBT) is one of such scale, focusing on the measurement of unilateral gross manual dexterity. Subjects are scored based on the number of blocks transferred from one compartment to the other compartment in a time window. Currently, most works on automatic BBT take advantage of the data captured by deep camera. However, these kind of solutions are limited by computational complexity and the accuracy of color segmentation. Based on recent success of wearable equipments, in this paper, we research multimodal wearable sensors based Box and Block Test system (wBBT). wBBT takes advantage of 5 kinds of time series signal, including Electromyographic, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Orientation and Orientation Euler for automatic manual dexterity assessment. In addition, we research 9 deep neural network structures (3 multimodal signal fusion methods × 3 network cells) for multimodal signal based blocks moving motion recognition. To evaluate the feasibility of wBBT, we collect the data of 37 subjects, including 25 subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 12 normal subjects. Experimental results show that wBBT is a useful tool for automatic assessment of unilateral gross manual dexterity.},

abstract={Recent advancements in human-computer interaction research have led to the possibility of emotional communication via brain-computer interface systems for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders or disabilities. In this paper, we efficiently recognize emotional states by analyzing the features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which are generated from EEG sensors that noninvasively measure the electrical activity of neurons inside the human brain, and select the optimal combination of these features for recognition. In this paper, the scalp EEG data of 21 healthy subjects (12-14 years old) were recorded using a 14-channel EEG machine while the subjects watched images with four types of emotional stimuli (happy, calm, sad, or scared). After preprocessing, the Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity) were used to measure the signal activity of the time series data. We selected the optimal EEG features using a balanced one-way ANOVA after calculating the Hjorth parameters for different frequency ranges. Features selected by this statistical method outperformed univariate and multivariate features. The optimal features were further processed for emotion classification using support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, random forest, deep learning, and four ensembles methods (bagging, boosting, stacking, and voting). The results show that the proposed method substantially improves the emotion recognition rate with respect to the commonly used spectral power band method.},

year={2017},

pages={1-7},
abstract={Participatory sensing of traffic, where Internet users share traffic situations either observed by them or automatically sensed by sensors on their smartphones, has become an established means of collecting real-time traffic information (e.g., Google Traffic and Waze). Recent studies have identified strong correlation between social media activity and traffic patterns in the New York area. Interestingly, social media communication leads road traffic. This project computes similar correlations in southern California with an aim to increase the time-resolution of vehicle traffic prediction as near real-time message volume information is available from online social networks. This study collects the number of public messages sent from southern California on the Twitter social media platform. Messages related to several topics are collected. Vehicle flow data at major freeways in the Los Angeles region as measured by Caltrans' extensive network of inductive loop sensors from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). The correlation between the two datasets - social media communications and vehicle traffic - is calculated between these datasets. The strengths of these correlations are used to describe the relationship between social media traffic and vehicular traffic in different regions in the southern California. Results show that social media communication is correlated to traffic sensor data with both showing a periodic pattern with approximately the same period. The relationship between social media and vehicular traffic is similar in different roadways in the same region and also holds across regions. Correlation of traffic with volume of social media communications is maximized with a lag of approximately 3 hours (i.e., social media changes appear before traffic volume changes). If further study can also show that there is predictive value in this observation, the time resolution of traffic prediction can be increased by adapting it to real-time changes in social media message volume.},

abstract={Finding potential customers in social networks is a hard challenge for today's businesses. But by listening to the noise of social network posts, we identify users, who express a demand for a certain product. We achieve this identification with a two-stage text categorization classifier: First, we detect whether the post expresses a demand for some product in general. Second, we detect, which product the post is about. By using the company's brochures, we minimize the integration effort for our system. However, this approach is difficult, because brochures differ from social network posts in style and length and only few brochures exist for each product. By employing feature selection and document sampling we are able to cope with these issues. Our evaluation has shown the practicability of this approach and supports our decisions for a two-stage classifier, document sampling and strict feature selection.},

abstract={As organizations increasingly adopt AI technologies, a number of ethical issues arise. Much research focuses on algorithmic bias, but there are other important concerns arising from the new uses of data and the introduction of technologies which may impact individuals. This paper examines the interplay between AI, Data Protection and FAT (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency) principles. We review the potential impact of the GDPR and consider the importance of the management of AI adoption. A survey of data protection experts is presented, the initial analysis of which provides some early insights into the praxis of AI in operational contexts. The findings indicate that organizations are not fully compliant with the GDPR, and that there is limited understanding of the relevance of FAT principles as AI is introduced. Those organizations which demonstrate greater GDPR compliance are likely to take a more cautious, risk-based approach to the introduction of AI.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) enables the automation of data collection and processing functions but exposes a huge amount of data to the cyberattacks risk. To tackle this issue, anomaly detection allows to identify data points, events, and/or observations that deviate from a dataset's normal behaviour indicating eventual critical incidents. In this paper, we focus on the imbalance data and the minority classes problem where the number of abnormal samples is much less than normal (secure) samples. In particular, this paper presents a new equilibrium model based on a Genetic Algorithm to improve Generative Adversarial networks (GANs). This model addresses the problem of class imbalance to anomaly detection system performance. The proposed approach use is illustrated by a case study: an intelligent transport system-based scenario.},

pages={2383-2388},
abstract={Traffic signs occupy a small proportion in the image, which makes feature extraction difficult. This study focuses on small prohibitory signs. First, we introduce super resolution (SR), which can improve the quality of the image, to solve the recognition problem of small prohibitory signs. Second, we propose a new model that can detect and classify various prohibitory signs compared with a traditional joint model. The proposed model utilizes the color and shape of prohibitory signs in generating proposals and filters the negative samples. The retained proposals are divided into small, medium, and large objects based on the size of prohibitory signs, and the small and medium objects are reconstructed through SR. Finally, the proposals are classified by using support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. Experiments on Tsinghua-Tencent 100K and German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible. The proposed method achieves recognition accuracies of 78% and 67% on the small objects of Tsinghua- Tencent 100K and GTSRB datasets, respectively, which exceed the recognition accuracy without SR.},

abstract={Head pose is an important indicator of driving attention detection. During driving, head pose, including head position and head movement, can infer the driver's attention. This paper presents a novel method for collecting driver's head pose information using a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope head-mounted inertial sensor. In our experimental study, we designed 10 scenes that are easy to distract from driving. And five subjects were asked to wear a head-mounted inertial sensor to drive the driving simulator. This driving simulator is equipped with real driving conditions such as brakes, steering wheels, accelerators and so on. While driving, subjects need to complete the designed driving scene in order. Subsequently, We perform pre-processing such as Savitzky-Golay filtering and windowing on data collected by inertial sensors with built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes. The time domain and frequency domain features of the data are then extracted in the corresponding window. Finally, we designed a random forest model to detect driving attention. Our simulation experiments show that our proposed method of collecting data using the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope's head-mounted sensor can achieve higher precision, recall and F1Score.},

abstract={The ability to sense the environment is the cornerstone of the Internet of Things (IoT), which is a rapidly expanding paradigm that is altering the way we interact with machines. IoT enables a range of new services to enhance the lives of endusers. One of these services concerns activity recognition within Ambient Assisted Living which can be used to help people live independently at home for longer. Many of these applications can, however, be prone to failure and vulnerable to attack. Extensive research is therefore required to build towards a secure and sustainable IoT. This work examines activity recognition in a smart home environment using three different classifiers on a well-known activity recognition dataset. Fail-dirty and device shut-down data is introduced in the dataset to examine the impact that this erroneous data has on the application. This study found that it was possible to rank the importance of sensors with regards to their influence on classification by observing how these failures impacted the classifiers when compared to the fmeasure produced from the classification of the clean data. This work also found that while representing data in a binary format obtains higher accuracy, it makes the classifier considerably more vulnerable to dirty data. Lastly, this study found that decision tree classifiers have an inherent vulnerability when it comes to handling dirty data, resulting in a 24% reduction in performance versus the clean data, due to the structuring and placement of leaf nodes in the tree.},

This paper outlines the Cloud infrastructure and the use of the systems for a range of gender-oriented sentiment classification scenarios.},

abstract={The Environment of Underground safety issue in the mining industry has attracted lots of research attention in recent years. It is vital to design new systems and methods to prevent dangerous incidents in the mining industry. With the development of the Internet of Things, existing work most consider to collect the data and compute them in the cloud. However, the conventional methods could cause long transmission latency as the data is transmitted to the remote end cloud servers. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) architecture for the mining industry to ensure the safety of the mining field. Notably, we propose a safety scheme to avoid the gas explosion through learning, collecting, and analysing the sensory data from the underground minefield. By adopting the well-known EdgeCloudSim simulator, the experimental results show that our proposal is a feasible solution to guarantee mining safety.},

With single data used in the previous studies, it cannot make a comprehensive response of user behavior patterns. So we collected fine-grained sensing data which could reflect user daily behavior fully from multiple dimensions based on smartphone, and then used multidimensional data feature fusion method and six classification methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forests. Finally, we carried out contrast experiment with twelve volunteers' hybrid data and personal data respectively to recognized user emotion based on discrete emotion model and circumplex emotion model. The results show that the multidimensional data feature fusion method we mentioned which could reflect user behavior comprehensively present high accuracy. The initial use of the hybrid data train only have 72.73% accuracy rate, but after personal data training the accuracy rate can reach 79.78%. In the experimental of different emotion model, circumplex emotion model is better than discrete emotion model.},

abstract={Mental stress is a critical factor affecting one's physical and mental well-being. At the early stage, the effect of stress is often underestimated, while it usually leads to serious issue Lateran. Therefore, it is crucial to detect stress before it evolves into severe problems. Traditional stress detection methods are based on either questionnaires or professional devices, which are time-consuming, costly and intrusive. With the popularity of smartphones embedded with a rich set of sensors, which can capture people's context, such as movement, sound, location and so on, it is an alternative way to access people's behavior by smartphones. Through an empirical study, this paper proposes an automatic and non-intrusive stress detection framework based on smartphone sensing data. First, we construct various discriminative features from multi-modality phone sensing data, in which both absolute and relative features are considered to make the model more personalized. Then, to tackle the challenge of label insufficiency, we further develop a co-training based method for stress level classification. Finally, we evaluate our model based on an open dataset, and the experimental results verify its advantages over other baselines.},

The NVIDIA AI City Challenge is envisioned to provide similar impetus to the analysis of image and video data that helps make cities smarter and safer. In its first year, this Challenge has focused on traffic video data. While millions of traffic video cameras around the world capture data, albeit low-quality, very little automated analysis and value creation results. Lack of labeled data, and trained models that can be deployed at the edge of the city fabric, ensure that most traffic video data goes through little or no automated analysis. Real-time and batch analysis of this data can provide vital breakthroughs in real-time traffic management as well as pedestrian safety. The NVIDIA AI City Challenge brought together 29 teams from universities in 4 continents to collaboratively annotate a 125 hour data set and then compete on detection, localization and classification tasks as well as traffic and safety application analytics tasks. The result is the largest high quality annotated data set, a set of models trained using NVIDIA AI City Edge to Cloud platform and ready to be deployed at the edge solving traffic and safety problems for cities worldwide.},

abstract={Under the premise that big data, smart cities, mobile internet, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things have become the market for information ownership, cyber security threats are becoming more and more serious. Network attacks have begun to shift to the direction of stealing complex network attacks, and it is of great significance to study the prediction methods of stealing complex network attacks. The purpose of this article is to consider the security situational awareness of the theft-type complex network attack monitoring method for research. This paper introduces and divides the stages of the stealing complex network attack in detail, proposes an alarm algorithm based on the aggregation stage of redundant relationships and an algorithm based on the causal probability correlation attack stage, and illustrates the process of extracting attack scenarios. This article proposes and compares three network security situational awareness models and introduces in detail the two model structures of random forest and star. Experimental data shows that before optimization, the detection rates of Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Neural Network are 75%, 80%, and 65%. After optimization, the detection rates of Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Neural Network are 96%, 90%, and 92%. This is because the original data has been effectively preprocessed after the first stage of situational awareness, so that the neural network model and the naive Bayesian structure model overcome the sensitivity to the shortcomings of the data set, resulting in a higher detection rate.},

In order to seek better solutions and achieve more efficient information retrieval, artificial intelligence (AI) serves as a strong technical earthquake and contributes a lot to data analysis and decision making. It plays a compelling role in prompting digital and intelligent services. In this article, we focus on and emphasize the great significance pertaining to the convergence of IoT and AI. We first elaborate two typical forms of AI, namely knowledge-enabled AI and data-driven AI, with a comparison between respective advantages and disadvantages. Then we survey recent progress relating to the convergence of AI throughout the IoT architecture, from the sensing layer through the network layer to the application layer. In addition, a case study of a smart city is presented illustrating the convergence between IoT and AI. Furthermore, we point out open issues worth further research. The convergence of IoT and AI marries the merits of both and enables strong capability of resolving a broad range of problems.},

Inherent complexity of cluttered environmentsis considered the major barrier to achieve good performances. To address this challenge, we present a novel method that includes head-worn eye tracker and egocentric video. Our method exploits sliding window-based time series approach in conjunction with aHeuristic probabilistic function to analyse user fixations around potential object of interest in an egocentric video.

abstract={With the quick development of mobile Internet and the popularity of smartphones, smartphone-based transportation mode detection has become a hot topic, which is able to provide effective data support for urban planning and traffic management. Though the popular GPS based transportation mode detection method has achieved reasonable accuracy, this method consumes large power, thus limiting it to be used in smartphones. Here, we propose a novel transportation mode detection algorithm using recurrent neural network. In order to identify transportation modes with low power consumption, this algorithm only uses four low-power-consumption sensors (namely accelerator, gyroscope, magnetometer and barometer) which are embedded in the commodity smartphones. Furthermore, we exploited the good representative ability of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and applied it to recognizing the transportation modes to achieve higher accuracy. To filter noises, a preprocessing is applied. After calculating features, we adopt the LSTM learning algorithm to train a model of transportation mode recognition and employ this model to predict transportation modes. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms the compared state-of-the-art transportation recognition methods with 96.9% accuracy to detect four transportation modes, namely buses, cars, subways, and trains.},

abstract={Collaborative Filtering (CF) has been widely used in recommendation due to its brevity and effectiveness. However, rating sparsity or even cold-start is still an inevitable problem when facing CF. Although multimodal information can be easily found in today's website, most existing CF methods are not well designed to incorporate them appropriately. In this paper, we intend to explore the potential methods of fusing abundant auxiliary cross-media information of user and items to help enhance traditional CF. In general, we divide the auxiliary data into discrete partial features (tags, genres...) and continuous global features (images, videos...) for different purposes. As for discrete features, embedding is adopted to represent them. In order to merge different discrete components, we use attention mechanism to adaptively learn their respective importance in contributing to a specific rating prediction. While for the continuous features, we use feature extraction network such as CNN to exploit informative representation to help restrain item's embedding space, consequently the interpretability of factorized vectors is improved. To validate the performance of our proposed method, extensive evaluations on public MovieLens dataset are carried. Experimental results on MSE improvements demonstrate both the importance of the auxiliary information and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract={In supervised medical image learning, labels for disease images are indispensable. The correctness of labels has a significant influence on disease discrimination. However, the labelling of disease images by professional doctors is a time-consuming and labour-intensive project; therefore, obtaining correct and high-quality labels is a difficult task in medical image learning. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network-based label completion and correction strategy for supervised medical image learning. We take the diagnosis of Seborrheic Keratosis (SK) and Flat Wart (FW) as examples and perform the label completion and correction on a dataset containing confocal laser scanning microscope images. Experimental results show that this strategy can use limited labelled data to complete the labels for most of the unlabelled data and correct some noise labels in the dataset, which improves the accurate rate of the model to identify diseases.},

On the basis of independently RNN (IndRNN), Softmax was introduced to improve the model stability. The SIndRNN model can eliminate some useless information with low probability in the longer time step by adjusting the weight based on probability, so as to ensure the model stability. Meanwhile, it has the characteristics of fast convergence rate, longer time step information processing and effective multi-layer superposition.

The research results show that LSTM can effectively analyze and predict SST. The accuracy of area-averaged SST prediction depends on the length of training observation time sequence. The increase in sequence length enhances prediction accuracy. Given training data of a dozen years, the accuracy of a 30-day length prediction can reach up to 95.87%, which meets the requirements of ocean forecasting. The study also revealed that specifying an observation length, the area-averaged prediction accuracy of a 30-day length prediction for different locations of the cold water mass make no difference.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Internet technology and social media, people are accustomed to making comments on the Internet. Sentiment analysis, as an efficient technique, has been used by researchers in the tasks of analysing the sentiment polarity under these comments. To better achieve this target, the fundamental challenge is how to extract the feature and build a proper mechanism to learn them. A lot of word embedding based deep learning models for sentiment analysis are proposed in the literature. And the semi-supervised learning methods make it possible to use both labelled and unlabelled data for this kind of task. Furthermore, the attention mechanism proposed in recent years has achieved great accomplishments for natural language processing (NLP) tasks since it helps to capture the important information of the documents. In this paper, inspired by these works, we proposed a long short term memory (LSTM) based semi-supervised attention framework for sentiment analysis tasks, which is composed of an unsupervised attention based LSTM encoder-decoder and an attention based supervised LSTM model attached by a Softmax layer. The unsupervised part worked for attaining the high dimensional representation of the documents, and the supervised part extracted feature and enhanced the important parts for classification. Experimental study on commonly used datasets has demonstrated its ability for sentiment analysis tasks.},

abstract={In this study, we take on one of the most common challenges in facial recognition, i.e. reducing the False Positives in the recognition phase, through studying performance of a standard Deep Learning Convolutional network in real-life, real-time, and large-scale identity surveillance application. This application involved designing a queue management system that uses facial recognition, for an airport in the UK. Our approach was to capture the faces of passengers as they enter through Boarding Pass Gates (BPG) and as they exit Security Gates (SG). Thereafter, we compare the faces captured, within 15 minutes time, from BPG against the ones from SG. When there is a match, we are able to calculate the time that someone has spent inside the security area, using the capture time of matched face. We call this the security queue time. Like any other facial recognition application, we have to deal with reducing the number of false positives, i.e. incorrectly matched faces. In this application false positives are statistically rare events. That is, the same or similar pair of images is unlikely to occur in a foreseeable time. To deal with this problem, we utilized several approaches including applying the Dlib library to improve the quality of the detected faces. Specifically, by taking advantage of Dlib's Facial Landmarks, we created a scoring system similar to Dlib's scoring system to chose the best frontal pose among all faces attributed to a single person. Our large-scale trials show that the approach does measurably reduce the rate of false positives in such systems.},

As per the idea of ITS, intelligence incorporated in existing vehicles, both private and public, is expected to make vehicle management inexpensive and less complex. Some of the barriers in successful deployment of ITS have been its reliability, scalability, interoperability and security. Communication plays a big role in ITS and Wi-Fi/ cellular technologies have been used to facilitate Car-to-Server (C2S) and Server-to-Server (S2S) type communication. Car-to-Car (C2C) communication emerges as a more resource constrained and challenging model. Due to strict real-time, low delay and high security requirements, C2C presents several avenues for research. In this work, we investigate the network and security concerns of C2C architecture of ITS. Based on our study, we propose an effective approach for C2C communication using event-triggered broadcast of information.

abstract={System logs provide invaluable resources for understanding system behavior and detecting anomalies on high performance computing (HPC) systems. As HPC systems continue to grow in both scale and complexity, the sheer volume of system logs and the complex interaction among system components make the traditional manual problem diagnosis and even automated line-by-line log analysis infeasible or ineffective. In this paper, we present a System Log Event Block Detection (SLEBD) framework that identifies groups of log messages that follow certain sequence but with variations, and explore these event blocks for event-based system behavior analysis and anomaly detection. Compared with the existing approaches that analyze system logs line by line, SLEBD is capable of characterizing system behavior and identifying intricate anomalies at a higher (i.e., event) level. We evaluate the performance of SLEBD by using syslogs collected from production supercomputers. Experimental results show that our framework and mechanisms can process streaming log messages, efficiently extract event blocks and effectively detect anomalies, which enables system administrators and monitoring tools to understand and process system events in real time. Additionally, we use the identified event blocks and explore deep learning algorithms to model and classify event sequences.},

abstract={In healthcare process, a key research part is to learn the dynamical human body mechanism. Because human body is a tremendous complicated non-linear dynamical system, it is almost an unfulfillable task to build a precise model for human body system. Thanks to the advances of deep learning technologies, it becomes possible to approximate the complicated functions of human body system. Particularly, the latent health state transitions of human body system usually have time delay. This paper proposes a body simulator framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for emulating the latent health state transitions of human body. The body simulator can receive interventions that will affect its latent health state, and generate observable data that can reflect its latent health state. The paper implements an experimental architecture of the proposed framework. The experimental architecture is tested in three typical cases of health state transitions. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can fit the situations that the state transitions have time delay.},

abstract={Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in the working-age population all over the world. Classifying DR is a time-consuming work, which requires an experienced ophthalmologist to evaluate color fundus photographs of retina. In this paper, we propose a deeply supervised ResNet approach to classify the severity of DR automatically. In this new convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture, we add three sets of additional side-output layers to intermediate hidden layers of a 11-layer ResNet. By introducing these deeply supervised layers, we can provide additional regularization during training network. More importantly, we can perform multi-scale learning by leveraging the predictions of intermediate supervised layers, thus improving the final performance. Furthermore, to combat the issue of class-imbalance in the dataset, we adopt cost sensitive learning and an oversampling method of cropping images. We train and evaluate our network on the publicly available Kaggle dataset, and the results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method.},

abstract={The number of accidents during driving is increasing day by day and drowsy driving has been implicated as a causal factor of road accidents. Research on driver drowsiness detection is important to improve road traffic safety. However, most of the conventional methods are intrusive since they often require expensive sensors. Moreover, their performances are rather limited since only single features and shallow classifiers are adopted. In this paper, we propose DrowsyDet, a real-time mobile application to detect driver drowsiness. DrowsyDet consists of the following steps. Firstly, the facial region and landmarks are extracted with a face detection model and landmark model. Secondly, three CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) models are built to classify facial drowsiness state, eyes state, and mouth state respectively. Finally, the drivers' state (i.e. normal, yawn, and sleep) is obtained based on all the models' results. All the models are lightweight CNN models that can be deployed on a mobile phone. Compared with existing methods, DrowsyDet is non-intrusive since it only requires a mobile phone without the Internet. We also build a large driver drowsiness dataset to test our approach, which includes different genders, ages, head poses, and illuminations. Experimental results demonstrate that DrownsyDet can reach a significantly high average accuracy of 97.8%.},

abstract={Recent progresses in video action recognition are driven by the great success of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). Many researches have investigated modeling spatiotemporal architecture with ConvNets to take full advantage of video information. However, the quality of video representations that serve as the network inputs, is often insufficient due to significant background motion. In this paper, we propose an Improved Dynamic Image (IDI) to describe videos by applying salient object detection and rank pooling on sequence of still images. Saliency detection aims to segment objects of interest which can be viewed as image-level background motion removal, while rank pooling is used to construct dynamic images as input to ConvNets. We also present a temporal Residual Network (ResNet) architecture which directly operates on multiple IDIs for long-term video representations learning. Experiments on two standard action recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without combining video-level representations (e.g. dense optical flow) as well as hand-designed features (e.g. improved dense trajectories).},

year={2018},
volume={},
number={},
pages={425-431},
abstract={The number of hidden neurons in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) greatly affects the model accuracy. When fewer neurons are used, less training time is involved and the accuracy is in a lower degree. Once we increase the number of hidden units, the performance will be encouraged but the training overhead will enhance exponentially. In this work, we propose a novel active propagation training strategy for distributed RNN, which is inspired by the information transmission in biological neuron system. With the aim to improve the training efficiency of RNN, the proposed active propagation avoids the traditional fixed number of neurons in training. Instead, when training the distributed RNN, the autonomous neuron dynamically activates new neurons and propagates the accumulated training information to them. The neurons not only learn from the training data but also from other neurons. Different from a fixed large number of neurons, the valid neurons are increased gradually and the model performance is promoted accordingly. A prototype of active propagation RNN (APRNN) is implemented on Spark and multiple evaluations are carried out on language modeling tasks. The results show that compared with the fixed-neurons training, APRNN can reduce the training time while keeping a comparable accuracy. The improvement is more significant on large scale training corpora.},

abstract={Motion related human action recognition using wearable sensors can potentially enable various useful daily applications. So far, most studies view it as a stand-alone mathematical classification problem without considering the physical nature of human motions. Consequently, they suffer from data dependencies and encounter the disaster of dimension problem and the o1ver-fitting issue, and their models are never human-readable. In this study, we start from a deep analysis on natural physical properties of human motions, and then propose a useful feature selection method to quantify each feature's classification contribution capability. On one hand, the “disaster of dimension” problem can be avoid to some extent, due to the constrained dimension of key features; On the other hand, over-fitting issue can be eased since the knowledge implied in human motions are nearly invariant, which compensates the possible data inadequacy. The experiment results indicate that the proposed method performs superior to those adopted in related works, such as decision tree, k-NN, SVM, neural networks.},

abstract={Mobile browsers are one of the most popular applications on mobile devices. However, as the requirements for low latency and the increasingly complex websites, the modern browsers become energy hungry to satisfy the user experiences. Previous studies have shown that the webpage rendering contributes the most to the overall overhead. In this paper, we propose a predictive model to schedule the rendering work to achieve the purpose of maximizing the user quality-of-experience (QoE). Both of the users' delay-tolerance and energy consumption are considered in our QoE evaluation. To this end, we characterize the webpage workload and leverage a machine learning technique to find the correlation between the webpage workload and the QoE. Finally, we build a governor to predict which processor configuration can be used to execute the web rendering engine at runtime, and then schedule the rendering process based on the predicted results. Our approach are useful for not only web browsers but also a large number of mobile apps which are underpinned by web rendering techniques.We evaluate the performance of our approach on a representative mobile heterogeneous platform by using the hottest 1000 webpages, the results show high prediction accuracy for the predicted model of 85.3%. Overall, our approach delivers an average of 47.3% higher QoE than the mobile system default governor, Interactive, with an average energy reduction of 38.5% and 1.12x performance speedup.},

abstract={Predicting the success of movies has been of interest to economists and investors (media and production houses) as well as predictive analysts. A number of attributes such as cast, genre, budget, production house, PG rating affect the popularity of a movie. Social media such as Twitter, YouTube etc. are major platforms where people can share their views about the movies. This paper describes experiments in predictive analysis using machine learning algorithms on both conventional features, collected from movies databases on Web as well as social media features (text comments on YouTube, Tweets). The results demonstrate that the sentiments harnessed from social media and other social media features can predict the success with more accuracy than that of using conventional features. We achieved best value of 77% and 61% using selected social media features for Rating and Income prediction respectively, whereas selected conventional features gave results of 76.2% and 52% respectively. More it was found that the blend of both types of attributes (conventional and those collected from social media) can outperform the existing approaches in this domain.},

Namely, we propose using only one feature, the Root Mean Square (RMS) signal value, and the KNN supervised classification algorithm. The system is evaluated in an DE10-Standard FPGA to demonstrate portability to wearable devices with limited hardware resources. Tests show that subjects only need three seconds per gesture to train the system, which avoids processing large amounts of data and improves user experience during the equipment setup. Furthermore, the accuracy of the system reaches 95% using only 2 seconds of data effectively maintaining both human and hardware resources low.},

abstract={Security systems using brain signals or Electroencephalogram (EEG), attempt to exploit chaotic nature of brain signals and their individuality to derive security primitives that are hard to reproduce. In this sense, the signal features are extracted to train a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for classification. However, although brain signals are chaotic, feature extraction process might reduce the chaos rendering features in a way that they can be generated. Besides, even if features are chaotic, ML techniques might classify them in such a manner that an element in a particular class becomes easy to generate. In this paper, we perform entropy analysis on common features used in EEG-based security systems to estimate their information content, which is used to propose a novel technique for EEG signal generation in feature domain instead of time domain. These generated signals can potentially be used for spoofing attacks. We consider five types of feature extraction techniques and six classifiers found in recently proposed security systems, and analyze their vulnerability to spoofing attacks using generated EEG signals. The results show that the generation scheme can synthesize artificial signals to get classified as genuine brain signals by ML algorithms.},

abstract={This paper describes a novel method for recognizing different soil types based on inertial data generated by a user's gait. To achieve this objective, a new wearable device which aims at collecting data produced by an embedded 6-axis accelerometer/gyroscope was designed first. To command this piece of hardware (start and stop recording, as well as annotate raw data), a mobile application was specifically developed. A total of 70 well-known features both from time and frequency domains that are mostly used in activity recognition were computed over each signal to produce enough discriminating characteristics. Then, two machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors) were employed to classify such data. The proposed method was tested with 9 participants on four soil types with an experimental setup close to real use case situations. Results obtained let us state that a soil-types recognition is not only possible but also accurate and reliable since overall median F-Score measures of 82% and 86% were obtained respectively with the Random Forest and the k-NN classifiers.

abstract={With the development of the network and the popularization of smart phones and computers, E-commerce is developing rapidly. In order to occupy more market shares, merchants sometimes run big promotions on particular dates. Unfortunately, many of the attracted buyers are one-time deal hunters, and these promotions may have little long lasting impact on sales. To alleviate this problem, it is important for merchants to identify who can be converted into repeated buyers. By targeting on these potential loyal customers, merchants can greatly reduce the promotion cost and enhance the return on investment. According to the idea of ensemble learning in machine learning, this paper proposes a two-layer model fusion algorithm(TMFBG) based on GBDT to predict repeat buyers. The algorithm is validated on the publication data from the behavior data of certain customers of the yearly "Double 11" on Tmall platform. The experimental results show that this fusion algorithm can improve the prediction precision and the model robustness.},

abstract={Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a fundamental problem in linear algebra and it has applications in many fields. For example, as a data reduction technique, SVD is widely used for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It also has extensive applications in the machine learning domain. For example, it is widely used in feature selection, data clustering, classification, and regression. Traditional sequential SVD algorithms take cubic time which may not be affordable especially when the input matrix is large. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop efficient sequential and parallel SVD algorithms. Jacobi iteration, as one of the most common SVD algorithms, has attracted a lot of attention. Among many algorithms that have been proposed, there are some relaxation schemes that have been proven to be very effective in parallel Jacobi-SVD computing. Such relaxation schemes are platform and architecture independent. In this paper, we propose some novel techniques to further generalize and speedup these relaxation schemes. Theoretical analysis proves the efficiency of our algorithms. Experimental results also show that our algorithms outperform the existing ones.},

abstract={In Machine learning (ML) the model we use is increasingly important, and the model's parameters, the key point of the ML, are adjusted through iteratively processing a training dataset until convergence. Although data-parallel ML systems often engage a perfect error tolerance when synchronizing the model parameters for maximizing parallelism, the synchronization of model parameters may delay in completion, a problem that generally gets worse at a large scale. This paper presents a Bounded Asynchronous Parallel (BAP) model of computation that allows computations using stale model parameters in order to reduce synchronization overheads. In the meanwhile, our BAP model ensures theoretical convergence guarantees for large scale data-parallel ML applications. This model permits distributed workers to use the stale parameters storing in the local cache, instead of waiting until the Parameter Server (PS) produces a new version. This expressively reduces the time workers spend on waiting. Furthermore, the BAP model guarantees the convergence of ML algorithm by bounding the maximum distance of the stale parameters. Experiments conducted on 4 cluster nodes with up to 32 GPUs showed that our model significantly improved the proportion of computing time relative to the waiting time and led to 1.2-2×speedup. Besides, we elaborated how to choose the staleness threshold when considering the tradeoff between Efficiency and Speed.},

year={2018},

pages={820-827},
abstract={In this paper, we propose an in-memory architecture called H-Memcached, which can solve the mismatch of local disks on modern supercomputers. It helps avoid out of memory and makes large-scale datasets fit into memory. Hadoop and Spark are good choices to run MapReduce and Machine learning algorithms, such as PageRank and K-means clustering. A supercomputer is a high-speed network cluster consisting of thousands of compute nodes where local disks are typically not available. All nodes share the same disk called the central disk, and disk I/O to that storage is expensive. To avoid disk I/O, in-memory Hadoop/Spark is required to fit into supercomputer environment. However, memory is limited on each node and out of memory happens when data does not fit into memory. In our proposal, a group of nodes are allocated and used as a storage device instead of the central disk. The uniqueness of H-Memcached is that some computation resources are used for data storage rather than running computation tasks. Nodes which are dedicated to data storage are less busy and give more memory for in-memory storage. Compared to the central disk on the FX10 supercomputer, our experimental results show that H-Memcached reduces execution time by 25% on average.},

abstract={The main technical challenge in device-free localization and tracking (DFLT) based on the received signal strength (RSS) is that the existence of multipath interferences will weaken the detection ability of RSS data of RF links. This difficulty will lead to performance degradation of wireless sensor network in cluttered environments. To address this challenge, this work focuses on developing a data-driven three-dimensional RSS model that can fully tap the certainty of target-induced shadow fading and reduce the uncertainty caused by multipath fading in RSS data. The novelty of our proposed model is twofold. Firstly, the RSS model is developed under relevance vector machine (RVM) framework with respect to three modeling parameters, that is, the excess path length, the proximity to TX/RX nodes and the static fade level. Secondly, as an alternative to existing empirical RSS modeling methods, our RVM-based modeling method can not only effectively capture complicated relationships among various modeling dimensions by machine learning but also have stronger representation ability on RSS data. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model in DFLT performance improvement.},

abstract={Short text similarity measures have lots of applications in online social networks (OSN), as they are being integrated in machine learning algorithms. However, the data quality is a major challenge in most OSNs, particularly Twitter. The sparse, ambiguous, informal, and unstructured nature of the medium impose difficulties to capture the underlying semantics of the text. Therefore, text pre-processing is a crucial phase in similarity identification applications, such as clustering and classification. This is because selecting the appropriate data processing methods contributes to the increase in correlations of the similarity measure. This research proposes a novel heuristic-driven pre-processing methodology for enhancing the performance of similarity measures in the context of Twitter tweets. The components of the proposed pre-processing methodology are discussed and evaluated on an annotated dataset that was published as part of SemEval-2014 shared task. An experimental analysis was conducted using the cosine angle as a similarity measure to assess the effect of our method against a baseline (C-Method). Experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms the baseline in terms of correlations and error rates.},

However, there are several problems obstructing applying general CRFs on online social network data mining tasks. For demonstration, we propose a unified CRF model for trust prediction to tackle the following problems: trust relationships are directed but existing work mostly deals with undirected links; online social networks are generally large and sparse, and traditional methods and their implementations perform poor on large datasets in both predictive accuracy and time efficiency. The proposed model has its unifications in three aspects: it models various types of entities in online social networks and captures the interconnection and interplay between them, it considers both directed links and undirected links, and it can embrace an arbitrary number of features to model the real-world online social networks. For better performance, our model is implemented with parallel computing support and gain further speedups by utilizing multiple GPU devices with massive computation powers. Experimental results show both the model's validity and the implementation's effectiveness.},

abstract={APT(Advanced persist threat) is an emerging attack on the Internet. Attackers may combine phishing emails, malware, social engineering and botnets to create a series of attacks in one APT attack which makes it quite difficult for detection. In this way, attackers can remotely control the infected host, or steal sensitive information. In this paper, we proposed a time transform features approach for distinguishing APT attacks based on the observation that malicious payload must be transferred to the target hosts in an APT attack. By comparing the normal traffic with the traffic containing a malicious payload, we are able to catch the signal of malicious payload and further infer the existence of APT attacks. Then we use machine learning methods to detect APT attacks in big data. To verify this approach, we placed a device on the gateway of our university for catching the real Internet traffic of the university for one month. Then we mixed the APT traffic with these flows, and see whether our approach can identify the malicious payloads. We found our approach is not only accurate but also efficient for catching APT attacks.},

abstract={Large scale disasters usually caused people trapped inside a building. In many cases, these people lost their motion ability and consciousness. For example, after a strong earthquake struck, people might first be hit by heavy objects or forced down by dropped objects, and then lost consciousness. The situation becomes dangerous if trapped people cannot be detected and pull out in time. Therefore, finding trapped victims inside a building in time becomes a very important issue for responders and command centers. Due to the popularity of video surveillance systems, several image-based methods have been proposed to detect trapped people by using machine learning technology to identify human features. However, trapped victims were usually covered by fallen objects. Detecting human features of trapped victims could be difficult. In this paper, we proposed, Indoor Trapped-Victim Detection System (iTEDS), an image recognition system to identify and recognize trapped victims inside a building. Given a video, we track people and big objects, such as bookcases, tables, chests and so on, inside a building. If a huge object falls on top of a person and makes the person unable to move for a while, we mark the person as a trapped victim. In order to investigate the effectiveness of iTEDS, we applied iTEDS to the accident that a dresser fell on twin boys. Our results showed that iTEDS successfully identified the trapped boys underneath the dresser.},

abstract={Recent research has proven the feasibility of using Process Mining algorithms to discover business processes from event logs of structured data. However, many IT systems also store a considerable amount of unstructured data. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems typically store information about interactions with customers, such as emails, phone calls, meetings, etc. These activities are characteristically made up of unstructured data, such as a free text subject and description of the interaction, but only limited structured data is available to classify them. This poses a problem to the traditional Process Mining approach that relies on an event log made up of clearly categorised activities. This paper proposes an original framework to mine processes from CRM data, by leveraging the unstructured part of the data. This method uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), an unsupervised machine learning technique, to automatically detect and assign labels to activities. This framework does not require any human intervention. A case study with real-world CRM data validates the feasibility of our approach.},

abstract={This paper presents a probabilistic approach for the identification of abnormal behaviour in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from dense sensor data collected from 30 participants. The ADLs considered are related to preparing and drinking (i) tea, and (ii) coffee. Abnormal behaviour identified in the context of these activities can be an indicator of a progressive health problem or the occurrence of a hazardous incident. The approach presented considers the temporal and sequential aspects of the actions that are part of each ADL and that vary between participants. The average and standard deviation for the duration and number of steps of each activity are calculated to define the average time and steps and a range within which a behaviour could be considered as normal for each stage and activity. The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is used to obtain the probabilities of abnormal behaviours related to the early and late completion of activities and stages within an activity in terms of time and steps. Analysis shows that CDF can provide precise and reliable results regarding the presence of abnormal behaviour in stages and activities that last over a minute or consist of many steps. Finally, this approach could be used to train machine learning algorithms for abnormal behaviour detection.},

abstract={The Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) is an algorithm for solving large-scale machine learning optimization problems. In order to reduce the communication delay in a distributed environment, asynchronous distributed ADMM (AD-ADMM) was proposed. However, low convergence speed and the master-slave communication structure greatly reduce the performance of AD-ADMM in multi-core cluster. In this paper, we propose a new method to speed up the convergence of ADMM. The proposed method accelerates the convergence speed by automatically deciding the optimization algorithms needed for the solution of ADMM subproblem in each iteration. The dynamic scheduling strategy chooses the optimization algorithm mainly based on the primal residual and the dual residual. In addition, we also combine the hierarchical communication structure with the strategy to guarantee the efficiency. Experiments in the ZiQiang 4000 cluster experimental environment show that the dynamic scheduling strategy based on hierarchical communication structure for solving ADMM subproblem improves the convergence speed and the communication efficiency of the algorithm efficiently.},

abstract={Cancer diseases have serious influence on people's live, but the-state-of-art machine learning approaches have the potential to decrease cancer death rates by formulating prevention strategies for cancer treatment. Some supervised learning methods have been used to give early warning of cancer successfully by using gene expression data, but the most prominent challenge is the insufficient labeled samples of biological data, especially in cancer datasets. It may cause the training model with over-fitting. Therefore, semi-supervised method approaches, such as self-training, are designed to improve the model performance by utilizing the unlabeled samples which are more than the labeled samples in some biological data. The high-quality pseudo-labeled sample is selected to train for improvement of model based curriculum learning paradigm. Of note, the self-training can meet above requirements. Next samples with high quality are pseudo-labeled by self-training. Afterward, put in the training dataset to increase the number of available labeled samples, and the cycle will continue until all unlabeled samples are annotated. The ensemble learning is a widely learning method, which can improve the model classification performance by combining multi-week classifier style. It can help self-training to learn the initial classifiers using the labeled samples. Therefore, in this study an ensemble self-training learning(ESTL) method is proposed to selects the unlabeled samples with high-quality more effectively and improves the robustness of the model.

abstract={Recently, drones have been widely used for a variety of purposes, such as surveillance, journalism, environmental protection, disaster management and various leisure activities. However, due to the noneffective monitoring of drones, the accidents of drones interfere with low-flying aircrafts and civil aviations emerge in an endless stream, resulting in many issues in safety. In this paper, we have designed the Dynamic No-fly Zone, which is based on a sphere centered on the current flight with a radius, to accurately model the no-fly zone of drones. Furthermore, in order to deal with the big data produced by the dynamically changed positions of flights and aircrafts, we have presented a Two-Level Dynamic Alert Zone. On top of it, a machine learning algorithm named Positive Logic Model (PLM) is proposed for the realization of the Dynamic No-fly Zone for drones. Without extra hardware support, our heuristic model and algorithm are able to solve the problem of drones interfere with low-flying aircrafts and civil aviations. Simulation experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our heuristic approach.},

The objective of this study is to assess the factors influencing the post-adoption intent-to-use of Big Data Analytics in an organization. A survey method was used for data collection using existing validated IS instruments. A total of 34 valid observations were collected. PLS-SEM was leveraged for data analysis because of the prediction focus of the study and the requirement to assess both reflective and formative measures in the same research model. The measurement and structural models were tested using the PLS algorithm. R2, f2, and Q2 were used as the basis for the acceptable fit measurement. Based on the valid structural model and after running the bootstrapping procedure, Perceived Risk has no mediating effect on Trust-in-Technology on Intent-to-Use. Perceived Usefulness has a mediating effect on Trust-in-Technology on Intent-to-Use.},

abstract={Currently event detection based on social media becomes a more and more active research field. Text classification is a challenging task in event detection on social media because a large number of irrelevant texts are provided at the same time of collecting relevant texts. Most of existing text classification methods are based on the supervised machine learning which requires labeled and balanced training dataset. However, it is very difficult or even impossible for emergency event detection to collect balanced and labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a novel text classification method based on one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) for emergency event detection, which takes only irrelevant texts as training data to detect the relevant texts to the emergency event. More importantly, we propose to extract variable length n-gram features for representing texts that takes the sequential relations and semantic relations among words into account. Finally we conduct two set of experiments to evaluate our method and experimental results show our method can perform text classification for detecting emergency event on social media with a comparable accuracy.},

abstract={With the continuous growth of video traffic on the whole Internet, it is of vital importance for content providers to provide high-quality service. Monitoring the QoE (Quality of Experience) of video can help them to improve their service. However, most of the video traffic is encrypted traffic which has unreadable payload and less information in the transport layer that makes monitoring QoE a challenging task. QoE is measured from multiple metrics and many methods have been proposed to infer it. Traditional machine learning based methods have two main shortcomings. 1) These methods ignore the relevance of these metrics which can do a favor to the inference of QoE. 2) They need to extract the transport layer features and statistic features manually. In this paper, we propose multi-task learning with hierarchy (MTLH) model for inferring video QoE metrics. We use shared layer to extract deep features automatically from traffic tendency pictures which reveal the variation tendency of video streaming, that characterizes video QoE. In addition, we utilize the hierarchy to promote fine-grained start-up delay tasks. Finally, we use multitask learning architecture to learn the correlation between each task and use their correlation to refer QoE metrics. We evaluate our model for YouTube adaptive video streams on two datasets. The proposed approach achieved an average 9.0% higher of precision score and an average 11.5% higher of recall score than the state-of-the-art method in two datasets.},

In order to detect malicious domains in large scale traffic data in real time, a modified SVM algorithm (F-SVM) is proposed in this paper. F-SVM draws lessons from the idea of feedback learning, and it is able to solve the problem of insufficient labeled samples and high cost of updating models. Experimental results show that F-SVM algorithm is capable to keep a high precision rate through whole detection process while simple SVM model has a detection fall as the detection process goes on.

This paper proposes a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) to handle the perturbed time-varying underdetermined linear system with double bound limits on residual errors and state variables. Beyond that, the bound-limited underdetermined linear system is converted into a time-varying system that consists of linear and nonlinear formulas through constructing a nonnegative time-varying variable. Then, theoretical analyses are conducted to verify the superior convergence performance of the proposed RNN model. Furthermore, numerical experiment results and computer simulations demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed RNN model for handling the time-varying underdetermined linear system with double bound limits. Finally, the proposed RNN model is applied to the physically limited PUMA560 robot to show its satisfactory applicabilities.},

abstract={Thanks to the advances in wireless communication and machine learning technologies, we can envision a novel AIoT (AI + IoT) service platform that collects video data from the individuals' edge devices. Then, it transforms the video data into useful information, providing services to IoT or smart city applications. However, collecting raw video data directly to the cloud server is merely possible due to network bandwidth limitations and data privacy concerns. One possible solution is to adopt federated learning, which enables edge devices to collaboratively train a shared model without sending the raw data to the cloud. Unfortunately, this scheme cannot directly be applied to the targeted scenario since it assumes labeled data for training, and only at the cloud, we have the human power and time to label the video data. Thus, to tackle those issues, we propose an edge learning system based on semisupervised learning and federated learning technologies. The system trains AI models at edge devices using an improved semisupervised learning scheme and periodically uploads the training results to the cloud server to form a single model by adapting the federated learning technology. Then, we observe that in the real world, the data on the end devices are nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) such that it may cause weight divergence during training and result in a considerable decrease in the model performance. Therefore, we propose a new operation called federated swapping (FedSwap) to replace partial federated learning operations based on a few shared data during federated training to alleviate the adverse impact of weight divergence. We evaluate our system on both image classification using the state-of-the-art benchmark data and object detection using real-world video data. The experimental results show that the proposed system can have up to 5.9% higher accuracy of object detection for the video analysis applications by fully utilizing unlabeled data, compared with the situation that only labeled data are used. Moreover, the proposed FedSwap can improve the accuracy of image classification by 3.8% and the object detection task by 1.1%.},

year={2021},
volume={},

abstract={Accurately predicting the urban spatio-temporal data is critically important to various urban computing tasks for smart city related applications such as crowd flow prediction and traffic congestion prediction. Existing models especially deep learning based approaches require a large volume of training data, whose performance may degrade remarkably when the data is scarce. Recent works try to transfer knowledge from the intra-city or cross-city multi-modal spatio-temporal data. However, the careful design of what to transfer and how between the multi-modal spatio-temporal data needs to be determined in advance. There still lacks an end-to-end solution that can automatically capture the common cross-domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Deep Attentive Adaptation Network model named ST-DAAN to transfer cross-domain Spatio-Temporal knowledge for urban crowd flow prediction. ST-DAAN first maps the raw spatio-temporal data of source domain and target domain to a common embedding space. Then domain adaptation is adopted on several domain-specific layers through adding a domain discrepancy penalty to explicitly match the mean embeddings of the two domain distributions. Considering the complex spatial correlation in many urban spatio-temporal data, a global attention mechanism is also designed to enable the model to capture broader spatial dependencies. Using urban crowd flow prediction as a demonstration, we conduct experiments on five real-world large datasets over both intra- and cross-city transfer learning. The results demonstrate that ST-DAAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

abstract={Change detection (CD) aims to identify surface changes from bitemporal images. In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based methods have made substantial breakthroughs in the field of CD. However, CD results can be easily affected by external factors, including illumination, noise, and scale, which leads to pseudo-changes and noise in the detection map. To deal with these problems and achieve more accurate results, a deeply supervised (DS) attention metric-based network (DSAMNet) is proposed in this article. A metric module is employed in DSAMNet to learn change maps by means of deep metric learning, in which convolutional block attention modules (CBAM) are integrated to provide more discriminative features. As an auxiliary, a DS module is introduced to enhance the feature extractor’s learning ability and generate more useful features. Moreover, another challenge encountered by data-driven DL algorithms is posed by the limitations in change detection datasets (CDDs). Therefore, we create a CD dataset, Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU)-CD, for bitemporal image CD, which contains a total of 20 000 aerial image pairs of size $256\times256$ . Experiments are conducted on both the CDD and the SYSU-CD dataset. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our network achieves the highest accuracy on both datasets, with an F1 of 93.69% on the CDD dataset and 78.18% on the SYSU-CD dataset.},

From running the experiments, in a non-laboratory setting, we found that hackable urban environments are interesting platforms for testing IoT technologies. Our findings also suggest that mundane aspects like access to power grids as well as availability and appearance of the build environment can have significant impact on the results of urban IoT experimentation. More generally, this suggest that cities are not hackable by default, and they need to be thoroughly designed and optimized for IoT in order to ensure successful experimentation.},

abstract={Indoor localization has attracted considerable attention lately, due to its large commercial and social values in smart cities. The existing indoor localization approaches mostly rely on fingerprint techniques, and many of those leverage either spatially discrete fingerprints or temporally consecutive ones for localization, which either suffers from large errors due to signal ambiguities or high time overhead with long sequences. To achieve high accuracy with low computational cost, we propose ST-Loc, a deep neural network that extracts features from multiple representations of a single signal sequence for localization, where each representation indicates a corresponding signal structure with underlying feature correlations. Taking geomagnetism as an example, we infer location features from two different representations, e.g., spatial and temporal. In spatial representation, a signal sequence is converted to a signal heatmap, where each pixel corresponds to a spatial location and the value indicates fingerprint. Temporal representation, on the other hand, is a signal sequence with ordered readings, which provides temporal correlations. Using these different representations, we employ convolutional and recurrent networks to extract location features and fuse them to generate more distinguishing features for localization. We have conducted extensive experiments in two different trial sites, a narrow office area and a spacious food plaza. Our experimental results show that ST- Loc achieves more than 43% average localization error reduction compared with state-of-the-art competing schemes in both trial sites.},

One of the most dangerous cyberattacks for IoT networks is the Mirai Botnet, a malware that turns networked consumer devices into a botnet to perform Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a security solution to detect cyberattacks on IoT networks. A promising approach to improve the IoT network’s detection capacity is the use of Machine Learning (ML) based solutions. This paper presents an intelligent mechanism to detect the Scan, Ack Flooding, Syn Flooding, UDP Flooding, and UDPplain Mirai Botnet attacks on IoT networks using ML techniques, comparing distinct ML approaches (KNN, SVM, and LR). The proposed mechanism was evaluated using a real IoT devices traffic dataset, giving 99% of accuracy to detect Mirai Botnet.},

To support massive numbers of machine type communication (MTC) devices, one of the challenging issues is to provide an efficient way for multiple access in the network and to minimize network overload.

To address this issue, we propose an online autonomous UAV navigation system named as multi-sensor data-fusion-based autonomous navigation (MDFAN) system for unknown flight environments, including the collision avoidance and path planning. Specifically, first, the newly MDFAN system formulates the navigation problem as a decision-making path planning problem to reduce the dependence of prior knowledge of the flight environment. Secondly, we develop a multi-sensor data-fusion-based method to extract more effective local environment information for mining the inherent inter-relationship between the local environment information and the current state of the UAV. Thirdly, we propose a deep reinforcement learning method for handling uncertain situations of the unknown environment. Finally, we validated our method both on the simulated and real-world environments.},

abstract={Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) is having a significant impact in a wide range of applications in smart city, smart home, and personal healthcare. Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain. However, these existing techniques do not perform well on highly heterogeneous domains. This article proposes shift-GAN that integrate bidirectional generative adversarial networks (Bi-GAN) and kernel mean matching (KMM) in an innovative way to learn intrinsic, robust feature transfer between two heterogeneous domains. Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Graph Attention Spatial-Temporal Network (GASTN), for accurate mobile traffic forecasting, which can capture not only local geographical dependency but also distant inter-region relationship when considering spatial factor. Specifically, GASTN considers spatial correlation through our constructed spatial relation graph and utilizes structural recurrent neural networks to model the global near-far spatial relationships as well as the temporal dependencies. In the framework of GASTN, two attention mechanisms are designed to integrate different effects in a holistic way. Besides, in order to further enhance the prediction performance, we propose a collaborative global-local learning strategy for the training of GASTN, which takes full advantage of the knowledge from both the global model and local models for individual regions and enhance the effectiveness of our model. Extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world mobile traffic dataset demonstrate that our GASTN model dramatically outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and a further improvement in the prediction performance of GASTN can be obtained by leveraging the collaborative global-local learning strategy.},

abstract={Our paper aims to build a classification-model which delineates the typical motion-related activities performed at a metro station using smart phone sensors. We focus on typical movements, such as climbing the stairs or moving in the lift, waiting at security, waiting at the turnstile to check out and, moving on platform while waiting for a train. Such a classifier estimates crowd levels in a metro-station (and metro trains in an indirect sense), thereby adding towards the vision of efficient metro travel. However, building such a classification-model is challenging due to non-trivial decision boundaries among the classes of interest. Our experiments revealed that the best accuracy that a traditional multi-class classifier could obtain was 0.58, for a four-class classifier. To this end, we proposed a hierarchical approach of classification which divides the multi-class problem at hand into a set of manageable two-class classification problems. These two-class classifiers are then put together, in a hierarchy, to give an end-to-end solution which takes sensors values from the phone and predicts the class of motion being observed. Our model obtained an accuracy of around 0.75, a significantly higher value, on the real-data collected at Delhi Metro stations. The same classifiers can potentially be applied to detect crowd levels at train stations and bus depots, which will make transportation efficient in smart cities.},

abstract={According to a report by the World Health Organization, diseases caused by an unhealthy lifestyle represent the leading cause of death all over the world. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor and avoid users' unhealthy behaviors. Existing health monitoring approaches still face many challenges of limited intelligence due to insufficient healthcare data. Therefore, this article proposes a smart personal health advisor (SPHA) for comprehensive and intelligent health monitoring and guidance. The SPHA monitors both physiological and psychological states of the user. The SPHAScore model is proposed to evaluate the overall health status of the user. Finally, a testbed for verification of feasibility and applicability of the proposed system was developed. The experimental and simulation results have shown that the proposed approach is efficient for proper user state monitoring.},

abstract={Up to date, the existing methods for nonlinear optimization with time-dependent parameters can be classified into two types: 1) static methods are capable of handling inequality constraints but may generate large lagging errors in the solution of the intrinsically time-dependent constrained nonlinear optimization (TDCNO) problem due to the hypothesis of short-time invariance and 2) time-variant methods, e.g., zeroing neural networks, are able to remedy the lagging error but fail to solve the TDCNO problem under inequality constraints. To resolve this contradiction, a noise-suppressing neural dynamics (NSND) model is proposed to solve the TDCNO problem subject to both equality and inequality constraints via the nonlinear complementary problem (NCP) function. The proposed method allows inequality constraints for unknown variables, removes the short-time invariance hypothesis, and further eliminates lagging errors during the solving process in the presence of noises. Besides, the rapid convergence, global stability, and noise processing of the NSND model are verified by the theoretical analyses. Simulation results of illustrative examples, including dimensionality reduction on principal component analyses (PCA) and a robot motion control, show that the NSND model outperforms the existing models for the TDCNO problem.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, location-based services have been widely applied in the construction of smart cities. Satellite-based location services have been utilized in outdoor environments, but they are not suitable for indoor technology due to the absence of global positioning system (GPS) signal. Therefore, many indoor localization technologies and systems have emerged by utilizing many other signals. In particular, fingerprinting localization has recently garnered attention because its promising performance. In this work, we aim to study recent indoor localization technologies and systems based on various fingerprints, which use machine learning and intelligent algorithms. We also present the architecture of intelligent localization. The development of indoor localization technology should have the ability of self-adaptation and self-learning in the future. And the architecture shows how to make localization become more “smart” by advanced techniques. The state-of-the-art localization systems' working principles are summarized and compared in terms of their localization accuracy, latency, energy consumption, complexity, and robustness. We also discuss the challenges of existing indoor localization technologies, potential solutions to these challenges, and possible improvement measures.},

abstract={Internet of things (IoT) is pushing the integration of physical and virtual worlds. Sensor devices provide rich sensory information to context-aware services. Actuators implement in the physical world application needs. The role of software is increasing as more and more resources become virtualized and software-defined. Smart environment is an emerging concept that has the potential to address many of the humanity problems. In this context, what are the promising tools for building the smart environments of the future? This paper provides a review of platforms, middleware, and frameworks that can help in this big challenge, discussing their architectures, service life-cycling, digital twins, cloud-based operation, virtualization, security, privacy, communication model, support for AI and machine learning, among other aspects. The proposed revision innovates by employing previous work on future Internet key enablers as parameters for qualitative comparisons. The idea is to determine the degree of alignment among current initiatives for smart environments and the ones emerging from future Internet research. Among the main conclusions are: (i) heterogeneity come to stay; (ii) many contemporary proposals do not cover important aspects raised in future Internet research; (iii) publish/subscribe model is largely employed; (iv) many proposals are stuck to the limitations of current Internet model (another reason to explore the relationship among current platforms and previous future Internet research for IoT); (v) devices interoperability is a problem solved; (vi) ingredients from future Internet research, such as SDN/NFV, ICN and SCN are systematically being adopted for smart environments design. Many others are to come; (vii) AI, machine learning, and big data support are missing not only in TCP/IP-based approaches, but also in future Internet-based.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have become more complex, more sophisticated, and more intelligent. In addition to this complexity, they have also been exposed to some important disturbances due to unintentional and intentional events since the number of cyber attacks has increased, and their behaviors have become more sophisticated. The openness, virtualization, and ubiquitous access traits of the combination of CPS and cloud computing may cause coupling problems. When malicious users or attackers simultaneously request the same physical nodes, it may lead to a failure of services as well as a security threat to the system. In this article, we design a low-coupling system based on the edge computing platform to counter coupling problems. The edge computing platform acts as a middleware platform and provides the scheduling method. Based on the edge computing platform and artificial intelligence technology, we design two buffer queues to reduce the coupling degree of the system in parallel. Moreover, we improve the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to obtain the maximum matching between users' requests and resources to achieve optimal resource distribution. The experimental results indicate that the proposed edge-based scheme can effectively counter the coupling problem for CPSs.},
