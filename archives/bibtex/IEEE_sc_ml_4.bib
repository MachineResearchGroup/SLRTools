abstract={Traffic management of metropolitan cities in India is becoming a challenging factor day by day. Traffic congestion and improper management leads to rise in accident cases in the city. Efficiency of existing traffic management solutions is decreasing, as the number of private vehicles is on the rise. In the context of increasing complexity of urban traffic and to reduce the accident rise, a machine learning solution is proposed. It provides predictive analysis of traffic in a given area using Supervised Learning techniques such as Back Propagation Neural Network (BPN). The work discusses about an android application that makes use of real-time traffic data and predicts the traffic densities of entire map area in an offline mode. It also specifically suggests best routes from source to destination based on the traffic data. The bigger picture here is the reduction of congested roads all over the city. This mechanism will also help to minimize the battery consumption of mobile devices.},

abstract={In recent years, with the continuous development of deep learning and natural language processing, sequence-to-sequence based model has become the mainstream of abstractive summarization generation, and achieved good results. However, there are some problems of low semantic similarity in the abstracts generated by traditional models. In this work, our goal is to improve semantic relevance between source texts and simplified texts for abstract generation, we propose a text Abstract generation model based on semantic similarity. We use encoder to represent the source document and decoder to generate the summary, and then calculate the semantic similarity between the source document and the generated summary. Experiments show that the generated abstract is more similar to the original text, and more in line with the standards of human writing Abstract.},

abstract={The use of IoT devices is growing rapidly and it is playing a critical role in a diverse set of industries. It has been instrumental in the growth of smart cities. Smart cities have emerged as a paradigm for urban development which aims to be sustainable, efficient and improve accessibility. However, the limited processing power of IoT devices makes them susceptible to flood-based attacks. Denial of Service attacks can overwhelm the computing resources or network bandwidth of IoT networks. Since IoT devices power critical infrastructure like traffic management in smart cities, adequate defense of such networks from malicious actors is imperative. In this article, the authors propose a framework tailored for detection and mitigation of flood-based attacks in smart city infrastructure. The proposed smart city framework aims to reduce latency of attack detection by using fog computing for feature extraction and security maintenance. It allows scalability by utilizing SDN and fog infrastructure for mitigation of attacks. We have analysed and utilized packet-level features which are excellent for distinguishing between IoT and attack traffic. We have trained and quantitatively compared 5 state-of-the-art supervised machine learning models for attack detection in this paper. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 99.9% on our simulated dataset in attack detection.},

abstract={The digital retina in smart cities is to select what the City Eye tells the City Brain, and convert the acquired visual data from front-end visual sensors to features in an intelligent sensing manner.

abstract={With the fluctuations of energy pricing, the electricity bills for many households is becoming an increasing burden in the monthly bills to be paid. Many households in many countries would appreciate Smart Electricity Monitors and Smart Electricity controllers that can be used both in Smart Cities and regular households. Weather conditions play a vital role in electricity consumption, for example, in a hot desert climate, the electricity bill is tripled or quadrupled due to the use of air conditioning in summer. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based technique to anticipate the electricity consumption using weather data. Using a dataset consisting of reading over 350 days of household appliances with weather condition, the proposed method is able to predict the electricity consumption with a correlation coefficient of 75.7% using Random Tree. The results obtained provide an excellent basis for the ultimate goal of setting up an accurate smart electricity consumption monitor to be used both in Smart Cities and even in regular households which could ultimately help households to reduce electricity by regulating the use of the most electricity consuming appliances according to weather conditions.},

As a second contribution, one aspect of realism, interference, is shown to be measured and predicted, based on data from the CityLab deployment.

abstract={Genes expression datasets are considered to be high dimensional dataset. It is very much needed that before predicting the genes expression dimensionality reduction must be performed. Machine learning algorithms fail to analyze genes expression due to its high dimensionality behaviour. These algorithms have to perform feature selection or feature extraction before classification. To overcome this dimensionality reduction approach deep learning algorithms are implemented which has shown improved performance. This paper is also based on the approach of deep learning algorithm which is based on a classification approach using hybridization of a deep neural network named Hybrid Deep Neural Network (HDNN) in which Convolutional Neural Networks are combined with Recurrent Neural Networks to perform prediction. Parameters like accuracy, AUC, precision, and F1score have shown improved performance than other state of art algorithms with 85.5%, 0.84, 0.81, and 0.79 respectively.},

abstract={The ubiquitous commercial Wi-Fi has brought unlimited possibilities to the smart city and the Internet of Things. Wi-Fi device-free sensing technology has received more and more attention in recent years. Counting the people in queuing is an uneasy task due to labile information. Most current counting schemes have existed in an ideal environment with idealistic people's behavior. In this article, we propose a more realistic counting scheme called Que-Fi, a queue number identification system based on Wi-Fi channel state information and a deep learning network. In the proposed Que-Fi scheme, the nonnegligible interference of human motion and the surrounding environment is first analyzed based on the Fresnel zone. Then, we proposed a static model based on the convolutional long short-term memory fully connected deep neural network in order to overcome the interference. A dynamic Que-Fi model is proposed to identify the entering/leaving people's behavior and update the counting number. In this article, different preprocessing methods are analyzed and compared to test and evaluate the proposed Que-Fi. Experiments have shown that the proposed Que-Fi outperforms the traditional support vector machine and provide accuracy up to 95% and 96.67% for static and dynamic models, respectively.},

Smart and efficient energy planning is the ultimate objective, where the final energy usage is fitted into the predicted demand. One day time horizon is used in order to provide energy managers, ESCOs or urban planners with an accurate forecast about the required energy.

abstract={Bike-sharing is adopted as a valid option replacing traditional public transports since they are eco-friendly, prevent traffic congestions, reduce any possible risk of social contacts which happen mostly on public means. However, some problems may occur such as the irregular distribution of bikes on related stations/racks/areas, and the difficulty of knowing in advance what the rack status will be like, or predicting if there will be bikes available in a specific bike-station at a certain time of the day, or if there will be a free slot to leave the rented bike. Thus, providing predictions can be useful to improve the service quality, especially in those cases where bike racks are used for e-bikes, which need to be recharged. This paper compares the state-of-the-art techniques to predict the number of available bikes and free bike-slots in bike-sharing stations (i.e., bike racks). To this end, a set of features and predictive models were compared to identify the best models and predictors for short-term predictions, namely of 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes. The study has demonstrated that deep learning and in particular Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM) offers a robust approach for the implementation of reliable and fast predictions of available bikes, even with a limited amount of historical data. This paper has also reported an analysis of feature relevance based on SHAP that demonstrated the validity of the model for different cluster behaviours. Both solution and its validation were derived by using data collected in bike-stations in the cities of Siena and Pisa (Italy), in the context of Sii-Mobility National Research Project on Mobility and Transport and Snap4City Smart City IoT infrastructure.},

abstract={Today's existing smart city research involves many overtly futuristic applications such as smart transportation, in which smart roads warn drivers of bad traffic conditions ahead, smart parking, which communicates the location of unoccupied parking spaces to drivers, and smart environment, which enables fully automated homes and workplaces to adjust their temperature to conserve energy. The realization of these applications hinges on a data acquisition structure that gathers its data from a countless number of sensors, either deployed for predefined tasks (hard sensing) or built into the mobile devices of smart city residents (soft sensing). At the core of this big data infrastructure lie the 5Vs: veracity, volume, velocity, variety, and value. The soft sensing component of a smart city sensing network is particularly affected by 3Vs: veracity, volume, and velocity. To address the unique challenges of big data, recommender systems, statistical reputation systems, and context analysis are used to ensure the veracity of acquired data, machine learning algorithms are applied to handle the data volume, and data analytics algorithms are implemented to manage data velocity. Despite its seemingly insurmountable size, the acquired data is highly redundant, and systematic use of machine intelligence and data analytics can facilitate processing by extracting only the relevant information; in this article, we study the role of these algorithms through the lens of the 3Vs in facilitating soft sensing within the framework of smart city applications.},

abstract={In the last decade, deep learning has attracted much attention from both the academia and industry. As one of the important hyperparameters, learning rate greatly affects the speed and convergence of deep learning. In the existing approaches, the learning rate is commonly adjusted with the training process, however, does not consider the model accuracy after each training epoch. This problem is even more complex in distributed deep learning approach, which involves multiple machines for learning. In this study, we propose an adaptive learning rate updating strategy (DALU) for distributed deep learning. After completing each training epoch, the classification accuracy on training data set is recorded. Learning rate is adjusted according to the accuracy of current epoch and previous epochs. We also design several special machines having more aggressive learning rate update than regular machines in the distributed system. Compared with current commonly used learning rate adjusting approaches, exponential decay learning rate and cosine decay learning rate, DALU improves the accuracy of deep learning by 3.0% to 3.9%.},

However, the video image quality is not always meet the requirements of such algorithms due to the influence of different external factors. A variety of adverse weather conditions produce noise on the images, which often makes it difficult to detect objects correctly. Lately, deep learning methods show good results in image processing, including denoising tasks.

abstract={In recent years, deep learning has been increasingly used for several applications such as object analysis, feature extraction and image classification. This paper explores the use of deep learning in a flood monitoring application in the context of an EC-funded project, Smart Cities and Open Data REuse (SCORE). IoT sensors for detecting blocked gullies and drainages are notoriously hard to build, hence we propose a novel technique to utilise deep learning for building an IoT-enabled smart camera to address this need. In our work, we apply deep leaning to classify drain blockage images to develop an effective image classification model for different severity of blockages. Using this model, an image can be analysed and classified in number of classes depending upon the context of the image. In building such model, we explored the use of filtering in terms of segmentation as one of the approaches to increase the accuracy of classification by concentrating only into the area of interest within the image. Segmentation is applied in data pre-processing stage in our application before the training. We used crowdsourced publicly available images to train and test our model. Our model with segmentation showed an improvement in the classification accuracy.},

abstract={Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated its powerful capabilities in the field of image inpainting, which could produce visually plausible results. Meanwhile, the malicious use of advanced image inpainting tools (e.g. removing key objects to report fake news) has led to increasing threats to the reliability of image data. To fight against the inpainting forgeries, in this work, we propose a novel end-to-end Generalizable Image Inpainting Detection Network (GIID-Net), to detect the inpainted regions at pixel accuracy. Extensive experimental results are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed GIID-Net, compared with the state-of-the-art competitors.

abstract={Smart cities integrate data collection and communication technologies to operate more efficiently in order to provide better services to citizens, improved road traffic situation, better economic development, etc. However, safety still a main concern of road traffic as road crashes pose serious threats to road users causing death and injury all over the world. Road traffic safety is the process of implementing measures to reduce the number of crashes, death and severe injuries. In this paper, using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Off-line, we train and test the Intelligent and Dynamic Adaptation Model (IDAM) on the road traffic data collected for 14 years of car crashes in United Kingdom (UK). IDAM then on-line determines the optimal speed limit for each road segment based on many predictors such as weather, road type, light condition, and many others, stated later. We train and test IDAM using three different machine learning algorithms: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), and Linear Regression (LR) with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Using the testing dataset, IDAM achieves prediction accuracy of around 96%. Implemented in an operation algorithm, IDAM can continuously adapt the road speed limit to an optimal value as the predictors change on-line.},

abstract={Developing effective machine learning models to maximize the generalization capability of the learned data patterns while minimizing the risk of overfitting and also the ultimate computational costs of the trained models are very challenging yet significant tasks in many real-world applications. Due to the high complexity and huge amount of data involved in financial applications, the critical task of constructing appropriate machine learning models will surely become more challenging. Typically, data scientists or researchers may employ various optimizers to enhance the feature selection and/or tuning of the involved hyper-parameters in order to improve the overall performance of the obtained learning models. In this paper, a very flexible optimizer, namely the Adaptive Multi-Population optimization Algorithm (AMPOA), utilizing multiple populations with different search strategies is considered in which two of its variants are carefully evaluated with the other state-of-theart optimizers to enhance the feature selection process of the commonly used K-nearest-neighbor classifier approach on a set of 12 well-known benchmark problems. The first variant named the BAMPOA-R approach employs a rounding technique to determine on the binary decision of choosing an input feature or not for the underlying classifier while the other BAMPOA- T approach utilizes a specific transform function to decide on the feature selection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed optimizer for financial applications, the BAMPOA- R approach with the best performance in the previous test is integrated with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) as the BAMPOA-R-SVR algorithm to compare against other regressors on 10 major financial market indexes. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the remarkable performance of the proposed AMPOA approach to enhance the prediction performances of the underlying machine learning models through more vigorous feature selection for numerous real-world applications including those challenging problems in computational finance.},

However, because of the complexity of the background, pedestrian posture diversity and pedestrian occlusions, pedestrian detection is still a challenge which calls for precise algorithms. In this paper, the fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) is used. Firstly, image features were extracted by CNN. After that, we built up a Region Proposal Network to extract regions that might contain pedestrians combined with K-means cluster analysis. And the region is identified and classified by detection network. Finally, the method was tested in the INRIA data set. The results show that the method of pedestrian detection based on Faster R-CNN, which achieves the accuracy of 92.7%, performs better, compared with other algorithms.},

In view of the existing problems in the resource allocation process of urban charging stations, such as a single planning method, considering the actual travel demand.

Secondly, this paper establishes a systematic clustering model based on principal component analysis, selecting factors such as per capita GDP, population, and civilian car ownership as indicators, clustering analysis of different regions and assigning different charging convenience coefficients. Finally, the shortest distance matrix between any two nodes is calculated by the Voronoi diagram to concentrate the regional charging load to the traffic node, and the Floyd algorithm is used to analyze and evaluate the effect of the established charging station configuration optimization model. This technology provides a basis for promoting the modernization of urban green transportation.},

abstract={Nowadays, with the increasing amount of data and scale of network models, distributed deep learning, i.e., training a deep neural network using multiple workers distributed across different computing nodes, is becoming more and more popular. One of the major challenges of distributed deep learning lies in the frequent communication of gradients among workers, because it may cause severe bottlenecks, in terms of time latency and bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Entropy-based Gradient Compression (EGC) to reduce communication overhead. The major components of EGC are two algorithms: the entropy-based threshold selection algorithm and the automatic learning rate correction algorithm. To improve the accuracy, EGC also includes two commonly used algorithms: gradient residual and momentum correction. To evaluate the performance of EGC, we conduct experiments based on applications of image classification and language modeling using public datasets including Cifar10, Tiny ImageNet and Penn Treebank. The experiment results show that, compared with existing works, EGC can achieve a gradient compression ratio about 1000× while keeping the accuracy similar or even higher.},

Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a feasible paradigm to control decentralized systems. In this work, we design a recurrent communication module for traffic light control systems. Aiming at lightweight decentralized learning, we decouple the interaction among entities, using an improved recurrent neural network to share messages. Regarding traffic lights as a partially observable Markov Decision Process, we develop a complete reinforcement learning model. Every light receives messages from its neighbors through the improved recurrent neural network. For the further lights, its neighbor lights can play the role of intermediation to transmit messages. By our communication framework, traffic lights can learn their control policies in a decentralized way, and distribution control can be executed through a communication channel. Several simulated experiments show that our method outperforms the fixed time method and the existing reinforcement learning-based frameworks under different traffic demands.},

Initially, a reinforcement learning approach is adopted in order for the citizens to select the business to visit, exploiting both social and physical characteristics of all involved entities. Subsequently, following the principles of behavioral economics, the problem of the citizens’ incentivization by the businesses to provide their health data via offering personalized rewards is studied. The solution of the corresponding optimization problem concludes to a contract between the business and each citizen associated with this business, containing the optimal reward and optimal portion of reported data. The process is completed by introducing an optimization framework, where the healthcare operator incentivizes the businesses to provide the collected health data to it, by providing them tailored rewards. This is founded on the principles of Contract Theory, where the healthcare operator aims at maximizing its benefit from the data acquisition process, while guaranteeing that the optimal determined contracts are acceptable by the respective businesses. Finally, through modeling and simulation, the performance, effectiveness, and robustness of the overall proposed framework is demonstrated, under various realistic scenarios.},

abstract={The cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) has attracted much interest recently in wireless networks due to its wide applications in smart cities, intelligent transportation systems, and smart metering networks. However, how to smartly schedule the packet transmission in CIoT systems is still a key challenge, that is, how to design a smart agent to realize the intelligent decision making and effective interoperability. In this paper, we model the system state transformation as a Markov decision process, and an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on a fuzzy normalized radial basis function neural network (called AC-FNRBF) is proposed to efficiently solve the intelligent transmission scheduling problem in CIoT systems under high-dimensional variables. The proposed AC-FNRBF algorithm can better approximate both the action function of the actor and the state-action value function of the critic without requiring the system prior knowledge, and a new reward function is established to maximize the system benefit, which jointly takes the transmission packet rate, the system throughput, the power consumption, and the transmission delay into account. Moreover, the AC-FNRBF has the ability to adjust its learning structure and parameters in dynamic environments. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves higher transmission packet rate and system throughput with lower power consumption and transmission delay, compared with other existing reinforcement learning algorithms.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used in many smart city sectors, where a huge amount of data is gathered from various (IoT) devices. As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts. Extensive experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

abstract={The IoT is the cornerstone of many innovating processes such as those behind Smart Cities and Smart Industries. As more and more wireless IoT devices are deployed, a newer, more congestion-resilient communication infrastructure is required to absorb the traffic from the 50 billion IoT nodes expected by the year 2020. Although 5G is said to be a key technology for the future IoT, it is not a silver bullet. Therefore, providing nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) would allow them to reap the various benefits offered by each RAT. However, the process of determining which technology should be used at any given time should not be based on uninformed intuition, but on mathematically educated choices. By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have allowed IoT nodes to learn from previous real world data in order to derive optimal RAT-selection policies. These policies, which are implemented as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), maximize a predefined reward closely related to classic throughput, while maintaining power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. To allow hardware-constrained IoT nodes to use these ANNs, we have proposed the application of a quantization technique that reduces computation and memory requirements and have validated it by its implementation in a real IoT device. Finally, to evaluate the proposal, we have simulated a network of 1000 devices deployed in the city of Chicago. The obtained results are compared to those achieved with other intuitive policies to further highlight the benefits of our proposal.},

abstract={Intelligent vehicular systems and smart city applications are the fastest growing Internet-of-Things (IoT) implementations at a compound annual growth rate of 30%. In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), the fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.},

abstract={In recent years, with the advancement of wireless communication and location acquisition technology in the context of modern smart cities, and the increasing popularity of mobile devices with location capabilities based on Social Internet of Things, we can now easily introduce location services into traditional social networks. How to effectively use these massive data to provide decision support for smart cities is an emerging task. It is necessary to find an efficient way to effectively extract and represent useful information from location-based social networks (LBSNs) by dealing with the data heterogeneity. Against this background, this article proposes a heterogeneous graph embedding framework for LBSN analysis named location based social network embedding (LBSNE). LBSNE framework first constructs the heterogeneous neighborhood of a node by formalizing a metapath-based random walk on LBSNs. Then, it leverages the learned heterogeneous neighborhood sequence to do network embedding by employing a heterogeneous skip-gram model. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on the tasks of location recommendation and visitor predict on two LBSN datasets.},

abstract={Human mobility modelling has emerged as an important research area over the past years. The opportunities that mobility modelling offers are widespread. From smart transportation services to reliable recommendations systems, all require generation of mobility models. Since mobility of humans is generally motivated by the activities they perform, activity recognition emerges as a vital initial step towards building better and accurate mobility models. The activity recognition can be carried out by analyzing relevant data from GPS devices, accelerometers and many other sensing sources. The most common approach is to combine data from different sources, analyze that data and recognize the type of activity being performed. However, this requires access to many specialized devices and customized infrastructures. As an alternate, this paper introduces a novel approach to recognize activities from the GPS traces only. This approach utilizes Adaptive-Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) which combines the power of neural networks and fuzzy logic to recognize activities. The approach is tested on three different datasets and shows promising results. In addition to this a multi-cloud architecture is proposed, for the deployment of such a system.},

However, advances in information communications technology have given birth to the concept of smart city, which is rapidly being applied to address some of the challenges being faced in such cities. This paper presents the development of an architecture based on smart city technology, for refuse disposal management in communities. A proof of concept prototype was implemented for the proposed architecture using Arduino UNO microcontroller board, proximity sensor, breadboard, refuse bin and a personal computer. The proximity sensor was interfaced with the Arduino board to capture dataset that correspond to the five different positions calibrated on a refuse bin. The dataset was shown to be of good quality since the graph of the mean voltages against the distances is similar to the proximity sensor characteristic graph. To determine the appropriate classifier for realizing the pattern classification unit of the prototype, an experiment was performed using the acquired dataset to train five different variants of the K-NN classifier. The 1-NN classifier was nominated for the prototype because it is simple and it gave higher values of accuracy, precision and recall.},

abstract={Smart Cities will create many benefits for society. One of the most significant will be real-time, active management of the systems making up a Smart City. Active management will be enabled by processing large amounts of real-time data, by machine learning to deliver timely insights and by large-scale simulation to create effective interventions. To realise active management of Smart Cities requires processing systems that can take in data at large volume and variety, and perform complex processing on these data, all in real-time. Digital twins are used to create a continuous, consistent view of the current state of the city, and simulation of the evolution of digitals twins is used to detect problems arising in the near future and to optimise the impact of interventions. In this paper we propose and validate a Smart City processing architecture that can deliver these benefits by building a digital twin of a city, combining real-time streamed data ingestion, simulation and analytics. Streamed data systems can deliver a real time response with large amount of incoming data but are not suited to time advancing simulations where the interaction between modelled objects is important. We propose a processing architecture that mitigates this limitation by separating object interactions from streamed data processing. Finally, we introduce DEDUCE-PT, a demonstration implementation of this Smart City processing architecture that is aimed at proactive management of public transport systems.},

year={2021},

pages={3258-3274},
abstract={Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have recently shown outstanding performance in semantic image segmentation. However, state-of-the-art DCNN-based semantic segmentation methods usually suffer from high computational complexity due to the use of complex network architectures. This greatly limits their applications in the real-world scenarios that require real-time processing. In this paper, we propose a real-time high-performance DCNN-based method for robust semantic segmentation of urban street scenes, which achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and speed. Specifically, a Lightweight Baseline Network with Atrous convolution and Attention (LBN-AA) is firstly used as our baseline network to efficiently obtain dense feature maps. Then, the Distinctive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DASPP), which exploits the different sizes of pooling operations to encode the rich and distinctive semantic information, is developed to detect objects at multiple scales. Meanwhile, a Spatial detail-Preserving Network (SPN) with shallow convolutional layers is designed to generate high-resolution feature maps preserving the detailed spatial information. Finally, a simple but practical Feature Fusion Network (FFN) is used to effectively combine both deep and shallow features from the semantic branch (DASPP) and the spatial branch (SPN), respectively. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method respectively achieves the accuracy of 73.6% and 68.0% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) at the inference speeds of 51.0 fps and 39.3 fps on the challenging Cityscapes and CamVid test datasets (by only using a single NVIDIA TITAN X card). This demonstrates that the proposed method offers excellent performance at the real-time speed for semantic segmentation of urban street scenes.},

There are many primary transportation sources of air pollution including airplanes. Automatic airplane recognition in high-resolution satellite images has many applications. One of the applications using artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to design lean smart cities and work on primary sources of transportation air pollutions detection using high-resolution satellite imagery. With the help of satellite imagery and artificial intelligence model, airplane count and detection can be done with accuracy.

To avoid time-consuming feature engineering used in previous studies, a convolutional neural network is introduced to gradually and automatically learn the intrinsic features from the raw ECG data. The learned hierarchical features are then fed into a fully connected neural network to yield the user identify.

abstract={The diffusion of the Internet of Things paradigm, in the last few years, has led to the need of deploying and managing large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), composed by a multitude of geographically distributed sensors, like the ones needed for Smart City applications. The traditional way to manage WSNs is not suitable for this type of applications, because manually managing and monitoring every single sensor would be too expensive, time consuming and error prone. Moreover, unattended sensors may suffer of several issues that progressively make their measures unreliable and consequently useless. For this reason, several automatically techniques have been studied and implemented for the detection and correction of measurements from sensors which are affected by errors caused by aging and/or drift. These methods are grouped under the name of self-calibration techniques. This paper presents a distributed system, which combines an incremental machine learning technique with a non-linear Kalman Filter estimator, which allows to automatically re-calibrate sensors leveraging the correlation with measurements made by neighbor sensors. After the description of the used model and the system implementation details, the paper describes also the proof-of-concept prototype that has been built for testing the proposed solution.},

abstract={In today's competitive business environment creating memorable experiences and emotional connections1 with consumers is critical to win consumer spending and long term brand loyalty [1]. Brands want their customers to be in pleasing subliminal scented2 environments because, as research has shown, even a few micro-particles of scent can do a lot of marketing's heavy lifting, from improving consumer perceptions of quality to increasing the number of store visits. Hence, customer venues such as hotels, retail showrooms, casinos, hospitable and other captive audience places employ HVAC (Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) based scent diffusion system that delivers a seamless olfactory [2] experience to connect with consumers on a deeper emotional level, resulting in a more memorable experience. Current state of the art of HVAC dispenser systems, however, uses power hungry deployments [3] to monitor and dispense periodically, without accounting venue-patron occupancy ratios and sudden changes in foot traffic numbers. Thus, resulting sub-optimal user experience that might lead to a poor brand engagement and could incur higher operational costs [5] and thus reduce over all return on the investment (ROI). In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to implement intelligent HVAC dispensing that improve venue experience and operational efficiencies through the application of Big Data Technologies, Edge processing and IoT Sensing. Our system combines a lightweight edge anomaly detection algorithm based on Kalman filter and venue ambient condition to foot traffic graph matrix. The amalgamation of anomaly detection using Kalman filter to the venue ambiance with the application of machine learning creates an adaptive edge and that is our formula to the innovation that we propose and present a prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.},

abstract={In this paper, privacy preservation in Distributed Deep Neural Networks (DDNN) is re-visited. We focus on the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE) in the DDNN. Although HE provides some level of effective way to bring privacy to the DDNN, its use is usually associated with high overheads, especially communication cost between the Honest-but-Curious (HbC) cloud server and participants. To this end, we propose an alternative approach for privacy preservation in the DDNN. Ability to select and encrypt selected gradients homomorphically, is the main appeal of this paper and has proven to provide good privacy, reduce communication cost to a considerable level (ie. 0.04MB and 0.13MB when 1% and 10% of total gradients are selected, encrypted and shared respectively) whilst maintaining acceptable level of accuracy. A learning with error (LWE) based additive Homomorphic Encryption is used and comparison is made with closely related works to show how efficient our approach is. Furthermore, we propose the use of non-malleable code to protect the integrity of ciphertexts that are transmitted between participants and the HbC cloud server. This paper is the first to combine partial sharing and Homomorphic Encryption in the DDNN.},

They are also expected to forecast for multiple time steps, i.e., long-term. This study investigates a highway sensor network as a graph. Specifically, the level of road network details required for graph deep learning is first discussed. Secondly, this paper proposes a new graph deep learning model enabling attention mechanism to predict speeds in the network. It captures spatial dependencies with adjacency matrices and graph convolutions, and learns temporal information with a recurrent neural network (RNN) structure. Lastly, performance of the proposed model is compared with literature on a real-world dataset. Experiments show that physical roadway linkages are sufficient for the representation, and the proposed attention-enabled model performs better in the prediction task.},

abstract={Recently, smart cities, healthcare system, and smart vehicles have raised challenges on the capability and connectivity of state-of-the-art Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, especially for the devices in hotspots area. Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) can enhance the ability of emerging resource-intensive IoT applications and has attracted much attention. However, due to the time-varying network environments, as well as the heterogeneous resources of network devices, it is hard to achieve stable, reliable, and real-time interactions between edge devices and their serving edge servers, especially in the 5G ultradense network (UDN) scenarios. Ultradense edge computing (UDEC) has the potential to fill this gap, especially in the 5G era, but it still faces challenges in its current solutions, such as the lack of: 1) efficient utilization of multiple 5G resources (e.g., computation, communication, storage, and service resources); 2) low overhead offloading decision making and resource allocation strategies; and 3) privacy and security protection schemes. Thus, we first propose an intelligent UDEC (I-UDEC) framework, which integrates blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) into 5G UDEC networks. Then, in order to achieve real-time and low overhead computation offloading decisions and resource allocation strategies, we design a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (2Ts-DRL) approach, consisting of a fast-timescale and a slow-timescale learning process, respectively. The primary objective is to minimize the total offloading delay and network resource usage by jointly optimizing computation offloading, resource allocation, and service caching placement. We also leverage federated learning (FL) to train the 2Ts-DRL model in a distributed manner, aiming to protect the edge devices' data privacy. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of both the 2Ts-DRL and FL in the I-UDEC framework and prove that our proposed algorithm can reduce task execution time up to 31.87%.},

abstract={With the development of smart cities, the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) based services grows exponentially. The existing works just focus on cloud- edge or edge-device cooperative AI which suffers low learning efficiency of AI, while edge-to-edge cooperative AI is still an unresolved issue. Moreover, the existing researches concentrate on the computation offloading of the AI-based task, ignoring that it is a brain-like task performing sophisticated processing to raw data, which leads to the high latency and low quality of the learning services. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an on-demand learning offloading mechanism for edge-to-edge cooperative AI. Firstly, the principle of the learning capability and its offloading are proposed for the formal description of the learning resources migration. Secondly, the proposed mechanism realizes the bilateral learning offloading utilizing edge-to-edge and cloud-edge collaborations to handle AI-based tasks with high learning efficiency and resource utilization rate. Moreover, we model the edge-to-edge learning offloading allocation based on the concatenation of deep neural network (DNN) subtasks and their heterogeneous requirement of learning resources. Simulation results indicate the rationality and efficiency of the proposed mechanism.},

abstract={The advancements of technology continuously rising over the years has seen many applications that are useful in providing users with sufficient information to make better journey plans on their own. However, commuters still find themselves going through congested routes every day to get to their destinations. This paper attempts to delineate the possibilities of improving urban mobility through big data processing and deep-learning models. Essentially, through a predictive model to predict congestion and its duration, this paper aims to develop and validate a functional journey planning mobile application that can predict traffic conditions, allowing road users to make better informed decisions to their travel plans. This paper proposes a Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) deep learning model for congestion prediction and supplements a Linear Regression (LR) model to predict its duration. The proposed MLP-LR model performed reasonably well with an accuracy of 63% in predicting an occurrence of congestion. Some critical discussions on further research opportunities stemming from this study is also presented.},

abstract={Twitter is a social network, which contains information of the city events (concerts, festival, etc.), city problems (traffic, collision, and road incident), the news, feelings of people, etc. For these reasons, there are many studies, which use tweet data to detect useful information to support the smart city management. In this paper, the ways of finding citizen problems with their locations by using tweet data is discussed. Tweets in Turkish language from the Aegean Region of Turkey were used for the study. It is aimed to form a smart system, which detects problems of citizens and extracts the problems' exact locations from tweet texts. Firstly, the collected data was analyzed to get information of any city event, citizen's complaint or requests about a problem. After the possibility of detecting tweets, which have any city problem, was ensured, two datasets were created. The first one consists of the tweets that have an event information or a problem and the second one has the tweets, which have other information not related to our study. Then Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the annotated tweets and was tested on a separate set of tweets. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure of the classifier is given. A location recognizer, which finds the Turkish place names in a text, is created and applied on the tweets that are marked as information-containing by the classifier to detect the location of the problem precisely. The first findings of the project is promising. The high accuracy, which is obtained by the classifier, shows that it is proper to use this classifier for our study. The location recognizer is planned to be improved and place names on the real-time tweet data is to be detected.},

abstract={As the advances in mobile technologies and IoT-enabled devices have been integrated into our daily lives, significant increases in wireless network traffic generate a large scale of high dimensional network log data. This has led to challenges in security of Wi-Fi network systems that have to analyze such complex big data for intrusion detection. Many Wi-Fi network systems commonly employee machine learning based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Such IDS usually adopt supervised methods that heavily depend on observations of human experts for feature extraction, feature selection, and labeling processes of training data for classification. In this study, using the recently collected Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) which contains real traces of different network attacks types, we propose an unsupervised approach with automatic feature extraction and selection process to replace human intervention and manual labeling process for analyzing a large scale high dimensional data to improve the prediction accuracy of classification to detect 3 most common network attack types - Injection, Flooding, and Impersonate attacks in an IDS with a large scale of high dimensional data. The experiment results showed the effectiveness of our approach for feature extraction and selection. The quality of the selected features and the accuracy of intrusion detection of the three attack types are compared and analyzed.},

In this work, our methodology is organized in three main phases: (i) data collection of the surface in which the cyclist is traveling, and the ultrasonic distance sensor, to identify areas of risk based on the proximity of objects from bicycle, (ii) data analysis and data classification, using machine learning concepts and (iii) data visualization, using map views in a Web Application. This methodology allows the identification of injury risk situations to cyclists. The main contributions of this work are surfaces classification with data collected by the accelerometer and ultrasonic sensor generating useful information through simple data.

abstract={Traditional text sentiment analysis methods often ignore context information when used in the expression of features. The position of the words in the text makes it difficult to achieve satisfactory results in semantic realization. In recent years, deep learning has obtained good results in text sentiment analysis tasks. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are two mainstream deep learning algorithms. In this paper, a deep sentiment representation model based on CNNs and long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) is proposed. The model uses two layers of CNNs to capture the partial features of the text. The model can capture more accurate partial features, after which the features are fed to the LSTM, which can capture the contextual information. Finally, we combine the improved deep learning model with a one-versus-rest training mechanism and apply it to multi-class sentiment classification. We evaluate the proposed model by conducting experiments on datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the model we designed for multi-class sentiment analysis achieves a accuracy of 78.42% on data set D1 is better than the existing SVMs (support vector machines), CNN, LSTM and CNN-LSTM.},

The multi-objective MDP problem is converted to many single-objective MDP problems by the sum technique which are solved by multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. To improve the performance of multi-agent DDPG algorithm, evolutionary computing-based parameter-tuning method is further proposed to fine-tune the policy parameters in DDPG algorithm. The proposed methods are verified on real data. Experiments results illustrate that the multi-agent DDPG algorithm can efficiently solve the multi-objective optimal operation problem of the IES while the evolutionary computing-based policy parameter-tuning method can further improve the approximation of Pareto frontier.},

abstract={Value-based algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of deep reinforcement learning tasks.

In n-step learning method, truncated N-step return was used as a part of multiple-step targets to make faster learning, and improve the defect of such algorithms, but it is still far away to practical application. In this paper, we proposed a straightforward optimal method - Discount Multiple-steps Learning Method (DMLM) to improve the performance of value-based algorithms by giving a discount factor to truncated N-step return which shows better results in our experiments. In this method, regard the discounted truncated N-step return rather than accumulated discount reward as the important part of target network when computing the TD-error as a loss function of evaluate network. In the experiment part, we perform experiments compare to value-based algorithms without this method, and prove this method can make more accurate predict of value function, thereby outperform other optimal methods in terms of stability, overestimate and convergence.},

abstract={Multi-agent reinforcement learning systems have received increasing attention in these years. Existing works have proved that communication between agents can accelerate the training process and improve the final performance. However, in real-world tasks, the communication bandwidth is always restricted and unstable either in the training or test process, which is usually neglected in previous works. In this paper, we propose a method called Ranked Communication Channel Confidence Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RC3MARL), which exploits a non-uniform information encoding mechanism to discriminate the message in finer granularity. RC3MARL is more flexible and can achieve better performance in various environments with different communication bandwidths than the methods with fixed communication mechanism. In concrete, when the bandwidth is limited, RC3MARL can guarantee an acceptable lower-bound performance, and when the bandwidth is adequate, RC3MARL will make full use of the bandwidth and provide better performance. The experimental result demonstrates that our method can achieve better performance with same training samples.},

abstract={As increasingly traditional applications migrate to the cloud, load balancing without sacrificing the performances of cloud-based applications is a highly challenging problem in cloud computing. Existing solutions focusing on online task scheduling have the inefficient issue, due to the highly dynamic nature of cloud workloads and the virtual machines (VMs) with heterogeneous hardware configurations. To address this issue, dependent on the strong perception and decision-making ability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in automatic control problems, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based task scheduling method, which can dynamic assign submitted tasks to different VMs. In details, we formulate the task scheduling as a dynamical optimal problem with constraints, and then adopt the deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG) network to find the optimal task assignment solution with meeting the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) requirements. It makes the optimal scheduling decision only dependent on learning directly from its experience without any prior knowledge. The experimental results using the actual Alibaba cloud workload tracings show that compared with other existing solutions, our proposed task scheduling method can effectively reduce the average response time of tasks with guaranteeing the load balancing among VMs, when facing of dynamical workloads.},

abstract={Nowadays, various advanced vehicular applications are developed for road safety enhancement and traffic optimization, while the limited computation capability of vehicles can not always meet the delay requirements of these applications. Offloading the computation tasks to edge servers is regarded as a promising solution. However, how to select the optimal edge server to offload so as to support many delay-sensitive vehicular services is a challenging problem, especially when the server status changes. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an online reinforcement learning offloading method. The offloading decision process is divided into two steps to reduce the computation cost. Firstly, the edge server candidates are obtained through analysis on the historical server data, using the reinforcement learning method. Secondly, the optimal edge server is selected from the candidates online through observing current condition of the status of servers. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed method and it can effectively reduce running time.},

abstract={Device-to-device (D2D) communication is an emerging technology in the evolution of the 5G network enabled vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. It is a core technique for the next generation of many platforms and applications, e.g. real-time high-quality video streaming, virtual reality game, and smart city operation. However, the rapid proliferation of user devices and sensors leads to the need for more efficient resource allocation algorithms to enhance network performance while still capable of guaranteeing the quality-of-service. Currently, deep reinforcement learning is rising as a powerful tool to enable each node in the network to have a real-time self-organising ability. In this paper, we present two novel approaches based on deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, namely “distributed deep deterministic policy gradient” and “sharing deep deterministic policy gradient”, for the multi-agent power allocation problem in D2D-based V2V communications. Numerical results show that our proposed models outperform other deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of the network's energy efficiency and flexibility.},

pages={231-238},
abstract={Distributed deep learning systems place stringent requirement on communication bandwidth in its model training with large volumes of input data under user-time constraint. The communications take place mainly between cluster of worker nodes for training data and parameter servers for maintaining a global trained model. For fast convergence the worker nodes and parameter servers have to frequently exchange billions of parameters to quickly broadcast updates and minimize staleness. Demand on the bandwidth becomes even higher with the introduction of dedicated GPUs in the computation. While RDMA-capable network has a great potential to provide sufficiently high bandwidth, its current use over TCP/IP or tied to particular programming models, such as MPI, limits its capability to break the bandwidth bottleneck. In this work we propose iRDMA, an RDMA-based parameter server architecture optimized for high-performance network environment supporting both GPU- and CPU-based training. It utilizes native asynchronous RDMA verbs to achieve network line speed while minimizing the communication processing cost on both worker and parameter-server sides. Furthermore, iRDMA exposes the parameter server system as a POSIX-compatible file API for convenient support of load balance and fault tolerance as well as its easy use. We have implemented iRDMA at IBM's deep learning platform. Experiment results show that our design can help deep learning applications, including image recognition and language classification, to achieve near-linear improvement on convergence speed and training accuracy acceleration by using distributed computing resources. From the system perspective, iRDMA can efficiently utilize about 95% network bandwidth of fast networks to synchronize models among distributed training processes.},

abstract={The aim of the paper is to perform audio analytics based on the audio sensor data that is continuously monitoring the home environment automatically through an audio Internet of Things (IoT) system. Domestic violence is one of the major problems in many cities nowadays. We have proposed a home automation system where IoT sensors records the audio in home environment continuously and the audio is sent to machine learning server where the audio is split into small clips and classified into different categories. The need of an automatic detection system is urgent for enforcing home safety and safe neighborhood. If IoT system detects any suspicious sound, it generates an emergency notification to nearest emergency services for possible action to be taken. The classification of audio such as gunshots, explosion, glass breaking, screaming and siren is based on shallow learning (Support vector machine, Decision tree, Random forest and Naïve Bayes) and deep learning (Convolutional neural network and Long short-term memory). Our experiments validated that Convolutional Neural Network shows the best performance (89% accuracy) compared to other machine learning algorithms.},

Support vector machine (SVM) is a type of machine learning method with solid foundation that is developed based on traditional statistics.

This paper optimizes the structure of SVM classification tree with differential evolution (DE) and designs the corresponding DE algorithm to effectively solve the problem of image classification of complex background cases in smart city management systems. In the training process of SVM classification tree, it obtains an optimal two-class classification scheme in every node by means of DE, initially separates the classes that are easy to be separated and then the less easy ones, and finally adaptively generates the best classification tree. The simulation experiment proves that the proposed algorithm is effective when applied to smart city management systems.},

abstract={Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has been emerged an important component and widely adopted for the smart city as it overcomes the limitations of the traditional transportation system. Existing fixed traffic light control systems split the traffic light signal into fixed duration and run in an inefficient way, therefore, it suffers from many weaknesses such as long waiting time, waste of fuel and increase in carbon emission. To tackle these issues and increase efficiency of the traffic light control system, in this work, a Dynamic and Intelligent Traffic Light Control System (DITLCS) is proposed which takes real-time traffic information as the input and dynamically adjusts the traffic light duration. Further, the proposed DITLCS runs in three modes namely Fair Mode (FM), Priority Mode (PM) and Emergency Mode (EM) where all the vehicles are considered with equal priority, vehicles of different categories are given different level of priority and emergency vehicles are given at most priority respectively. Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning model is also proposed to switch the traffic lights in different phases (Red, Green and Yellow), and fuzzy inference system selects one mode among three modes i.e., FM, PM and EM according to the traffic information. We have evaluated DITLCS via realistic simulation on Gwalior city map of India using an open-source simulator i.e., Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). The simulation results prove the efficiency of DITLCS in comparison to other state of the art algorithms on various performance parameters.},

abstract={Accurate traffic prediction can benefit many smart city applications. Existing works mainly consider traffic prediction on each individual road segment, and heavily rely on some statistical or machine learning models, which suffer from either poor prediction accuracy or high computation overheads for predictions of the whole road network. In this paper, we instead consider the region-level traffic prediction that is still useful for many applications. To describe the regional traffic conditions and capture their spatio-temporal dependencies, we present a deep learning based model - DeepRTP. Specifically, we use a novel metric called Traffic State Index (TSI) to measure regional traffic conditions, and carefully classify traffic data into three categories that are used to capture hourly, daily, and weekly traffic patterns. Furthermore, we employ the convolutional and residual neural networks to model both spatial and temporal dependencies. Experimental results from real-world traffic data demonstrate that DeepRTP outperforms five baseline methods and can achieve higher prediction accuracy.},

abstract={LoRa wireless networks are considered as a key enabling technology for next generation internet of things (IoT) systems. New IoT deployments (e.g., smart city scenarios) can have thousands of devices per square kilometer leading to huge amount of power consumption to provide connectivity. In this paper, we investigate green LoRa wireless networks powered by a hybrid of the grid and renewable energy sources, which can benefit from harvested energy while dealing with the intermittent supply. This paper proposes resource management schemes of the limited number of channels and spreading factors (SFs) with the objective of improving the LoRa gateway energy efficiency. First, the problem of grid power consumption minimization while satisfying the system’s quality of service demands is formulated. Specifically, both scenarios the uncorrelated and time-correlated channels are investigated. The optimal resource management problem is solved by decoupling the formulated problem into two sub-problems: channel and SF assignment problem and energy management problem. Since the optimal solution is obtained with high complexity, online resource management heuristic algorithms that minimize the grid energy consumption are proposed. Finally, taking into account the channel and energy correlation, adaptable resource management schemes based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), are developed. Simulations results show that the proposed resource management schemes offer efficient use of renewable energy in LoRa wireless networks.},

The framework aims to provide flexible application-service disseminations for end-user requests. The state of the application and its longevity are taken into account for satisfying the in-time need of the requests. The service requiring scalable disseminations are performed based on the decisions of state learning to improve the success rate and enduring responses.

abstract={In the era of big data, the applications/services of the smart city are expected to offer end users better QoE than in a conventional smart city. Nevertheless, various types of sensors will produce an increasing volume of big data along with the implementation of a smart city, where we face redundant and diverse data. Therefore, providing satisfactory QoE will become the major challenge in the big-data-based smart city. In this article, to enhance the QoE, we propose a novel big data architecture consisting of three planes: the data storage plane, the data processing plane, and the data application plane. The data storage plane stores a wide variety of data collected by sensors and originating from different data sources. Then the data processing plane filters, analyzes, and processes the ocean of data to make decisions autonomously for extracting high-quality information. Finally, the application plane initiates the execution of the events corresponding to the decisions delivered from the data processing plane. Under this architecture, we particularly use machine learning techniques, trying to acquire accurate data and deliver precise information to end users.

abstract={Convolutional Neural Networks have received considerable attention over the past few years, and they are widely used in various fields.

This will limit further development of deep learning in resource-constrained devices such as the mobile terminal. It has been proposed that pruning is a useful method to optimize networks, whereas there is no contribution focus on utilizing the traits of the network to guide pruning. The primary purpose of this paper is to research the different effects of layers with varying depth and the different number of parameters during the pruning process. By taking advantage of the characteristics of network structure itself, we propose a new pruning strategy with three variants to effectively prune CNNs which can automatically determine the most appropriate sparsity for each conv-layer.

abstract={Community detection is a popular yet thorny issue in social network analysis. A symmetric and nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) model based on a nonnegative multiplicative update (NMU) scheme is frequently adopted to address it. Current research mainly focuses on integrating additional information into it without considering the effects of a learning scheme. This study aims to implement highly accurate community detectors via the connections between an SNMF-based community detector's detection accuracy and an NMU scheme's scaling factor. The main idea is to adjust such scaling factor via a linear or nonlinear strategy, thereby innovatively implementing several scaling-factor-adjusted NMU schemes. They are applied to SNMF and graph-regularized SNMF models to achieve four novel SNMF-based community detectors. Theoretical studies indicate that with the proposed schemes and proper hyperparameter settings, each model can: 1) keep its loss function nonincreasing during its training process and 2) converge to a stationary point. Empirical studies on eight social networks show that they achieve significant accuracy gain in community detection over the state-of-the-art community detectors.},

abstract={With the development of power system, accurate demand response business is developing towards diversification, which requires higher reliability and accuracy of demand response. In recent years, machine learning has been a hot topic in the academic field. If the ability of machine learning to learn from the environment and make optimal decisions is applied to the demand response, the demand response business can have a deep understanding of users behavior and make accurate predictions. Combining with the concept of smart community, this paper proposes a distributed optimal dispatch method of demand response based on LSTM and Q-learning algorithm. In this paper, the algorithm is applied to the demand response business planning of an smart community in a city with tropical monsoon climate. The simulation results show that the algorithm is consistent with the facts and has high accuracy.},
