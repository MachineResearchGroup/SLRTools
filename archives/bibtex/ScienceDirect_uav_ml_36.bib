abstract = {In this work, the distributed fixed-time formation control problem for a group of second-order multi-agent systems is investigated with consideration of collision avoidance, external disturbances, and connected undirected topology. As a stepping stone, a novel distributed fixed-time sliding manifold is proposed to achieve the predefined convergence performance. Furthermore, by combining repulsive potential function with the presented sliding manifold, an adaptive fixed-time formation protocol is developed to guarantee the tracking errors converge to small regions of zero, whilst providing collision-avoidance ability for multiple agents. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.}

If diagnostic tools or proper monitoring systems ignore them, they could not be detectable until their effects become severe and cause catastrophic damages to systems. This paper presents a survey on model-based (incipient) fault diagnosis approaches to show the significance of the incipient faults diagnosis in nonlinear closed-loop systems and, by taking a glance through data-based incipient fault diagnosis advancements, a picture of their present state of the art is also briefly discussed for completeness. Moreover, a classification of the most used state estimation filters is also provided. Consequently, recent works on incipient fault diagnosis approaches are reviewed, and an incipient fault diagnosis case study is investigated for a discrete-time nonlinear open-loop system affected by stochastic noise and disturbances. Specifically, a numerical example of a closed-loop three-tank system is considered, and simulations are accomplished, to demonstrate the inability of open-loop incipient fault diagnosis approaches in detecting incipient faults in the proposed closed-loop system.}

Accordingly, these gridded population data are increasingly dependent on a single ancillary data set to inform the distribution of populations across space. Our study tests several combinations of binary masking variables (land areas, all building footprints, residential building footprints) and density variables (building footprint areas, building volumes) derived from characteristics of the built environment at 20× and 8000× downscaling using a flexible equation for high-resolution global dasymetric population modeling. The assessment is applied in New York City, where large spatial heterogeneities exist across confined geographic areas. Results confirm that the performance of the model generally improves as: (i) the binary masking variable becomes increasingly limiting; and, (ii) the density variable becomes more pronounced. However, application requires careful consideration due to their propensity to amplify both positive results and errors.}

Mobile users endowing with computation and energy harvesting (EH) capabilities, called EH devices, are desired in MEC systems. With computation capability, EH devices can switch between local computing and mobile-edge computing for better QoEs. With EH technologies, mobile users could survive perpetually for supporting long-term task processing. However, the heterogeneous computation resource among EH devices and edge servers, limited wireless resource as well as time-constrained harvestable energy challenge the computation offloading. This paper investigates a green MEC with EH devices and develops an effective EH computation offloading scheme towards minimizing delay for green MEC. We formulate and analyze the EH computation offloading problem with game theory. Then, an EH computation offloading game scheme, including the Lyapunov drift-based energy harvesting and computation offloading best response algorithms, is designed to find out optimal energy harvesting and computation offloading solutions to address the problem.

In addition, the wearable sensor-based information acquisition meets the new trend of take-home healthcare, the access to the great amount of data enables applying data-driven methods in this scenario. In this paper, we propose to use wearable Electromyography (EMG) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to make an ahead-of-motion prediction of basic gait information, including lower-limb kinematics and kinetics. Particularly, a novel long short term memory (LSTM)-based algorithm is trained to extract features and continuously predict lower-limb angles. Based on the predicted kinematics, the kinetics of lower limbs are calculated by a dynamic model of human segments. EMG signals recorded from nine lower limb muscles and IMU signals from each lower-limb segment were collected for training the regressor. The experimental results with cross-validation among ten subjects have demonstrated the accuracy of the angle prediction and kinetics calculation. In addition, the optimal prediction time was exploited by testing the different sets of prediction time. The implication of this research work highlights the potential of continuous prediction of kinematics and kinetics, which provides fast and accurate access to basic gait information for smart healthcare applications.}

A sensor node would be capable of moving to a particular position to establish network connectivity, provided it knows its current position, positions of other sensor nodes and the radio propagation characteristics of the sensor area. In this paper, we present a pseudo formation control based trajectory algorithm to determine the optimal trajectory of a moving beacon used in localization of the sensor nodes in real-time. The trajectory and the frequency of transmission of the GPS based position information of the moving beacon influences the accuracy of localization and the power consumed by the beacon to localize. Localization accuracy and reduction in the number of position information messages can be achieved, in real-time, by determining the optimal position from where the beacon should transmit its next position information. This will decrease the time required to localize, and power consumed by the beacon in comparison to random or predetermined trajectories. We first show that optimal position determination is a pseudo formation control problem. Next, we show the pseudo formation control problem formulated as an unconstrained optimization problem under the free space propagation model. We further present the modeling of the beacon incorporating the trajectory algorithm based on the pseudo formation control in a discrete event simulator. Simulation results, comparing the performance of localization with pseudo formation control based trajectory against random waypoint and predetermined trajectories for the beacon are presented. The simulation results show that the localization accuracy is significantly improved along with reduction in the number of position information messages transmitted when the beacon traverses along the pseudo formation control based trajectory.}

This paper reviews the field measurement and remote sensing estimation methods, characteristics, and applications of CI. CI is generally estimated in the field using direct, indirect optical, and allometric methods. The basis for the indirect optical approach is the gap-fraction based method. Remote sensing of CI is carried out using passive optical and active LiDAR technology. Current CI products are mainly derived from an empirical relationship with the normalized difference hotspot and darkspot (NDHD) index. Further CI product validation studies should be conducted using enhanced field measurements. CI typically shows vertical, scale, directional, and temporal variations. The overall CI is calculated as the integration of the directional CI values. CI is a key parameter in leaf area index (LAI) estimation, and canopy reflectance and land surface modeling studies. Future studies should focus on the adoption of automated and wireless measurement methods, development of new remote sensing estimation methods, improving our understanding of the CI characteristics, and accounting for CI in land surface models.}

The Buxus Hyrcania stands in the Hyrcanian forests have been infested by Buxus blight pathogen in recent years. Determination of the rate, and finding the spatial distribution of infested trees, is very important for control and treatment management. In a case study, the capacity of leaf-off (winter) Pleiades high-resolution satellite imagery was examined using pixel and object-based classification algorithms to map the different infestation intensity classes in the reserved area of Anjilsi-Khiboos, a small part of the Hyrcanian forest. Ground truth of five infested classes including healthy, semi-healthy, full-infested, forest stands without boxwood understory and, the non-forest area was prepared using accurate positioning using RTK-DGPS. The images were geometrically orthorectified using DGPS ground control points and a DEM. Using suitable vegetation indices, the separability of classes on main and processed bands was evaluated using a transformed divergence index. Image classifications were carried out using appropriate algorithms and assessed using unused ground truth points. In the pixel-based classification, the best results were achieved using maximum likelihood algorithms on the original VNIR bands. In the object-based classification, the Bayes algorithm on VNIR bands had better performance among other used algorithms; however, the object-based classifiers had slightly the same results compared with pixel-based classifiers. The results showed that due to the similarity of spectral responses of healthy and semi-healthy boxwood trees and the heterogeneous distribution of boxwood blight disease in the study area, detection of the healthy trees from infested trees was slightly impossible. However, the fully infested and dead trees could be detected well from healthy boxwood trees and other stands and classes.}

The solution is approached with two methods: the target deviation rate minimization model and NSGA-II algorithm. The results obtained by solving the target deviation rate minimization model can balance every target. The branch and bound algorithm can find the global optimal solution at a certain calculation scale with high calculation efficiency, but its efficiency decreases significantly when the operation scale increases.

We propose a variety of relevant statistical tools including logistic regression, Gaussian process regression, quantile regression and support vector machines, which we then incorporate into an overall Regression Monte Carlo (RMC) framework for approximate dynamic programming. Our results indicate that using logistic or Gaussian process regression to estimate the admissibility probability outperforms the other options. Our algorithms offer an efficient and reliable extension of RMC to probability-constrained control. We illustrate our findings with two case studies for the microgrid problem.}

In this paper, an overview of collaborative industrial scenarios and programming requirements for cobots to implement effective collaboration is given. Then, detailed reviews on cobot programming, which are categorised into communication, optimisation, and learning, are conducted. Additionally, a significant gap between cobot programming implemented in industry and in research is identified, and research that works towards bridging this gap is pinpointed. Finally, the future directions of cobots for industrial collaborative scenarios are outlined, including potential points of extension and improvement.}

abstract = {Due to high popularity of electric scooters, cities with high population have faced challenges regarding establishment of battery swapping stations (BSS) along populated areas of the urban districts. However, locating a BSS in a big city is a multi-dimensional problem which require reliable tools to efficiently address. This paper proposes a novel robust decision-making tool, named mulTi-noRmalization mUlti-distance aSsessmenT (TRUST), to tackle location selection problem for BSS considering sustainability criteria. The proposed approach applies a multi-normalization procedure using three linear normalization techniques, logarithmic-normalization, and constraint-based normalization which are integrated through an aggregation operator. Then, Euclidean, Manhattan, Lorentzian, and Pearson distance measures are used to determine distance of alternatives from the negative ideal solution in order to calculate the final score. Advantages of the proposed approach are consideration of a multi-normalization algorithm to minimize subjectivity in normalized data, consideration of constraint-based normalization technique to ensure specific standards, and utilization of four distance measures through a two-stage process to determine a relative distance score. To show the feasibility and applicability of the new approach, a real-life case study is investigated to locate a BSS in Istanbul. Results show that the best alternative is Beyoğlu for locating a BSS for electric scooters.}

These sites contain numerous pictures, but some have incomplete or blurred location information. The geo-localization of crowd-sourced pictures enriches the information contained therein, and is applicable to activities such as urban construction, urban landscape analysis, and crime tracking. However, geo-localization faces huge technical challenges. This paper proposes a method for large-scale geo-localization of crowd-sourced pictures. Our approach uses structured, organized Street View images as a reference dataset and employs a three-step strategy of coarse geo-localization by image retrieval, selecting reliable matches by image registration, and fine geo-localization by 3D reconstruction to attach geographic tags to pictures from unidentified sources. In study area, 3D reconstruction based on close-range photogrammetry is used to restore the 3D geographical information of the crowd-sourced pictures, resulting in the proposed method improving the median error from 256.7 m to 69.0 m, and the percentage of the geo-localized query pictures under a 50 m error from 17.2% to 43.2% compared with the previous method. Another discovery using the proposed method is that, in respect of the causes of reconstruction error, closer distances from the cameras to the main objects in query pictures tend to produce lower errors and the component of error parallel to the road makes a more significant contribution to the Total Error. The proposed method is not limited to small areas, and could be expanded to cities and larger areas owing to its flexible parameters.}

The goal of this study was to develop a Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-Best Worst Method (BWM) based ecomentalist land suitability model to identify optimal locations for wind farms, and to evaluate existing planning preferences. Nine assessment criteria and nineteen constraints were used, and BWM was implemented to reckon the criteria weights. The wind velocity was designated to be the most outstanding assessment criterion, followed by land cover/use, proximity to specific conservation zones, proximity to urban settlements, slope, proximity to wetlands and important bird zones, and others. Standardized thematic suitability maps were presented using Weighted Overlay approach in GIS environment. The findings indicate that 40.90% of the study zone is suitable, and 54.39% of available wind turbines coincide with the suitable classes proposed in this study. This indicates that 45.61% of the real planning preferences are made without considering environmental conditions (e.g. visual impact, noise impact, deforestation, habitat damage to flora and fauna, and land fragmentation), land use features, and disaster conditions (e.g. snowslides, landslides, flood zones).

Researchers study to prevent the situations that drones are disabled by cyber-attackers by embedding malwares into the drones and Ground Control Stations (GCS). Therefore, it is required to protect the malwares considering the diverse kinds of features of the drones and GCSs. Signature-based detection approaches are traditionally utilized. However, given that those approaches only scan files partially, some of malwares are not detected. This paper proposes a novel method for finding the malwares in GCSs that utilizes a fastText model to create lower-dimension vectors than those the vectors by one-hot encoding and a bidirectional LSTM model to analyze the correlation with sequential opcodes. In addition, API function names are utilized to increase the classification accuracy of the sequential opcodes. In the experiments, the Microsoft malware classification challenge dataset was utilized and the malwares in the dataset were classified by family types. The proposed method showed the performance improvement of 1.87% comparing with the performance by a one-hot encoding-based approach. When the proposed method was compared with a similar decision tree-based malware detection approach, the performance of the proposed method was improved by 0.76%.}

abstract = {Visual object tracking is as a critical function for many computer vision tasks such as motion analysis, event detection and action recognition. Recently, Siamese network based trackers gained enormous popularity in the tracking field due to their favorable accuracy and efficiency. However, the distraction problem caused by semantic backgrounds and the simple modeling strategy of target templates often lead to performance degradation. In this study, we propose two modules, namely the target objectness model and the target template model, based on existing Siamese network based trackers to solve these issues. The target objectness model computes the possibility of each pixel in the search area pertaining to the tracked target based on color distributions of the foreground and background areas. The computed target likelihood map is masked on the previous response map, and subsequently adjusts the final response map to focus on the target. This practice enlarges the discrimination between the tracked target and surrounding backgrounds, thus alleviating the distraction problem. The target template model proposes a Gaussian mixed model to encode target appearance variations, where each component of the model represents a different aspect of the target, and the component weights are learned and dynamically updated. The proposed Gaussian model enhances diversity and simultaneously reduces redundancy between target samples. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we perform extensive experiments on four widely used benchmarks, namely OTB100, VOT2016, TC128, and UAV123. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves favorable performance compared to many state-of-the-art trackers while maintaining real-time tracking speed.}

We take into account both antenna mode switching and destination selection for the amplify and forward relaying network. The untrusted relay (UR) is equipped with two antennas, where one antenna that maximizes the source-to-relay channel gain will be selected for reception and the other one is exploited to forward the processed information. Moreover, the Nth best destination is considered as the legitimate destination, which aims to achieve a better secrecy rate. Specially, in general signal-to-noise ratio regime, a low-complexity Gaussian Q-function is introduced to derive the exact closed-form expression of ergodic secrecy rate (ESR). In addition, when the UR works in a non-linear energy harvesting mode, the achievable secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved by an alternative optimization method. The simulation results reveal the correctness of the theoretical derivation and also proves that much higher secrecy performance can be achieved by the proposed scheme than other benchmark schemes.}

This paper proposes a robust and efficient mismatch-removal algorithm based on the concepts of local barycentric coordinate (LBC) and matching coordinate matrices (MCMs), called locality affine-invariant matching (LAM). LAM is suitable for both rigid and nonrigid image matching problems. We define a novel LBC system based on area ratios, which is invariant to local affine transformations. We also present the MCMs based on the coordinates of matches, whose degeneracy is able to indicate the correctness of correspondences. Our LAM method first builds a mathematical model based on the LBCs to extract good matches that preserve local neighborhood structures. Then, LAM constructs local MCMs using the extracted reliable correspondences and identifies the correctness for the remaining matches via minimizing the rank of the MCMs. LAM has linear space and linearithmic time complexities. Extensive experiments on both rigid and nonrigid real datasets demonstrate the power of the proposed method; i.e., LAM is more robust to complex transformations compared to other methods and is two orders of magnitude faster than RANSAC under low inlier rates. The source code of the proposed LAM method will be publicly available in http://www.escience.cn/people/lijiayuan/index.html.}

Analyzing the conditions that led to early CBMs suggests such measures, however, will unlikely succeed today without being adapted to current conditions. This article uses historical analogies to illustrate how, in the absence of combat experiences involving novel military technology, it is difficult for states to be certain how these innovations change the implicit rules of warfare. Pursuing international dialogue, in ways that borrow from the Cold War CBM toolkit, may help speed the learning process about the implications of military applications of AI in ways that reduce the risk that states’ uncertainty about changes in military technology undermine international security and stability.}

Recent studies have shown that social media plays an important role in disasters, offering a participatory, collaborative and self-organized structure to communicate and disseminate situational information. Despite growing research on social media during disasters, little is known about the dynamic properties of inter-organizational networks and the roles of different organizations in communication networks on social media during disasters. This understanding is important for evaluating and improving collective action for disaster preparedness, emergency response, and recovery. To address this gap, this study presents a methodology for mapping and analyzing online organizational communication networks based on their interactions on twitter using the data obtained from Hurricane Harvey. The proposed method enables examining the network properties of online inter-organizational communication networks, unveiling the evolution of the roles of organizations within different phases of the disaster. The results show that: 1) during Harvey, government organizational users primarily generate information, while non-government organizational users mainly disseminate information, 2) during Harvey, most users in the cores of online organizational communication networks are from government organizations, 3) there are limited interactions among government and non-government organizational users before and after Harvey. The results provide insights into the roles of different types of organizations in online communication networks, helping make recommendations to improve inter-organizational communication in online social media to enhance disaster preparedness, responses, and recovery.}

L1 adaptive controller is a novel technology considering both the robustness and fast adaptation. The closed-loop control system is proved to be uniformly global asymptotically stable. A novel guidance law, time-varying vector field, is proposed for the guidance system. The kinematic analysis of path-following shows that the guidance and control systems are coupled, and the guidance system is affected by the performance of the controller. The Lyapunov method is employed to show that the equilibrium point of the whole system is uniformly global asymptotically stable. Path-following simulations are carried out to validate the performance of the proposed control law and vector field guidance law using a fully nonlinear manoeuvring mode of an underactuated tanker in the presence of stochastic ocean current.}

There exists a variety of road-based routing problems at all three strategic, tactical and operational planning levels. Examples include location routing problems, fleet management, vehicle routing and shortest path problems. To evaluate solution quality, multiple, usually conflicting objectives are considered. Aiming to provide practice-oriented decision support, multi-objective routing problems attract more and more attention in academic literature. This contribution offers a wide overview of which application-oriented multi-objective routing problems are treated and what kind of trade-off is investigated. Furthermore, the algorithmic approach is analyzed with regard to its fitness assignment strategy, i.e. how the multiple objectives are handled, and its search strategy to solve the problem. In order to structure the literature, we propose a classification in which every identified objective is sorted into a category and related to problem elements. Both problem-specific and general research gaps in multi-objective routing problems are identified and offer a starting point for future research. Lastly, fitness assignment strategies are extensively discussed and insights regarding their usage are given.}

A new approach for 3D building surface modeling, based on closed constraints, is proposed. First, a region growth algorithm is applied to fit the input point clouds by a set of candidate planes. Then, additional candidate planes are generated from the initial planes according to a rigid transformation followed by expanding the original primitive set to the candidate model set through generation rules. Furthermore, an energy function is employed to combine the data fitting errors with the structural constraints at the model selection stage. Finally, the 3D building surface model is generated from the candidate set through energy minimization. More precisely speaking, we adopt the surface optimization scheme that enforces the 3D polygonal surfaces of the building to be consistent with a priori geometric structures. Our approach was assessed using multi-source datasets with different densities, noise levels covering diverse and complex structures. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy and robustness than those of several state-of-the-art methods.}

To evaluate the degree to which remote sensing is contributing to the science of ecologically-oriented urban planning, we carried out a systematic literature review using the SCOPUS database, searching for articles integrating knowledge in urban planning, remote sensing and ecology. We reviewed 186 articles, analysing various issues in urban environments worldwide. Key findings include that the level of integration between the three disciplines is limited, with only 12% of the papers fully integrating ecology, remote sensing and planning while 24% of the studies use specific methods from one domain only. The vast majority of studies is oriented towards contributing to the knowledge base or monitoring the impacts of existing policies. Few studies are directly policy relevant by either contributing to direct issues in planning and making specific design suggestions or evaluations. The accessibility of the scientific findings remains limited, as the majority of journal articles are not open access and proprietary software and data are frequently used. To overcome these issues, we suggest three future avenues for science as well as three potential entry points for remote sensing into applied urban planning. By doing so, remote sensing data could become a vital tool actively contributing to policies, civil engagement and concrete planning measures by providing independent and cost effective environmental analyses.}

A supervised neural dynamic programming (SNDP) approach is developed to solve this MRAC problem, which includes a learning mode and a control mode. In the learning mode, a data-based adaptive critic learning algorithm is proposed, which guarantees that the controlled objective adaptively tracks the reference model on behavior. Such an algorithm also ensures flexible switching from the learning mode to the control mode under which the robustness of the closed-loop control systems is further improved. By employing a newly defined mode scheduler that regulates the learning mode and the control mode, the adaptation and the robustness of the systems are both achieved by the developed SNDP approach. Its uniformly ultimately bounded property is proved by using Lyapunov method. Simulation results verify that the developed SNDP approach ensures the adaptation to the variable reference input, and has superiority over some traditional MRAC methods in improving the robustness.}

The problems introduced by the time-varying topologies are, respectively, decomposition schemes deterioration and pre-training difficulties. The causes of the two problems are detailed and addressed in our work. First, for the decomposition schemes deterioration problem, a multi-agent dynamics-based online distributed decomposition algorithm are developed, so that a decent decomposed network structure for such topology-varying network can be maintained. Second, to alleviate the pre-training difficulties in topology-varying systems, a fault detection method is proposed, which avoids the need for pre-training. The distributed decomposition algorithm is proved to converge in finite steps, and the proposed fault detection method is verified both theoretically and experimentally.}

abstract = {Remote estimation of leaf nitrogen content is a critical requirement for precision farm management. Precise knowledge of nitrogen distribution in the crop enables farmers to decide the fertilisation amount required at specific locations on the farm. Importantly, nitrogen related molecules in plants are transported using water molecules, and water molecules surround the amide bonds (a plant protein created from nitrogen). Consequently, the nitrogen in various crop parts loses its activity in the absence of sufficient water molecules. The association of water molecules around plant proteins makes the optical remote estimation of plant nitrogen challenging as nitrogen and water molecules simultaneously affect the reflectance data. Moreover, the coarse spatial resolution of satellite data and sparse canopy coverage at early growth stages of the crop make it challenging to estimate leaf-level nitrogen contents. Accordingly, this research developed a leaf nitrogen content estimation model using drone-based top-of-canopy 400–1000 nm pure pixel hyperspectral images collected from a maize research farm treated with different water and nitrogen levels. Leaf level spectral signatures were also collected using a field spectroradiometer and used to identify indices more sensitive to nitrogen than water. The leaves were also destructively sampled for obtaining ground truth leaf water and nitrogen content. Red-edge region bands of electromagnetic spectra were identified to be sensitive to leaf nitrogen content. A synthetic data was created using maximum and minimum values of these indices and crop growth stage information, which was further used for training a gradient-boosting machine model to estimate leaf nitrogen content from drone-based hyperspectral images. The estimated leaf nitrogen content values from drone observations were critically analysed with respect to leaf water content values. For water-stressed areas, the model gave an R2 and RMSE of 0.63 and 2.74 mg/g, respectively. However, the model did not perform adequately for well irrigated areas, having an R2 and RMSE of 0.26 and 4.54 mg/g, respectively.}

However, the iFEM method based on constant cross-section beam elements proposed in previous works were no longer suitable for variable cross-section beam elements. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new iFEM method for reconstructing the displacement field of variable cross-section beam based on isogeometric analysis. Firstly, the mechanical parameters of beam section are linearized, including section area, axial rigidity, shear rigidity, torsional rigidity and bending rigidity, and a new constitutive relations are established. Then, adhering to the constitutive equations and the small-strain hypothesis, the displacement equations of the theoretical deformation field are deduced. Nevertheless, considering that the deduced displacement equations can not be applied to the iFEM, this paper proposes a method for using isogeometric analysis instead of the original function, and the least-square method is used to establish the strain-displacement relation. Finally, to verify the validity and accuracy of the methodology, a concentrated load and a distributed load were applied to one airfoil in the experiment tests. The predicted displacements with previous iFEM and presented iFEM are compared with those experimentally measured values, respectively. The results show that the presented iFEM exhibited higher accuracy than the previous iFEM in the variable cross-section beam problem.}

However, initially deploying and ensuring a mobile ad-hoc network in real and complex environments is an arduous task since the strength of the connection between two nodes (i.e., robots) can change rapidly in time or even disappear. An extension of the Particle Swarm Optimization to multi-robot applications has been previously proposed and denoted as Robotic Darwinian PSO (RDPSO). This paper contributes with a further extension of the RDPSO, thus integrating two research aspects: (i) an autonomous, realistic and fault-tolerant initial deployment strategy denoted as Extended Spiral of Theodorus (EST); and (ii) a fault-tolerant distributed search to prevent communication network splits. The exploring agents, denoted as scouts, are autonomously deployed using supporting agents, denoted as rangers. Experimental results with 15 physical scouts and 3 physical rangers show that the algorithm converges to the optimal solution faster and more accurately using the EST approach over the random deployment strategy. Also, a more fault-tolerant strategy clearly influences the time needed to converge to the final solution, but is less susceptible to robot failures.}

Then, an improved torque controller is derived by applying filter operations and a set of auxiliary variables to avoid measuring the acceleration signals. To address the unknown dynamics parameters, a modified adaptive law with an alternative leakage term containing the parameter estimation error is developed. With this adaptive law, the convergence of both the estimated parameters and the tracking error can be achieved simultaneously. The whole closed-loop system's stability under environmental disturbances and parameter uncertainties is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory. Comparative simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Then, the glide phase is optimized using a proposed novel robust hybrid algorithm that combines advantages of the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and gauss pseudospectral method (GPM). In the proposed hybrid algorithm, an improved GSA (IGSA) is presented to enhance the convergence speed and the global search ability, by adopting the elite memory reservation strategy and an adaptive gravitational constant adaption with individual optimum fitness feedback. At the beginning stage of search process, an initialization generator is constructed to find an optimum solution with IGSA, due to its strong global search ability and robustness to the initial values. When the change in fitness value satisfies the predefined value, the IGSA is replaced by the GPM to accelerate the search process and to get an accurate optimum solution. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation results are analyzed in detail, which demonstrate the proposed method is practicable. The comparison with GSA and GPM shows that the hybrid algorithm has better performance in terms of convergence speed, robustness and accuracy for solving the RLV A&L trajectory optimization problem.}

Yet the resulting datasets are rarely related to use-based monitoring indicators (i.e., utilization or residual biomass), which are critical for adaptive management and to inform the subsequent year's grazing plans. To better assess our ability to use remotely sensed data products for grazing monitoring and adaptive management, we tested the relationships between a variety of vegetation biomass metrics derived from remotely sensed data on a bunchgrass-dominated grassland in northeast Oregon and two common indicators: stocking rate at the pasture scale (40−250 ha; a management indicator) and field-based utilization estimates at the plot scale (25−50 m; a grazing indicator). At the pasture scale, we correlated stocking rate to biomass metrics and found two metrics that had consistent relationships to stocking rate: fall mean biomass (r values range: −0.52 to −0.56; P values < 0.001) and the 10th percentile of the relative difference between summer and fall biomass (r values range: −0.47 to −0.52; P values < 0.01). Scatterplots from these correlations were then evaluated alongside managers’ knowledge to interpret why some pastures deviated from the overall pattern. At the plot scale, we correlated in-field utilization estimates to biomass metrics and found consistent relationships with fall mean biomass (r values range: −0.32 to −0.47; P values < 0.001) and the relative difference between summer and fall biomass (r value: from −0.20 to −0.62; P values < 0.005). To further visualize the utilization correlations, we classified these two biomass maps into three categories guided by our utilization estimates. Significant changes in biomass due to management and interannual variation in biomass amounts stood out. The results and visualizations demonstrate how remotely sensed data relate to conventional grazing monitoring indicators and exemplify how remotely sensed data can be used to inform adaptive management.}

abstract = {Trajectory optimization is essentially an optimal control problem (OCP) with highly nonlinear dynamic properties and complex constraints, and a critical part of spacecraft design. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm is proposed for automatic reentry trajectory optimization of reusable launch vehicle (RLV) without providing user-specified initial guesses and a priori knowledge about the optimal trajectory. The method combines the strong robustness and global optimization properties of hyper-heuristic whale optimization algorithm (HHWOA) with the efficient and accurate features of the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM). HHWOA works as the first-stage optimizer aims to obtain an approximate solution to provide a high-quality initial guess for the GPM, while the GPM works as the second-stage optimizer aims to accelerate the search of the optimum neighborhood to obtain an accurate optimal solution. Additionally, to enhance the progress during the evolutionary process, HHWOA is equipped with opposition-based learning, differential evolution operators, chaotic map sequences and smoothing technique strategies. The utilization of such strategies can potentially smooth the flight trajectory and improve the global convergence of the algorithm, while the three OCPs have shown their superiority in HHWOA. In order to evaluate the performance of the hybrid algorithm, complex constrained RLV maximum cross-range reentry problems with three different path constraint scenarios are investigated. Furthermore, more discussion and experiments are likewise conducted to investigate the impact of the parameters on the performance of the algorithm. The results show that the proposed hybrid algorithm can be very effective in addressing RLV reentry trajectory optimization problems.}

Thermodynamic analyses and parametric studies are collectively performed to investigate the compatibility and applicability of the proposed system as well as its performance through the energetic and exergetic efficiencies to determine how the efficiencies are affected by varying the operating conditions. Hydrogen, methane, methanol, ethanol, and dimethyl ether with different combinations are chosen as alternative fuels to replace kerosene, which is a traditional, fossil-based fuel. It is found that the net power of the solid oxide fuel cell is 944 kW with an electric efficiency of 87.0%. A maximum thermal efficiency of 32.3% and exergetic efficiency of 43.9% were achieved using 75% methane and 25% hydrogen fuel. The maximum overall thermal and exergetic efficiencies of the hybrid turbofan are 48.1% and 54.4%, respectively, using 75% methanol and 25% hydrogen fuel, which reduce carbon emissions by 65% compared to the fossil fuels. Therefore, the hybrid turbofan aircraft engine can increase the turbofan performance. In addition, a fuel mixture of 60% ethanol and 40% hydrogen can increase the performance by 5% and reduce carbon emissions by 73%.}

We present Electrosense+ which addresses this challenge and creates a general-purpose and open platform for spectrum monitoring using low-cost, embedded, and software-defined spectrum IoT sensors. Electrosense+ allows users to remotely decode specific parts of the radio spectrum. It builds on the centralized architecture of its predecessor, Electrosense, for controlling and monitoring the spectrum IoT sensors, but implements a real-time and peer-to-peer communication system for scalable spectrum data decoding. We propose different mechanisms to incentivize the participation of users for deploying new sensors and keep them operational in the Electrosense network. As a reward for the user, we propose an incentive accounting system based on virtual tokens to encourage the participants to host IoT sensors. We present the new Electrosense+ system architecture and evaluate its performance at decoding various wireless signals, including FM radio, AM radio, ADS-B, AIS, LTE, and ACARS.}

abstract = {Computer Vision (CV) based surveillance in crowded scenes is one of the most significant and promising topics due to the increase of people gatherings in public places where the possibilities of disasters and stampedes is also high. Therefore, it is essential to develop a well established Crowd Disaster Avoidance System (CDAS) for the public safety. In general, CV-CDAS focuses on crowd scene analysis, crowd behavior analysis and crowd management. Either, a stampede may occur due to abnormal behavior of individuals in a crowd or a crowd may behave abnormally after the stampede. Even though behavior analysis of a crowd plays an essential role, it is inadequate to decide whether a stampede may occur or not at that instance. Despite significant progress and various surveys on crowd scene, crowd modeling and behavior analysis over the past few decades, the existing surveys still fail to discuss and delineate the crowd disaster analysis based on many key aspects as a whole. However, CV-CDAS needs to be developed based on the necessary factors such as the number of cameras (single/multiple), target of interest (an individual/group or crowd), crowd scene (structured/unstructured), crowd motion (static/dynamic), crowd behavior analysis, people count and crowd density estimation, person re-identification in crowd, crowd evacuation, forensic analysis on crowd disaster and computations on crowd analysis. Consequently, taking all these factors into an account, this survey aims to deliberate a road map to develop a stable CV-CDAS which includes recent trends and approaches in the crowd disaster analysis. In addition, behavior analysis plays a vital role and hence, an extended version of existing survey with the perspective of single and multiple cameras is elaborated. Besides, it summarizes the crowd disaster problem handled by various CV algorithms in the past and also paves a way to avoid this problem in future. Moreover, this survey presents the existing benchmark datasets with their specifications and performance evaluation metrics with special focus on dataset which will be suitable for specific application and it helps the researchers to select appropriate dataset for evaluation. Finally, this paper concludes with open issues and directions for future research which may further motivate and guide the academic and industrial personnel, involved in developing CV-based crowd disaster management systems.}

Since then, great attention has been paid by the scientific and industrial communities for the protocol evaluation and improvement. Indeed, depending on applications scenarios, constraints related to the target environments or other requirements, many adaptations and improvements can be made. So, since the initial release of the standard, several implementations were proposed, some targeting specific optimization goals whereas others would optimize several criteria while building the routing topology. They include, but are not limited to, extending the network lifetime, maximizing throughput at the sink node, avoiding the less secured nodes, considering nodes or sink mobility. Sometimes, to consider the Quality of Service (QoS), it is necessary to consider several of those criteria at the same time. This paper reviews recent works on RPL and highlights major contributions to its improvement, especially those related to topology optimization, security and mobility. We aim to provide an insight into relevant efforts around the protocol, draw some lessons and give useful guidelines for future developments.}

This flow of carbon is referred to as the Earth's carbon cycle. It is also intimately linked to the cycling of other elements and compounds. The ocean plays a fundamental role in Earth's carbon cycle, helping to regulate atmospheric CO2 concentration. The ocean biological carbon pump (OBCP), defined as a set of processes that transfer organic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean, is at the heart of the ocean carbon cycle. Monitoring the OBCP is critical to understanding how the Earth's carbon cycle is changing. At present, satellite remote sensing is the only tool available for viewing the entire surface ocean at high temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we review methods for monitoring the OBCP with a focus on satellites. We begin by providing an overview of the OBCP, defining and describing the pools of carbon in the ocean, and the processes controlling fluxes of carbon between the pools, from the surface to the deep ocean, and among ocean, land and atmosphere. We then examine how field measurements, from ship and autonomous platforms, complement satellite observations, provide validation points for satellite products and lead to a more complete view of the OBCP than would be possible from satellite observations alone. A thorough analysis is then provided on methods used for monitoring the OBCP from satellite platforms, covering current capabilities, concepts and gaps, and the requirement for uncertainties in satellite products. We finish by discussing the potential for producing a satellite-based carbon budget for the oceans, the advantages of integrating satellite-based observations with ecosystem models and field measurements, and future opportunities in space, all with a view towards bringing satellite observations into the limelight of ocean carbon research.}

However, designing a vehicular recruitment scheme to enhance a security-based DNS is challenging since it is hard to judge trustworthiness values of vehicular sensors. Therefore, in this paper, a novel vehicular trust evaluation scheme is proposed to analyze and supervise the data collected by vehicular sensors with a trust and low-cost style. To obtain vehicular trusts, the proposed scheme that considers time factor and gap between sensed data and real data is designed to calculate trustworthiness of vehicles. Moreover, sensing data in the vehicle sparse regions has more contributions because of its rareness. Thus, to inspire vehicles to sense data in the vehicle sparse regions, a trustworthiness-based gradient pricing method is designed to pay rewards for the vehicular sensors. Finally, with real vehicular GPS datasets, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve accuracy rate of data sensing by 37.72% and can improve data quality by 76.95%. By incentive pricing method, coverage ratio of data sensing is improved by 13.1%. In general, performances of the proposed scheme can be improved by 19. 39% to 22.32% approximately. Future works focus on improving information security by advanced machine learning methods in the dynamic DNS.}

Previous works treat all feature channels and training samples equally during training. This ignores channel interdependencies and foreground–background data imbalance, thus limiting the tracking performance. To tackle these problems, we introduce channel attention and focal loss into the network design to enhance feature representation learning. Specifically, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block is coupled to each convolutional layer to generate channel attention. Channel attention reflects the channel-wise importance of each feature channel and is used for feature weighting in online tracking. To alleviate the foreground–background data imbalance, we propose a focal logistic loss by adding a modulating factor to the logistic loss, with two tunable focusing parameters. The focal logistic loss down-weights the loss assigned to easy examples in the background area. Both the SE block and focal logistic loss are computationally lightweight and impose only a slight increase in model complexity. Extensive experiments are performed on three challenging tracking datasets including OTB100, UAV123 and TC128. Experimental results demonstrate that the enhanced tracker achieves significant performance improvement while running at a real-time frame-rate of 66 fps.}

Traditionally, the graph model-based reliability block diagrams (RBD) and fault tree analysis (FTA) have been used to assess the reliability of products and systems. However, these methods are based on deterministic relationships between components that introduce prediction inaccuracy. To fill the gap, a Bayesian Network (BN) method is introduced that considers the intricacies of the high-power light-emitting diode (LED) lamp system and the functional interaction among components for reliability assessment and lifetime prediction. An accelerated degradation test was conducted to analyze the evolution of the degradation and failure of components that influence the system level lifetime and performance of LED lamps. The Gamma process and Weibull distribution are used for component level lifetime prediction. The junction tree algorithm was deployed in the BN structure to estimate the joint probability distributions of the lifetime states. The degradation and prediction results showed that LED modules contribute a major part for lumen degradation of LED lamps followed by drivers and the least effect is from diffuser and reflector. The BN based lifetime estimation results also exhibited an accurate prediction as validated with the Gamma process and such improved reliability assessment outcomes are beneficial to LED manufacturers and customers. Thus, the proposed approach is effective to evaluate and address the long-term reliability assessment concerns of high-reliability LED lamps and fulfill the guarantee of high prediction accuracy in less time and cost-effective manner.}

Then, we discuss key techniques to localize the mobile robot such as: probabilistic approach, autonomous map building and radio frequency identification (RFID) based scheme. In the probabilistic localization section, we discuss the Markov localization and Kalman filter along with its extended versions. Autonomous map building focuses on the widely used simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach. This section also discusses on applying SLAM to localize brain-controlled mobile robots.

Firstly, the designed controller regards the unknown system nonlinearities and the disturbance of state time-delay as “disturbance-like” terms, which are guaranteed to be bounded by using the pre-set barrier functions, such that any prior knowledge of system nonlinearities and state time-delay are released. Then, the “disturbance-like” terms are compensated adaptively by designing the novel compensator at each step, such that the synchronization errors are eliminated to zero eventually for each agent. It is proved that our developed controller guarantees the convergence on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory. Some simulations are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed method.}

In the previous fault-tolerant attitude estimation methods, the two types of sensors' faults are treated separately. When one sensor is detected, the other sensor is assumed to be always healthy. In this paper, the situation is improved by introducing the rolling & pitching moment model of quadrotors. The rolling & pitching moment model, x-axis gyro, y-axis gyro and velocity measurement sensors are fused, forming an analytical redundancy based fault-tolerant filter. The real flight experiment data are used for validation, showing that the faults of x-axis gyro, y-axis gyro and velocity measurement sensors can all be detected and isolated, and the state estimation accuracy is improved compared with the traditional method when gyros are faulty.}

Shape descriptors extracted from a hand contour or silhouette have been proved effective in representing a hand posture. However, it is difficult for these shape-based methods to achieve good balance between accuracy and efficiency. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel hand shape descriptor based on a set of geometric features (SoGF) and Fisher Vector (FV), for effective and efficient HPR. Three types of geometric features, including distances, angles and curvatures, are extracted from a hand silhouette to form a discriminative local descriptor, and FV is adopted to encode the set of local descriptors for compact hand shape representation. To recognize hand postures, we construct a classifier using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) with FVs as input. The experimental results on four public HPR datasets show that the proposed method can achieve the mean accuracy of the state-of-the-art methods in real time.}

abstract = {The recent northward expansion of Southern Pine Beetle (SPB) outbreaks associated with warming winters has caused extensive tree mortality in temperate pine forests, significantly affecting forest dynamics, structure, and functioning. Spatially-explicit early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality is critical for timely and sustainable forest management practices. The unique contributions of remote sensing technologies to mapping the location, extent, and severity of beetle outbreaks, as well as assisting in analyzing the potential drivers for outbreak predictions, have been well recognized. However, little is known about the performance of moderate resolution satellite multispectral imagery for early warning and detection of SPB-induced tree mortality. Thus, we conducted this study, as the first attempt, to capture the spatial-temporal patterns of SPB infestation severity at the regional scale and to understand the underlying environmental drivers in a spatially-explicit manner. First, we explored the spectral signatures of SPB-killed trees based on 30-m plot measurements and Landsat-8 imagery. Then, to improve detection accuracy for areas with low-moderate SPB infestation severity, we added spectral-temporal anomaly information in the form of a linear trend of the spectral index trajectory to a previously developed approach. The best overall accuracy increased from 84.7% to 90.1% and the best Macro F1 value increased from 0.832 to 0.900. Next, we compared the performances of spectral indices in mapping SPB infestation severity (i.e., % red stage within the 30-m grid cell). The results showed that the combination of Normalized Difference Moisture Index and Tasseled Cap Greenness had the best performance for mapping SPB infestation severity (2016: R2 = 0.754; RSME = 15.7; 2017: R2 = 0.787; RSME = 12.4). Finally, we found that climatic and landscape variables can explain the detected patterns of SPB infestation from 2014 to 2017 in our study area (R2 = 0.751; RSME = 9.67), providing valuable insights on possible predictors for early warning of SPB infestation. Specifically, in our study area, winter dew point temperature was found to be one of the most important predictors, followed by SPB infestation locations in the previous year, canopy cover of host species, elevation, and slope. In the context of continued global warming, our study not only provides a novel framework for efficient, spatially-explicit, and quantitative measurements of forest damage induced by SPB infestation over large scales, but also uncovers opportunities to predict future SPB outbreaks and take precautions against it.}

abstract = {Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a new technology introduced by 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) to meet low-power wide area networks (LPWAN) requirements. Accessing nodes with poor channel condition is of decisive importance in such networks. Repetition is a promising approach to enhance the network coverage in radio technologies suitable for machine-type communications including NB-IoT. This approach implies repeating the same transmission data or control signals back-to-back without getting feedback from the end point. Introducing this new feature raises the need for link adaptation in mainly two dimensions: 1) Selection of modulation and coding scheme (MCS) level and 2) Repetition number determination to guarantee the block error rate of less than 10%. In this paper, we propose a link adaptation scheme to minimize the transmission of control information for large packets that are segmented before sending. This is done by a new online SNR estimation scheme and adaptively sending downlink control information (DCI) only for necessary segments. According to the simulation results, our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional method by reducing the resource blocks consumption and active time by an average of 35% and 30%, respectively.}

However, these approaches either focus on the target area by suppressing the background information or exploit a spatial regularisation term to penalise filter coefficients far from the target centre, where real negative samples are exceedingly rare and irrelevant information is integrated into filters. Based on the observation that the tracking model is strongly dependent on the quality of training samples, this paper proposes a novel DCF-based tracker to precisely process the training set through a smooth and steeply decreasing function in two respects. On the one hand, the surrounding information is suitably incorporated into the target. On the other hand, every real background patch is collected as a negative sample. In addition, the target appearance model is adaptively updated by achieving an appropriate trade-off between current and historical models according to their reliability. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In particular, compared with the baseline tracker, our method achieves gains of 7.4% and 9.9% in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) on the OTB-100 and LaSOT datasets, respectively.}

abstract = {Human multi-robot interaction exploits both the human operator's high-level decision-making skills and the robotic agents’ vigorous computing and motion abilities. While controlling multi-robot teams, an operator's attention must constantly shift between individual robots to maintain sufficient situation awareness. To conserve an operator's attentional resources, a robot with self-reflect capability on its abnormal status can help an operator focus her attention on emergent tasks rather than unneeded routine checks. With the proposing self-reflect aids, the human-robot interaction becomes a queuing framework, where the robots act as the clients to request for interaction and an operator acts as the server to respond these job requests. This paper examined two types of queuing schemes, the self-paced Open-queue identifying all robots’ normal/abnormal conditions, whereas the forced-paced shortest-job-first (SJF) queue showing a single robot's request at one time by following the SJF approach. As a robot may miscarry its experienced failures in various situations, the effects of imperfect automation were also investigated in this paper. The results suggest that the SJF attentional scheduling approach can provide stable performance in both primary (locate potential targets) and secondary (resolve robots’ failures) tasks, regardless of the system's reliability levels. However, the conventional results (e.g., number of targets marked) only present little information about users’ underlying cognitive strategies and may fail to reflect the user's true intent. As understanding users’ intentions is critical to providing appropriate cognitive aids to enhance task performance, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to examine operators’ underlying cognitive intent and identify the unobservable cognitive states. The HMM results demonstrate fundamental differences among the queuing mechanisms and reliability conditions. The findings suggest that HMM can be helpful in investigating the use of human cognitive resources under multitasking environments.}

The dataset covered three commonly used gas pollutants, including CO, NO2 and O3 measured by both ECGS and reference instruments, with a time resolution of 1 min and a duration of 6 months. Taking advantage of this large dataset, the performance of 8 different data correction schemes (2 new algorithms and 6 algorithms from the literature) was benchmarked by a set of evaluation metrics using raw signals from ECGS (nA level currents from the working and auxiliary electrodes). Eight scenarios were considered to examine the robustness of correction algorithms in response to different training and evaluation data period configurations. In addition, the bias dependence on temperature, RH, target gas levels and cross-sensitivity by different correction algorithms was investigated. Recommendations on data correction scheme selection are provided based on the comparison results.}

Different from the conventional path planning algorithms which mostly focus on the shortest, safest or smoothest paths, PTA takes all the dynamic constraints of the USV into account, and finds the global trajectory that can be traced precisely via its own maneuvering system. In present strategy, the predicted trajectories produced by the mathematical model of the USV are decomposed into a series of waypoints on grid map. Then an efficient trajectory can be found for the USV by performing the A* search method. To improve the search efficiency and accuracy, the PTA is enhanced with global path guiding (GPTA). When searching for feasible trajectories, GPTA can employ the global path obtained by Theta* to accurately estimate the heuristic cost of the objective function, rather than using the Euclidean distance directly as PTA does. Numerical simulations in various scenarios are conducted to compare the performance of the PTA, GPTA, Trajectory Units (TUs) and hybrid path planning algorithm combining global and local path planning (HGL). The results demonstrate that GPTA has higher safety and navigation efficiency for motion planning of the underactuated USV.}

Since the closed-loop control can compensate for system changes and disturbances and the effect of the wind disturbance is significant, the residuals obtained from a standard simulation model can be misleading. Instead, a sensor-to-sensor submodel of the quadcopter is selected to detect a change in the payload using the Instrumental Variables (IV) cost function. It is shown that the mass variation can be detected using the IV cost function in different flight scenarios.}

This paper introduces an automated spectral band analysis tool (BAT) based on Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for the spectral analysis of vegetation properties. The GPR-BAT procedure sequentially backwards removes the least contributing band in the regression model for a given variable until only one band is kept. GPR-BAT is implemented within the framework of the free ARTMO's MLRA (machine learning regression algorithms) toolbox, which is dedicated to the transforming of optical remote sensing images into biophysical products. GPR-BAT allows (1) to identify the most informative bands in relating spectral data to a biophysical variable, and (2) to find the least number of bands that preserve optimized accurate predictions. To illustrate its utility, two hyperspectral datasets were analyzed for most informative bands: (1) a field hyperspectral dataset (400–1100nm at 2nm resolution: 301 bands) with leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and green leaf area index (gLAI) collected for maize and soybean (Nebraska, US); and (2) an airborne HyMap dataset (430–2490nm: 125 bands) with LAI and canopy water content (CWC) collected for a variety of crops (Barrax, Spain). For each of these biophysical variables, optimized retrieval accuracies can be achieved with just 4 to 9 well-identified bands, and performance was largely improved over using all bands. A PROSAIL global sensitivity analysis was run to interpret the validity of these bands. Cross-validated RCV2 (NRMSECV) accuracies for optimized GPR models were 0.79 (12.9%) for LCC, 0.94 (7.2%) for gLAI, 0.95 (6.5%) for LAI and 0.95 (7.2%) for CWC. This study concludes that a wise band selection of hyperspectral data is strictly required for optimal vegetation properties mapping.}

Compared with operations, maintenance is a critical element in the levelized cost of energy, given the practical constraints imposed by offshore operations and the relatively high costs. The effects of maintenance on the life cycle of an offshore wind farm are highly complex and uncertain. The selection of maintenance strategies influences the overall efficiency, profit margin, safety, and sustainability of offshore wind farms. For an offshore wind project, after a maintenance strategy is selected, schedule planning will be considered, which is an optimization problem. Onsite maintenance will involve complex marine operations whose efficiency and safety depend on practical factors. Moreover, negative environmental impacts due to offshore maintenance deserve attention. To address these issues, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on OWT maintenance, covering strategy selection, schedule optimization, onsite operations, repair, assessment criteria, recycling, and environmental concerns. Many methods are summarized and compared. Limitations in the research and shortcomings in industrial development of OWT operations and maintenance are described.

The backstepping technique augmented by a robust adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is employed as the main control framework. Based on the horizontal dynamic model of the airship, an improved adaptive integral line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law is first proposed, which suits any parametric paths. The guidance law calculates the desired yaw angle and estimates the wind. Then the controller is extended to cope with the airship yaw tracking and velocity control by resorting to the augmented backstepping technique. The uncertainties of the dynamics are compensated by using the robust RBFNNs. Each robust RBFNN utilizes an nth-order smooth switching function to combine a conventional RBFNN with a robust control. The conventional RBFNN dominates in the neural active region, while the robust control retrieves the transient outside the active region, so that the stability range can be widened. Stability analysis shows that the controlled closed-loop system is globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.}

Private standards, on the contrary, are more concrete and applicable, but most of the times they are voluntary and reflect industry interests. The ‘better regulation’ approach of the EU may increase the use of evidence to inform policy and lawmaking, and the involvement of different stakeholders. Current hard-lawmaking instruments do not appear to take advantage of the knowledge produced by standard-based regulations, virtually wasting their potential benefits. This fact affects the legal certainty with regards to a fast-paced changing environment like robotics. In this paper, we investigate the challenges of overlapping public/private regulatory initiatives that govern robot technologies in general, and in the concrete of healthcare robot technologies. We wonder until what extent robotics should be governed only by standards. We also reflect on how public policymaking could increase their technical understanding of robot technology to devise an applicable and comprehensive framework for this technology. In this respect, we propose different ways to integrate the technical know-how into policymaking (e.g., collecting the data/knowledge generated from the impact assessments in shared data repositories, and using it for evidence-based policies) and to strengthen the legitimacy of standards.}

Two previous studies were conducted to respond to this gap, and a conceptual GI typology matrix was developed according to functional, structural and configurational attributes. The present research presents a streamlined version and tests its applicability for the automated mapping, classification and thermal evaluation of GI using remote sensing data. A combination of parameters is introduced, including surface cover fractions and FRAGSTATS metrics estimated from very high-resolution hyperspectral imagery, LiDAR and cadastral data. The proposed framework can be applied at different spatial scales to analyse large urban areas rapidly and with high spatial accuracy. This paper also proposes a replicable workflow that can be implemented by researchers and practitioners to map existing vegetation conditions, prioritise greening interventions and assess thermal conditions with greater confidence. In this study, this workflow was successfully applied at local scale to classify green open spaces, tree canopies and water bodies in the city of Sydney. Evidence presented here demonstrates the applicability of the proposed system to evaluate and compare the intra- and inter-typology variability of land surface temperatures (LSTs), which can be potentially applied for performance assessment across other ecosystem service categories. Despite satisfactory results, the proposed typology is contingent on further developments and tests on a larger spatial extent and with a greater number of observations. Further statistical analysis is also required to determine the cooling capacity of typologies and quantify the influence of measured parameters on LSTs.}

Reliable and robust monitoring practices can be used to improve and better understand catchment processes affecting the water quality. In recent years the deployment of long term in-situ sensors has increased the temporal and spatial data being obtained. Furthermore, the development and research into remote sensing using satellite and aerial imagery has been incrementally integrated into catchments for monitoring areas that previously might have been impossible to monitor, producing high-resolution data that has become imperative to catchment monitoring. The use of modelling in catchments has become relevant as it enables the prediction of events before they occur so that strategic plans can be put in place to deal with or prevent certain threats. This review highlights the monitoring approaches employed in catchments currently and examines the potential for integration of these methods. A framework might incorporate all monitoring strategies to obtain more information about a catchment and its water quality. The future of monitoring will involve satellite, in-situ and air borne devices with data analytics playing a key role in providing decision support tools. The review provides examples of successful use of individual technologies, some combined approaches and identifies gaps that should be filled to achieve an ideal catchment observation system.}

Prognostics deals with predicting the future behavior of engineering systems, and is affected by various sources of uncertainty. In order to facilitate meaningful prognostics-based decision-making, it is important to analyze how these sources of uncertainty affect prognostics, and thereby, compute the overall uncertainty in the remaining useful life prediction. This paper investigates the classical (frequentist) and subjective (Bayesian) interpretations of uncertainty and their implications on prognostics, and argues that the Bayesian interpretation of uncertainty is more suitable for condition-based prognostics and health monitoring. It is also demonstrated that uncertainty quantification in remaining useful life prediction needs to be approached as an uncertainty propagation problem. Several uncertainty propagation methods are discussed in this context, and the practical challenges involved in such uncertainty quantification are outlined.}

Such an approach to urban tree inventories means they are challenging to maintain and only capture information describing trees on accessible land. Whilst remote sensing approaches have shown the potential to derive individual tree attributes, these studies rarely make use of existing inventory information. In this study, we present a method to parameterise an algorithm for individual tree detection and delineation from airborne remote sensing data. The approach uses existing inventory data as training information firstly for the detection of the canopy area and secondly to parameterise a marker-based watershed segmentation algorithm. In this parameterisation, crown segmentation shape, as well as features derived from the remote sensing data, are used to determine if a segment contains one or more trees. If a segment contains more than one tree, it is split with the number of markers increased until each segment includes only one tree. The approach was evaluated within three distinct urban areas: the central business district, an urban park and a residential area, to be determined. Commission and omission errors ranged between 11% and 27% across the three regions, with commission typically caused by land covers on private land that were unaccounted for in the training processes. In all areas the overall tree count was within two per cent of that defined by reference information. The accurate tree count produced by this approach suggests it has the potential to be adopted by government agencies for routine tree inventory maintenance.}

The aim of the present study is to present and comparatively assess the various driver recording tools that researchers have at their disposal. Method: In order to achieve this aim, a multitude of published studies from the international literature have been examined based on the driver recording methodologies that have been implemented. An examination of more traditional survey methods (questionnaires, police reports, and direct observer methods) is initially conducted, followed by investigating issues pertinent to the use of driving simulators. Afterwards, an extensive section is provided for naturalistic driving data tools, including the utilization of on-board diagnostics (OBD) and in-vehicle data recorders (IVDRs). Lastly, in-depth incident analysis and the exploitation of smartphone data are discussed. Results: A critical synthesis of the results is conducted, providing the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing each tool and including additional knowledge regarding ease of experimental implementation, data handling issues, impacts on subsequent analyses, as well as the respective cost parameters. Conclusions: New technologies provide undeniably powerful tools that allow for seamless data handling, storage, and analysis, such as smartphones and in-vehicle data recorders. However, this sometimes comes at considerable costs (which may or may not pay off at a later stage), while legacy driver recording methods still have their own niches to fill in research. Practical Applications: The present research supports researchers when designing driver behavior monitoring studies. The present work enables better scheduling and pacing of research activities, but can also provide insights for the distribution of research funds.}

We develop two event-triggered functions to decide when to activate the control input in centralized and decentralized cases, respectively. Additionally, the infamous Zeno behavior can be excluded in the centralized case. Moreover, in the decentralized case, we simplify the event-triggered function by calculating the maximum and minimum of the corresponding parameters, so as to save memory of the systems.}

However, like most workflow systems, it coordinates the workflow centrally, and cannot run within more transient environments where nodes are mobile. To address this gap, we show how Node-RED workflows can be migrated into a decentralized execution environment for operation on mobile ad-hoc networks, and we demonstrate this by converting a Node-RED based traffic congestion detection workflow to operate in a decentralized environment. The approach uses a Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) to dynamically convert Node-Red applications into a compact semantic vector representation that encodes the service interfaces and the workflow in which they are embedded. By extending existing services interfaces, with a simple cognitive layer that can interpret and exchange the vectors, we show how the required services can be dynamically discovered and interconnected into the required workflow in a completely decentralized manner. The resulting system provides a convenient environment where the Node-RED front-end graphical composition tool can be used to orchestrate decentralized workflows. In this paper, we further extend this work by introducing a new dynamic VSA vector compression scheme that compresses vectors for on-the-wire communication, thereby reducing communication bandwidth while maintaining the semantic information content. This algorithm utilizes the holographic properties of the symbolic vectors to perform compression taking into consideration the number of combined vectors along with similarity bounds that determine conflict with other encoded vectors used in the same context. The resulting savings make this approach extremely efficient for discovery in service based decentralized workflows.}

To promote the development of dispersed wind power, this paper is devoted to obstacles identification and analysis to provide effective development proposals. Firstly, a three-stage process (namely collection, screening and improvement) is developed to extract common obstacles from literature and explore unique obstacles according to the characteristics and development status of dispersed wind power. Then, DANP method is improved to analyze interaction, interrelation and relative importance among filtered obstacles, where Pythagorean fuzzy numbers and K-Means clustering algorithm are introduced to modify incomplete information collection and arbitrary threshold determination, respectively. Three reasonable thresholds are determined according to clustering results, which divide the influence degree among obstacles into four categories (namely, high, moderate, low and no influence). The analysis results indicate that lagged unified planning ranks the first of obstacles, followed by financial difficulty and restricted grid access. On that basis, some practical proposals on regional coordinated development are suggested, including building unified coordination platforms and forming dispersed wind power project group. This paper does not only enrich material database for scholars, but also provide reference and guidance for government and related enterprises.}

In highly congested terrain, dynamic and static obstacles have a critical impact on IoD performance. One of the critical challenges in IoD missions is avoiding obstacles for successfully and safely completing their tasks. The limited flight time of a drone is another challenge. Thus, IoD has to be provided by an intelligent and accurate energy-efficient collision avoidance algorithm in which IoD paths are modified online to guarantee drones safety. This paper presents an energy-efficient strategy to avoid static and dynamic collisions with minimum energy required for drones to reach their destinations safely. We develop a novel algorithm to avoid multiple static and dynamic obstacles of different sizes within a limited detection range with energy consumption minimization. To do so, the gradient-based approach is utilized in the proposed algorithm for fast and quick convergence. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm allows drones to be in hovering or backtracking states; or they can fly vertically in other cases. More importantly, the results validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm in a dense environment that involves high collision risk with obstacle relative speed up to 10 meters/sec.}
