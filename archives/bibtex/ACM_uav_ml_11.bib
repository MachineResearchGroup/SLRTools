abstract = {The number of road accidents is increasing at a rapid pace which also affects the death rate that is proportional to the number of accidents occurring. This is a serious issue that has unfortunately become somewhat normalized due to how deeply embedded it is in the day-to-day lives of people, especially in developing countries. For any society to make significant progress, it is imperative to utilize our technical skills or otherwise to ensure personal safety before anything else. This includes reducing the time of response to an accident to the minimum, among other things. The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) based accident detection and response system is an attempt towards minimizing the rates of casualty and injuries occurring to both passengers and vehicles due to road accidents. The system is fully automated to be able to send emergency notifications to nearby hospital or fire station and an emergency contact in case of an accident. This is done via a combination of a vehicle device that has to be installed in the vehicle of the consumer and a remote server system that responds to the device accordingly. The motive is to provide the location of the vehicle and measure the severity of the accident so that help can be provided as fast as possible. From the data values collected from the sensors in the vehicle device prototype, we have tested the notification process successfully and also been able to assess the level of accident severity. We believe this system will reduce the response time of emergency responders and in the process improve both the traffic and health system of a society.},

abstract = {With use cases that range from external localisation of single robots or robotic swarms to self-localisation in marker-augmented environments and simplifying perception by tagging objects in a robot's surrounding, fiducial markers have a wide field of application in the robotic world. We propose a new family of circular markers which allow for both computationally efficient detection, tracking and identification and full 6D position estimation. At the core of the proposed approach lies the separation of the detection and identification steps, with the former using computationally efficient circular marker detection and the latter utilising an open-ended 'necklace encoding', allowing scalability to a large number of individual markers. While the proposed algorithm achieves similar accuracy to other state-of-the-art methods, its experimental evaluation in realistic conditions demonstrates that it can detect markers from larger distances while being up to two orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the art fiducial marker detection methods. In addition, the entire system is available as an open-source package at https://github.com/LCAS/whycon.},

abstract = {Multi Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning paths for agents to reach their targets from their start locations, such that the agents do not collide while executing the plan. In safety-critical systems, the plan is typically checked by a human supervisor, who decides on whether to allow its execution. In such cases, we wish to convince the human that the plan is indeed collision free.To this end, we propose an explanation scheme for MAPF, which bases explanations on simplicity of visual verification by human's cognitive process. The scheme decomposes a plan into segments such that within each segment, the paths of the agents are disjoint. Then, we can convince the supervisor that the plan is collision free using a small number of images (dubbed an explanation). In addition, we can measure the simplicity of a plan by the number of segments required for the decomposition. We study the complexity of algorithmic problems that arise by the explanation scheme, as well as the tradeoff between the length (makespan) of a plan and its minimal decomposition. We also provide experimental results of our scheme both in a continuous and in a discrete setting.},

The game is set in a retirement village, where elderly residents live in smart homes equipped with monitoring systems. These systems should raise alerts when adverse events happen, but they do not function perfectly (they may issue false alerts or miss true events). Players, who "work'' in the village, perform a primary task, whereby they must ensure the welfare of the residents by attending to adverse events in a timely manner, and a secondary routine task that demands their attention. Our contributions are (1) the game itself, which supports experimentation with various trust-related factors; (2) a methodology for the calibration of the game's parameters; (3) insights from two experiments regarding the relationship between device performance, in particular error type, and trust and user behaviour; and (4) insights from predictive models about factors that influence trust and aspects of user behaviour.},

abstract = {While NSF's recent Campus Cyberinfrastructure investments have catalyzed an enormous leap in campus networking capabilities, it remains necessary to integrate these capabilities into the routine workflows of researchers transferring data among their remote collaborators, data repositories, and visualization facilities. The Pacific Research Platform (PRP) is a program to develop a science-driven, data-centric "freeway system" by federating campus Science DMZs into a regional Science DMZ. Research collaborations across PRP partners serve as use cases for deploying the hardware/software and addressing security/policy/social issues to achieve high-performance data transfers between researchers. The regional PRP represents a manageable scale for initial deployment efforts and capturing lessons learned, but the PRP also informs national deployments --i.e., an eventual National Research Platform (NRP). The recent First NRP Workshop included many campuses and networking organizations and addressed scientific requirements, scaling approaches, and socio-technical issues to extend the PRP to a national level; a second NRP Workshop will be held in August 2018. In this paper, we describe efforts to build the PRP, the social and technical approaches, the domain science applications of PRP's capabilities, and results of the recent NRP workshop.},

It takes as input a test suite and a modified parser for the grammar that can collect grammar spectra, i.e., the sets of rules used in attempts to parse the individual test cases, and returns as output a ranked list of suspicious rules. We show how grammar spectra can be collected for both LL and LR parsers, and how the ANTLR and CUP parser generators can be modified and used to automate the collection of the grammar spectra. We evaluate our method over grammars with seeded faults as well as real world grammars and student grammars submitted in compiler engineering courses that contain real faults. The results show that our method ranks the seeded faults within the top five rules in more than half of the cases and can pinpoint them in 10%–40% of the cases. On average, it ranks the faults at around 25% of all rules, and better than 15% for a very large test suite. It also allowed us to identify deviations and faults in the real world and student grammars.},

abstract = {In acoustic array processing, beamforming is a class of algorithms commonly used to estimate the position of a radiating sound source. This paper presents a diagonal unloading DU transformation method for the conventional response power beamforming to achieve robust localization with low computational complexity. The transformation is obtained by subtracting an opportune diagonal matrix from the covariance matrix of the array output vector. Specifically, the DU beamformer aims at subtracting the signal subspace from the noisy signal space. It is, hence, a data-dependent covariance matrix conditioning method. We show how to calculate precisely the unloading parameters, and we present a comparison of the proposed DU beamforming, the robust minimum variance distortionless response MVDR filter, and the multiple signal classification MUSIC method, in terms of their respective eigenanalyses. Theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on both simulated and real acoustic data demonstrate that the DU beamformer localization performance is comparable to that of robust MVDR and MUSIC. Since its computational cost is equivalent to that of a conventional beamformer, the proposed DU beamformer method can, thus, be very attractive due to its effectiveness and computational efficiency.},

abstract = {Multitasking has become an integral part of work environments, even though people are not well-equipped cognitively to handle numerous concurrent tasks effectively. Systems that support such multitasking may produce better performance and less frustration. However, without understanding the user's internal processes, it is difficult to determine optimal strategies for adapting interfaces, since all multitasking activity is not identical. We describe two experiments leading toward a system that detects cognitive multitasking processes and uses this information as input to an adaptive interface. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy sensors, we differentiate four cognitive multitasking processes. These states cannot readily be distinguished using behavioral measures such as response time, accuracy, keystrokes or screen contents. We then present our human-robot system as a proof-of-concept that uses real-time cognitive state information as input and adapts in response. This prototype system serves as a platform to study interfaces that enable better task switching, interruption management, and multitasking.},

abstract = {Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (sCPS) are a novel kind of Cyber- Physical Systems engineered to take advantage of large-scale cooperation between devices, users and environment to achieve added value in face of uncertainty and various situations in their environment. Examples of sCPS include modern traffic systems, Industry 4.0 systems, systems for smart-buildings, smart energy grids, etc. The uniting aspect of all these systems is that to achieve their high-level of intelligence, adaptivity and ability to optimize and learn, they heavily rely on software. This makes them software-intensive systems, where software becomes their most complex part. Engineering sCPS thus becomes a recognized software engineering discipline, which however, due to specifics of sCPS, can only partially rely on the existing body of knowledge in software engineering. In fact, it turns out that many of the traditional approaches to architecture modeling and software development fail to cope with the high dynamicity and uncertainty of sCPS. This calls for innovative approaches that jointly reflect and address the specifics of such systems. This paper maps the discussions and results of the Third International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (SEsCPS 2017), which specifically focuses on challenges and promising solutions in the area of software engineering for sCPS.},

abstract = {Recent projections by the United Nations show that the food production needs to double by 2050 in order to meet the nutrition demand of the world's growing population. A key enabler of this growth are smallholder family farms, that form the backbone of agricultural (AG) production worldwide. To meet this increasing demand, smallholder farms need to implement critical advances in task management and coordination, crop and livestock monitoring and efficient farming practices. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) will play a critical role in these advances by providing integrated and affordable cyber-physical systems (CPS) that can longitudinally measure, analyze and control AG operations. In this paper we make headway towards the design and integration of such AG-CPS. We begin by characterizing the information and communication technology demand of smallholder agriculture based on traffic analysis of farm Internet use. Our findings inform the design and integration of an end-to-end AG-CPS called FarmNET that provides (i) robust control mechanisms for multi-sensor AG data collection and fusion, (ii) wide-area, heterogeneous wireless networks for ubiquitous farm connectivity, (iii) algorithms and models for farm data analytics that produce actionable information from the collected agricultural data, and (iv) control mechanisms for autonomous, proactive farming.},

abstract = {In the aftermath of earthquakes, floods, and other disasters, photos are increasingly playing more significant roles, such as finding missing people and assessing disasters, in rescue and recovery efforts. These disaster photos are taken in real time by the crowd, unmanned aerial vehicles, and wireless sensors. However, communications equipment is often damaged in disasters, and the very limited communication bandwidth restricts the upload of photos to the cloud center, seriously impeding disaster rescue endeavors. Based on edge computing, we propose Echo, a highly time-efficient disaster rescue framework. By utilizing the computing, storage, and communication abilities of edge servers, disaster photos are preprocessed and analyzed in real time, and more specific visuals are immensely helpful for conducting emergency response and rescue. This article takes the search for missing people as a case study to show that Echo can be more advantageous in terms of disaster rescue. To greatly conserve valuable communication bandwidth, only significantly associated images are extracted and uploaded to the cloud center for subsequent facial recognition. Furthermore, an adaptive photo detector is designed to utilize the precious and unstable communication bandwidth effectively, as well as ensure the photo detection precision and recall rate. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by simulation experiments.},

abstract = {Distributed Adaptive Real-Time (DART) systems are interconnected and collaborating systems that continuously must satisfy guaranteed and highly critical requirements (e.g., collision avoidance), while at the same time adapt, smartly, to achieve best-effort and low-critical application requirements (e.g., protection coverage) when operating in dynamic and uncertain environments. This short paper introduces our architecture and approach to engineering a DART system so that we achieve high assurance in its runtime behavior against a set of formally specified requirements. It describes our technique to: (i) ensure asymmetric timing protection between high- and low-critical threads on each node in the DART system, and (ii) verify that the self-adaptation within, and coordination between, the nodes and their interaction with the physical environment do not violate high and low criticality requirements. We present our ongoing research to integrate advances in model-based engineering with compositional analysis techniques to formally verify safety-critical properties demanded in safety-conscious domains such as aviation and automotive; and introduce our DART model problem to demonstrate of our engineering approach.},

abstract = {In this article, we first characterize register operand value locality in shader programs of modern gaming applications and observe that there is a high likelihood of one of the register operands of several multiply, logical-and, and similar operations being zero, dynamically. We provide intuition, examples, and a quantitative characterization for how zeros originate dynamically in these programs. Next, we show that this dynamic behavior can be gainfully exploited with a profile-guided code optimization called Zeroploit that transforms targeted code regions into a zero-(value-)specialized fast path and a default slow path. The fast path benefits from zero-specialization in two ways, namely: (a) the backward slice of the other operand of a given multiply or logical-and can be skipped dynamically, provided the only use of that other operand is in the given instruction, and (b) the forward slice of instructions originating at the given instruction can be zero-specialized, potentially triggering further backward slice specializations from operations of that forward slice as well. Such specialization helps the fast path avoid redundant dynamic computations as well as memory fetches, while the fast-slow versioning transform helps preserve functional correctness. With an offline value profiler and manually optimized shader programs, we demonstrate that Zeroploit is able to achieve an average speedup of 35.8% for targeted shader programs, amounting to an average frame-rate speedup of 2.8% across a collection of modern gaming applications on an NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 2080 GPU.},

abstract = {Extreme events such as urban floods are dynamic in nature, i.e. they evolve with time. The spatiotemporal analysis of such disastrous events is important for understanding the resiliency of an urban system during these events. Remote Sensing (RS) data is one of the crucial earth observation (EO) data sources that can facilitate such spatiotemporal analysis due to its wide spatial coverage and high temporal availability. In this paper, we propose a discrete mereotopology (DM) based approach to enable representation and querying of spatiotemporal information from a series of multitemporal RS images that are acquired during a flood disaster event. We represent this spatiotemporal information using a semantic model called Dynamic Flood Ontology (DFO). To establish the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach, spatiotemporal queries relevant during an urban flood scenario such as, show me road segments that were partially flooded during the time interval t1 have been demonstrated with promising results.},

abstract = {Data mining tools have been around for several decades, but the term "big data" has only recently captured widespread attention. Numerous success stories have been promulgated as organizations have sifted through massive volumes of data to find interesting patterns that are, in turn, transformed into actionable information. Yet a key drawback to the big data paradigm is that it relies on observational data, limiting the types of insights that can be gained. The simulation world is different. A "data farming" metaphor captures the notion of purposeful data generation from simulation models. Large-scale experiments let us grow the simulation output efficiently and effectively. We can use modern statistical and visual analytic methods to explore massive input spaces, uncover interesting features of complex simulation response surfaces, and explicitly identify cause-and-effect relationships. With this new mindset, we can achieve tremendous leaps in the breadth, depth, and timeliness of the insights yielded by simulation.},

abstract = {The rural US includes 72% of the nation's land and 46 million people, and it serves as major sources of food and energy for the nation. Thus rural prosperity is essential to US wellbeing. As a foundation for next-generation rural economy and communities, broadband connectivity is a key driver of rural prosperity. Yet 39% of the rural US lacks broadband access, and most agriculture (ag) farms are not connected at all. To address the rural broadband challenge, we will develop the ARA rural wireless living lab. ARA will not only serve as a first-of-its-kind, real-world wireless experimental infrastructure for smart and connected rural communities, it will also provide the living lab processes, activities, and organizations to engage the broad wireless and application communities in the research, education, innovation, and pilot of affordable, high-capacity rural broadband solutions. Through this visioning article, we illustrate the community, application, economic, and operational contexts of rural wireless, the design of ARA, ARA-enabled research, and how ARA is expected to make rural broadband as affordable as urban broadband today. This article is also a call-to-action for the broad wireless and application communities to participate in the ARA living lab activities and to join the ARA Consortium of public-private partners in shaping the future of advanced wireless, rural broadband, and rural communities in general.},

This work evaluates two wearable interfaces of augmented reality as HCI alternatives to assist the drone pilot in the inspection. The goal is to validate the platforms for visualization of the images of the industrial environment.

abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on embedded devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks). Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We address several challenges in reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program, including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if physical events and eFSA's state transitions are inconsistent. We evaluate our prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s~0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking.},

abstract = {Dynamic data-driven applications such as object tracking, surveillance, and other sensing and decision applications are largely dependent on the characteristics of the data streams on which they operate. The underlying models and algorithms of data-driven applications must continually adapt at runtime to changes in data quality and availability to meet both functional and designer-specified performance requirements. Given the dynamic nature of these applications, point solutions produced by traditional design tools cannot be expected to perform adequately across varying execution scenarios. Additionally, the increasing diversity and interdependence of application requirements complicates the design and optimization process. To assist designers of data-driven applications, we present a modeling and optimization framework that enables developers to model an application's data sources, tasks, and exchanged data tokens; specify application requirements through high-level design metrics and fuzzy logic--based optimization rules; and define an estimation framework to automatically optimize the application at runtime. We demonstrate the modeling and optimization process via an example application for video-based vehicle tracking and collision avoidance. We analyze the benefits of runtime optimization by comparing the performance of static point solutions to dynamic solutions over five distinct execution scenarios, showing improvements of up to 74% for dynamic over static configurations. Further, we show the benefits of using fuzzy logic--based rules over traditional weighted functions for the specification and evaluation of competing high-level metrics in optimization.},

abstract = {Buildings can improve their energy efficiency through retrofitting and thus decrease energy demand throughout the life of the building. However, evaluating building retrofit opportunities at a city level is a significant challenge. This requires identifying where in the city the biggest energy efficiency gains can be made and in the most cost-effective way. A surveyor is typically relied upon to manually assess a building for insulation absence, defective installation, thermal leakage and other similar issues. To perform these inspections across whole cities would be prohibitively time intensive. There is therefore a need for a faster approach to detect and prioritise a city's retrofit requirements so that effective value for money decisions can be made. In this paper, the concept design of a vehicle mounted integrated sensing platform to collect high resolution visual, thermal and 3D scene data of the built environment at a city scale is presented. Initial design considerations are first explored before an initial concept design is presented and evaluated. From the evaluation, a number of concerns about the design were raised. Based on these findings, a significantly revised concept design is subsequently presented that addresses the aforementioned issues.},

abstract = {Visible light positioning, or VLP, has emerged as a low-cost approach to enabling a variety of indoor location-based services for indoor smart spaces. However, a survey of existing approaches to VLP reveals some challenges in comparing one system to another.Advances in key areas are expected to enable new levels of performance at low cost. These include innovations at the source (LEDs, Laser Diodes/LIDAR, and ToF sensors), at the receiver (diversity receivers and AoA sensors), and in the design of the overall end-to-end VLP system. Again, comparing these improvements from one system to the another is difficult due to varying assumptions and operating conditions.In this paper we classify VLP techniques in an attempt to reconcile the wide range of characteristics. We also propose a new concept called an active zone in recognition that best performance is needed primarily in a subset of the volume of an indoor space. Finally, we show the performance of a baseline VLP system under the new metric and conclude with how our Visible Light Communication (VLC) testbed can be used to verify and quantify the region we call the active zone.},

Unlike today's deployments, which are mainly restricted to lab settings and highly controlled high-value applications, future smart camera networks will be messy and unpredictable. They will operate on a vast scale, drawing on mobile resources connected in networks structured in complex and changing ways. They will comprise heterogeneous and decentralised aggregations of visual sensors, which will come together in temporary alliances, in unforeseen and rapidly unfolding scenarios. The potential to include and harness citizen-contributed mobile streaming, body-worn video, and robot-mounted cameras, alongside more traditional fixed or PTZ cameras, and supported by other non-visual sensors, leads to a number of difficult and important challenges. In this position paper, we discuss a variety of potential uses for such complex smart camera networks, and some of the challenges that arise when staying smart in the presence of such complexity. We present a general discussion on the challenges of heterogeneity, coordination, self-reconfigurability, mobility, and collaboration in camera networks.},

abstract = {Network location is one of the critical issues and a challenge in wireless sensor and ad hoc networks, in particular when networks are sparse. However, even in highly sparse networks, there exist well-connected subgraphs while the distribution of the networks is random. This paper introduces weighted component stitching WCS to find redundantly rigid components with high redundant ratios, which can be used to generate reliable local realization. Finding and ranking the redundantly rigid components is an NP-hard problem a reduction from maximum quasi-clique. Here, we introduce a series of theorems and algorithms to carry out WCS efficiently. More precisely, we prove that each graph has a determinant number of redundantly rigid components, each redundantly rigid component is covered by a set of basic redundant components BRCs, and each BRC contains one redundant edge. We apply constraints to merge the BRCs to form components with higher redundancy ratio and develop a greedy algorithm to merge BRCs to form locally mostly redundant components LMRCs. Finally, we give the approximation ratio. The local coordinates of nodes are calculated by optimization in each LMRC and are synchronized with weights to produce the global coordinates of nodes in the network to overcome the sparseness of subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy 45%–64% using our WCS method over the state-of-the-art algorithms under various settings of network sparseness and ranging noises.},

To solve this problem, in this paper, we present an RGB channels scenario sensing method and a sensor group selection mechanism based on this method. RGB channels scenario sensing method can detect different scenarios by analyzing the value of RGB channels of images obtained by sensors. By using RGB channels method, this mechanism can automatically activate appropriate sensor groups for current environment. To verify the expandability and validity of our method and mechanism, we build a prototype system based on the mechanism. This system can choose appropriate sensor groups effectively according to the composite changes of two conditions: illumination intensity and scene type (indoor or outdoor). We run this prototype system in a TurtleBot robot equipped with a Kinect sensor and RPLIDAR (light detection and ranging). The results of the experiments show that the proposed method and mechanism can active corresponding sensor groups according to the results of the scene detection module. This method and mechanism offers an effective solution to the aforementioned problem and improve the efficiency and robustness when robots work in different scenarios.},

However, transportation professionals face difficulties in performing the daunting tasks of calibrating a model for each transportation network design to satisfy the targeted traffic flow demand, especially during data collection and distillation. Our innovative approach utilizes sensor and geography networking technology to seamlessly collect data about real world network, traffic, and driver behavior. This data is then distilled as needed by data mining before feeding the data to a simulation model. The data is validated automatically to instantaneously reflect the real world and to avoid typographical errors often involved with human intervention, resulting in a more accurate model.We conduct a feasibility study for our vision of model calibration automation. The research flexes multidisciplinary expertise in traffic flow simulation, geosciences, sensing/networking, and knowledge discovery. As a proof of concept, we implement a prototype that demonstrates how to convert sensor data about traffic flow collected by a state department of transportation into a format taken by CORSIM, a popular traffic simulation model. A running example shows encouraging results.},

abstract = {Software is becoming more complex as it needs to deal with an increasing number of aspects in volatile environments. This complexity may cause behaviors that violate the imposed constraints. A goal of runtime service monitoring is to determine whether the service behaves as intended to potentially allow the correction of the behavior. It may be set up in advance the infrastructure to allow the detections of suspicious situations. However, there may also be unexpected situations to look for as they only become evident during data stream monitoring at runtime produced by te system. The access to historic data may be key to detect relevant situations in the monitoring infrastructure. Available technologies used for monitoring offer different trade-offs, e.g. in cost and flexibility to store historic information. For instance, Temporal Graphs (TGs) can store the long-term history of an evolving system for future querying, at the expense of disk space and processing time. In contrast, Complex Event Processing (CEP) can quickly react to incoming situations efficiently, as long as the appropriate event patterns have been set up in advance. This paper presents an architecture that integrates CEP and TGs for service monitoring through the data stream produced at runtime by a system. The pros and cons of the proposed architecture for extracting and treating the monitored data are analyzed. The approach is applied on the monitoring of Quality of Service (QoS) of a data-management network case study. It is demonstrated how the architecture provides rapid detection of issues, as well as the ability to access to historical data about the state of the system to allow for a comprehensive monitoring solution.},

abstract = {The ocean is a huge saltwater body that is different from terrestrial environments in terms of deployment circumstance, weather conditions, and user distributions. Therefore, it is difficult to apply terrestrial networking technologies directly in oceans. The cost-effectiveness of satellites is still an issue to be addressed to increase their popularity due to their high cost in construction, launching, and maintenance and high deployment risks. Such situations stimulate many research efforts on networking technologies in the ocean space consisting of coastline, water surface, sky, and underwater. This article conducts a comprehensive survey on the related issues through reviewing the networking environments and communication networks already operating in the ocean space as well as ongoing R8D activities and results reported in the literature. These systems include coastal networks, water surface networks, sky networks, and underwater networks, which are reviewed and discussed along with summaries on the related topics and research issues necessary for further studies. This article, taking into account maritime communication networks and underwater networking together, aims to provide the reader with an overview on the state of the art and corresponding challenging issues for networking in the ocean space.},

abstract = {For outdoor navigation, GPS provides the most widely-used means of node localization; however, the level of accuracy provided by low-cost receivers is typically insufficient for use in high-precision applications. Additionally, many of these applications do not require precise absolute Earth coordinates, but rather rely on relative positioning to infer information about the geometric configuration of the constituent nodes in a system. This paper presents a novel approach that uses GPS to derive relative location information for a scalable network of single-frequency receivers. Networked nodes share their raw satellite observations, enabling each node to localize its neighbors in a pairwise fashion as opposed to computing its own standalone position. Random and systematic errors are mitigated in novel ways, challenging long-standing beliefs that precision GPS systems require extensive stationary calibration times or complex equipment configurations. In addition to presenting the mathematical basis for our technique, a working prototype is developed, enabling experimental evaluation of several real-world test scenarios. The results of these experiments indicate sub-meter relative positioning accuracy under various conditions and in varying environments. This represents up to order of magnitude increase in precision over existing absolute positioning techniques or other unimodal GPS-based solutions.},

abstract = {Motivated by the extensive documented disparate harms of artificial intelligence (AI), many recent practitioner-facing reflective tools have been created to promote responsible AI development. However, the use of such tools internally by technology development firms addresses responsible AI as an issue of closed-door compliance rather than a matter of public concern. Recent advocate and activist efforts intervene in AI as a public policy problem, inciting a growing number of cities to pass bans or other ordinances on AI and surveillance technologies. In support of this broader ecology of political actors, we present a set of reflective tools intended to increase public participation in technology advocacy for AI policy action. To this end, the Algorithmic Equity Toolkit (the AEKit) provides a practical policy-facing definition of AI, a flowchart for assessing technologies against that definition, a worksheet for decomposing AI systems into constituent parts, and a list of probing questions that can be posed to vendors, policy-makers, or government agencies. The AEKit carries an action-orientation towards political encounters between community groups in the public and their representatives, opening up the work of AI reflection and remediation to multiple points of intervention. Unlike current reflective tools available to practitioners, our toolkit carries with it a politics of community participation and activism.},

Our participants were armed with significant experience and qualifications – pertinent to both drone operations and a set of applications covering diverse industries. Our findings have resulted in design recommendations that should inform both ends and means of human-drone interaction research.

As such, the design of interaction mechanisms that enable users to understand the operation of autonomous systems and flexibly delegate or regain control is an open challenge for HCI. Against this background, in this paper we report on a lab study designed to investigate whether displaying the confidence of an autonomous system about the quality of its work, which we call its confidence information, can improve user acceptance and interaction with autonomous systems. The results demonstrate that confidence information encourages the usage of the autonomous system we tested, compared to a situation where such information is not available. Furthermore, an additional contribution of our work is the method we employ to study users' incentives to do work in collaboration with the autonomous system. In experiments comparing different incentive strategies, our results indicate that our translation of behavioural economics research methods to HCI can support the study of interactions with autonomous systems in the lab.},

abstract = {Self-adaptive systems often employ dynamic programming or similar techniques to select optimal adaptations at run-time. These techniques suffer from the "curse of dimensionality", increasing the cost of run-time adaptation decisions. We propose a novel approach that improves upon the state-of-the-art proactive self-adaptation techniques to reduce the number of possible adaptations that need be considered for each run-time adaptation decision. The approach, realized in a tool called Thallium, employs a combination of automated formal modeling techniques to (i) analyze a structural model of the system showing which configurations are reachable from other configurations and (ii) compute the utility that can be generated by the optimal adaptation over a bounded horizon in both the best- and worst-case scenarios. It then constructs triangular possibility values using those optimized bounds to automatically compare adjacent adaptations for each configuration, keeping only the alternatives with the best range of potential results. The experimental results corroborate Thallium's ability to significantly reduce the number of states that need to be considered with each adaptation decision, freeing up vital resources at run-time.},

abstract = {Software-defined networks offer flexible and intelligent network operations by splitting a traditional network into a centralized control plane and a programmable data plane. The controller in the control plane is the fundamental element used to manage all operations of the data plane. Hence, the performance and capabilities of the controller itself are essential in achieving optimal performance. Furthermore, the tools used to benchmark their performance must be accurate and useful in measuring different evaluation parameters. There are dozens of controller proposals for general and specialized networks in the literature. However, there is a very limited comprehensive quantitative analysis for them. In this article, we present a comprehensive qualitative comparison of different SDN controllers, along with a quantitative analysis of their performance in different network scenarios. We categorize and classify 34 controllers and present a qualitative comparison. We also present a comparative analysis of controllers for specialized networks such as the Internet of Things, blockchain networks, vehicular networks, and wireless sensor networks. We also discuss in-depth capabilities of benchmarking tools and provide a comparative analysis of their capabilities. This work uses three benchmarking tools to compare 9 controllers and presents a detailed analysis of their performance, along with discussion on performance of specialized network controllers.},

Introducing the concept of machine sensibility, we characterize our findings around: i) assessing printability, ii) monitoring and intervening and iii) reading the prints. We use the term machine to highlight the importance of understanding the materiality of the 3D printer, and sensibility, to address critical interactions and abilities that surfaced in studying this practice.

abstract = {Robotic vehicles (RVs), such as drones and ground rovers, are a type of cyber-physical systems that operate in the physical world under the control of computing components in the cyber world. Despite RVs' robustness against natural disturbances, cyber or physical attacks against RVs may lead to physical malfunction and subsequently disruption or failure of the vehicles' missions. To avoid or mitigate such consequences, it is essential to develop attack detection techniques for RVs. In this paper, we present a novel attack detection framework to identify external, physical attacks against RVs on the fly by deriving and monitoring Control Invariants (CI). More specifically, we propose a method to extract such invariants by jointly modeling a vehicle's physical properties, its control algorithm and the laws of physics. These invariants are represented in a state-space form, which can then be implemented and inserted into the vehicle's control program binary for runtime invariant check. We apply our CI framework to eleven RVs, including quadrotor, hexarotor, and ground rover, and show that the invariant check can detect three common types of physical attacks -- including sensor attack, actuation signal attack, and parameter attack -- with very low runtime overhead.},

abstract = {Along the trend pushing computation from the network core to the edge where the most of data are generated, edge computing has shown its potential in reducing response time, lowering bandwidth usage, improving energy efficiency and so on. At the same time, low-latency video analytics is becoming more and more important for applications in public safety, counter-terrorism, self-driving cars, VR/AR, etc. As those tasks are either computation intensive or bandwidth hungry, edge computing fits in well here with its ability to flexibly utilize computation and bandwidth from and between each layer. In this paper, we present LAVEA, a system built on top of an edge computing platform, which offloads computation between clients and edge nodes, collaborates nearby edge nodes, to provide low-latency video analytics at places closer to the users. We have utilized an edge-first design and formulated an optimization problem for offloading task selection and prioritized offloading requests received at the edge node to minimize the response time. In case of a saturating workload on the front edge node, we have designed and compared various task placement schemes that are tailed for inter-edge collaboration. We have implemented and evaluated our system. Our results reveal that the client-edge configuration has a speedup ranging from 1.3x to 4x (1.2x to 1.7x) against running in local (client-cloud configuration). The proposed shortest scheduling latency first scheme outputs the best overall task placement performance for inter-edge collaboration.},

abstract = {The deployment of a wireless sensor network (WSN) is crucial to its reliability and performance. Yet, node placement is typically determined in-field via effort-demanding trial-and-error procedures, because existing approaches over-simplify the radio environment; this especially holds for forests, the focus of this article, where trees greatly affect communication.We present LaPS (<underline>L</underline>iDAR-assisted <underline>P</underline>lacement for wireless <underline>S</underline>ensor networks), an approach exploiting remote sensing to identify the best node placement automatically and prior to deployment. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquired for the target forest are automatically processed to estimate its properties (e.g., tree position and diameter) that, once incorporated into a specialized path loss model, enable per-link estimates of the radio signal attenuation induced by trees. Finally, a genetic algorithm explores placement options by evolving toward a (sub-)optimal solution while satisfying the user’s spatial and network requirements, whose formulation is very flexible and broadly applicable.Our experiments, focused on a real forest, confirm that LaPS yields topologies of significantly higher quality w.r.t. approaches using a regular placement or a standard path loss model. Further, the ability to quickly explore the impact that changes in user requirements have on topology is invaluable to improve the operation of WSNs and reduce the effort of their in-field deployment.},
