ABSTRACT = {Facial recognition (FR) in unconstrained weather is still challenging and surprisingly ignored by many researchers and practitioners over the past few decades. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the performance of three existing popular facial recognition methods considering different weather conditions. As a result, a new face dataset (Lamar University database (LUDB)) was developed that contains face images captured under various weather conditions such as foggy, cloudy, rainy, and sunny. Three very popular FR methods—Eigenface (EF), Fisherface (FF), and Local binary pattern histogram (LBPH)—were evaluated considering two other face datasets, AT&amp;T and 5_Celebrity, along with LUDB in term of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score with 95% confidence interval (CI). Computational results show a significant difference among the three FR techniques in terms of overall time complexity and accuracy. LBPH outperforms the other two FR algorithms on both LUDB and 5_Celebrity datasets by achieving 40% and 95% accuracy, respectively. On the other hand, with minimum execution time of 1.37, 1.37, and 1.44 s per image on AT&amp;T,5_Celebrity, and LUDB, respectively, Fisherface achieved the best result.},

ABSTRACT = {This study was conducted to develop robot prototypes of three models that navigate mallards to achieve high-efficiency rice-duck farming. We examined two robotics navigation approaches based on imprinting and feeding. As the first approach, we used imprinting applied to baby mallards. They exhibited follow behavior to our first prototype after imprinting. Experimentally obtained observation results revealed the importance of providing imprinting immediately up to one week after hatching. As another approach, we used feed placed on the top of our second prototype. Experimentally obtained results showed that adult mallards exhibited wariness not only against the robot, but also against the feeder. After relieving wariness with provision of more than one week time to become accustomed, adult mallards ate feed in the box on the robot. However, they ran away immediately at a slight movement. Based on this confirmation, we developed the third prototype as an autonomous mobile robot aimed for mallard navigation in a paddy field. The body width is less than the length between rice stalks. After checking the waterproof capability of a body waterproof box, we conducted an indoor driving test for manual operation. Moreover, we conducted outdoor evaluation tests to assess running on an actual paddy field. We developed indoor and outdoor image datasets using an onboard monocular camera. For the outdoor image datasets, our segmentation method based on SegNet achieved semantic segmentation for three semantic categories. For the indoor image datasets, our prediction method based on CNN and LSTM achieved visual prediction for three motion categories.},

ABSTRACT = {Path planning algorithms are of paramount importance in guidance and collision systems to provide trustworthiness and safety for operations of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Previous works showed different approaches mostly focusing on shortest path discovery without a sufficient consideration on local planning and collision avoidance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid path planning algorithm that uses an anytime graph-based path planning algorithm for global planning and deep reinforcement learning for local planning which applied for a real-time mission planning system of an autonomous UAV. In particular, we aim to achieve a highly autonomous UAV mission planning system that is adaptive to real-world environments consisting of both static and moving obstacles for collision avoidance capabilities. To achieve adaptive behavior for real-world problems, a simulator is required that can imitate real environments for learning. For this reason, the simulator must be sufficiently flexible to allow the UAV to learn about the environment and to adapt to real-world conditions. In our scheme, the UAV first learns about the environment via a simulator, and only then is it applied to the real-world. The proposed system is divided into two main parts: optimal flight path generation and collision avoidance. A hybrid path planning approach is developed by combining a graph-based path planning algorithm with a learning-based algorithm for local planning to allow the UAV to avoid a collision in real time. The global path planning problem is solved in the first stage using a novel anytime incremental search algorithm called improved Anytime Dynamic A* (iADA*). A reinforcement learning method is used to carry out local planning between waypoints, to avoid any obstacles within the environment. The developed hybrid path planning system was investigated and validated in an AirSim environment. A number of different simulations and experiments were performed using AirSim platform in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system for an autonomous UAV. This study helps expand the existing research area in designing efficient and safe path planning algorithms for UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {Meeting food demand for the growing population will require an increase to crop production despite climate changes and, more particularly, severe drought episodes. Sorghum is one of the cereals most adapted to drought that feed millions of people around the world. Valorizing its genetic diversity for crop improvement can benefit from extensive phenotyping. The current methods to evaluate plant biomass, leaves area and plants height involve destructive sampling and are not practical in breeding. Phenotyping relying on drone based imagery is a powerful approach in this context. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a high throughput field phenotyping method of sorghum growth traits under contrasted water conditions relying on drone based imagery. Experiments were conducted in Bambey (Senegal) in 2018 and 2019, to test the ability of multi-spectral sensing technologies on-board a UAV platform to calculate various vegetation indices to estimate plants characteristics. In total, ten (10) contrasted varieties of West African sorghum collection were selected and arranged in a randomized complete block design with three (3) replicates and two (2) water treatments (well-watered and drought stress). This study focused on plant biomass, leaf area index (LAI) and the plant height that were measured weekly from emergence to maturity. Drone flights were performed just before each destructive sampling and images were taken by multi-spectral and visible cameras. UAV-derived vegetation indices exhibited their capacity of estimating LAI and biomass in the 2018 calibration data set, in particular: normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), corrected transformed vegetation index (CTVI), seconded modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI2), green normalize difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and simple ratio (SR) (r2 of 0.8 and 0.6 for LAI and biomass, respectively). Developed models were validated with 2019 data, showing a good performance (r2 of 0.92 and 0.91 for LAI and biomass accordingly). Results were also promising regarding plant height estimation (RMSE = 9.88 cm). Regression plots between the image-based estimation and the measured plant height showed a r2 of 0.83. The validation results were similar between water treatments. This study is the first successful application of drone based imagery for phenotyping sorghum growth and development in a West African context characterized by severe drought occurrence. The developed approach could be used as a decision support tool for breeding programs and as a tool to increase the throughput of sorghum genetic diversity characterization for adaptive traits.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial systems (UAVs) are dramatically evolving and promoting several civil applications. However, they are still prone to many security issues that threaten public safety. Security becomes even more challenging when they are connected to the Internet as their data stream is exposed to attacks. Unmanned traffic management (UTM) represents one of the most important topics for small unmanned aerial systems for beyond-line-of-sight operations in controlled low-altitude airspace. However, without securing the flight path exchanges between drones and ground stations or control centers, serious security threats may lead to disastrous situations. For example, a predefined flight path could be easily altered to make the drone perform illegal operations. Motivated by these facts, this paper discusses the security issues for UTM’s components and addresses the security requirements for such systems. Moreover, we propose UTM-Chain, a lightweight blockchain-based security solution using hyperledger fabric for UTM of low-altitude UAVs which fits the computational and storage resources limitations of UAVs. Moreover, UTM-Chain provides secure and unalterable traffic data between the UAVs and their ground control stations. The performance of the proposed system related to transaction latency and resource utilization is analyzed by using cAdvisor. Finally, the analysis of security aspects demonstrates that the proposed UTM-Chain scheme is feasible and extensible for the secure sharing of UAV data.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid development of digital technology, bird images have become an important part of ornithology research data. However, due to the rapid growth of bird image data, it has become a major challenge to effectively process such a large amount of data. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown great potential and effectiveness in a variety of tasks regarding the automatic processing of bird images. However, no research has been conducted on the recognition of habitat elements in bird images, which is of great help when extracting habitat information from bird images. Here, we demonstrate the recognition of habitat elements using four DCNN models trained end-to-end directly based on images. To carry out this research, an image database called Habitat Elements of Bird Images (HEOBs-10) and composed of 10 categories of habitat elements was built, making future benchmarks and evaluations possible. Experiments showed that good results can be obtained by all the tested models. ResNet-152-based models yielded the best test accuracy rate (95.52%); the AlexNet-based model yielded the lowest test accuracy rate (89.48%). We conclude that DCNNs could be efficient and useful for automatically identifying habitat elements from bird images, and we believe that the practical application of this technology will be helpful for studying the relationships between birds and habitat elements.},

ABSTRACT = {UAV-based multispectral multi-camera systems are widely used in scientific research for non-destructive crop traits estimation to optimize agricultural management decisions. These systems typically provide data from the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) domain. However, several key absorption features related to biomass and nitrogen (N) are located in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) domain. Therefore, this study investigates a novel multi-camera system prototype that addresses this spectral gap with a sensitivity from 600 to 1700 nm by implementing dedicated bandpass filter combinations to derive application-specific vegetation indices (VIs). In this study, two VIs, GnyLi and NRI, were applied using data obtained on a single observation date at a winter wheat field experiment located in Germany. Ground truth data were destructively sampled for the entire growing season. Likewise, crop heights were derived from UAV-based RGB image data using an improved approach developed within this study. Based on these variables, regression models were derived to estimate fresh and dry biomass, crop moisture, N concentration, and N uptake. The relationships between the NIR/SWIR-based VIs and the estimated crop traits were successfully evaluated (R2: 0.57 to 0.66). Both VIs were further validated against the sampled ground truth data (R2: 0.75 to 0.84). These results indicate the imaging system’s potential for monitoring crop traits in agricultural applications, but further multitemporal validations are needed.},

ABSTRACT = {Weed maps should be available quickly, reliably, and with high detail to be useful for site-specific management in crop protection and to promote more sustainable agriculture by reducing pesticide use. Here, the optimization of a deep residual convolutional neural network (ResNet-18) for the classification of weed and crop plants in UAV imagery is proposed. The target was to reach sufficient performance on an embedded system by maintaining the same features of the ResNet-18 model as a basis for fast UAV mapping. This would enable online recognition and subsequent mapping of weeds during UAV flying operation. Optimization was achieved mainly by avoiding redundant computations that arise when a classification model is applied on overlapping tiles in a larger input image. The model was trained and tested with imagery obtained from a UAV flight campaign at low altitude over a winter wheat field, and classification was performed on species level with the weed species Matricaria chamomilla L., Papaver rhoeas L., Veronica hederifolia L., and Viola arvensis ssp. arvensis observed in that field. The ResNet-18 model with the optimized image-level prediction pipeline reached a performance of 2.2 frames per second with an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier on the full resolution UAV image, which would amount to about 1.78 ha h−1 area output for continuous field mapping. The overall accuracy for determining crop, soil, and weed species was 94%. There were some limitations in the detection of species unknown to the model. When shifting from 16-bit to 32-bit model precision, no improvement in classification accuracy was observed, but a strong decline in speed performance, especially when a higher number of filters was used in the ResNet-18 model. Future work should be directed towards the integration of the mapping process on UAV platforms, guiding UAVs autonomously for mapping purpose, and ensuring the transferability of the models to other crop fields.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate forest biomass estimation at the individual tree scale is the foundation of timber industry and forest management. It plays an important role in explaining ecological issues and small-scale processes. Remotely sensed images, across a range of spatial and temporal resolutions, with their advantages of non-destructive monitoring, are widely applied in forest biomass monitoring at global, ecoregion or community scales. However, the development of remote sensing applications for forest biomass at the individual tree scale has been relatively slow due to the constraints of spatial resolution and evaluation accuracy of remotely sensed data. With the improvements in platforms and spatial resolutions, as well as the development of remote sensing techniques, the potential for forest biomass estimation at the single tree level has been demonstrated. However, a comprehensive review of remote sensing of forest biomass scaled at individual trees has not been done. This review highlights the theoretical bases, challenges and future perspectives for Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) applications of individual trees scaled to whole forests. We summarize research on estimating individual tree volume and aboveground biomass (AGB) using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAV-LS) and Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS, including Vehicle-borne Laser Scanning (VLS) and Backpack Laser Scanning (BLS)) data.},

ABSTRACT = {The impact of floods on forests is immediate, so it is necessary to quickly define the boundaries of flooded areas. Determining the extent of flooding in situ has shortcomings due to the possible limited spatial and temporal resolutions of data and the cost of data collection. Therefore, this research focused on flood mapping using geospatial data and remote sensing. The research area is located in the central part of the Republic of Croatia, an environmentally diverse area of lowland forests of the Sava River and its tributaries. Flood mapping was performed by merging Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) mission data and applying object-based image analysis (OBIA). For this purpose, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data (GRD processing level) were primarily used during the flood period due to the possibility of all-day imaging in all weather conditions and flood detection under the density of canopy. The pre-flood S2 imagery, a summer acquisition, was used as a source of additional spectral data. Geographical information system (GIS) layers—a multisource forest inventory, habitat map, and flood hazard map—were used as additional sources of information in assessing the accuracy of and interpreting the obtained results. The spectral signature, geometric and textural features, and vegetation indices were applied in the OBIA process. The result of the work was a developed methodological framework with a high accuracy and speed of production. The overall accuracy of the classification is 94.94%. Based on the conducted research, the usefulness of the C band of the S1 in flood mapping in lowland forests in the leaf-off season was determined. The paper presents previous research and describes the SAR parameters and characteristics of floodplain forest with a significant impact on the accuracy of classification.},

ABSTRACT = {Soil moisture is a key variable in the terrestrial water and energy system. This study presents an hourly index that provides soil moisture estimates on a high spatial and temporal resolution (1 km × 1 km). The long established Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) is extended with soil characteristic and temperature dependent loss functions. The Soilgrids and ERA5 data sets are used to provide the controlling variables. Precipitation as main driver is provided by the German weather radar data set RADOLAN. Empiric variables in the equations are fitted in a optimization effort using 23 in-situ soil moisture measurement stations from the Terrestial Environmental Observatories (TERENO) and a separately conducted field campaign. The volumetric soil moisture estimation results show error values of 3.45 Vol% mean ubRMSD between RADOLAN_API and station data with a high temporal accordance especially of soil moisture upsurge. Further potential of the improved API algorithm is shown with a per-station calibration of applied empirical variables. In addition, the RADOLAN_API data set was spatially compared to the ESA CCI soil moisture product where it altogether demonstrates good agreement. The resulting data set is provided as open access data.},

ABSTRACT = {Airborne remote sensing technologies have been widely applied in field crop phenotyping. However, the quality of current remote sensing data suffers from significant diurnal variances. The severity of the diurnal issue has been reported in various plant phenotyping studies over the last four decades, but there are limited studies on the modeling of the diurnal changing patterns that allow people to precisely predict the level of diurnal impacts. In order to comprehensively investigate the diurnal variability, it is necessary to collect time series field images with very high sampling frequencies, which has been difficult. In 2019, Purdue agricultural (Ag) engineers deployed their first field visible to near infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral gantry platform, which is capable of repetitively imaging the same field plots every 2.5 min. A total of 8631 hyperspectral images of the same field were collected for two genotypes of corn plants from the vegetative stage V4 to the reproductive stage R1 in the 2019 growing season. The analysis of these images showed that although the diurnal variability is very significant for almost all the image-derived phenotyping features, the diurnal changes follow stable patterns. This makes it possible to predict the imaging drifts by modeling the changing patterns. This paper reports detailed diurnal changing patterns for several selected plant phenotyping features such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Relative Water Content (RWC), and single spectrum bands. For example, NDVI showed a repeatable V-shaped diurnal pattern, which linearly drops by 0.012 per hour before the highest sun angle and increases thereafter by 0.010 per hour. The different diurnal changing patterns in different nitrogen stress treatments, genotypes and leaf stages were also compared and discussed. With the modeling results of this work, Ag remote sensing users will be able to more precisely estimate the deviation/change of crop feature predictions caused by the specific imaging time of the day. This will help people to more confidently decide on the acceptable imaging time window during a day. It can also be used to calibrate/compensate the remote sensing result against the time effect.},

ABSTRACT = {European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a keystone species for biodiversity of boreal forests. Large-diameter aspens maintain the diversity of hundreds of species, many of which are threatened in Fennoscandia. Due to a low economic value and relatively sparse and scattered occurrence of aspen in boreal forests, there is a lack of information of the spatial and temporal distribution of aspen, which hampers efficient planning and implementation of sustainable forest management practices and conservation efforts. Our objective was to assess identification of European aspen at the individual tree level in a southern boreal forest using high-resolution photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) and multispectral (MSP) orthomosaics acquired with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The structure-from-motion approach was applied to generate RGB imagery-based PPC to be used for individual tree-crown delineation. Multispectral data were collected using two UAV cameras: Parrot Sequoia and MicaSense RedEdge-M. Tree-crown outlines were obtained from watershed segmentation of PPC data and intersected with multispectral mosaics to extract and calculate spectral metrics for individual trees. We assessed the role of spectral data features extracted from PPC and multispectral mosaics and a combination of it, using a machine learning classifier—Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform two different classifications: discrimination of aspen from the other species combined into one class and classification of all four species (aspen, birch, pine, spruce) simultaneously. In the first scenario, the highest classification accuracy of 84% (F1-score) for aspen and overall accuracy of 90.1% was achieved using only RGB features from PPC, whereas in the second scenario, the highest classification accuracy of 86 % (F1-score) for aspen and overall accuracy of 83.3% was achieved using the combination of RGB and MSP features. The proposed method provides a new possibility for the rapid assessment of aspen occurrence to enable more efficient forest management as well as contribute to biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts in boreal forests.},

ABSTRACT = {Northern China has been long threatened by aeolian desertification. In recent years, all levels of the Chinese government have performed a series of ecological protection and sand control projects. To grasp the implementation effects of these projects and adjust policies in time, it is necessary to understand the process of aeolian desertification quickly and accurately. Remote sensing technologies play an irreplaceable role in aeolian desertification monitoring. In this study, the Zhenglan Banner, which is in the hinterland of the Hunshandake Sandy Land, was considered as the research area. Based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, ground survey data, and Landsat images called in Google Earth Engine (GEE), the aeolian desertified land (ADL) in 2000, 2004, 2010, 2015, and 2019 was extracted using spectral mixture analysis. A desertification index (DI) was constructed to evaluate the spatial and temporal dynamics of the ADL in the Zhenglan Banner. Finally, a residual analysis explored the driving forces of aeolian desertification. The results showed that (1) the ADL area in the Zhenglan Banner has been trending downwards over the past 20 years but rebounded from 2004 to 2010; (2) over the past 20 years, the area of slightly, moderately, and severely desertified land has decreased at annual rates of 0.4%, 2.7%, and 3.4%, respectively; (3) human activities had significantly positive and negative impacts on the aeolian desertification trend for 20.0% and 21.0% of the study area, respectively, but not for the rest. This paper explored new techniques for rapid aeolian desertification monitoring and is of great significance for controlling and managing aeolian desertification in this region.},

ABSTRACT = {Very often, the root of problems found to produce food sustainably, as well as the origin of many environmental issues, derive from making decisions with unreliable or inexistent data. Data-driven agriculture has emerged as a way to palliate the lack of meaningful information when taking critical steps in the field. However, many decisive parameters still require manual measurements and proximity to the target, which results in the typical undersampling that impedes statistical significance and the application of AI techniques that rely on massive data. To invert this trend, and simultaneously combine crop proximity with massive sampling, a sensing architecture for automating crop scouting from ground vehicles is proposed. At present, there are no clear guidelines of how monitoring vehicles must be configured for optimally tracking crop parameters at high resolution. This paper structures the architecture for such vehicles in four subsystems, examines the most common components for each subsystem, and delves into their interactions for an efficient delivery of high-density field data from initial acquisition to final recommendation. Its main advantages rest on the real time generation of crop maps that blend the global positioning of canopy location, some of their agronomical traits, and the precise monitoring of the ambient conditions surrounding such canopies. As a use case, the envisioned architecture was embodied in an autonomous robot to automatically sort two harvesting zones of a commercial vineyard to produce two wines of dissimilar characteristics. The information contained in the maps delivered by the robot may help growers systematically apply differential harvesting, evidencing the suitability of the proposed architecture for massive monitoring and subsequent data-driven actuation. While many crop parameters still cannot be measured non-invasively, the availability of novel sensors is continually growing; to benefit from them, an efficient and trustable sensing architecture becomes indispensable.},

ABSTRACT = {Intertidal seagrass plays a vital role in estimating the overall health and dynamics of coastal environments due to its interaction with tidal changes. However, most seagrass habitats around the globe have been in steady decline due to human impacts, disturbing the already delicate balance in the environmental conditions that sustain seagrass. Miniaturization of multi-spectral sensors has facilitated very high resolution mapping of seagrass meadows, which significantly improves the potential for ecologists to monitor changes. In this study, two analytical approaches used for classifying intertidal seagrass habitats are compared—Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs). Both methods produce pixel-wise classifications in order to create segmented maps. FCNNs are an emerging set of algorithms within Deep Learning. Conversely, OBIA has been a prominent solution within this field, with many studies leveraging in-situ data and multiresolution segmentation to create habitat maps. This work demonstrates the utility of FCNNs in a semi-supervised setting to map seagrass and other coastal features from an optical drone survey conducted at Budle Bay, Northumberland, England. Semi-supervision is also an emerging field within Deep Learning that has practical benefits of achieving state of the art results using only subsets of labelled data. This is especially beneficial for remote sensing applications where in-situ data is an expensive commodity. For our results, we show that FCNNs have comparable performance with the standard OBIA method used by ecologists.},

ABSTRACT = {Hyperspectral cameras onboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently emerged for monitoring crop traits at the sub-field scale. Different physical, statistical, and hybrid methods for crop trait retrieval have been developed. However, spectra collected from UAVs can be confounded by various issues, including illumination variation throughout the crop growing season, the effect of which on the retrieval performance is not well understood at present. In this study, four retrieval methods are compared, in terms of retrieving the leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (fCover), and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) of potato plants over an agricultural field for six dates during the growing season. We analyzed: (1) The standard look-up table method (LUTstd), (2) an improved (regularized) LUT method that involves variable correlation (LUTreg), (3) hybrid methods, and (4) random forest regression without (RF) and with (RFexp) the exposure time as an additional explanatory variable. The Soil–Leaf–Canopy (SLC) model was used in association with the LUT-based inversion and hybrid methods, while the statistical modelling methods (RF and RFexp) relied entirely on in situ data. The results revealed that RFexp was the best-performing method, yielding the highest accuracies, in terms of the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), for LAI (5.36%), fCover (5.87%), and CCC (15.01%). RFexp was able to reduce the effects of illumination variability and cloud shadows. LUTreg outperformed the other two retrieval methods (hybrid methods and LUTstd), with an NRMSE of 9.18% for LAI, 10.46% for fCover, and 12.16% for CCC. Conversely, LUTreg led to lower accuracies than those derived from RF for LAI (5.51%) and for fCover (6.23%), but not for CCC (16.21%). Therefore, the machine learning approaches—in particular, RF—appear to be the most promising retrieval methods for application to UAV-based hyperspectral data.},

ABSTRACT = {Riparian habitats provide a series of ecological services vital for the balance of the environment, and are niches and resources for a wide variety of species. Monitoring riparian environments at the intra-habitat level is crucial for assessing and preserving their conservation status, although it is challenging due to their landscape complexity. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and multi-spectral optical sensors can be used for very high resolution (VHR) monitoring in terms of spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. In this contribution, the vegetation species of the riparian habitat (91E0*, 3240 of Natura 2000 network) of North-West Italy were mapped at individual tree (ITD) level using machine learning and a multi-temporal phenology-based approach. Three UAV flights were conducted at the phenological-relevant time of the year (epochs). The data were analyzed using a structure from motion (SfM) approach. The resulting orthomosaics were segmented and classified using a random forest (RF) algorithm. The training dataset was composed of field-collected data, and was oversampled to reduce the effects of unbalancing and size. Three-hundred features were computed considering spectral, textural, and geometric information. Finally, the RF model was cross-validated (leave-one-out). This model was applied to eight scenarios that differed in temporal resolution to assess the role of multi-temporality over the UAV’s VHR optical data. Results showed better performances in multi-epoch phenology-based classification than single-epochs ones, with 0.71 overall accuracy compared to 0.61. Some classes, such as Pinus sylvestris and Betula pendula, are remarkably influenced by the phenology-based multi-temporality: the F1-score increased by 0.3 points by considering three epochs instead of two.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) carrying multispectral cameras are increasingly being used for high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) of above-ground traits of crops to study genetic diversity, resource use efficiency and responses to abiotic or biotic stresses. There is significant unexplored potential for repeated data collection through a field season to reveal information on the rates of growth and provide predictions of the final yield. Generating such information early in the season would create opportunities for more efficient in-depth phenotyping and germplasm selection. This study tested the use of high-resolution time-series imagery (5 or 10 sampling dates) to understand the relationships between growth dynamics, temporal resolution and end-of-season above-ground biomass (AGB) in 869 diverse accessions of highly productive (mean AGB = 23.4 Mg/Ha), photoperiod sensitive sorghum. Canopy surface height (CSM), ground cover (GC), and five common spectral indices were considered as features of the crop phenotype. Spline curve fitting was used to integrate data from single flights into continuous time courses. Random Forest was used to predict end-of-season AGB from aerial imagery, and to identify the most informative variables driving predictions. Improved prediction of end-of-season AGB (RMSE reduction of 0.24 Mg/Ha) was achieved earlier in the growing season (10 to 20 days) by leveraging early- and mid-season measurement of the rate of change of geometric and spectral features. Early in the season, dynamic traits describing the rates of change of CSM and GC predicted end-of-season AGB best. Late in the season, CSM on a given date was the most influential predictor of end-of-season AGB. The power to predict end-of-season AGB was greatest at 50 days after planting, accounting for 63% of variance across this very diverse germplasm collection with modest error (RMSE 1.8 Mg/ha). End-of-season AGB could be predicted equally well when spline fitting was performed on data collected from five flights versus 10 flights over the growing season. This demonstrates a more valuable and efficient approach to using UAVs for HTP, while also proposing strategies to add further value.},

ABSTRACT = {Benzene, toluene, and total BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) concentrations registered for one year (2016) have been determined every month for one high-density traffic area. The assessment was performed in Arad City, Romania, to evaluate these pollutants and their influence on the inhabitants’ health. The contaminants were sampled using a static sampling method and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Benzene was the most dominant among the BTEX compounds—the average concentrations ranged from 18.00 ± 1.32 µg m−3 in December to 2.47 ± 0.74 µg m−3 in August. The average toluene concentration over the year was 4.36 ± 2.42 µg m−3 (with a maximum of 9.60 ± 2.39 µg m−3 in November and a minimum of 1.04 ± 0.29 µg m−3 in May). The toluene/benzene ratio (T/B) was around 0.5, indicating substantial contributions from mobile sources (vehicles). The emission and accumulation of different aromatic compounds (especially benzene) could deteriorate the urban air quality. The lifetime cancer risk (LTCR) for benzene was found to be more than 10−5 in winter, including the inhabitants in the “probable cancer risk” category.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of deep learning models to identify lesions on cotton leaves on the basis of images of the crop in the field is proposed in this article. Cultivated in most of the world, cotton is one of the economically most important agricultural crops. Its cultivation in tropical regions has made it the target of a wide spectrum of agricultural pests and diseases, and efficient solutions are required. Moreover, the symptoms of the main pests and diseases cannot be differentiated in the initial stages, and the correct identification of a lesion can be difficult for the producer. To help resolve the problem, the present research provides a solution based on deep learning in the screening of cotton leaves which makes it possible to monitor the health of the cotton crop and make better decisions for its management. With the learning models GoogleNet and Resnet50 using convolutional neural networks, a precision of 86.6% and 89.2%, respectively, was obtained. Compared with traditional approaches for the processing of images such as support vector machines (SVM), Closest k-neighbors (KNN), artificial neural networks (ANN) and neuro-fuzzy (NFC), the convolutional neural networks proved to be up to 25% more precise, suggesting that this method can contribute to a more rapid and reliable inspection of the plants growing in the field.},

ABSTRACT = {Slope failure probabilistic models generated using random forest (RF) machine learning (ML), manually interpreted incident points, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) digital terrain variables are assessed for predicting and generalizing to new geographic extents. Specifically, models for four Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) in the state of West Virginia in the United States (US) were created. All region-specific models were then used to predict withheld validation data within all four MLRAs. For all validation datasets, the model trained using data from the same MLRA provided the highest reported overall accuracy (OA), Kappa statistic, F1 Score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC PR). However, the model from the same MLRA as the validation dataset did not always provide the highest precision, recall, and/or specificity, suggesting that models extrapolated to new geographic extents tend to either overpredict or underpredict the land area of slope failure occurrence whereas they offer a better balance between omission and commission error within the region in which they were trained. This study highlights the value of developing region-specific inventories, models, and high resolution and detailed digital elevation data, since models may not generalize well to new geographic extents, potentially resulting from spatial heterogeneity in landscape and/or slope failure characteristics.},

ABSTRACT = {Radiation transform models such as PROSAIL are widely used for crop canopy reflectance simulation and biophysical parameter inversion. The PROSAIL model basically assumes that the canopy is turbid homogenous media with a bare soil background. However, the canopy structure changes when crop growth stages develop, which is more or less a departure from this assumption. In addition, a paddy rice field is inundated most of the time with flooded soil background. In this study, field-scale paddy rice leaf area index (LAI), leaf cholorphyll content (LCC), and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) were retrieved from unmanned-aerial-vehicle-based hyperspectral images by the PROSAIL radiation transform model using a lookup table (LUT) strategy, with a special focus on the effects of growth-stage development and soil-background signature selection. Results show that involving flooded soil reflectance as background reflectance for PROSAIL could improve estimation accuracy. When using a LUT with the flooded soil reflectance signature (LUTflooded) the coefficients of determination (R2) between observed and estimation variables are 0.70, 0.11, and 0.79 for LAI, LCC, and CCC, respectively, for the entire growing season (from tillering to heading growth stages), and the corresponding mean absolute errors (MAEs) are 21.87%, 16.27%, and 12.52%. For LAI and LCC, high model bias mainly occurred in tillering growth stages. There is an obvious overestimation of LAI and underestimation of LCC for in the tillering growth stage. The estimation accuracy of CCC is relatively consistent from tillering to heading growth stages.},

ABSTRACT = {Exploiting hand gestures for non-verbal communication has extraordinary potential in HCI. A data glove is an apparatus widely used to recognize hand gestures. To improve the functionality of the data glove, a highly stretchable and reliable signal-to-noise ratio sensor is indispensable. To do this, the study focused on the development of soft silicone microchannel sensors using a Eutectic Gallium-Indium (EGaIn) liquid metal alloy and a hand gesture recognition system via the proposed data glove using the soft sensor. The EGaIn-silicone sensor was uniquely designed to include two sensing channels to monitor the finger joint movements and to facilitate the EGaIn alloy injection into the meander-type microchannels. We recruited 15 participants to collect hand gesture dataset investigating 12 static hand gestures. The dataset was exploited to estimate the performance of the proposed data glove in hand gesture recognition. Additionally, six traditional classification algorithms were studied. From the results, a random forest shows the highest classification accuracy of 97.3% and a linear discriminant analysis shows the lowest accuracy of 87.4%. The non-linearity of the proposed sensor deteriorated the accuracy of LDA, however, the other classifiers adequately overcame it and performed high accuracies (&gt;90%).},

ABSTRACT = {Gully erosion is well-developed in the Jinsha dry-hot valley region, which has caused serious soil losses. Gully volume is regarded as an effective indicator that can reflect the development intensity of gully erosion, and the evolutionary processes of gullies can be predicted based on the dynamic variation in gully volume. Establishing an effective prediction model of gully volume is essential to determine gully volume accurately and conveniently. Therefore, in this work, an empirical prediction model of gully volume was constructed and verified based on detailed morphological features acquired by elaborate field investigations and measurements in 134 gullies. The results showed the mean value of gully length, width, depth, cross-section area, volume, and vertical gradient decreased with the weakness of the activity degree of the gully, although the decrease in processes of these parameters had some differences. Moreover, a series of empirical prediction models of gully volume was constructed, and gully length was demonstrated to be a better predictor than other morphological features. Lastly, the effectiveness test showed the model of V = aL^b was the most effective in predicting gully volume among the different models established in this study. Our results provide a useful approach to predict gully volume in dry-hot valley regions.},

ABSTRACT = {Deterioration of bridge infrastructure is a serious concern to transport and government agencies as it declines serviceability and reliability of bridges and jeopardizes public safety. Maintenance and rehabilitation needs of bridge infrastructure are periodically monitored and assessed, typically every two years. Existing inspection techniques, such as visual inspection, are time-consuming, subjective, and often incomplete. Non-destructive testing (NDT) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been gaining momentum for bridge monitoring in the recent years, particularly due to enhanced accessibility and cost efficiency, deterrence of traffic closure, and improved safety during inspection. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive review of the application of UAVs in bridge condition monitoring, used in conjunction with remote sensing technologies. Remote sensing technologies such as visual imagery, infrared thermography, LiDAR, and other sensors, integrated with UAVs for data acquisition are analyzed in depth. This study compiled sixty-five journal and conference papers published in the last two decades scrutinizing NDT-based UAV systems. In addition to comparison of stand-alone and integrated NDT-UAV methods, the facilitation of bridge inspection using UAVs is thoroughly discussed in the present article in terms of ease of use, accuracy, cost-efficiency, employed data collection tools, and simulation platforms. Additionally, challenges and future perspectives of the reviewed UAV-NDT technologies are highlighted.},

ABSTRACT = {Rapid, accurate and inexpensive methods are required to analyze plant traits throughout all crop growth stages for plant phenotyping. Few studies have comprehensively evaluated plant traits from multispectral cameras onboard UAV platforms. Additionally, machine learning algorithms tend to over- or underfit data and limited attention has been paid to optimizing their performance through an ensemble learning approach. This study aims to (1) comprehensively evaluate twelve rice plant traits estimated from aerial unmanned vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral images and (2) introduce Random Forest AdaBoost (RFA) algorithms as an optimization approach for estimating plant traits. The approach was tested based on a farmer’s field in Terengganu, Malaysia, for the off-season from February to June 2018, involving five rice cultivars and three nitrogen (N) rates. Four bands, thirteen indices and Random Forest-AdaBoost (RFA) regression models were evaluated against the twelve plant traits according to the growth stages. Among the plant traits, plant height, green leaf and storage organ biomass, and foliar nitrogen (N) content were estimated well, with a coefficient of determination (R2) above 0.80. In comparing the bands and indices, red, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Red-Edge Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (REWDRVI) and Red-Edge Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (RESAVI) were remarkable in estimating all plant traits at tillering, booting and milking stages with R2 values ranging from 0.80–0.99 and root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.04–0.22. Milking was found to be the best growth stage to conduct estimations of plant traits. In summary, our findings demonstrate that an ensemble learning approach can improve the accuracy as well as reduce under/overfitting in plant phenotyping algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Rice bacterial leaf streak (BLS) is a serious disease in rice leaves and can seriously affect the quality and quantity of rice growth. Automatic estimation of disease severity is a crucial requirement in agricultural production. To address this, a new method (termed BLSNet) was proposed for rice and BLS leaf lesion recognition and segmentation based on a UNet network in semantic segmentation. An attention mechanism and multi-scale extraction integration were used in BLSNet to improve the accuracy of lesion segmentation. We compared the performance of the proposed network with that of DeepLabv3+ and UNet as benchmark models used in semantic segmentation. It was found that the proposed BLSNet model demonstrated higher segmentation and class accuracy. A preliminary investigation of BLS disease severity estimation was carried out based on our BLS segmentation results, and it was found that the proposed BLSNet method has strong potential to be a reliable automatic estimator of BLS disease severity.},

ABSTRACT = {Groups of landslides induced by heavy rainfall are widely distributed on a global basis and they usually result in major losses of human life and economic damage. However, compared with landslides induced by earthquakes, inventories of landslides induced by heavy rainfall are much less common. In this study we used high-precision remote sensing images before and after continuous heavy rainfall in southern Tianshui, China, from 20 June to 25 July 2013, to produce an inventory of 14,397 shallow landslides. Based on the results of landslide inventory, we utilized machine learning and the geographic information system (GIS) to map landslide susceptibility in this area and evaluated the relative weight of various factors affecting landslide development. First, 18 variables related to geomorphic conditions, slope material, geological conditions, and human activities were selected through collinearity analysis; second, 21 selected machine learning models were trained and optimized in the Python environment to evaluate the susceptibility of landslides. The results showed that the ExtraTrees model was the most effective for landslide susceptibility assessment, with an accuracy of 0.91. This predictive ability means that our landslide susceptibility results can be used in the implementation of landslide prevention and mitigation measures in the region. Analysis of the importance of the factors showed that the contribution of slope aspect (SA) was significantly higher than that of the other factors, followed by planar curvature (PLC), distance to river (DR), distance to fault (DTF), normalized difference vehicle index (NDVI), distance to road (DTR), and other factors. We conclude that factors related to geomorphic conditions are principally responsible for controlling landslide susceptibility in the study area.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning techniques (ML) have gained attention in precision agriculture practices since they efficiently address multiple applications, like estimating the growth and yield of trees in forest plantations. The combination between ML algorithms and spectral vegetation indices (VIs) from high-spatial-resolution line measurement, segment: 0.079024 m multispectral imagery, could optimize the prediction of these biometric variables. In this paper, we investigate the performance of ML techniques and VIs acquired with an unnamed aerial vehicle (UAV) to predict the diameter at breast height (DBH) and total height (Ht) of eucalyptus trees. An experimental site with six eucalyptus species was selected, and the Parrot Sequoia sensor was used. Several ML techniques were evaluated, like random forest (RF), REPTree (DT), alternating model tree (AT,) k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), linear regression (LR), and radial basis function (RBF). Each algorithm performance was verified using the correlation coefficient (r) and the mean absolute error (MAE). We used, as input, 34 VIs as numeric variables to predict DHB and Ht. We also added to the model a categorical variable as input identifying the different eucalyptus trees species. The RF technique obtained an overall superior estimation for all the tested configurations. Still, the RBF also showed a higher performance for predicting DHB, numerically surpassing the RF both in r and MAE, in some cases. For Ht variable, the technique that obtained the smallest MAE was SVM, though in a particular test. In this regard, we conclude that a combination of ML and VIs extracted from UAV-based imagery is suitable to estimate DBH and Ht in eucalyptus species. The approach presented constitutes an interesting contribution to the inventory and management of planted forests.},

ABSTRACT = {Motion estimation is crucial to predict where other traffic participants will be at a certain period of time, and accordingly plan the route of the ego-vehicle. This paper presents a novel approach to estimate the motion state by using region-level instance segmentation and extended Kalman filter (EKF). Motion estimation involves three stages of object detection, tracking and parameter estimate. We first use a region-level segmentation to accurately locate the object region for the latter two stages. The region-level segmentation combines color, temporal (optical flow), and spatial (depth) information as the basis for segmentation by using super-pixels and Conditional Random Field. The optical flow is then employed to track the feature points within the object area. In the stage of parameter estimate, we develop a relative motion model of the ego-vehicle and the object, and accordingly establish an EKF model for point tracking and parameter estimate. The EKF model integrates the ego-motion, optical flow, and disparity to generate optimized motion parameters. During tracking and parameter estimate, we apply edge point constraint and consistency constraint to eliminate outliers of tracking points so that the feature points used for tracking are ensured within the object body and the parameter estimates are refined by inner points. Experiments have been conducted on the KITTI dataset, and the results demonstrate that our method presents excellent performance and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods either in object segmentation and parameter estimate.},

ABSTRACT = {The dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltei Hornemann (Z. noltei) is the most dominant seagrass in semi-enclosed coastal systems of the Atlantic coast of Morocco. The species is experiencing a worldwide decline and monitoring the extent of its meadows would be a useful approach to estimate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic stressors. Here, we aimed to map the Z. noltei meadows in the Merja Zerga coastal lagoon (Atlantic coast of Morocco) using remote sensing. We used a random forest algorithm combined with field data to classify a SPOT 7 satellite image. Despite the difficulties related to the non-synchronization of the satellite images with the high tide coefficient, our results revealed, with an accuracy of 95%, that dwarf eelgrass beds can be discriminated successfully from other habitats in the lagoon. The estimated area was 160.76 ha when considering mixed beds (Z. noltei-associated macroalgae). The use of SPOT 7 satellite images seems to be satisfactory for long-term monitoring of Z. noltei meadows in the Merja Zerga lagoon and for biomass estimation using an NDVI–biomass quantitative relationship. Nevertheless, using this method of biomass estimation for dwarf eelgrass meadows could be unsuccessful when it comes to areas where the NDVI is saturated due to the stacking of many layers.},

ABSTRACT = {Reducing risk from pesticide applications has been gaining serious attention in the last few decades due to the significant damage to human health, environment, and ecosystems. Pesticide applications are an essential part of current agriculture, enhancing cultivated crop productivity and quality and preventing losses of up to 45% of the world food supply. However, inappropriate and excessive use of pesticides is a major rising concern. Precision spraying addresses these concerns by precisely and efficiently applying pesticides to the target area and substantially reducing pesticide usage while maintaining efficacy at preventing crop losses. This review provides a systematic summary of current technologies used for precision spraying in tree fruits and highlights their potential, briefly discusses factors affecting spraying parameters, and concludes with possible solutions to reduce excessive agrochemical uses. We conclude there is a critical need for appropriate sensing techniques that can accurately detect the target. In addition, air jet velocity, travel speed, wind speed and direction, droplet size, and canopy characteristics need to be considered for successful droplet deposition by the spraying system. Assessment of terrain is important when field elevation has significant variability. Control of airflow during spraying is another important parameter that needs to be considered. Incorporation of these variables in precision spraying systems will optimize spray decisions and help reduce excessive agrochemical applications.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, we proposed to include remote sensing techniques as a part of the methodology for natural lake bottom mapping, with a focus on the littoral zone. Due to the inaccessibility of this zone caused by dense vegetation, measurements of the lake bottom and the coastline are also difficult to perform using traditional methods. The authors of this paper present, discuss and verify the applicability of remote sensing active sensors as a tool for measurements in the shore zone of a lake. The single-beam Lowrance HDS-7 ComboGPS echosounder with an 83/200 kHz transducer and a two-beam LiDAR RIEGL VQ-1560i-DW scanner have been used for reservoir bottom measurements of two neighboring lakes, which differ in terms of water transparency. The research has found a strong correlation between both sonar and LiDAR for mapping the bottom depth in a range up to 1.6 m, and allowed LiDAR mapping of approximately 20% of the highly transparent lake, but it has not been found to be useful in water with low transparency. In the light of the conducted research, both devices, sonar and LiDAR, have potential for complementary use by fusing both methods: the sonar for mapping of the sublittoral and the pelagic zone, and the LiDAR for mapping of the littoral zone, overcoming limitation related to vegetation in the lake shore zone.},

ABSTRACT = {Wine growing needs to adapt to confront climate change. In fact, the lack of water becomes more and more important in many regions. Whereas vineyards have been located in dry areas for decades, so they need special resilient varieties and/or a sufficient water supply at key development stages in case of severe drought. With climate change and the decrease of water availability, some vineyard regions face difficulties because of unsuitable variety, wrong vine management or due to the limited water access. Decision support tools are therefore required to optimize water use or to adapt agronomic practices. This study aimed at monitoring vine water status at a large scale with Sentinel-2 images. The goal was to provide a solution that would give spatialized and temporal information throughout the season on the water status of the vines. For this purpose, thirty six plots were monitored in total over three years (2018, 2019 and 2020). Vine water status was measured with stem water potential in field measurements from pea size to ripening stage. Simultaneously Sentinel-2 images were downloaded and processed to extract band reflectance values and compute vegetation indices. In our study, we tested five supervised regression machine learning algorithms to find possible relationships between stem water potential and data acquired from Sentinel-2 images (bands reflectance values and vegetation indices). Regression model using Red, NIR, Red-Edge and SWIR bands gave promising result to predict stem water potential (R2=0.40, RMSE=0.26).},

ABSTRACT = {Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool for estimating crop variables, particularly Leaf Area Index (LAI), which plays a pivotal role in monitoring crop development. The goal of this study was to identify the optimal Sentinel-2 bands for LAI estimation and to derive Vegetation Indices (VI) that are well correlated with LAI. Linear regression models between time series of Sentinel-2 imagery and field-measured LAI showed that Sentinel-2 Band-8A—Narrow Near InfraRed (NIR) is more accurate for LAI estimation than the traditionally used Band-8 (NIR). Band-5 (Red edge-1) showed the lowest performance out of all red edge bands in tomato and cotton. A novel finding was that Band 9 (Water vapor) showed a very high correlation with LAI. Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, and 12 were saturated at LAI ≈ 3 in cotton and tomato. Bands 6, 7, 8, 8A, and 9 were not saturated at high LAI values in cotton and tomato. The tomato, cotton, and wheat LAI estimation performance of ReNDVI (R2 = 0.79, 0.98, 0.83, respectively) and two new VIs (WEVI (Water vapor red Edge Vegetation Index) (R2 = 0.81, 0.96, 0.71, respectively) and WNEVI (Water vapor narrow NIR red Edge Vegetation index) (R2 = 0.79, 0.98, 0.79, respectively)) were higher than the LAI estimation performance of the commonly used NDVI (R2 = 0.66, 0.83, 0.05, respectively) and other common VIs tested in this study. Consequently, reNDVI, WEVI, and WNEVI can facilitate more accurate agricultural monitoring than traditional VIs.},

ABSTRACT = {We consider the problem of vision-based detection and ranging of a target UAV using the video feed from a monocular camera onboard a pursuer UAV. Our previously published work in this area employed a cascade classifier algorithm to locate the target UAV, which was found to perform poorly in complex background scenes. We thus study the replacement of the cascade classifier algorithm with newer machine learning-based object detection algorithms. Five candidate algorithms are implemented and quantitatively tested in terms of their efficiency (measured as frames per second processing rate), accuracy (measured as the root mean squared error between ground truth and detected location), and consistency (measured as mean average precision) in a variety of flight patterns, backgrounds, and test conditions. Assigning relative weights of 20%, 40% and 40% to these three criteria, we find that when flying over a white background, the top three performers are YOLO v2 (76.73 out of 100), Faster RCNN v2 (63.65 out of 100), and Tiny YOLO (59.50 out of 100), while over a realistic background, the top three performers are Faster RCNN v2 (54.35 out of 100, SSD MobileNet v1 (51.68 out of 100) and SSD Inception v2 (50.72 out of 100), leading us to recommend Faster RCNN v2 as the recommended solution. We then provide a roadmap for further work in integrating the object detector into our vision-based UAV tracking system.},

ABSTRACT = {Sufficient nitrogen (N) supply is decisive to achieve high grass seed yields while overfertilization will lead to negative environmental impact. From the literature, estimation of N rates taking into account the crop’s N status and its yield potential, seems promising for attaining high yields and averting adverse environmental impacts. This study aimed at an evaluation of remote sensing to predict final seed yield, N traits of the grass seed crop and the usability of nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) to measure additional N requirement. It included four years’ data and eight N application rates and strategies. Several reflectance measurements were made and used for the calculation of 18 vegetation indices. The predictions were made using partial least square regression and support vector machine. Three different yield responses to N fertilization were noted; one with linear response, one with optimum economic nitrogen (EON) at ~188 kg N ha−1, and one with EON at ~138 kg N ha−1. We conclude that although it is possible to make in-season predictions of NNI, it does not always portray the differences in yield potential; thus, it is challenging to utilize it to optimize N application.},

ABSTRACT = {Floating and washed ashore marine plastic debris (MPD) is a growing environmental challenge. It has become evident that secluded locations including the Arctic, Antarctic, and remote islands are being impacted by plastic pollution generated thousands of kilometers away. Optical remote sensing of MPD is an emerging field that can aid in monitoring remote environments where in-person observation and data collection is not always feasible. Here we evaluate MPD spectral features in the visible to shortwave infrared regions for detecting varying quantities of MPD that have accumulated on beaches using a spectroradiometer. Measurements were taken from a range of in situ MPD accumulations ranging from 0.08% to 7.94% surface coverage. Our results suggest that spectral absorption features at 1215 nm and 1732 nm are useful for detecting varying abundance levels of MPD in a complex natural environment, however other absorption features at 931 nm, 1045 nm and 2046 nm could not detect in situ MPD. The reflectance of some in situ MPD accumulations was statistically different from samples that only contained organic debris and sand between 1.56% and 7.94% surface cover; however other samples with similar surface cover did not have reflectance that was statistically different from samples containing no MPD. Despite MPD being detectable against a background of sand and organic beach debris, a clear relationship between the surface cover of MPD and the strength of key absorption features could not be established. Additional research is needed to advance our understanding of the factors, such as type of MPD assemblage, that contribute to the bulk reflectance of MPD contaminated landscapes.},

ABSTRACT = {Automatic crop identification and monitoring is a key element in enhancing food production processes as well as diminishing the related environmental impact. Although several efficient deep learning techniques have emerged in the field of multispectral imagery analysis, the crop classification problem still needs more accurate solutions. This work introduces a competitive methodology for crop classification from multispectral satellite imagery mainly using an enhanced 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) designed at a smaller-scale architecture, as well as a novel post-processing step. The proposed methodology contains four steps: image stacking, patch extraction, classification model design (based on a 2D-CNN architecture), and post-processing. First, the images are stacked to increase the number of features. Second, the input images are split into patches and fed into the 2D-CNN model. Then, the 2D-CNN model is constructed within a small-scale framework, and properly trained to recognize 10 different types of crops. Finally, a post-processing step is performed in order to reduce the classification error caused by lower-spatial-resolution images. Experiments were carried over the so-named Campo Verde database, which consists of a set of satellite images captured by Landsat and Sentinel satellites from the municipality of Campo Verde, Brazil. In contrast to the maximum accuracy values reached by remarkable works reported in the literature (amounting to an overall accuracy of about 81%, a f1 score of 75.89%, and average accuracy of 73.35%), the proposed methodology achieves a competitive overall accuracy of 81.20%, a f1 score of 75.89%, and an average accuracy of 88.72% when classifying 10 different crops, while ensuring an adequate trade-off between the number of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) and accuracy. Furthermore, given its ability to effectively classify patches from two image sequences, this methodology may result appealing for other real-world applications, such as the classification of urban materials.},

ABSTRACT = {Monitoring the structural health of wind turbine blades is essential to increase energy capture and operational safety of turbines, and therewith enhance competitiveness of wind energy. With the current trends of designing blades ever longer, detailed knowledge of the vibrational characteristics at any point along the blade is desirable. In our approach, we monitor vibrations during operation of the turbine by wirelessly measuring accelerations on the outside of the blades. We propose an algorithm to extract so-called vibration-based fingerprints from those measurements, i.e., dominant vibrations such as eigenfrequencies and narrow-band noise. These fingerprints can then be used for subsequent analysis and visualisation, e.g., for comparing fingerprints across several sensor positions and for identifying vibrations as global or local properties. In this study, data were collected by sensors on two test turbines and fingerprints were successfully extracted for vibrations with both low and high operational variability. An analysis of sensors on the same blade indicates that fingerprints deviate for positions at large radial distance or at different blade sides and, hence, an evaluation with larger datasets of sensors at different positions is promising. In addition, the results show that distributed measurements on the blades are needed to gain a detailed understanding of blade vibrations and thereby reduce loads, increase energy harvesting and improve future blade design. In doing so, our method provides a tool for analysing vibrations with relation to environmental and operational variability in a comprehensive manner.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote-sensing time-series datasets are significant for global change research and a better understanding of the Earth. However, remote-sensing acquisitions often provide sparse time series due to sensor resolution limitations and environmental factors such as cloud noise for optical data. Image transformation is the method that is often used to deal with this issue. This paper considers the deep convolution networks to learn the complex mapping between sequence images, called adaptive filter generation network (AdaFG), convolution long short-term memory network (CLSTM), and cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CyGAN) for construction of sequence image datasets. AdaFG network uses a separable 1D convolution kernel instead of 2D kernels to capture the spatial characteristics of input sequence images and then is trained end-to-end using sequence images. CLSTM network can map between different images using the state information of multiple time-series images. CyGAN network can map an image from a source domain to a target domain without additional information. Our experiments, which were performed with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Landsat-8 datasets, show that the deep convolution networks are effective to produce high-quality time-series image datasets, and the data-driven deep convolution networks can better simulate complex and diverse nonlinear data information.},

ABSTRACT = {Highly effective pesticide applications require a continual adjustment of the pesticide spray flow rate that attends to different canopy characterizations. Real-time image processing with rapid target detection and data-processing technologies is vital for precision pesticide application. However, the extant studies do not provide an efficient and reliable method of extracting individual trees with irregular tree-crown shapes and complicated backgrounds. This paper on our study proposes a Mahalanobis distance and conditional random field (CRF)-based segmentation model to extract cherry trees accurately in a natural orchard environment. This study computed Mahalanobis distance from the image’s color, brightness and location features to acquire an initial classification of the canopy and background. A CRF was then created by using the Mahalanobis distance calculations as unary potential energy and the Gaussian kernel function based on the image color and pixels distance as binary potential energy. Finally, the study completed image segmentation using mean-field approximation. The results show that the proposed method displays a higher accuracy rate than the traditional algorithms K-means and GrabCut algorithms and lower labeling and training costs than the deep learning algorithm DeepLabv3+, with 92.1%, 94.5% and 93.3% of the average P, R and F1-score, respectively. Moreover, experiments on datasets with different overlap conditions and image acquisition times, as well as in different years and seasons, show that this method performs well under complex background conditions, with an average F1-score higher than 87.7%.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper deals with detecting small objects in remote sensing images from satellites or any aerial vehicle by utilizing the concept of image super-resolution for image resolution enhancement using a deep-learning-based detection method. This paper provides a rationale for image super-resolution for small objects by improving the current super-resolution (SR) framework by incorporating a cyclic generative adversarial network (GAN) and residual feature aggregation (RFA) to improve detection performance. The novelty of the method is threefold: first, a framework is proposed, independent of the final object detector used in research, i.e., YOLOv3 could be replaced with Faster R-CNN or any object detector to perform object detection; second, a residual feature aggregation network was used in the generator, which significantly improved the detection performance as the RFA network detected complex features; and third, the whole network was transformed into a cyclic GAN. The image super-resolution cyclic GAN with RFA and YOLO as the detection network is termed as SRCGAN-RFA-YOLO, which is compared with the detection accuracies of other methods. Rigorous experiments on both satellite images and aerial images (ISPRS Potsdam, VAID, and Draper Satellite Image Chronology datasets) were performed, and the results showed that the detection performance increased by using super-resolution methods for spatial resolution enhancement; for an IoU of 0.10, AP of 0.7867 was achieved for a scale factor of 16.},

This study focused on assessing, comparing, and discussing the performances and limitations of satellite and UAV-based imagery in terms of canopy development, i.e., the leaf area index (LAI), and yield, i.e., the dry aboveground biomass (DAGB), for maize. Three commercial maize fields were studied over four seasons to obtain the LAI and DAGB. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) from satellite platforms (Landsat 5TM, 7 ETM+, 8OLI, and Sentinel 2A MSI) and the VARI and green canopy cover (GCC) from UAV imagery were compared. The remote sensing predictors in addition to the growing degree days (GDD) were assessed to estimate the LAI and DAGB using multilinear regression models (MRMs). For LAI estimation, better adjustments were obtained when predictors from the UAV platform were considered. The DAGB estimation revealed similar adjustments for both platforms, although the Landsat imagery offered slightly better adjustments. The results obtained in this study demonstrate the advantage of remote sensing platforms as a useful tool to estimate essential agronomic features.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of topographic airborne LiDAR data has become an essential part of archaeological prospection, and the need for an archaeology-specific data processing workflow is well known. It is therefore surprising that little attention has been paid to the key element of processing: an archaeology-specific DEM. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to describe an archaeology-specific DEM in detail, provide a tool for its automatic precision assessment, and determine the appropriate grid resolution. We define an archaeology-specific DEM as a subtype of DEM, which is interpolated from ground points, buildings, and four morphological types of archaeological features. We introduce a confidence map (QGIS plug-in) that assigns a confidence level to each grid cell. This is primarily used to attach a confidence level to each archaeological feature, which is useful for detecting data bias in archaeological interpretation. Confidence mapping is also an effective tool for identifying the optimal grid resolution for specific datasets. Beyond archaeological applications, the confidence map provides clear criteria for segmentation, which is one of the unsolved problems of DEM interpolation. All of these are important steps towards the general methodological maturity of airborne LiDAR in archaeology, which is our ultimate goal.},

ABSTRACT = {A contemporary review of land administration, from the perspective of systems maintenance, is provided. A special emphasis is placed on emerging fit-for-purpose land administration solutions. The research synthesis uses reputable sources from the contemporary era. Results show the challenges of maintaining land administration systems and the data held are long recognized. The 1970s–1980s gave the issue impetus as data and processes moved from paper-based and manual to digital and automated. The 1990s recognized concerns on maintenance, albeit as a secondary issue: system establishment was the primary concern. The 2000s placed more emphasis on more holistic sociotechnical systems but, again maintenance was supplementary. The fit-for-purpose era deliveres a vast range of new social and technological innovations; however, scaled and sustainable implementations still struggle with system maintenance. From the findings, a consolidated model for analyzing maintenance problems and solutions at jurisdictional level is developed. Maintenance of a land administration system can be understood by identifying the level of change, method for change, components to change, and options for what to change to. The United Nations-endorsed Framework for Effective Land Administration is then used to identify specific maintenance challenges and available solutions. It is suggested that due to the scope and size of what can be considered maintenance issues, there exists no single solution—instead the country should identify its persistant maintenance problems, and the most appropriate solution set from the suite of available options. Emerging solutions and challenges include ensuring interlinkage to maintenance of spatial planning, land valuation, and marine administration; exploiting survey data ‘back capture’ initiatives; supporting grassroots IT; and giving serious attention to cybersecurity concerns.},

ABSTRACT = {With the emerging interest in the autonomous driving level at 4 and 5 comes a necessity to provide accurate and versatile frameworks to evaluate the algorithms used in autonomous vehicles. There is a clear gap in the field of autonomous driving simulators. It covers testing and parameter tuning of a key component of autonomous driving systems, SLAM, frameworks targeting off-road and safety-critical environments. It also includes taking into consideration the non-idealistic nature of the real-life sensors, associated phenomena and measurement errors. We created a LiDAR simulator that delivers accurate 3D point clouds in real time. The point clouds are generated based on the sensor placement and the LiDAR type that can be set using configurable parameters. We evaluate our solution based on comparison of the results using an actual device, Velodyne VLP-16, on real-life tracks and the corresponding simulations. We measure the error values obtained using Google Cartographer SLAM algorithm and the distance between the simulated and real point clouds to verify their accuracy. The results show that our simulation (which incorporates measurement errors and the rolling shutter effect) produces data that can successfully imitate the real-life point clouds. Due to dedicated mechanisms, it is compatible with the Robotic Operating System (ROS) and can be used interchangeably with data from actual sensors, which enables easy testing, SLAM algorithm parameter tuning and deployment.},

ABSTRACT = {Miniature hyperspectral and thermal cameras onboard lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) bring new opportunities for monitoring land surface variables at unprecedented fine spatial resolution with acceptable accuracy. This research applies hyperspectral and thermal imagery from a drone to quantify upland rice productivity and water use efficiency (WUE) after biochar application in Costa Rica. The field flights were conducted over two experimental groups with bamboo biochar (BC1) and sugarcane biochar (BC2) amendments and one control (C) group without biochar application. Rice canopy biophysical variables were estimated by inverting a canopy radiative transfer model on hyperspectral reflectance. Variations in gross primary productivity (GPP) and WUE across treatments were estimated using light-use efficiency and WUE models respectively from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), canopy chlorophyll content (CCC), and evapotranspiration rate. We found that GPP was increased by 41.9 ± 3.4% in BC1 and 17.5 ± 3.4% in BC2 versus C, which may be explained by higher soil moisture after biochar application, and consequently significantly higher WUEs by 40.8 ± 3.5% in BC1 and 13.4 ± 3.5% in BC2 compared to C. This study demonstrated the use of hyperspectral and thermal imagery from a drone to quantify biochar effects on dry cropland by integrating ground measurements and physical models.},

ABSTRACT = {Quality tree species information gathering is the basis for making proper decisions in forest management. By applying new technologies and remote sensing methods, very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery can give sufficient spatial detail to achieve accurate species-level classification. In this study, the influence of pansharpening of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite imagery on classification results of three main tree species (Quercus robur L., Carpinus betulus L., and Alnus glutinosa (L.) Geartn.) has been evaluated. In order to increase tree species classification accuracy, three different pansharpening algorithms (Bayes, RCS, and LMVM) have been conducted. The LMVM algorithm proved the most effective pansharpening technique. The pixel- and object-based classification were applied to three pansharpened imageries using a random forest (RF) algorithm. The results showed a very high overall accuracy (OA) for LMVM pansharpened imagery: 92% and 96% for tree species classification based on pixel- and object-based approach, respectively. As expected, the object-based exceeded the pixel-based approach (OA increased by 4%). The influence of fusion on classification results was analyzed as well. Overall classification accuracy was improved by the spatial resolution of pansharpened images (OA increased by 7% for pixel-based approach). Also, regardless of pixel- or object-based classification approaches, the influence of the use of pansharpening is highly beneficial to classifying complex, natural, and mixed deciduous forest areas.},

ABSTRACT = {Estimating the main hydrodynamic features of real vegetated water bodies is crucial to assure a balance between their hydraulic conveyance and environmental quality. Riparian vegetation stands have a high impact on vegetated channels. The present work has the aim to integrate riparian vegetation’s reflectance indices and hydrodynamics of real vegetated water flows to assess the impact of riparian vegetation morphometry on bulk drag coefficients distribution along an abandoned vegetated drainage channel fully covered by 9–10 m high Arundo donax (commonly known as giant reed) stands, starting from flow average velocities measurements at 30 cross-sections identified along the channel. A map of riparian vegetation cover was obtained through digital processing of Unnamed Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-acquired multispectral images, which represent a fast way to observe riparian plants’ traits in hardly accessible areas such as vegetated water bodies in natural conditions. In this study, the portion of riparian plants effectively interacting with flow was expressed in terms of ground-based Leaf Area Index measurements (LAI), which easily related to UAV-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The comparative analysis between Arundo donax stands NDVI and LAI map enabled the analysis of the impact of UAV-acquired multispectral imagery on bulk drag predictions along the vegetated drainage channel.},

ABSTRACT = {Weed management is a crucial issue in agriculture, resulting in environmental in-field and off-field impacts. Within Agriculture 4.0, adoption of UASs combined with spatially explicit approaches may drastically reduce doses of herbicides, increasing sustainability in weed management. However, Agriculture 4.0 technologies are barely adopted in small-medium size farms. Recently, small and low-cost UASs, together with open-source software packages, may represent a low-cost spatially explicit system to map weed distribution in crop fields. The general aim is to map weed distribution by a low-cost UASs and a replicable workflow, completely based on open GIS software and algorithms: OpenDroneMap, QGIS, SAGA and OpenCV classification algorithms. Specific objectives are: (i) testing a low-cost UAS for weed mapping; (ii) assessing open-source packages for semi-automatic weed classification; (iii) performing a sustainable management scenario by prescription maps. Results showed high performances along the whole process: in orthomosaic generation at very high spatial resolution (0.01 m/pixel), in testing weed detection (Matthews Correlation Coefficient: 0.67–0.74), and in the production of prescription maps, reducing herbicide treatment to only 3.47% of the entire field. This study reveals the feasibility of low-cost UASs combined with open-source software, enabling a spatially explicit approach for weed management in small-medium size farmlands.},

ABSTRACT = {In a precision agriculture context, the amount of geospatial data available can be difficult to interpret in order to understand the crop variability within a given terrain parcel, raising the need for specific tools for data processing and analysis. This is the case for data acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), in which the high spatial resolution along with data from several spectral wavelengths makes data interpretation a complex process regarding vegetation monitoring. Vegetation Indices (VIs) are usually computed, helping in the vegetation monitoring process. However, a crop plot is generally composed of several non-crop elements, which can bias the data analysis and interpretation. By discarding non-crop data, it is possible to compute the vigour distribution for a specific crop within the area under analysis. This article presents QVigourMaps, a new open source application developed to generate useful outputs for precision agriculture purposes. The application was developed in the form of a QGIS plugin, allowing the creation of vigour maps, vegetation distribution maps and prescription maps based on the combination of different VIs and height information. Multi-temporal data from a vineyard plot and a maize field were used as case studies in order to demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the QVigourMaps tool. The presented application can contribute to making the right management decisions by providing indicators of crop variability, and the outcomes can be used in the field to apply site-specific treatments according to the levels of vigour.},

ABSTRACT = {The 2018–2019 Central European drought had a grave impact on natural and managed ecosystems, affecting their health and productivity. We examined patterns in hyperspectral VNIR imagery using an unsupervised learning approach to improve ecosystem monitoring and the understanding of grassland drought responses. The main objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the application of simplex volume maximisation (SiVM), an unsupervised learning method, for the detection of grassland drought stress in high-dimensional remote sensing data at the ecosystem scale and (2) to analyse the contributions of different spectral plant and soil traits to the computed stress signal. The drought status of the research site was assessed with a non-parametric standardised precipitation–evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and soil moisture measurements. We used airborne HySpex VNIR-1800 data from spring 2018 and 2019 to compare vegetation condition at the onset of the drought with the state after one year. SiVM, an interpretable matrix factorisation technique, was used to derive typical extreme spectra (archetypes) from the hyperspectral data. The classification of archetypes allowed for the inference of qualitative drought stress levels. The results were evaluated using a set of geophysical measurements and vegetation indices as proxy variables for drought-inhibited vegetation growth. The successful application of SiVM for grassland stress detection at the ecosystem canopy scale was verified in a correlation analysis. The predictor importance was assessed with boosted beta regression. In the resulting interannual stress model, carotenoid-related variables had among the highest coefficient values. The significance of the photochemical reflectance index that uses 512 nm as reference wavelength (PRI512) demonstrates the value of combining imaging spectrometry and unsupervised learning for the monitoring of vegetation stress. It also shows the potential of archetypical reflectance spectra to be used for the remote estimation of photosynthetic efficiency. More conclusive results could be achieved by using vegetation measurements instead of proxy variables for evaluation. It must also be investigated how the method can be generalised across ecosystems.},

ABSTRACT = {To address the threat of drones intruding into high-security areas, the real-time detection of drones is urgently required to protect these areas. There are two main difficulties in real-time detection of drones. One of them is that the drones move quickly, which leads to requiring faster detectors. Another problem is that small drones are difficult to detect. In this paper, firstly, we achieve high detection accuracy by evaluating three state-of-the-art object detection methods: RetinaNet, FCOS, YOLOv3 and YOLOv4. Then, to address the first problem, we prune the convolutional channel and shortcut layer of YOLOv4 to develop thinner and shallower models. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of small drone detection, we implement a special augmentation for small object detection by copying and pasting small drones. Experimental results verify that compared to YOLOv4, our pruned-YOLOv4 model, with 0.8 channel prune rate and 24 layers prune, achieves 90.5% mAP and its processing speed is increased by 60.4%. Additionally, after small object augmentation, the precision and recall of the pruned-YOLOv4 almost increases by 22.8% and 12.7%, respectively. Experiment results verify that our pruned-YOLOv4 is an effective and accurate approach for drone detection.},

ABSTRACT = {When the use of optical images is not practical due to cloud cover, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is a preferred alternative for monitoring coastal wetlands because it is unaffected by weather conditions. Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) enables the detection of different backscattering mechanisms and thus has potential applications in land cover classification. Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese civilian satellite with multi-polarized C-band SAR imaging capability. Coastal wetland classification with GF-3 polarimetric SAR imagery has attracted increased attention in recent years, but it remains challenging. The aim of this study was to classify land cover in coastal wetlands using an object-oriented random forest algorithm on the basis of GF-3 polarimetric SAR imagery. First, a set of 16 commonly used SAR features was extracted. Second, the importance of each SAR feature was calculated, and the optimal polarimetric features were selected for wetland classification by combining random forest (RF) with sequential backward selection (SBS). Finally, the proposed algorithm was utilized to classify different land cover types in the Yancheng Coastal Wetlands. The results show that the most important parameters for wetland classification in this study were Shannon entropy, Span and orientation randomness, combined with features derived from Yamaguchi decomposition, namely, volume scattering, double scattering, surface scattering and helix scattering. When the object-oriented RF classification approach was used with the optimal feature combination, different land cover types in the study area were classified, with an overall accuracy of up to 92%.},

ABSTRACT = {Leaf age and plant centre are important phenotypic information of weeds, and accurate identification of them plays an important role in understanding the morphological structure of weeds, guiding precise targeted spraying and reducing the use of herbicides. In this work, a weed segmentation method based on BlendMask is proposed to obtain the phenotypic information of weeds under complex field conditions. This study collected images from different angles (front, side, and top views) of three kinds of weeds (Solanum nigrum, barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli), and Abutilon theophrasti Medicus) in a maize field. Two datasets (with and without data enhancement) and two backbone networks (ResNet50 and ResNet101) were replaced to improve model performance. Finally, seven evaluation indicators are used to evaluate the segmentation results of the model under different angles. The results indicated that data enhancement and ResNet101 as the backbone network could enhance the model performance. The F1 value of the plant centre is 0.9330, and the recognition accuracy of leaf age can reach 0.957. The mIOU value of the top view is 0.642. Therefore, deep learning methods can effectively identify weed leaf age and plant centre, which is of great significance for variable spraying.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote sensing (RS) has been widely adopted as a tool to investigate several biotic and abiotic factors, directly and indirectly, related to biodiversity conservation. European grasslands are one of the most biodiverse habitats in Europe. Most of these habitats are subject to priority conservation measure, and several human-induced processes threaten them. The broad expansions of few dominant species are usually reported as drivers of biodiversity loss. In this context, using Sentinel-2 (S2) images, we investigate the distribution of one of the most spreading species in the Central Apennine: Brachypodium genuense. We performed a binary Random Forest (RF) classification of B. genuense using RS images and field-sampled presence/absence data. Then, we integrate the occurrences obtained from RS classification into species distribution models to identify the topographic drivers of B. genuense distribution in the study area. Lastly, the impact of B. genuense distribution in the Natura 2000 (N2k) habitats (Annex I of the European Habitat Directive) was assessed by overlay analysis. The RF classification process detected cover of B. genuense with an overall accuracy of 94.79%. The topographic species distribution model shows that the most relevant topographic variables that influence the distribution of B. genuense are slope, elevation, solar radiation, and topographic wet index (TWI) in order of importance. The overlay analysis shows that 74.04% of the B. genuense identified in the study area falls on the semi-natural dry grasslands. The study highlights the RS classification and the topographic species distribution model’s importance as an integrated workflow for mapping a broad-expansion species such as B. genuense. The coupled techniques presented in this work should apply to other plant communities with remotely recognizable characteristics for more effective management of N2k habitats.},

ABSTRACT = {Lightweight UAVs equipped with deep learning models have become a trend, which can be deployed for automatic navigation in a wide range of civilian and military missions. However, real-time applications usually need to process a large amount of image data, which leads to a very large computational complexity and storage consumption, and restricts its deployment on resource-constrained embedded edge devices. To reduce the computing requirements and storage occupancy of the neural network model, we proposed the ensemble binarized DroNet (EBDN) model, which implemented the reconstructed DroNet with the binarized and ensemble learning method, so that the model size of DroNet was effectively compressed, and ensemble learning method was used to overcome the defect of the poor performance of the low-precision network. Compared to the original DroNet, EBDN saves more than 7 times of memory footprint with similar model accuracy. Meanwhile, we also proposed a novel and high-efficiency hardware architecture to realize the EBDN on the chip (EBDNoC) system, which perfectly realizes the mapping of an algorithm model to hardware architecture. Compared to other solutions, the proposed architecture achieves about 10.21 GOP/s/kLUTs resource efficiency and 208.1 GOP/s/W energy efficiency, while also providing a good trade-off between model performance and resource utilization.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, construction projects are getting more complex, applying more information and communication technologies (ICT), while few studies use real-time data to dynamically optimize construction. The purpose of this article is to study the current development status of the optimization applied dynamically in the construction phase and their potential for applying real data collected by ICT. This article reviews 72 relevant optimization methods and identified some of the ICT research studies that can provide them with dynamic data. The dynamic triggering mode of each research is first analyzed, then its dynamic way, dynamic data, data resource, optimization object, and method are identified and formulated. The results reveal the great value of dynamic optimization in dealing with the complicated and uncertain contextual conditions in construction. Different dynamic triggering modes have different affinities with real data. Then, through the analysis of ICT articles, the huge potential of these dynamic optimization methods in applying real data is shown. This paper points out the most practical dynamic mode for engineers or managers to continuously apply optimization methods to solve dynamic problems in construction, and put forward scientific questions for related researchers: How does one combine ICT with the event dynamics or uncertain parameters? Based on this, the research gap of this area is identified a conceptual solution is proposed.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper concerns multicast packet traffic throughput maximization in multi-hop wireless sensor networks with time division multiple access to radio channel. We assume that the modulation and coding schemes (MCSs) that are used by the (broadcasting) nodes as well as the transmission power of the nodes are adjustable. This leads to the main research question studied in this paper: to what extent traffic throughput can be increased by proper MCSs assignment and transmission power control (TPC) at the nodes? To answer this question, we introduce mixed-integer programming formulations for joint MCSs assignment and TPC optimization, together with a solution algorithm. Finally, we present a numerical study illustrating the considerations of the paper. The numerical results show a significant gain being achieved by proper MCSs assignment, which is further increased by applying TPC.},

ABSTRACT = {Identifying agricultural fields that grow cabbage in the highlands of South Korea is critical for accurate crop yield estimation. Only grown for a limited time during the summer, highland cabbage accounts for a significant proportion of South Korea’s annual cabbage production. Thus, it has a profound effect on the formation of cabbage prices. Traditionally, labor-extensive and time-consuming field surveys are manually carried out to derive agricultural field maps of the highlands. Recently, high-resolution overhead images of the highlands have become readily available with the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and remote sensing technology. In addition, deep learning-based semantic segmentation models have quickly advanced by recent improvements in algorithms and computational resources. In this study, we propose a semantic segmentation framework based on state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to automate the process of identifying cabbage cultivation fields. We operated UAVs and collected 2010 multispectral images under different spatiotemporal conditions to measure how well semantic segmentation models generalize. Next, we manually labeled these images at a pixel-level to obtain ground truth labels for training. Our results demonstrate that our framework performs well in detecting cabbage fields not only in areas included in the training data but also in unseen areas not included in the training data. Moreover, we analyzed the effects of infrared wavelengths on the performance of identifying cabbage fields. Based on the results of our framework, we expect agricultural officials to reduce time and manpower when identifying information about highlands cabbage fields by replacing field surveys.},

ABSTRACT = {Forest-type classification is a very complex and difficult subject. The complexity increases with urban and peri-urban forests because of the variety of features that exist in remote sensing images. The success of forest management that includes forest preservation depends strongly on the accuracy of forest-type classification. Several classification methods are used to map urban and peri-urban forests and to identify healthy and non-healthy ones. Some of these methods have shown success in the classification of forests where others failed. The successful methods used specific remote sensing data technology, such as hyper-spectral and very high spatial resolution (VHR) images. However, both VHR and hyper-spectral sensors are very expensive, and hyper-spectral sensors are not widely available on satellite platforms, unlike multi-spectral sensors. Moreover, aerial images are limited in use, very expensive, and hard to arrange and manage. To solve the aforementioned problems, an advanced method, self-organizing–deep learning (SO-UNet), was created to classify forests in the urban and peri-urban environment using multi-spectral, multi-temporal, and medium spatial resolution Sentinel-2 images. SO-UNet is a combination of two different machine learning technologies: artificial neural network unsupervised self-organizing maps and deep learning UNet. Many experiments have been conducted, and the results showed that SO-UNet overwhelms UNet significantly. The experiments encompassed different settings for the parameters that control the algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used extensively for search and rescue operations, surveillance, disaster monitoring, attacking terrorists, etc. due to their growing advantages of low-cost, high maneuverability, and easy deployability. This study proposes a mixed-integer programming model under a multi-objective optimization framework to design trajectories that enable a set of UAVs to execute surveillance tasks. The first objective maximizes the cumulative probability of target detection to aim for mission planning success. The second objective ensures minimization of cumulative path length to provide a higher resource utilization goal. A two-step variable neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is offered, which addresses the combinatorial optimization issue for determining the near-optimal sequence for cell visiting to reach the target. Numerical experiments and simulation results are evaluated in numerous benchmark instances. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach can favorably support practical deployability purposes.},

ABSTRACT = {There is considerable interest in multirobot systems capable of performing spatially distributed, hazardous, and complex tasks as a team leveraging the unique abilities of humans and automated machines working alongside each other. The limitations of human perception and cognition affect operators’ ability to integrate information from multiple mobile robots, switch between their spatial frames of reference, and divide attention among many sensory inputs and command outputs. Automation is necessary to help the operator manage increasing demands as the number of robots (and humans) scales up. However, more automation does not necessarily equate to better performance. A generalized robot confidence model was developed, which transforms key operator attention indicators to a robot confidence value for each robot to enable the robots’ adaptive behaviors. This model was implemented in a multirobot test platform with the operator commanding robot trajectories using a computer mouse and an eye tracker providing gaze data used to estimate dynamic operator attention. The human-attention-based robot confidence model dynamically adapted the behavior of individual robots in response to operator attention. The model was successfully evaluated to reveal evidence linking average robot confidence to multirobot search task performance and efficiency. The contributions of this work provide essential steps toward effective human operation of multiple unmanned vehicles to perform spatially distributed and hazardous tasks in complex environments for space exploration, defense, homeland security, search and rescue, and other real-world applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart cities use digital technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things, or open data in order to overcome limitations of traditional representation and exchange of geospatial data. This concept ensures a significant increase in the use of data to establish new services that contribute to better sustainable development and monitoring of all phenomena that occur in urban areas. The use of the modern geoinformation technologies, such as sensors for collecting different geospatial and related data, requires adequate storage options for further data analysis. In this paper, we suggest the biG dAta sMart cIty maNagEment SyStem (GAMINESS) that is based on the Apache Spark big data framework. The model of the GAMINESS management system is based on the principles of the big data modeling, which differs greatly from standard databases. This approach provides the ability to store and manage huge amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in real time. System performance is increasing to a higher level by using the process parallelization explained through the five V principles of the big data paradigm. The existing solutions based on the five V principles are focused only on the data visualization, not the data themselves. Such solutions are often limited by different storage mechanisms and by the ability to perform complex analyses on large amounts of data with expected performance. The GAMINESS management system overcomes these disadvantages by conversion of smart city data to a big data structure without limitations related to data formats or use standards. The suggested model contains two components: a geospatial component and a sensor component that are based on the CityGML and the SensorThings standards. The developed model has the ability to exchange data regardless of the used standard or the data format into proposed Apache Spark data framework schema. The verification of the proposed model is done within the case study for the part of the city of Novi Sad.},

ABSTRACT = {The traditional frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar two-dimensional (2D) super-resolution (SR) estimation algorithm for target localization has high computational complexity, which runs counter to the increasing demand for real-time radar imaging. In this paper, a fast joint direction-of-arrival (DOA) and range estimation framework for target localization is proposed; it utilizes a very deep super-resolution (VDSR) neural network (NN) framework to accelerate the imaging process while ensuring estimation accuracy. Firstly, we propose a fast low-resolution imaging algorithm based on the Nystrom method. The approximate signal subspace matrix is obtained from partial data, and low-resolution imaging is performed on a low-density grid. Then, the bicubic interpolation algorithm is used to expand the low-resolution image to the desired dimensions. Next, the deep SR network is used to obtain the high-resolution image, and the final joint DOA and range estimation is achieved based on the reconstructed image. Simulations and experiments were carried out to validate the computational efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, there have been rapid improvements in both remote sensing methods and satellite image availability that have the potential to massively improve burn severity assessments of the Alaskan boreal forest. In this study, we utilized recent pre- and post-fire Sentinel-2 satellite imagery of the 2019 Nugget Creek and Shovel Creek burn scars located in Interior Alaska to both assess burn severity across the burn scars and test the effectiveness of several remote sensing methods for generating accurate map products: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classification. We used 52 Composite Burn Index (CBI) plots from the Shovel Creek burn scar and 28 from the Nugget Creek burn scar for training classifiers and product validation. For the Shovel Creek burn scar, the RF and SVM machine learning (ML) classification methods outperformed the traditional spectral indices that use linear regression to separate burn severity classes (RF and SVM accuracy, 83.33%, versus NBR accuracy, 73.08%). However, for the Nugget Creek burn scar, the NDVI product (accuracy: 96%) outperformed the other indices and ML classifiers. In this study, we demonstrated that when sufficient ground truth data is available, the ML classifiers can be very effective for reliable mapping of burn severity in the Alaskan boreal forest. Since the performance of ML classifiers are dependent on the quantity of ground truth data, when sufficient ground truth data is available, the ML classification methods would be better at assessing burn severity, whereas with limited ground truth data the traditional spectral indices would be better suited. We also looked at the relationship between burn severity, fuel type, and topography (aspect and slope) and found that the relationship is site-dependent.},

ABSTRACT = {In the Industrial Internet, computing- and power-limited mobile devices (MDs) in the production process can hardly support the computation-intensive or time-sensitive applications. As a new computing paradigm, mobile edge computing (MEC) can almost meet the requirements of latency and calculation by handling tasks approximately close to MDs. However, the limited battery capacity of MDs causes unreliable task offloading in MEC, which will increase the system overhead and reduce the economic efficiency of manufacturing in actual production. To make the offloading scheme adaptive to that uncertain mobile environment, this paper considers the reliability of MDs, which is defined as residual energy after completing a computation task. In more detail, we first investigate the task offloading in MEC and also consider reliability as an important criterion. To optimize the system overhead caused by task offloading, we then construct the mathematical models for two different computing modes, namely, local computing and remote computing, and formulate task offloading as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. To effectively solve the optimization problem, we further propose a heuristic algorithm based on greedy policy (HAGP). The algorithm achieves the optimal CPU cycle frequency for local computing and the optimal transmission power for remote computing by alternating optimization (AP) methods. It then makes the optimal offloading decision for each MD with a minimal system overhead in both of these two modes by the greedy policy under the limited wireless channels constraint. Finally, multiple experiments are simulated to verify the advantages of HAGP, and the results strongly confirm that the considered task offloading reliability of MDs can reduce the system overhead and further save energy consumption to prolong the life of the battery and support more computation tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Smart cities and communities (SCC) constitute a new paradigm in urban development. SCC ideate a data-centered society aimed at improving efficiency by automating and optimizing activities and utilities. Information and communication technology along with Internet of Things enables data collection and with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) situation awareness can be obtained to feed the SCC actors with enriched knowledge. This paper describes AI perspectives in SCC and gives an overview of AI-based technologies used in traffic to enable road vehicle automation and smart traffic control. Perception, smart traffic control and driver modeling are described along with open research challenges and standardization to help introduce advanced driver assistance systems and automated vehicle functionality in traffic. To fully realize the potential of SCC, to create a holistic view on a city level, availability of data from different stakeholders is necessary. Further, though AI technologies provide accurate predictions and classifications, there is an ambiguity regarding the correctness of their outputs. This can make it difficult for the human operator to trust the system. Today there are no methods that can be used to match function requirements with the level of detail in data annotation in order to train an accurate model. Another challenge related to trust is explainability: models can have difficulty explaining how they came to certain conclusions, so it is difficult for humans to trust them.},

ABSTRACT = {The volume of remote sensing images continues to grow as image sources become more diversified and with increasing spatial and spectral resolution. The handling of such large-volume datasets, which exceed available CPU memory, in a timely and efficient manner is becoming a challenge for single machines. The distributed cluster provides an effective solution with strong calculation power. There has been an increasing number of big data technologies that have been adopted to deal with large images using mature parallel technology. However, since most commercial big data platforms are not specifically developed for the remote sensing field, two main issues exist in processing large images with big data platforms using a distributed cluster. On the one hand, the quantities and categories of official algorithms used to process remote sensing images in big data platforms are limited compared to large amounts of sequential algorithms. On the other hand, the sequential algorithms employed directly to process large images in parallel over a distributed cluster may lead to incomplete objects in the tile edges and the generation of large communication volumes at the shuffle stage. It is, therefore, necessary to explore the distributed strategy and adapt the sequential algorithms over the distributed cluster. In this research, we employed two seed-based image segmentation algorithms to construct a distributed strategy based on the Spark platform. The proposed strategy focuses on modifying the incomplete objects by processing border areas and reducing the communication volume to a reasonable size by limiting the auxiliary bands and the buffer size to a small range during the shuffle stage. We calculated the F-measure and execution time to evaluate the accuracy and execution efficiency. The statistical data reveal that both segmentation algorithms maintained high accuracy, as achieved in the reference image segmented in the sequential way. Moreover, generally the strategy took less execution time compared to significantly larger auxiliary bands and buffer sizes. The proposed strategy can modify incomplete objects, with execution time being twice as fast as the strategies that do not employ communication volume reduction in the distributed cluster.},

ABSTRACT = {In mobile edge computing (MEC), partial computational offloading can be intelligently investigated to reduce the energy consumption and service delay of user equipment (UE) by dividing a single task into different components. Some of the components execute locally on the UE while the remaining are offloaded to a mobile edge server (MES). In this paper, we investigate the partial offloading technique in MEC using a supervised deep learning approach. The proposed technique, comprehensive and energy efficient deep learning-based offloading technique (CEDOT), intelligently selects the partial offloading policy and also the size of each component of a task to reduce the service delay and energy consumption of UEs. We use deep learning to find, simultaneously, the best partitioning of a single task with the best offloading policy. The deep neural network (DNN) is trained through a comprehensive dataset, generated from our mathematical model, which reduces the time delay and energy consumption of the overall process. Due to the complexity and computation of the mathematical model in the algorithm being high, due to trained DNN the complexity and computation are minimized in the proposed work. We propose a comprehensive cost function, which depends on various delays, energy consumption, radio resources, and computation resources. Furthermore, the cost function also depends on energy consumption and delay due to the task-division-process in partial offloading. None of the literature work considers the partitioning along with the computational offloading policy, and hence, the time and energy consumption due to task-division-process are ignored in the cost function. The proposed work considers all the important parameters in the cost function and generates a comprehensive training dataset with high computation and complexity. Once we get the training dataset, then the complexity is minimized through trained DNN which gives faster decision making with low energy consumptions. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique with high accuracy of the DNN in deciding offloading policy and partitioning of a task with minimum delay and energy consumption for UE. More than 70% accuracy of the trained DNN is achieved through a comprehensive training dataset. The simulation results also show the constant accuracy of the DNN when the UEs are moving which means the decision making of the offloading policy and partitioning are not affected by the mobility of UEs.},

ABSTRACT = {Swarm robotics is an emerging field that can offer efficient solutions to real-world problems with minimal cost. Despite recent developments in the field, however, it is still not sufficiently mature, and challenges clearly remain. The dynamic deadline problem is neglected in the literature, and thus, time-sensitive foraging tasks are still an open research problem. This paper proposes a novel approach—ED_Foraging—that allows simple robots with limited sensing and communication abilities to perform complex foraging tasks that are dynamic and time constrained. A new mathematical model is developed in this paper to utilize epidemiological modeling and predict the dynamics of resource deadlines. Moreover, an improved dynamic task allocation (DTA) method is proposed to assign robots to the most critical region, where a deadline is represented by a state and time. The main goal is to reduce the number of expired resources and collect them as quickly as possible by giving priority to those that are more likely to expire if not collected. The deadlines are unknown and change dynamically. Thus, the robots continuously collect local information throughout their journeys and allocate themselves dynamically to the predicted hotspots. In the experiments, the proposed approach is adapted to four DTA methods and tested with different setups using simulated foot-bot robots. The flexibility, scalability, and robustness of this approach are measured in terms of the foraging and expiration rates. The empirical results support the hypothesis that epidemiological modeling can be utilized to handle foraging tasks that are constrained by dynamic deadlines. It is also confirmed that the proposed DTA method improves the results, which were found to be flexible, scalable, and robust to changes in the number of robots and the map size.},

ABSTRACT = {Weeds are among the major constraints to any crop production system, reducing productivity and profitability. Herbicides are among the most effective methods to control weeds, and reliance on herbicides for weed control has increased significantly with the advent of herbicide-resistant crops. Unfortunately, over-reliance on herbicides leads to environmental-health issues and herbicide-resistant weeds, causing human health and ecological concerns. Crop diversification can help manage weeds sustainably in major crop production systems. It acts as an organizing principle under which technological innovations and ecological insights can be combined to manage weeds sustainably. Diversified cropping can be defined as the conscious inclusion of functional biodiversity at temporal and/or spatial levels to improve the productivity and stability of ecosystem services. Crop diversification helps to reduce weed density by negatively impacting weed seed germination and weed growth. Additionally, diversified farming systems are more resilient to climate change than monoculture systems and provide better crop yield. However, there are a few challenges to adopting a diversified cropping system, ranging from technology innovations, government policies, farm-level decisions, climate change, and market conditions. In this review, we discuss how crop diversification supports sustainable weed management, the challenges associated with it, and the future of weed management with respect to the diversification concept.},

ABSTRACT = {Woody plant encroachment into grasslands ecosystems causes significantly ecological destruction and economic losses. Effective and efficient management largely benefits from accurate and timely detection of encroaching species at an early development stage. Recent advances in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) enabled easier access to ultra-high spatial resolution images at a centimeter level, together with the latest machine learning based image segmentation algorithms, making it possible to detect small-sized individuals of target species at early development stage and identify them when mixed with other species. However, few studies have investigated the optimal practical spatial resolution of early encroaching species detection. Hence, we investigated the performance of four popular semantic segmentation algorithms (decision tree, DT; random forest, RF; AlexNet; and ResNet) on a multi-species forest classification case with UAS-collected RGB images in original and down-sampled coarser spatial resolutions. The objective of this study was to explore the optimal segmentation algorithm and spatial resolution for eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana, ERC) early detection and its classification within a multi-species forest context. To be specific, firstly, we implemented and compared the performance of the four semantic segmentation algorithms with images in the original spatial resolution (0.694 cm). The highest overall accuracy was 0.918 achieved by ResNet with a mean interaction over union at 85.0%. Secondly, we evaluated the performance of ResNet algorithm with images in down-sampled spatial resolutions (1 cm to 5 cm with 0.5 cm interval). When applied on the down-sampled images, ERC segmentation performance decreased with decreasing spatial resolution, especially for those images coarser than 3 cm spatial resolution. The UAS together with the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms provides a promising tool for early-stage detection and localization of ERC and the development of effective management strategies for mixed-species forest management.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, the use of drones for surveillance tasks has been on the rise worldwide. However, in the context of anomaly detection, only normal events are available for the learning process. Therefore, the implementation of a generative learning method in an unsupervised mode to solve this problem becomes fundamental. In this context, we propose a new end-to-end architecture capable of generating optical flow images from original UAV images and extracting compact spatio-temporal characteristics for anomaly detection purposes. It is designed with a custom loss function as a sum of three terms, the reconstruction loss (Rl), the generation loss (Gl) and the compactness loss (Cl) to ensure an efficient classification of the “deep-one” class. In addition, we propose to minimize the effect of UAV motion in video processing by applying background subtraction on optical flow images. We tested our method on very complex datasets called the mini-drone video dataset, and obtained results surpassing existing techniques’ performances with an AUC of 85.3.},

ABSTRACT = {Insulator fault detection is one of the essential tasks for high-voltage transmission lines’ intelligent inspection. In this study, a modified model based on You Only Look Once (YOLO) is proposed for detecting insulator faults in aerial images with a complex background. Firstly, aerial images with one fault or multiple faults are collected in diverse scenes, and then a novel dataset is established. Secondly, to increase feature reuse and propagation in the low-resolution feature layers, a Cross Stage Partial Dense YOLO (CSPD-YOLO) model is proposed based on YOLO-v3 and the Cross Stage Partial Network. The feature pyramid network and improved loss function are adopted to the CSPD-YOLO model, improving the accuracy of insulator fault detection. Finally, the proposed CSPD-YOLO model and compared models are trained and tested on the established dataset. The average precision of CSPD-YOLO model is 4.9% and 1.8% higher than that of YOLO-v3 and YOLO-v4, and the running time of CSPD-YOLO (0.011 s) model is slightly longer than that of YOLO-v3 (0.01 s) and YOLO-v4 (0.01 s). Compared with the excellent object detection models YOLO-v3 and YOLO-v4, the experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed CSPD-YOLO model performs better in insulator fault detection from high-voltage transmission lines with a complex background.},

ABSTRACT = {Warming and drought are reducing global crop production with a potential to substantially worsen global malnutrition. As with the green revolution in the last century, plant genetics may offer concrete opportunities to increase yield and crop adaptability. However, the rate at which the threat is happening requires powering new strategies in order to meet the global food demand. In this review, we highlight major recent ‘big data’ developments from both empirical and theoretical genomics that may speed up the identification, conservation, and breeding of exotic and elite crop varieties with the potential to feed humans. We first emphasize the major bottlenecks to capture and utilize novel sources of variation in abiotic stress (i.e., heat and drought) tolerance. We argue that adaptation of crop wild relatives to dry environments could be informative on how plant phenotypes may react to a drier climate because natural selection has already tested more options than humans ever will. Because isolated pockets of cryptic diversity may still persist in remote semi-arid regions, we encourage new habitat-based population-guided collections for genebanks. We continue discussing how to systematically study abiotic stress tolerance in these crop collections of wild and landraces using geo-referencing and extensive environmental data. By uncovering the genes that underlie the tolerance adaptive trait, natural variation has the potential to be introgressed into elite cultivars. However, unlocking adaptive genetic variation hidden in related wild species and early landraces remains a major challenge for complex traits that, as abiotic stress tolerance, are polygenic (i.e., regulated by many low-effect genes). Therefore, we finish prospecting modern analytical approaches that will serve to overcome this issue. Concretely, genomic prediction, machine learning, and multi-trait gene editing, all offer innovative alternatives to speed up more accurate pre- and breeding efforts toward the increase in crop adaptability and yield, while matching future global food demands in the face of increased heat and drought. In order for these ‘big data’ approaches to succeed, we advocate for a trans-disciplinary approach with open-source data and long-term funding. The recent developments and perspectives discussed throughout this review ultimately aim to contribute to increased crop adaptability and yield in the face of heat waves and drought events.},

ABSTRACT = {The need for civilian use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has drastically increased in recent years. Their potential applications for civilian use include door-to-door package delivery, law enforcement, first aid, and emergency services in urban areas, which put the UAVs into obstacle collision risk. Therefore, UAVs are required to be equipped with sensors so as to acquire Artificial Intelligence (AI) to avoid potential risks during mission execution. The AI comes with intensive training of an on-board machine that is responsible to autonomously navigate the UAV. The training enables the UAV to develop humanoid perception of the environment it is to be navigating in. During the mission, this perception detects and localizes objects in the environment. It is based on this AI that this work proposes a real-time three-dimensional (3D) path planner that maneuvers the UAV towards destination through obstacle-free path. The proposed path planner has a heuristic sense of A⋆ algorithm, but requires no frontier nodes to be stored in a memory unlike A⋆. The planner relies on relative locations of detected objects (obstacles) and determines collision-free paths. This path planner is light-weight and hence a fast guidance method for real-time purposes. Its performance efficiency is proved through rigorous Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulations in constrained-environment and preliminary real flight tests.},

ABSTRACT = {Plants are a major source of food for the world population. Plant diseases contribute to production loss, which can be tackled with continuous monitoring. Manual plant disease monitoring is both laborious and error-prone. Early detection of plant diseases using computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) can help to reduce the adverse effects of diseases and also overcome the shortcomings of continuous human monitoring. In this work, we propose the use of a deep learning architecture based on a recent convolutional neural network called EfficientNet on 18,161 plain and segmented tomato leaf images to classify tomato diseases. The performance of two segmentation models i.e., U-net and Modified U-net, for the segmentation of leaves is reported. The comparative performance of the models for binary classification (healthy and unhealthy leaves), six-class classification (healthy and various groups of diseased leaves), and ten-class classification (healthy and various types of unhealthy leaves) are also reported. The modified U-net segmentation model showed accuracy, IoU, and Dice score of 98.66%, 98.5%, and 98.73%, respectively, for the segmentation of leaf images. EfficientNet-B7 showed superior performance for the binary classification and six-class classification using segmented images with an accuracy of 99.95% and 99.12%, respectively. Finally, EfficientNet-B4 achieved an accuracy of 99.89% for ten-class classification using segmented images. It can be concluded that all the architectures performed better in classifying the diseases when trained with deeper networks on segmented images. The performance of each of the experimental studies reported in this work outperforms the existing literature.},

ABSTRACT = {Plant diseases are responsible for substantial crop losses each year and affect food security and agricultural sustainability. The improvement of crop resistance to pathogens through breeding represents an environmentally sound method for managing disease and minimizing these losses. The challenge is to breed varieties with a stable and broad-spectrum resistance. Different approaches, from markers to recent genomic and ‘post-genomic era’ technologies, will be reviewed in order to contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of host–pathogen interactions and genes, including those with small phenotypic effects and mechanisms that underlie resistance. An efficient combination of these approaches is herein proposed as the basis to develop a successful breeding strategy to obtain resistant crop varieties that yield higher in increasing disease scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {Oil palm crops are essential for ensuring sustainable edible oil production, in which production is highly dependent on fertilizer applications. Using Landsat-8 imageries, the feasibility of macronutrient level classification with Machine Learning (ML) was studied. Variable rates of compost and inorganic fertilizer were applied to experimental plots and the following nutrients were studied: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca). By applying image filters, separability metrics, vegetation indices (VI) and feature selection, spectral features for each plot were acquired and used with ML models to classify macronutrient levels of palm stands from chemical foliar analysis of their 17th frond. The models were calibrated and validated with 30 repetitions, with the best mean overall accuracy reported for N and K at 79.7 ± 4.3% and 76.6 ± 4.1% respectively, while accuracies for P, Mg and Ca could not be accurately classified due to the limitations of the dataset used. The study highlighted the effectiveness of separability metrics in quantifying class separability, the importance of indices for N and K level classification, and the effects of filter and feature selection on model performance, as well as concluding RF or SVM models for excessive N and K level detection. Future improvements should focus on further model validation and the use of higher-resolution imaging.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban green spaces (UGSs) provide essential environmental services for the well-being of ecosystems and society. Due to the constant environmental, social, and economic transformations of cities, UGSs pose new challenges for management, particularly in fast-growing metropolitan areas. With technological advancement and the evolution of deep learning, it is possible to optimize the acquisition of UGS inventories through the detection of geometric patterns present in satellite imagery. This research evaluates two deep learning model techniques for semantic segmentation of UGS polygons with the use of different convolutional neural network encoders on the U-Net architecture and very high resolution (VHR) imagery to obtain updated information on UGS polygons at the metropolitan area level. The best model yielded a Dice coefficient of 0.57, IoU of 0.75, recall of 0.80, and kappa coefficient of 0.94 with an overall accuracy of 0.97, which reflects a reliable performance of the network in detecting patterns that make up the varied geometry of UGSs. A complete database of UGS polygons was quantified and categorized by types with location and delimited by municipality, allowing for the standardization of the information at the metropolitan level, which will be useful for comparative analysis with a homogenized and updated database. This is of particular interest to urban planners and UGS decision-makers.},

ABSTRACT = {Deep learning has already been successfully used in the development of decision support systems in various domains. Therefore, there is an incentive to apply it in other important domains such as agriculture. Fertilizers, electricity, chemicals, human labor, and water are the components of total energy consumption in agriculture. Yield estimates are critical for food security, crop management, irrigation scheduling, and estimating labor requirements for harvesting and storage. Therefore, estimating product yield can reduce energy consumption. Two deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, have been developed for the analysis of time-series data such as agricultural datasets. In this paper, the capabilities of these models and their extensions, called Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units, to predict end-of-season yields are investigated. The models use historical data, including climate data, irrigation scheduling, and soil water content, to estimate end-of-season yield. The application of this technique was tested for tomato and potato yields at a site in Portugal. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term memory outperformed the Gated Recurrent Units network, the Long Short-Term Memory, and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units network on the validation dataset. The model was able to capture the nonlinear relationship between irrigation amount, climate data, and soil water content and predict yield with an MSE of 0.017 to 0.039. The performance of the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory in the test was compared with the most commonly used deep learning method, the Convolutional Neural Network, and machine learning methods including a Multi-Layer Perceptrons model and Random Forest Regression. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory outperformed the other models with an R2 score between 0.97 and 0.99. The results show that analyzing agricultural data with the Long Short-Term Memory model improves the performance of the model in terms of accuracy. The Convolutional Neural Network model achieved the second-best performance. Therefore, the deep learning model has a remarkable ability to predict the yield at the end of the season.},

ABSTRACT = {University campuses consists of many buildings within a large area managed by a single organization. Like 3D city modeling, a 3D model of campuses can be utilized to provide a better foundation for planning, navigation and management of buildings. This study approaches 3D modeling of the UTM campus by utilizing data from aerial photos and site observations. The 3D models of buildings were drawn from building footprints in SketchUp and converted to CityGML using FME software. The CityGML models were imported into a geodatabase using 3DCityDB and visualized in Cesium. The resulting 3D model of buildings was in CityGML format level of detail 2, consisting of ground, wall and roof surfaces. The 3D models were positioned with real-world coordinates using the geolocation function in SketchUp. The non-spatial attributes of the 3D models were also stored in a database managed by PostgreSQL. While the methodology demonstrated in this study was found to be able to create LoD2 building models. However, issues of accuracy arose in terms of building details and positioning. Therefore, higher accuracy data, such as point cloud data, should produce higher LoD models and accurate positioning.},

ABSTRACT = {Land surface phenology (LSP) has been extensively explored from global archives of satellite observations to track and monitor the seasonality of rangeland ecosystems in response to climate change. Long term monitoring of LSP provides large potential for the evaluation of interactions and feedbacks between climate and vegetation. With a special focus on the rangeland ecosystems, the paper reviews the progress, challenges and emerging opportunities in LSP while identifying possible gaps that could be explored in future. Specifically, the paper traces the evolution of satellite sensors and interrogates their properties as well as the associated indices and algorithms in estimating and monitoring LSP in productive rangelands. Findings from the literature revealed that the spectral characteristics of the early satellite sensors such as Landsat, AVHRR and MODIS played a critical role in the development of spectral vegetation indices that have been widely used in LSP applications. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pioneered LSP investigations, and most other spectral vegetation indices were primarily developed to address the weaknesses and shortcomings of the NDVI. New indices continue to be developed based on recent sensors such as Sentinel-2 that are characterized by unique spectral signatures and fine spatial resolutions, and their successful usage is catalyzed with the development of cutting-edge algorithms for modeling the LSP profiles. In this regard, the paper has documented several LSP algorithms that are designed to provide data smoothing, gap filling and LSP metrics retrieval methods in a single environment. In the future, the development of machine learning algorithms that can effectively model and characterize the phenological cycles of vegetation would help to unlock the value of LSP information in the rangeland monitoring and management process. Precisely, deep learning presents an opportunity to further develop robust software packages such as the decomposition and analysis of time series (DATimeS) with the abundance of data processing tools and techniques that can be used to better characterize the phenological cycles of vegetation in rangeland ecosystems.},

ABSTRACT = {The development of advanced computational models for improving the accuracy of streamflow forecasting could save time and cost for sustainable water resource management. In this study, a locally weighted learning (LWL) algorithm is combined with the Additive Regression (AR), Bagging (BG), Dagging (DG), Random Subspace (RS), and Rotation Forest (RF) ensemble techniques for the streamflow forecasting in the Jhelum Catchment, Pakistan. To build the models, we grouped the initial parameters into four different scenarios (M1–M4) of input data with a five-fold cross-validation (I–V) approach. To evaluate the accuracy of the developed ensemble models, previous lagged values of streamflow were used as inputs whereas the cross-validation technique and periodicity input were used to examine prediction accuracy on the basis of root correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative absolute error (RAE), and root relative squared error (RRSE). The results showed that the incorporation of periodicity (i.e., MN) as an additional input variable considerably improved both the training performance and predictive performance of the models. A comparison between the results obtained from the input combinations III and IV revealed a significant performance improvement. The cross-validation revealed that the dataset M3 provided more accurate results compared to the other datasets. While all the ensemble models successfully outperformed the standalone LWL model, the ensemble LWL-AR model was identified as the best model. Our study demonstrated that the ensemble modeling approach is a robust and promising alternative to the single forecasting of streamflow that should be further investigated with different datasets from other regions around the world.},

ABSTRACT = {Weeds are one of the most important factors affecting agricultural production. The waste and pollution of farmland ecological environment caused by full-coverage chemical herbicide spraying are becoming increasingly evident. With the continuous improvement in the agricultural production level, accurately distinguishing crops from weeds and achieving precise spraying only for weeds are important. However, precise spraying depends on accurately identifying and locating weeds and crops. In recent years, some scholars have used various computer vision methods to achieve this purpose. This review elaborates the two aspects of using traditional image-processing methods and deep learning-based methods to solve weed detection problems. It provides an overview of various methods for weed detection in recent years, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of existing methods, and introduces several related plant leaves, weed datasets, and weeding machinery. Lastly, the problems and difficulties of the existing weed detection methods are analyzed, and the development trend of future research is prospected.},

ABSTRACT = {When integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) occurred, tens of applications including smart agriculture have emerged to offer innovative solutions to modernize the farming sector. This paper aims to present a low-cost platform for comprehensive environmental parameter monitoring using flying IoT. This platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the period of March 2020 to March 2021. The experimental work fulfills the requirements of automated and real-time monitoring of the environmental parameters using both under- and aboveground sensors. These IoT sensors are on a farm collecting vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent to ground gateways every 1 h, after which the obtained data is collected and transmitted by a drone to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h. This low-cost platform can help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to predict environmental data over the geographically large farm field, which leads to enhancement in crop productivity and farm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained experimental results infer that automated and human-made sets of actions can be applied and/or suggested, due to the innovative integration between IoT sensors with the drone. These smart actions help in precision agriculture, which, in turn, intensely boost crop productivity, saving natural resources.},

ABSTRACT = {The São Pedro da Cova waste pile (Porto, Portugal) is composed of coal mining residues that have been self-burning since 2005 and is located close to an inhabited area and social infrastructures, further adding to effects on the environment and human health. Therefore, there is a great interest in the environmental monitoring of this waste pile. This work describes an integrative multi-approach that allows the environmental monitoring of several parameters of the waste pile, applying several technologies. The temperature measurements were obtained by a thermal infrared (TIR) sensor on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and supplemented with field measurements. In order to evaluate the altimetric variations, for each flight, a digital elevation model (DEM) was generated considering a multispectral sensor also on board the UAV. The hydrogeochemical characterization was performed through the analysis of groundwater and surface water samples, with and without the influence of mine drainage. The soil monitoring included the analysis of waste material as well as the surface soil in the surrounding area of the waste pile. All the data were analyzed and integrated in a geographical information system (GIS) open-source application. The adopted multi-approach methodology, given its intrinsic interdisciplinary character, has proven to be an effective way of encompassing the complexity of this type of environmental problem.},

ABSTRACT = {Current efforts aim to accelerate cadastral mapping through innovative and automated approaches and can be used to both create and update cadastral maps. This research aims to automate the detection of visible land boundaries from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery using deep learning. In addition, we wanted to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of programming-based deep learning compared to commercial software-based deep learning. For the first case, we used the convolutional neural network U-Net, implemented in Keras, written in Python using the TensorFlow library. For commercial software-based deep learning, we used ENVINet5. UAV imageries from different areas were used to train the U-Net model, which was performed in Google Collaboratory and tested in the study area in Odranci, Slovenia. The results were compared with the results of ENVINet5 using the same datasets. The results showed that both models achieved an overall accuracy of over 95%. The high accuracy is due to the problem of unbalanced classes, which is usually present in boundary detection tasks. U-Net provided a recall of 0.35 and a precision of 0.68 when the threshold was set to 0.5. A threshold can be viewed as a tool for filtering predicted boundary maps and balancing recall and precision. For equitable comparison with ENVINet5, the threshold was increased. U-Net provided more balanced results, a recall of 0.65 and a precision of 0.41, compared to ENVINet5 recall of 0.84 and a precision of 0.35. Programming-based deep learning provides a more flexible yet complex approach to boundary mapping than software-based, which is rigid and does not require programming. The predicted visible land boundaries can be used both to speed up the creation of cadastral maps and to automate the revision of existing cadastral maps and define areas where updates are needed. The predicted boundaries cannot be considered final at this stage but can be used as preliminary cadastral boundaries.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent developments in technology and data processing for Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized the scope of ecosystem monitoring, providing novel pathways to fill the critical gap between limited-scope field surveys and limited-customization satellite and piloted aerial platforms. These advances are especially ground-breaking for supporting management, restoration, and conservation of landscapes with limited field access and vulnerable ecological systems, particularly wetlands. This study presents a scoping review of the current status and emerging opportunities in wetland UAV applications, with particular emphasis on ecosystem management goals and remaining research, technology, and data needs to even better support these goals in the future. Using 122 case studies from 29 countries, we discuss which wetland monitoring and management objectives are most served by this rapidly developing technology, and what workflows were employed to analyze these data. This review showcases many ways in which UAVs may help reduce or replace logistically demanding field surveys and can help improve the efficiency of UAV-based workflows to support longer-term monitoring in the face of wetland environmental challenges and management constraints. We also highlight several emerging trends in applications, technology, and data and offer insights into future needs.},

ABSTRACT = {The well-recognized and extensive task of mapping unrecorded land rights across sub-Saharan Africa demands innovative solutions. In response, the consortia of “its4land”, a European Commission Horizon 2020 project, developed, adapted, and tested innovative geospatial tools including (1) software underpinned by the smart Sketch maps concept, called SmartSkeMa; (2) a workflow for applying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); and (3) a boundary delineator tool based on the UAV images. Additionally, the consortium developed (4) a platform called Publish and Share (PaS), enabling integration of all the outputs of tool sharing and publishing of land information through geocloud web services. The individual tools were developed, tested, and demonstrated based on requirements from Rwanda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Zanzibar. The platform was further tested by key informants and experts in a workshop in Rwanda after the AfricaGIS conference in 2019. With the project concluding in 2020, this paper seeks to undertake an assessment of the tools and the PaS platform against the elements of fit-for-purpose land administration. The results show that while the tools can function and deliver outputs independently and reliably, PaS enables interoperability by allowing them to be combined and integrated into land administration workflows. This feature is useful for tailoring approaches for specific country contexts. In this regard, developers of technical approaches tackling land administration issues are further encouraged to include interoperability and the use of recognized standards in designs.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the last decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have been broadly utilized in various agricultural fields, such as crop management, crop monitoring, seed sowing, and pesticide spraying. Nonetheless, autonomy is still a crucial limitation faced by the Internet of Things (IoT) UAV systems, especially when used as sprayer UAVs, where data needs to be captured and preprocessed for robust real-time obstacle detection and collision avoidance. Moreover, because of the objective and operational difference between general UAVs and sprayer UAVs, not every obstacle detection and collision avoidance method will be sufficient for sprayer UAVs. In this regard, this article seeks to review the most relevant developments on all correlated branches of the obstacle avoidance scenarios for agricultural sprayer UAVs, including a UAV sprayer’s structural details. Furthermore, the most relevant open challenges for current UAV sprayer solutions are enumerated, thus paving the way for future researchers to define a roadmap for devising new-generation, affordable autonomous sprayer UAV solutions. Agricultural UAV sprayers require data-intensive algorithms for the processing of the images acquired, and expertise in the field of autonomous flight is usually needed. The present study concludes that UAV sprayers are still facing obstacle detection challenges due to their dynamic operating and loading conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {When agricultural automation systems are required to send cultivation field images to the cloud for field monitoring, pay-as-you-go mobile communication leads to high operation costs. To minimize cost, one can exploit a characteristic of cultivation field images wherein the landscape does not change considerably besides the appearance of the plants. Therefore, this paper presents a method that transmits only the difference data between the past and current images to minimize the amount of transmitted data. This method is easy to implement because the difference data are generated using an existing video encoder. Further, the difference data are generated based on an image at a specific time instead of the images at adjacent times, and thus the subsequent images can be reproduced even if the previous difference data are lost because of unstable mobile communication. A prototype of the proposed method was implemented with a MPEG-4 Visual video encoder. The amount of transmitted and received data on the medium access control layer was decreased to approximately 1/4 of that when using the secure copy protocol. The transmission time for one image was 5.6 s; thus, the proposed method achieved a reasonable processing time and a reduction of transmitted data.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper reviews the different remote sensing techniques found in the literature to monitor plant water status, allowing farmers to control the irrigation management and to avoid unnecessary periods of water shortage and a needless waste of valuable water. The scope of this paper covers a broad range of 77 references published between the years 1981 and 2021 and collected from different search web sites, especially Scopus. Among them, 74 references are research papers and the remaining three are review papers. The different collected approaches have been categorized according to the part of the plant subjected to measurement, that is, soil (12.2%), canopy (33.8%), leaves (35.1%) or trunk (18.9%). In addition to a brief summary of each study, the main monitoring technologies have been analyzed in this review. Concerning the presentation of the data, different results have been obtained. According to the year of publication, the number of published papers has increased exponentially over time, mainly due to the technological development over the last decades. The most common sensor is the radiometer, which is employed in 15 papers (20.3%), followed by continuous-wave (CW) spectroscopy (12.2%), camera (10.8%) and THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) (10.8%). Excluding two studies, the minimum coefficient of determination (R2) obtained in the references of this review is 0.64. This indicates the high degree of correlation between the estimated and measured data for the different technologies and monitoring methods. The five most frequent water indicators of this study are: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (12.2%), backscattering coefficients (10.8%), spectral reflectance (8.1%), reflection coefficient (8.1%) and dielectric constant (8.1%).},

ABSTRACT = {This study explores the experts’ opinions during the consultation stage before law-making for civilian drones. A thorough literature study is first undertaken to have the set of influencing factors that should be suitable for the investigation from the perspective of designing and selecting civilian drones. Several rounds of surveys using the Delphi method, followed by an analytic hierarchy process (AHP), are performed to conform to the organized tree structure of constructs and factors and to obtain the knowledge about the opinions of the expert groups, with the expert sample being intentionally partitioned into three opinion groups at the beginning: academia (A), industry (I), and research institutes (R). Doing so facilitates a “mind-mining” process using the triple helix model (THM), while the opinions across the groups can also be visualized and compared. This exploits a new set of knowledge for the design and selection of civilian drones on a scientific yet empirical basis, and the observed differences and similarities among the groups may benefit their future negotiations to propose the drafts for regulating the design, manufacturing, and uses of civilian drones. As several significant implications and insights are also drawn and gained from the abovementioned results eventually, some possible research directions are worthwhile. The proposed hybrid methodological flow is another novelty.},

ABSTRACT = {Visible light communications (VLC) is gaining interest as one of the enablers of short-distance, high-data-rate applications, in future beyond 5G networks. Moreover, non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA)-enabled schemes have recently emerged as a promising multiple-access scheme for these networks that would allow realization of the target spectral efficiency and user fairness requirements. The integration of NOMA in the widely adopted orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based VLC networks would require an optimal resource allocation for the pair or the cluster of users sharing the same subcarrier(s). In this paper, the max-min rate of a multi-cell indoor centralized VLC network is maximized through optimizing user pairing, subcarrier allocation, and power allocation. The joint complex optimization problem is tackled using a low-complexity solution. At first, the user pairing is assumed to follow the divide-and-next-largest-difference user-pairing algorithm (D-NLUPA) that can ensure fairness among the different clusters. Then, subcarrier allocation and power allocation are solved iteratively through both the Simulated Annealing (SA) meta-heuristic algorithm and the bisection method. The obtained results quantify the achievable max-min user rates for the different relevant variants of NOMA-enabled schemes and shed new light on both the performance and design of multi-user multi-carrier NOMA-enabled centralized VLC networks.},

ABSTRACT = {Protected areas worldwide receive billions of visitors annually. The positive impact of nature on health and wellbeing, in addition to providing opportunities for cultural activities such as recreation and aesthetic appreciation, is well documented. Management to reduce negative impacts to biodiversity and conservation aims whilst providing amenities and access to visitors is important. Understanding environmental awareness of visitors and their on-site spatial patterns can assist in making effective management decisions within often constrained resources. However, there is a lack of strategies for site-specific identification and predictive mapping of visitors by environmental awareness. Here, we demonstrate a method to map on-site visitation by latent groups of visitors based on their environmental awareness of on-site issues. On-site surveys and participatory mapping were used to collect data on environmental awareness on bird nesting and spatial visitation patterns in an upland moor in northern England. Latent class analysis (LCA), a structural equation model, was used to discover underlying groups of environmental awareness, with random forest (RF) modelling, a machine learning technique, using a range of on-site predictors (bioclimatic, land cover, elevation, viewshed, and proximity to paths and freshwater) to predict and map visitation across the site by each group. Visitors were segmented into ‘aware’ and ‘ambiguous’ groups and their potential spatial visitation patterns mapped. Our results demonstrate the ability to uncover groups of users by environmental awareness and map their potential visitation across a site using a variety of on-site predictors. Spatial understanding of the movement patterns of differently environmentally aware groups of visitors can assist in efficient targeting of conservation education endeavours (i.e., signage, positioning of staff, monitoring programmes, etc.), therefore maximising their efficacy. Furthermore, we anticipate this method will be of importance to environmental managers and educators when deploying limited resources.},

ABSTRACT = {After the Cold War, the defense industries found themselves at a crossroads. However, it seems that they are gaining new momentum, as new technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence are enabling the development of autonomous, highly innovative and disruptive intelligent systems. Despite this new impetus, there are still doubts about where to invest limited financial resources to boost high-tech defense industries. In order to shed some light on the topic, we decided to conduct a systematic literature review by using the PRISMA protocol and content analysis. The results indicate that autonomous intelligent systems are being developed by the defense industry and categorized into three different modes—fully autonomous operations, partially autonomous operations, and smart autonomous decision-making. In addition, it is also important to note that, at a strategic level of war, there is limited room for automation given the need for human intervention. However, at the tactical level of war, there is a high probability of growth in industrial defense, since, at this level, structured decisions and complex analytical-cognitive tasks are carried out. In the light of carrying out those decisions and tasks, robotics and artificial intelligence can make a contribution far superior to that of human beings.},

ABSTRACT = {Due to its relation to the Earth’s climate and weather and phenomena like drought, flooding, or landslides, knowledge of the soil moisture content is valuable to many scientific and professional users. Remote-sensing offers the unique possibility for continuous measurements of this variable. Especially for agriculture, there is a strong demand for high spatial resolution mapping. However, operationally available soil moisture products exist with medium to coarse spatial resolution only (≥1 km). This study introduces a machine learning (ML)—based approach for the high spatial resolution (50 m) mapping of soil moisture based on the integration of Landsat-8 optical and thermal images, Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR images, and modelled data, executable in the Google Earth Engine. The novelty of this approach lies in applying an entirely data-driven ML concept for global estimation of the surface soil moisture content. Globally distributed in situ data from the International Soil Moisture Network acted as an input for model training. Based on the independent validation dataset, the resulting overall estimation accuracy, in terms of Root-Mean-Squared-Error and R², was 0.04 m3·m−3 and 0.81, respectively. Beyond the retrieval model itself, this article introduces a framework for collecting training data and a stand-alone Python package for soil moisture mapping. The Google Earth Engine Python API facilitates the execution of data collection and retrieval which is entirely cloud-based. For soil moisture retrieval, it eliminates the requirement to download or preprocess any input datasets.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate approaches to aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation are required to support appraisal of the effectiveness of land use measures, which seek to protect grazing-adapted grasslands atop the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). This methodological study assesses the effectiveness of one commonly used visible band vegetation index, Red Green Blue Vegetation Index (RGBVI), obtained from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in estimating AGB timely and accurately at the local scale, seeking to improve the estimation accuracy by taking into account in situ collected information on disturbed grassland. Particular emphasis is placed upon the mapping and quantification of areas disturbed by grazing (simulated via mowing) and plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) that have led to the emergence of bare ground. The initial model involving only RGBVI performed poorly in AGB estimation by underestimating high AGB by around 10% and overestimating low AGB by about 10%. The estimation model was modified by the mowing intensity ratio and bare ground metrics. The former almost doubled the estimation accuracy from R2 = 0.44 to 0.81. However, this modification caused the bare ground AGB to be overestimated by about 38 and 19 g m−2 for 2018 and 2019, respectively. Although further modification of the model by bare ground metrics improved the accuracy slightly to 0.88, it markedly reduced the overestimation of low AGB values. It is recommended that grazing intensity be incorporated into the micro-scale estimation of AGB, together with the bare ground modification metrics, especially for severely disturbed meadows with a sizable portion of bare ground.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, the worsening impacts of urbanizations have been impelled to the importance of monitoring and management of existing urban trees, securing sustainable use of the available green spaces. Urban tree species identification and evaluation of their roles in atmospheric Carbon Stock (CS) are still among the prime concerns for city planners regarding initiating a convenient and easily adaptive urban green planning and management system. A detailed methodology on the urban tree carbon stock calibration and mapping was conducted in the urban area of Brussels, Belgium. A comparative analysis of the mapping outcomes was assessed to define the convenience and efficiency of two different remote sensing data sources, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and WorldView-3 (WV-3), in a unique urban area. The mapping results were validated against field estimated carbon stocks. At the initial stage, dominant tree species were identified and classified using the high-resolution WorldView3 image, leading to the final carbon stock mapping based on the dominant species. An object-based image analysis approach was employed to attain an overall accuracy (OA) of 71% during the classification of the dominant species. The field estimations of carbon stock for each plot were done utilizing an allometric model based on the field tree dendrometric data. Later based on the correlation among the field data and the variables (i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI and Crown Height Model, CHM) extracted from the available remote sensing data, the carbon stock mapping and validation had been done in a GIS environment. The calibrated NDVI and CHM had been used to compute possible carbon stock in either case of the WV-3 image and LiDAR data, respectively. A comparative discussion has been introduced to bring out the issues, especially for the developing countries, where WV-3 data could be a better solution over the hardly available LiDAR data. This study could assist city planners in understanding and deciding the applicability of remote sensing data sources based on their availability and the level of expediency, ensuring a sustainable urban green management system.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydrographic survey or seabed mapping plays an important role in achieving better maritime safety, especially in coastal waters. Due to advances in survey technologies, it becomes important to choose well-suited technology for a specific area. Moreover, various technologies have various ranges of equipment and manufacturers, as well as characteristics. Therefore, in this paper, a novel method of a hydrographic survey, i.e., identifying the appropriate technology, has been developed. The method is based on a reduced elimination matrix, decision tree supervised learning, and multicriteria decision methods. The available technologies were: remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), light detection and ranging (LIDAR), autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), and multibeam echosounder (MBES), and they are applied as a case study of Kaštela Bay. Results show, considering the specifics of the survey area, that UAV is the best-suited technology to be used for a hydrographic survey. However, some other technologies, such as SDB come close and can be considered an alternative for hydrographic surveys.},

ABSTRACT = {Unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly commonplace in aiding planning and management decisions in agricultural and horticultural crop production. The ability of UAV-based sensing technologies to provide high spatial (&lt;1 m) and temporal (on-demand) resolution data facilitates monitoring of individual plants over time and can provide essential information about health, yield, and growth in a timely and quantifiable manner. Such applications would be beneficial for cropped banana plants due to their distinctive growth characteristics. Limited studies have employed UAV data for mapping banana crops and to our knowledge only one other investigation features multi-temporal detection of banana crowns. The purpose of this study was to determine the suitability of multiple-date UAV-captured multi-spectral data for the automated detection of individual plants using convolutional neural network (CNN), template matching (TM), and local maximum filter (LMF) methods in a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) software framework coupled with basic classification refinement. The results indicate that CNN returns the highest plant detection accuracies, with the developed rule set and model providing greater transferability between dates (F-score ranging between 0.93 and 0.85) than TM (0.86–0.74) and LMF (0.86–0.73) approaches. The findings provide a foundation for UAV-based individual banana plant counting and crop monitoring, which may be used for precision agricultural applications to monitor health, estimate yield, and to inform on fertilizer, pesticide, and other input requirements for optimized farm management.},

ABSTRACT = {Vegetation measures are crucial for assessing changes in the ecological environment. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) provides information on the growth status, distribution characteristics, and structural changes of vegetation. An in-depth understanding of the dynamic changes in urban FVC contributes to the sustainable development of ecological civilization in the urbanization process. However, dynamic change detection of urban FVC using multi-temporal remote sensing images is a complex process and challenge. This paper proposed an improved FVC estimation model by fusing the optimized dynamic range vegetation index (ODRVI) model. The ODRVI model improved sensitivity to the water content, roughness degree, and soil type by minimizing the influence of bare soil in areas of sparse vegetation cover. The ODRVI model enhanced the stability of FVC estimation in the near-infrared (NIR) band in areas of dense and sparse vegetation cover through introducing the vegetation canopy vertical porosity (VCVP) model. The verification results confirmed that the proposed model had better performance than typical vegetation index (VI) models for multi-temporal Landsat images. The coefficient of determination (R2) between the ODRVI model and the FVC was 0.9572, which was 7.4% higher than the average R2 of other typical VI models. Moreover, the annual urban FVC dynamics were mapped using the proposed improved FVC estimation model in Hefei, China (1999–2018). The total area of all grades FVC decreased by 33.08% during the past 20 years in Hefei, China. The areas of the extremely low, low, and medium grades FVC exhibited apparent inter-annual fluctuations. The maximum standard deviation of the area change of the medium grade FVC was 13.35%. For other grades of FVC, the order of standard deviation of the change ratio was extremely low FVC &gt; low FVC &gt; medium-high FVC &gt; high FVC. The dynamic mapping of FVC revealed the influence intensity and direction of the urban sprawl on vegetation coverage, which contributes to the strategic development of sustainable urban management plans.},

Some investigations focused on issues related to UAV flight operations, spatial resolution requirements, and computation and data analytics, while others studied the ability of UAVs for characterizing relevant vegetation features (mainly canopy cover and crop height) or for detecting different plant/crop stressors, such as nutrient content/deficiencies, water needs, weeds, and diseases. The general goal was proposing UAV-based technological solutions for a better use of agricultural and forestry resources and more efficient production with relevant economic and environmental benefits.},

ABSTRACT = {Unoccupied aerial system (UAS; i.e., drone equipped with sensors) field-based high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms are used to collect high quality images of plant nurseries to screen genetic materials (e.g., hybrids and inbreds) throughout plant growth at relatively low cost. In this study, a set of 100 advanced breeding maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids were planted at optimal (OHOT trial) and delayed planting dates (DHOT trial). Twelve UAS surveys were conducted over the trials throughout the growing season. Fifteen vegetative indices (VIs) and the 99th percentile canopy height measurement (CHMs) were extracted from processed UAS imagery (orthomosaics and point clouds) which were used to predict plot-level grain yield, days to anthesis (DTA), and silking (DTS). A novel statistical approach utilizing a nested design was fit to predict temporal best linear unbiased predictors (TBLUP) for the combined temporal UAS data. Our results demonstrated machine learning-based regressions (ridge, lasso, and elastic net) had from 4- to 9-fold increases in the prediction accuracies and from 13- to 73-fold reductions in root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to classical linear regression in prediction of grain yield or flowering time. Ridge regression performed best in predicting grain yield (prediction accuracy = ~0.6), while lasso and elastic net regressions performed best in predicting DTA and DTS (prediction accuracy = ~0.8) consistently in both trials. We demonstrated that predictor variable importance descended towards the terminal stages of growth, signifying the importance of phenotype collection beyond classical terminal growth stages. This study is among the first to demonstrate an ability to predict yield in elite hybrid maize breeding trials using temporal UAS image-based phenotypes and supports the potential benefit of phenomic selection approaches in estimating breeding values before harvest.},

ABSTRACT = {Explicit spatial information about crop types on smallholder farms is important for the development of local precision agriculture. However, due to highly fragmented and heterogeneous cropland landscapes, fine-scale mapping of smallholder crops, based on low- and medium-resolution satellite images and relying on a single machine learning (ML) classifier, generally fails to achieve satisfactory performance. This paper develops an ensemble ML-based framework to improve the accuracy of parcel-level smallholder crop mapping from very high spatial resolution (VHSR) images. A typical smallholder agricultural area in central China covered by WorldView-2 images is selected to demonstrate our approach. This approach involves the task of distinguishing eight crop-level agricultural land use types. To this end, six widely used individual ML classifiers are evaluated. We further improved their performance by independently implementing bagging and stacking ensemble learning (EL) techniques. The results show that the bagging models improved the performance of unstable classifiers, but these improvements are limited. In contrast, the stacking models perform better, and the Stacking #2 model (overall accuracy = 83.91%, kappa = 0.812), which integrates the three best-performing individual classifiers, performs the best of all of the built models and improves the classwise accuracy of almost all of the land use types. Since classification performance can be significantly improved without adding costly data collection, stacking-ensemble mapping approaches are valuable for the spatial management of complex agricultural areas. We also demonstrate that using geometric and textural features extracted from VHSR images can improve the accuracy of parcel-level smallholder crop mapping. The proposed framework shows the great potential of combining EL technology with VHSR imagery for accurate mapping of smallholder crops, which could facilitate the development of parcel-level crop identification systems in countries dominated by smallholder agriculture.},

ABSTRACT = {Based on the characteristics of remote sensing images of mine vegetation, this research studied the application of deep belief network model in mine vegetation identification. Through vegetation identification and classification, the ecological environment index of mining area was determined according to the analysis of vegetation and coverage. Deep learning algorithm is adopted to improve the depth study, the vegetation coverage in the analysis was studied. Parameters and parameter values were selected for identification by establishing the optimal experimental design. The experimental results were compared with remote sensing images to determine the accuracy of deep learning identification and the effectiveness of the algorithm. When the sample size is 2,000,000 pixels, through repeated tests and classification effect comparison, the optimal parameter setting suitable for mine vegetation identification is obtained. Parameter setting: the number of network layers is 3 layers; the number of hidden layer neurons is 60. The learning rate is 0.01 and the number of iterations is 2. The average recognition rate of vegetation coverage was 95.95%, outperforming some other models, and the accuracy rate of kappa coefficient was 0.95, which can accurately reflect the vegetation coverage. The clearer the satellite image is, the more accurate the recognition result is, and the accuracy is closer to 100%. The identification of vegetation coverage has important guiding significance for determining the area and area of ecological restoration.},

ABSTRACT = {Data collection from large areas of native forests poses a challenge. The present study aims at assessing the use of UAV for forest inventory on native forests in Southern Chile, and seeks to retrieve both stand and tree level attributes from forest canopy data. Data were collected from 14 plots (45 × 45 m) established at four locations representing unmanaged Chilean temperate forests: seven plots on secondary forests and seven plots on old-growth forests, including a total of 17 different native species. The imagery was captured using a fixed-wing airframe equipped with a regular RGB camera. We used the structure from motion and digital aerial photogrammetry techniques for data processing and combined machine learning methods based on boosted regression trees and mixed models. In total, 2136 trees were measured on the ground, from which 858 trees were visualized from the UAV imagery of the canopy, ranging from 26% to 88% of the measured trees in the field (mean = 45.7%, SD = 17.3), which represented between 70.6% and 96% of the total basal area of the plots (mean = 80.28%, SD = 7.7). Individual-tree diameter models based on remote sensing data were constructed with R2 = 0.85 and R2 = 0.66 based on BRT and mixed models, respectively. We found a strong relationship between canopy and ground data; however, we suggest that the best alternative was combining the use of both field-based and remotely sensed methods to achieve high accuracy estimations, particularly in complex structure forests (e.g., old-growth forests). Field inventories and UAV surveys provide accurate information at local scales and allow validation of large-scale applications of satellite imagery. Finally, in the future, increasing the accuracy of aerial surveys and monitoring is necessary to advance the development of local and regional allometric crown and DBH equations at the species level.},

ABSTRACT = {Context: At present, sensor-based systems are widely used to solve distributed problems in changing environments where sensors are controlled by intelligent agents. On Multi-Agent Systems, agents perceive their environment through such sensors, acting upon that environment through actuators in a continuous cycle. These problems have not always been addressed from an ad-hoc perspective, designed specifically for the circumstances of the problem at hand. Instead, they have been modelled under a common mathematical framework as distributed constrained optimisation problems (DCOP). Objective: The question to answer is how sensor-based scenarios have been modelled as DCOPs in changing environments known as Dynamic DCOP and what their trends, gaps, and progression are. Method: A systematic mapping study of Dynamic DCOPs has been conducted, considering the scattered literature and the lack of consensus in the terminology. Results: Given the high complexity of distributed constraint-based problems, priority is given to obtaining sub-optimal but fast responses with a low communication cost. Other trending aspects are the scalability and guaranteeing the solution over time. Conclusion: Despite some lacks in the analysis and experimentation in real-world scenarios, a large set that is applicable to changing sensor-based scenarios is evidenced, along with proposals that allow the integration of off-the-shell constraint-based algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Plant diseases can cause a considerable reduction in the quality and number of agricultural products. Guava, well known to be the tropics’ apple, is one significant fruit cultivated in tropical regions. It is attacked by 177 pathogens, including 167 fungal and others such as bacterial, algal, and nematodes. In addition, postharvest diseases may cause crucial production loss. Due to minor variations in various guava disease symptoms, an expert opinion is required for disease analysis. Improper diagnosis may cause economic losses to farmers’ improper use of pesticides. Automatic detection of diseases in plants once they emerge on the plants’ leaves and fruit is required to maintain high crop fields. In this paper, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven framework is presented to detect and classify the most common guava plant diseases. The proposed framework employs the ΔE color difference image segmentation to segregate the areas infected by the disease. Furthermore, color (RGB, HSV) histogram and textural (LBP) features are applied to extract rich, informative feature vectors. The combination of color and textural features are used to identify and attain similar outcomes compared to individual channels, while disease recognition is performed by employing advanced machine-learning classifiers (Fine KNN, Complex Tree, Boosted Tree, Bagged Tree, Cubic SVM). The proposed framework is evaluated on a high-resolution (18 MP) image dataset of guava leaves and fruit. The best recognition results were obtained by Bagged Tree classifier on a set of RGB, HSV, and LBP features (99% accuracy in recognizing four guava fruit diseases (Canker, Mummification, Dot, and Rust) against healthy fruit). The proposed framework may help the farmers to avoid possible production loss by taking early precautions.},

ABSTRACT = {Ground surface changes caused by freeze-thaw action affect agriculture and forestry, as well as artificial structures such as roads. In this study, an area is examined in which reforestation is urgently needed but the growth of naturally restored seedlings and planted trees is impaired by freeze-thaw action. Thus, a method of measuring freeze-thaw induced ground surface changes and mitigating their negative impacts is needed. Real-time kinematic unmanned aerial vehicle and structure-from-motion multiview stereophotogrammetry are used on slope-failure sites in forest areas to observe the ground surface changes caused by freeze-thaw action over a wide area, in a nondestructive manner. The slope characteristics influencing the ground-surface changes were examined, and it was confirmed that it is possible to observe minute topographical changes of less than ±5 cm resulting from freeze-thaw action. Statistical models show that the amount of freeze-thaw action is mostly linked to the cumulative solar radiation, daily ground-surface temperature range, and topographic-wetness index, which influence the microscale dynamics of the ground surface. The proposed method will be useful for future quantitative assessments of ground-surface conditions. Further, efficient reforestation could be implemented by considering the effects of the factors identified on the amount of freeze-thaw action.},

ABSTRACT = {Wildlife monitoring is carried out for diverse reasons, and monitoring methods have gradually advanced through technological development. Direct field investigations have been replaced by remote monitoring methods, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become the most important tool for wildlife monitoring. Many previous studies on detecting wild animals have used RGB images acquired from UAVs, with most of the analyses depending on machine learning–deep learning (ML–DL) methods. These methods provide relatively accurate results, and when thermal sensors are used as a supplement, even more accurate detection results can be obtained through complementation with RGB images. However, because most previous analyses were based on ML–DL methods, a lot of time was required to generate training data and train detection models. This drawback makes ML–DL methods unsuitable for real-time detection in the field. To compensate for the disadvantages of the previous methods, this paper proposes a real-time animal detection method that generates a total of six applicable input images depending on the context and uses them for detection. The proposed method is based on the Sobel edge algorithm, which is simple but can detect edges quickly based on change values. The method can detect animals in a single image without training data. The fastest detection time per image was 0.033 s, and all frames of a thermal video could be analyzed. Furthermore, because of the synchronization of the properties of the thermal and RGB images, the performance of the method was above average in comparison with previous studies. With target images acquired at heights below 100 m, the maximum detection precision and detection recall of the most accurate input image were 0.804 and 0.699, respectively. However, the low resolution of the thermal sensor and its shooting height limitation were hindrances to wildlife detection. The aim of future research will be to develop a detection method that can improve these shortcomings.},

ABSTRACT = {Floods are the most frequent natural disasters in the world. In the system of warning and flood protection of areas at risk of flooding in the event of its occurrence, it seems advisable to initially work out the possibility of evacuating the population, animals, equipment, material values, etc. In this article, a methodology for determining destinations (points of destination) for the evacuation of people and equipment from a predicted flood zone (of a natural disaster) to a safe area is proposed based upon the criterion of the shortest possible distance. In the paper, a scenario is considered that involves the contours of the flood zone boundaries for several variants of the intensity of the probable development of future events (with the aid of geoinformation technologies), and the coordinates of the objects to evacuate are permanent and known in advance. With the known coordinates of the objects and the closest points of the boundary of the predicted flood zone, the shortest distances can be calculated. Based on these calculations, the appropriate destinations for evacuation are determined. The proposed methodology can be used for flood forecasting and flood zone modeling to assess the economic and social risks of their aftereffects and to allow the public, local governments, and other organizations to better understand the potential risks of floods and to identify the measures needed to save lives and avoid damage to and loss of property and equipment. This methodology, in contrast to known approaches, allows the determination of the nearest locations for the evacuation of people and equipment from a flood zone (of a natural disaster) to safe areas, to be determined for several variants, depending on the possible development of future events. The methodology is algorithm-driven and presented in the form of a flowchart and is suitable for use in the appropriate software. The proposed methodology is an introduction to the next stages of research related to the determination of safe places for evacuation of people and their property (equipment) to safe places. This is especially important in case of sudden weather events (flash floods).},

ABSTRACT = {The paper discusses the results of a study carried out to determine the thermal condition of a conveyor power unit using a thermal imaging camera. The tests covered conveyors in the main haulage system carrying coal from a longwall. The measurements were taken with a thermal imaging diagnostic method which measures infrared radiation emitted by an object. This technology provides a means of assessing the imminence and severity of a possible failure or damage. The method is a non-contact measuring technique and offers great advantages in an underground mine. The thermograms were analysed by comparing the temperature distribution. An analysis of the operating time of the conveyors was also carried out and the causes of the thermal condition were determined. The main purpose of the research was to detect changes in thermal state during the operation of a belt conveyor that could indicate failure and permit early maintenance and eliminate the chance of a fire. The article also discusses the construction and principle of operation of a thermal imaging camera. The findings obtained from the research analysis on determining the thermal condition of the conveyor drive unit are a valuable source of information for the mine’s maintenance service.},

ABSTRACT = {Usage of multispectral satellite imaging data opens vast possibilities for monitoring and quantitatively assessing properties or objects of interest on a global scale. Machine learning and computer vision (CV) approaches show themselves as promising tools for automatizing satellite image analysis. However, there are limitations in using CV for satellite data. Mainly, the crucial one is the amount of data available for model training. This paper presents a novel image augmentation approach called MixChannel that helps to address this limitation and improve the accuracy of solving segmentation and classification tasks with multispectral satellite images. The core idea is to utilize the fact that there is usually more than one image for each location in remote sensing tasks, and this extra data can be mixed to achieve the more robust performance of the trained models. The proposed approach substitutes some channels of the original training image with channels from other images of the exact location to mix auxiliary data. This augmentation technique preserves the spatial features of the original image and adds natural color variability with some probability. We also show an efficient algorithm to tune channel substitution probabilities. We report that the MixChannel image augmentation method provides a noticeable increase in performance of all the considered models in the studied forest types classification problem.},

ABSTRACT = {Official information on Land Use Land Cover is essential for mapping wildland–urban interface (WUI) zones. However, these resources do not always provide the geometrical or thematic accuracy required to delimit buildings that are easily exposed to risk of wildfire at the appropriate scale. This research shows that the integration of active remote sensing and official Land Use Land Cover (LULC) databases, such as the Spanish Land Use Land Cover information system (SIOSE), creates the synergy capable of achieving this. An automated method was developed to detect WUI zones by the massive geoprocessing of data from official and open repositories of the Spanish national plan for territory observation (PNOT) of the Spanish national geographic institute (IGN), and it was tested in the most important metropolitan zones in Spain: Barcelona and Madrid. The processing of trillions of LiDAR data and their integration with thousands of SIOSE polygons were managed in a Linux environment, with libraries for geographic processing and a PostgreSQL database server. All this allowed the buildings that are exposed to wildfire risk with a high level of accuracy to be obtained with a methodology that can be applied anywhere in the Spanish territory.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the development of technologies to support the decision-making of local government executives and smart city concept managers in selecting and evaluating the competencies of new members for advisory groups for solving problems that are implemented in safe times in individual areas or in crises, such as pandemics. The reason for developing effective urban transformation strategies and for the transparent selection of independent experts (non-politicians) for policymaking, decision-making, and implementation teams is not only the heterogeneity of smart city dimensions together with the necessary complexity and systems approach, but also the nature of the capacities and tools needed for smart city concepts. The innovative hybrid competency assessment model is based on fuzzy logic and a network for neuro-fuzzy assessment. It is a technological model for evaluating the competencies of specialists, taking into account the influence of human factors on the processes of personnel selection and system management. An innovative web platform named “Smart City Concept Personnel Selection” has been designed, which can be adapted to various users of municipalities or regional institutions for the transparent selection of qualified personnel for effective decision-making and the use of public funds during safe times or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.},

ABSTRACT = {Fires are one of the most destructive forces in natural ecosystems. This study aims to develop and compare four hybrid models using two well-known machine learning models, support vector regression (SVR) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), as well as two meta-heuristic models, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and simulated annealing (SA) to map wildland fires in Jerash Province, Jordan. For modeling, 109 fire locations were used along with 14 relevant factors, including elevation, slope, aspect, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, soil texture, topographic wetness index (TWI), distance to drainage, and population density, as the variables affecting the fire occurrence. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. The findings indicated that SVR-based hybrid models yielded a higher AUROC value (0.965 and 0.949) than the ANFIS-based hybrid models (0.904 and 0.894, respectively). Wildland fire susceptibility maps can play a major role in shaping firefighting tactics.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban greenery is an essential characteristic of the urban ecosystem, which offers various advantages, such as improved air quality, human health facilities, storm-water run-off control, carbon reduction, and an increase in property values. Therefore, identification and continuous monitoring of the vegetation (trees) is of vital importance for our urban lifestyle. This paper proposes a deep learning-based network, Siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN), combined with a modified brute-force-based line-of-bearing (LOB) algorithm that evaluates the health of Eucalyptus trees as healthy or unhealthy and identifies their geolocation in real time from Google Street View (GSV) and ground truth images. Our dataset represents Eucalyptus trees’ various details from multiple viewpoints, scales and different shapes to texture. The experiments were carried out in the Wyndham city council area in the state of Victoria, Australia. Our approach obtained an average accuracy of 93.2% in identifying healthy and unhealthy trees after training on around 4500 images and testing on 500 images. This study helps in identifying the Eucalyptus tree with health issues or dead trees in an automated way that can facilitate urban green management and assist the local council to make decisions about plantation and improvements in looking after trees. Overall, this study shows that even in a complex background, most healthy and unhealthy Eucalyptus trees can be detected by our deep learning algorithm in real time.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital agriculture services can greatly assist growers to monitor their fields and optimize their use throughout the growing season. Thus, knowing the exact location of fields and their boundaries is a prerequisite. Unlike property boundaries, which are recorded in local council or title records, field boundaries are not historically recorded. As a result, digital services currently ask their users to manually draw their field, which is time-consuming and creates disincentives. Here, we present a generalized method, hereafter referred to as DECODE (DEtect, COnsolidate, and DElinetate), that automatically extracts accurate field boundary data from satellite imagery using deep learning based on spatial, spectral, and temporal cues. We introduce a new convolutional neural network (FracTAL ResUNet) as well as two uncertainty metrics to characterize the confidence of the field detection and field delineation processes. We finally propose a new methodology to compare and summarize field-based accuracy metrics. To demonstrate the performance and scalability of our method, we extracted fields across the Australian grains zone with a pixel-based accuracy of 0.87 and a field-based accuracy of up to 0.88 depending on the metric. We also trained a model on data from South Africa instead of Australia and found it transferred well to unseen Australian landscapes. We conclude that the accuracy, scalability and transferability of DECODE shows that large-scale field boundary extraction based on deep learning has reached operational maturity. This opens the door to new agricultural services that provide routine, near-real time field-based analytics.},

ABSTRACT = {The combined action of waves, surges and tides can cause flooding, erosion and dune and structure overtopping in many coastal regions. Addressing emergency and risk management in these areas require a combination of targeted campaigns and real-time data that measure all phenomena at stake and can be used to develop comprehensive monitoring platforms. These monitoring platforms can support the development of prediction tools that address all hazards in an integrated way. Herein, we present a methodology focused on multi-hazard coastal alert and risk, and its implementation in a tailored WebGIS platform. The MOSAIC platform offers a one-stop-shop capacity to access in-situ and remote sensing data, and hydrodynamic and morphodynamic predictions, supported by numerical models: SCHISM and XBeach. Information is structured on a local observatory scale, with regional forcings available for the correct interpretation of local hazards effects. This implementation can be further applied and extended to other coastal zones. The MOSAIC platform also provides access to a detailed database of past hazardous events, organized along several risk indicators, for the western coast of Portugal. The combination of features in the platform provides a unique repository of hazard information to support end-users for both emergency and long term risk planning actions.},

ABSTRACT = {Identifying permanent water and temporary water in flood disasters efficiently has mainly relied on change detection method from multi-temporal remote sensing imageries, but estimating the water type in flood disaster events from only post-flood remote sensing imageries still remains challenging. Research progress in recent years has demonstrated the excellent potential of multi-source data fusion and deep learning algorithms in improving flood detection, while this field has only been studied initially due to the lack of large-scale labelled remote sensing images of flood events. Here, we present new deep learning algorithms and a multi-source data fusion driven flood inundation mapping approach by leveraging a large-scale publicly available Sen1Flood11 dataset consisting of roughly 4831 labelled Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery gathered from flood events worldwide in recent years. Specifically, we proposed an automatic segmentation method for surface water, permanent water, and temporary water identification, and all tasks share the same convolutional neural network architecture. We utilize focal loss to deal with the class (water/non-water) imbalance problem. Thorough ablation experiments and analysis confirmed the effectiveness of various proposed designs. In comparison experiments, the method proposed in this paper is superior to other classical models. Our model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 52.99%, Intersection over Union (IoU) of 52.30%, and Overall Accuracy (OA) of 92.81% on the Sen1Flood11 test set. On the Sen1Flood11 Bolivia test set, our model also achieves very high mIoU (47.88%), IoU (76.74%), and OA (95.59%) and shows good generalization ability.},

ABSTRACT = {In site-specific management, rapid and accurate identification of crop stress at a large scale is critical. Radiometric ground-based data and satellite imaging with advanced spatial and spectral resolution allow for a deeper understanding of crop stress and the level of stress in a given area. This research aimed to assess the potential of radiometric ground-based data and high-resolution QuickBird satellite imagery to determine the leaf area index (LAI), biomass fresh weight (BFW) and chlorophyll meter (Chlm) of maize across well-irrigated, water stress and salinity stress areas in the Nile Delta of Egypt. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were evaluated to estimate the three measured traits based on vegetation spectral indices (vegetation-SRIs) derived from these methods and their combination. Maize field visits were conducted during the summer seasons from 28 to 30 July 2007 to collect ground reference data concurrent with the acquisition of radiometric ground-based measurements and QuickBird satellite imagery. The results showed that the majority of vegetation-SRIs extracted from radiometric ground-based data and high-resolution satellite images were more effective in estimating LAI, BFW, and Chlm. In general, the vegetation-SRIs of radiometric ground-based data showed higher R2 with measured traits compared to the vegetation-SRIs extracted from high-resolution satellite imagery. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the significant relationships between vegetation-SRIs of both methods and three measured traits varied from 0.64 to 0.89. For example, with QuickBird high-resolution satellite images, the relationships of the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) with LAI and BFW showed the highest R2 of 0.80 and 0.84, respectively. Overall, the ground-based vegetation-SRIs and the satellite-based indices were found to be in good agreement to assess the measured traits of maize. Both the calibration (Cal.) and validation (Val.) models of PLSR and MLR showed the highest performance in predicting the three measured traits based on the combination of vegetation-SRIs from radiometric ground-based data and high-resolution QuickBird satellite imagery. For example, validation (Val.) models of PLSR and MLR showed the highest performance in predicting the measured traits based on the combination of vegetation-SRIs from radiometric ground-based data and high-resolution QuickBird satellite imagery with R2 (0.91) of both methods for LAI, R2 (0.91–0.93) for BFW respectively, and R2 (0.82) of both methods for Chlm. The models of PLSR and MLR showed approximately the same performance in predicting the three measured traits and no clear difference was found between them and their combinations. In conclusion, the results obtained from this study showed that radiometric ground-based measurements and high spectral resolution remote-sensing imagery have the potential to offer necessary crop monitoring information across well-irrigated, water stress and salinity stress in regions suffering lack of freshwater resources.},

ABSTRACT = {Soil nutrient is one of the most important properties for improving farmland quality and product. Imaging spectrometry has the potential for rapid acquisition and real-time monitoring of soil characteristics. This study aims to explore the preprocessing and modeling methods of hyperspectral images obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform for estimating the soil organic matter (SOM) and soil total nitrogen (STN) in farmland. The results showed that: (1) Multiplicative Scattering Correction (MSC) performed better in reducing image scattering noise than Standard Normal Variate (SNV) transformation or spectral derivatives, and it yielded a result with higher correlation and lower signal-to-noise ratio; (2) The proposed feature selection method combining Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) and Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling algorithm (CARS), could provide selective preference for hyperspectral bands. Exploiting this method, 24 and 22 feature bands were selected for SOM and STN estimation, respectively; (3) The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was employed to obtain optimized input weights and bias values of the extreme learning machine (ELM) model for more accurate prediction of SOM and STN. The improved PSO-ELM model based on the selected preference bands achieved higher prediction accuracy (R2 of 0.73 and RPD of 1.91 for SOM, R2 of 0.63, and RPD of 1.53 for STN) than support vector machine (SVM), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and the ELM model. This study provides an important guideline for monitoring soil nutrient for precision agriculture with imaging spectrometry.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the decades, robotics technology has acquired sufficient advancement through the progression of 5G Internet, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud, and Edge Computing. Though nowadays, Cobot and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) supported robots with edge computing paradigms have achieved remarkable performances in diverse applications, the existing SOA robotics technology fails to develop a multi-domain expert with high performing robots and demands improvement to Service-Oriented Brain, SOB (including AI model, driving service application and metadata) enabling robot for deploying brain and a new computing model with more scalability and flexibility. In this paper, instead of focusing on SOA and Robot as a Service (RaaS) model, we propose a novel computing architecture, addressed as Brainware Computing, for driving multiple domain-specific brains one-at-a-time in a single hardware robot according to the service, addressed as Brain as a Service (BaaS). In Brainware Computing, each robot can install and remove the virtual machine, which contains SOB and operating applications from the nearest edge cloud. Secondly, we provide an extensive explanation of the scope and possibilities of Brainware Computing. Finally, we demonstrate several challenges and opportunities and then concluded with future research directions in the field of Brainware Computing.},

ABSTRACT = {Knowing the expected crop yield in the current growing season provides valuable information for farmers, policy makers, and food processing plants. One of the main benefits of using reliable forecasting tools is generating more income from grown crops. Information on the amount of crop yielding before harvesting helps to guide the adoption of an appropriate strategy for managing agricultural products. The difficulty in creating forecasting models is related to the appropriate selection of independent variables. Their proper selection requires a perfect knowledge of the research object. The following article presents and discusses the most commonly used independent variables in agricultural crop yield prediction modeling based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Particular attention is paid to environmental variables, such as climatic data, air temperature, total precipitation, insolation, and soil parameters. The possibility of using plant productivity indices and vegetation indices, which are valuable predictors obtained due to the application of remote sensing techniques, are analyzed in detail. The paper emphasizes that the increasingly common use of remote sensing and photogrammetric tools enables the development of precision agriculture. In addition, some limitations in the application of certain input variables are specified, as well as further possibilities for the development of non-linear modeling, using artificial neural networks as a tool supporting the practical use of and improvement in precision farming techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {With the emergence of low-cost robotic systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicle, the importance of embedded high-performance image processing has increased. For a long time, FPGAs were the only processing hardware that were capable of high-performance computing, while at the same time preserving a low power consumption, essential for embedded systems. However, the recently increasing availability of embedded GPU-based systems, such as the NVIDIA Jetson series, comprised of an ARM CPU and a NVIDIA Tegra GPU, allows for massively parallel embedded computing on graphics hardware. With this in mind, we propose an approach for real-time embedded stereo processing on ARM and CUDA-enabled devices, which is based on the popular and widely used Semi-Global Matching algorithm. In this, we propose an optimization of the algorithm for embedded CUDA GPUs, by using massively parallel computing, as well as using the NEON intrinsics to optimize the algorithm for vectorized SIMD processing on embedded ARM CPUs. We have evaluated our approach with different configurations on two public stereo benchmark datasets to demonstrate that they can reach an error rate as low as 3.3%. Furthermore, our experiments show that the fastest configuration of our approach reaches up to 46 FPS on VGA image resolution. Finally, in a use-case specific qualitative evaluation, we have evaluated the power consumption of our approach and deployed it on the DJI Manifold 2-G attached to a DJI Matrix 210v2 RTK unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), demonstrating its suitability for real-time stereo processing onboard a UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {Anomaly detection has gained considerable attention in the past couple of years. Emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), are known to be among the most critical sources of data streams that produce massive amounts of data continuously from numerous applications. Examining these collected data to detect suspicious events can reduce functional threats and avoid unseen issues that cause downtime in the applications. Due to the dynamic nature of the data stream characteristics, many unresolved problems persist. In the existing literature, methods have been designed and developed to evaluate certain anomalous behaviors in IoT data stream sources. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that discuss all the aspects of IoT data processing. Thus, this paper attempts to fill this gap by providing a complete image of various state-of-the-art techniques on the major problems and core challenges in IoT data. The nature of data, anomaly types, learning mode, window model, datasets, and evaluation criteria are also presented. Research challenges related to data evolving, feature-evolving, windowing, ensemble approaches, nature of input data, data complexity and noise, parameters selection, data visualizations, heterogeneity of data, accuracy, and large-scale and high-dimensional data are investigated. Finally, the challenges that require substantial research efforts and future directions are summarized.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the last several decades, thanks to improvements in and the diversification of open-access satellite imagery, land cover mapping techniques have evolved significantly. Notable changes in these techniques involve the automation of different steps, yielding promising results in terms of accuracy, class detection and efficiency. The most successful methodologies that have arisen rely on the use of multi-temporal data. Several different approaches have proven successful. In this study, one of the most recently developed methodologies is tested in the region of Galicia (in Northwestern Spain), with the aim of filling gaps in the mapping needs of the Galician forestry sector. The methodology mainly consists of performing a supervised classification of individual images from a selected time series and then combining them through aggregation using decision criteria. Several of the steps of the methodology can be addressed in multiple ways: pixel resolution selection, classification model building and aggregation methods. The effectiveness of these three tasks as well as some others are tested and evaluated and the most accurate and efficient parameters for the case study area are highlighted. The final land cover map that is obtained for Galicia has high accuracy metrics (an overall accuracy of 91.6%), which is in line with previous studies that have followed this methodology in other regions. This study has led to the development of an efficient open-access solution to support the mapping needs of the forestry sector.},

ABSTRACT = {Prolonged dry periods and increased temperatures that result from anthropogenic climate change have been shown to increase the frequency and severity of wildfires in the boreal region. There is growing evidence that such changes in fire regime can reduce forest resilience and drive shifts in post-fire plant successional trajectories. The response of post-fire vegetation communities to climate variability is under-studied, despite being a critical phase determining the ultimate successional conclusion. This study investigated the responses of post-fire recruited species to climate change and inter-annual variability at 16 study sites that experienced high-severity fire events, mostly in early 2000, within the Scots pine forest-steppe zone of southeastern Siberia, Russia. These sites were originally dominated by Scots pine, and by 2018, they were recruited by different successional species. Additionally, three mature Scots pine stands were included for comparison. A Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) approach was used to model the relationship between Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, temperature and precipitation in the 15 years after a stand-replacing fire. Using the resulting BART models, together with six projected climate scenarios with increased temperature and enhanced inner-annual precipitation variability, we simulated NDVI at 5-year intervals for 15 years post-fire. Our results show that the BART models performed well, with in-sample Pseudo-R2 varying from 0.49 to 0.95 for fire-disturbed sites. Increased temperature enhanced greenness across all sites and across all three time periods since fires, exhibiting a positive feedback in a warming environment. Repeatedly dry spring periods reduced NDVI at all the sites and wetter summer periods following such dry springs could not compensate for this, indicating that a prolonged dry spring has a strong impact consistently over the entire early developmental stages from the initial 5 years to 15 years post-fire. Further, young forests showed higher climate sensitivity compared to the mature forest, irrespective of species and projected climatic conditions. Our findings suggest that a dry spring not only increases fire risk, but also delays recovery of boreal forests in southern Siberia. It also highlights the importance of changing rainfall seasonality as well as total rainfall in a changing climate for post-fire recovery of forest.},

ABSTRACT = {Forage dry matter is the main source of nutrients in the diet of ruminant animals. Thus, this trait is evaluated in most forage breeding programs with the objective of increasing the yield. Novel solutions combining unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and computer vision are crucial to increase the efficiency of forage breeding programs, to support high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), aiming to estimate parameters correlated to important traits. The main goal of this study was to propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach using UAV-RGB imagery to estimate dry matter yield traits in a guineagrass breeding program. For this, an experiment composed of 330 plots of full-sib families and checks conducted at Embrapa Beef Cattle, Brazil, was used. The image dataset was composed of images obtained with an RGB sensor embedded in a Phantom 4 PRO. The traits leaf dry matter yield (LDMY) and total dry matter yield (TDMY) were obtained by conventional agronomic methodology and considered as the ground-truth data. Different CNN architectures were analyzed, such as AlexNet, ResNeXt50, DarkNet53, and two networks proposed recently for related tasks named MaCNN and LF-CNN. Pretrained AlexNet and ResNeXt50 architectures were also studied. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for training and testing the model. Estimates of DMY traits by each CNN architecture were considered as new HTP traits to compare with real traits. Pearson correlation coefficient r between real and HTP traits ranged from 0.62 to 0.79 for LDMY and from 0.60 to 0.76 for TDMY; root square mean error (RSME) ranged from 286.24 to 366.93 kg·ha−1 for LDMY and from 413.07 to 506.56 kg·ha−1 for TDMY. All the CNNs generated heritable HTP traits, except LF-CNN for LDMY and AlexNet for TDMY. Genetic correlations between real and HTP traits were high but varied according to the CNN architecture. HTP trait from ResNeXt50 pretrained achieved the best results for indirect selection regardless of the dry matter trait. This demonstrates that CNNs with remote sensing data are highly promising for HTP for dry matter yield traits in forage breeding programs.},

ABSTRACT = {The form of a remote sensing index is generally empirically defined, whether by choosing specific reflectance bands, equation forms or its coefficients. These spectral indices are used as preprocessing stage before object detection/classification. But no study seems to search for the best form through function approximation in order to optimize the classification and/or segmentation. The objective of this study is to develop a method to find the optimal index, using a statistical approach by gradient descent on different forms of generic equations. From six wavebands images, five equations have been tested, namely: linear, linear ratio, polynomial, universal function approximator and dense morphological. Few techniques in signal processing and image analysis are also deployed within a deep-learning framework. Performances of standard indices and DeepIndices were evaluated using two metrics, the dice (similar to f1-score) and the mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores. The study focuses on a specific multispectral camera used in near-field acquisition of soil and vegetation surfaces. These DeepIndices are built and compared to 89 common vegetation indices using the same vegetation dataset and metrics. As an illustration the most used index for vegetation, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices) offers a mIoU score of 63.98% whereas our best models gives an analytic solution to reconstruct an index with a mIoU of 82.19%. This difference is significant enough to improve the segmentation and robustness of the index from various external factors, as well as the shape of detected elements.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the hyperspectral sensors and exploit the potential of satellite hyperspectral data for predicting soil properties, we took MingShui County as the study area, which the study area is approximately 1481 km2, and we selected Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite hyperspectral image of the study area to explore an applicable and accurate denoising method that can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of soil organic matter (SOM) content. First, fractional-order derivative (FOD) processing is performed on the original reflectance (OR) to evaluate the optimal FOD. Second, singular value decomposition (SVD), Fourier transform (FT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) are used to denoise the OR and optimal FOD reflectance. Third, the spectral indexes of the reflectance under different denoising methods are extracted by optimal band combination algorithm, and the input variables of different denoising methods are selected by the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm. Finally, the SOM content is predicted by a random forest prediction model. The results reveal that 0.6-order reflectance describes more useful details in satellite hyperspectral data. Five spectral indexes extracted from the reflectance under different denoising methods have a strong correlation with the SOM content, which is helpful for realizing high-accuracy SOM predictions. All three denoising methods can reduce the noise in hyperspectral data, and the accuracies of the different denoising methods are ranked DWT &gt; FT &gt; SVD, where 0.6-order-DWT has the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 3.36 g kg−1, and RPIQ = 1.71). This paper is relatively novel, in that GF-5 satellite hyperspectral data based on different denoising methods are used to predict SOM, and the results provide a highly robust and novel method for mapping the spatial distribution of SOM content at the regional scale.},

ABSTRACT = {Sensor applications for plant phenotyping can advance and strengthen crop breeding programs. One of the powerful sensing options is the automated sensor system, which can be customized and applied for plant science research. The system can provide high spatial and temporal resolution data to delineate crop interaction with weather changes in a diverse environment. Such a system can be integrated with the internet to enable the internet of things (IoT)-based sensor system development for real-time crop monitoring and management. In this study, the Raspberry Pi-based sensor (imaging) system was fabricated and integrated with a microclimate sensor to evaluate crop growth in a spring wheat breeding trial for automated phenotyping applications. Such an in-field sensor system will increase the reproducibility of measurements and improve the selection efficiency by investigating dynamic crop responses as well as identifying key growth stages (e.g., heading), assisting in the development of high-performing crop varieties. In the low-cost system developed here-in, a Raspberry Pi computer and multiple cameras (RGB and multispectral) were the main components. The system was programmed to automatically capture and manage the crop image data at user-defined time points throughout the season. The acquired images were suitable for extracting quantifiable plant traits, and the images were automatically processed through a Python script (an open-source programming language) to extract vegetation indices, representing crop growth and overall health. Ongoing efforts are conducted towards integrating the sensor system for real-time data monitoring via the internet that will allow plant breeders to monitor multiple trials for timely crop management and decision making.},

ABSTRACT = {Remotely sensing data have advantages in filling spatiotemporal gaps of in situ observation networks, showing potential application for monitoring floods in data-sparse regions. By using the water level retrievals of Jason-2/3 altimetry satellites, this study estimates discharge at a 10-day timescale for the virtual station (VS) 012 and 077 across the midstream Yangtze River Basin during 2009–2016 based on the developed Manning formula. Moreover, we calibrate a hybrid model combined with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, by coupling the GR6J hydrological model with a machine learning model to simulate discharge. To physically capture the flood processes, the random forest (RF) model is employed to downscale the 10-day discharge into a daily scale. The results show that: (1) discharge estimates from the developed Manning formula show good accuracy for the VS012 and VS077 based on the improved Multi-subwaveform Multi-weight Threshold Retracker; (2) the combination of the GR6J and the LSTM models substantially improves the performance of the discharge estimates solely from either the GR6J or LSTM models; (3) RF-downscaled daily discharge demonstrates a general consistency with in situ data, where NSE/KGE between them are as high as 0.69/0.83. Our approach, based on multi-source remotely sensing data and machine learning techniques, may benefit flood monitoring in poorly gauged areas.},

ABSTRACT = {Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) satellite mission is expanding the spatial bounds and temporal resolution of large-scale mapping applications. Integrating the recent GEDI data into Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS)-derived estimations represents a global opportunity to update and extend forest models based on area based approaches (ABA) considering temporal and spatial dynamics. This study evaluates the effect of combining ALS-based aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates with GEDI-derived models by using temporally coincident datasets. A gradient of forest ecosystems, distributed through 21,766 km2 in the province of Badajoz (Spain), with different species and structural complexity, was used to: (i) assess the accuracy of GEDI canopy height in five Mediterranean Ecosystems and (ii) develop GEDI-based AGB models when using ALS-derived AGB estimates at GEDI footprint level. In terms of Pearson’s correlation (r) and rRMSE, the agreement between ALS and GEDI statistics on canopy height was stronger in the denser and homogeneous coniferous forest of P. pinaster and P. pinea than in sparse Quercus-dominated forests. The GEDI-derived AGB models using relative height and vertical canopy metrics yielded a model efficiency (Mef) ranging from 0.31 to 0.46, with a RMSE ranging from 14.13 to 32.16 Mg/ha and rRMSE from 38.17 to 84.74%, at GEDI footprint level by forest type. The impact of forest structure confirmed previous studies achievements, since GEDI data showed higher uncertainty in highly multilayered forests. In general, GEDI-derived models (GEDI-like Level4A) underestimated AGB over lower and higher ALS-derived AGB intervals. The proposed models could also be used to monitor biomass stocks at large-scale by using GEDI footprint level in Mediterranean areas, especially in remote and hard-to-reach areas for forest inventory. The findings from this study serve to provide an initial evaluation of GEDI data for estimating AGB in Mediterranean forest.},

ABSTRACT = {In the process of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight testing, plenty of compound faults exist, which could be composed of concurrent single faults or over-limit states alarmed by Built-In-Test (BIT) equipment. At present, there still lacks a suitable automatic labeling approach for UAV flight data, effectively utilizing the information of the BIT record. The performance of the originally employed flight data-driven fault diagnosis models based on machine learning needs to be improved as well. A compound fault labeling and diagnosis method based on actual flight data and the BIT record of the UAV during flight test phase is proposed, through labeling the flight data with compound fault modes corresponding to concurrent single faults recorded by the BIT system, and upgrading the original diagnosis model based on Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Fully Convolutional Network (FCNN), to eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The experimental results based on actual test flight data show that the proposed method could effectively label the flight data and obtain a significant improvement in diagnostic performance, appearing to be practical in the UAV test flight process.},

ABSTRACT = {An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can greatly reduce manpower in the agricultural plant protection such as watering, sowing, and pesticide spraying. It is essential to develop a Decision-making Support System (DSS) for UAVs to help them choose the correct action in states according to the policy. In an unknown environment, the method of formulating rules for UAVs to help them choose actions is not applicable, and it is a feasible solution to obtain the optimal policy through reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that the existing reinforcement learning algorithms cannot get the optimal policy for a UAV in the agricultural plant protection environment. In this work we propose an improved Q-learning algorithm based on similar state matching, and we prove theoretically that there has a greater probability for UAV choosing the optimal action according to the policy learned by the algorithm we proposed than the classic Q-learning algorithm in the agricultural plant protection environment. This proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on datasets that are evenly distributed based on real UAV parameters and real farm information. The performance evaluation of the algorithm is discussed in detail. Experimental results show that the algorithm we proposed can efficiently learn the optimal policy for UAVs in the agricultural plant protection environment.},

ABSTRACT = {Corrosion identification and repair is a vital task in aircraft maintenance to ensure continued structural integrity. Regarding fuselage lap joints, typically, visual inspections are followed by non-destructive methodologies, which are time-consuming. The visual inspection of large areas suffers not only from subjectivity but also from the variable probability of corrosion detection, which is aggravated by the multiple layers used in fuselage construction. In this paper, we propose a methodology for automatic image-based corrosion detection of aircraft structures using deep neural networks. For machine learning, we use a dataset that consists of D-Sight Aircraft Inspection System (DAIS) images from different lap joints of Boeing and Airbus aircrafts. We also employ transfer learning to overcome the shortage of aircraft corrosion images. With precision of over 93%, we demonstrate that our approach detects corrosion with a precision comparable to that of trained operators, aiding to reduce the uncertainties related to operator fatigue or inadequate training. Our results indicate that our methodology can support specialists and engineers in corrosion monitoring in the aerospace industry, potentially contributing to the automation of condition-based maintenance protocols.},

ABSTRACT = {The aboveground fresh weight of weeds is an important indicator that reflects their biomass and physiological activity and directly affects the criteria for determining the amount of herbicides to apply. In precision agriculture, the development of models that can accurately locate weeds and predict their fresh weight can provide visual support for accurate, variable herbicide application in real time. In this work, we develop a two-stream dense feature fusion convolutional network model based on RGB-D data for the real-time prediction of the fresh weight of weeds. A data collection method is developed for the compilation and production of RGB-D data sets. The acquired images undergo data enhancement, and a depth transformation data enhancement method suitable for depth data is proposed. The main idea behind the approach in this study is to use the YOLO-V4 model to locate weeds and use the two-stream dense feature fusion network to predict their aboveground fresh weight. In the two-stream dense feature fusion network, DenseNet and NiN methods are used to construct a Dense-NiN-Block structure for deep feature extraction and fusion. The Dense-NiN-Block module was embedded in five convolutional neural networks for comparison, and the best results were achieved with DenseNet201. The test results show that the predictive ability of the convolutional network using RGB-D as the input is better than that of the network using RGB as the input without the Dense-NiN-Block module. The mAP of the proposed network is 75.34% (IoU value of 0.5), the IoU is 86.36%, the detection speed of the fastest model with a RTX2080Ti NVIDIA graphics card is 17.8 fps, and the average relative error is approximately 4%. The model proposed in this paper can provide visual technical support for precise, variable herbicide application. The model can also provide a reference method for the non-destructive prediction of crop fresh weight in the field and can contribute to crop breeding and genetic improvement.},

ABSTRACT = {Satellite mapping of buildings and built-up areas used to be delineated from high spatial resolution (e.g., meters or sub-meters) and middle spatial resolution (e.g., tens of meters or hundreds of meters) satellite images, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, it is important to explore a deep-learning approach to delineate high-resolution semantic maps of buildings from middle-resolution satellite images. The approach is termed as super-resolution semantic segmentation in this paper. Specifically, we design a neural network with integrated low-level image features of super-resolution and high-level semantic features of super-resolution, which is trained with Sentinel-2A images (i.e., 10 m) and higher-resolution semantic maps (i.e., 2.5 m). The network, based on super-resolution semantic segmentation features is called FSRSS-Net. In China, the 35 cities are partitioned into three groups, i.e., 19 cities for model training, four cities for quantitative testing and the other 12 cities for qualitative generalization ability analysis of the learned networks. A large-scale sample dataset is created and utilized to train and validate the performance of the FSRSS-Net, which includes 8597 training samples and 766 quantitative accuracy evaluation samples. Quantitative evaluation results show that: (1) based on the 10 m Sentinel-2A image, the FSRSS-Net can achieve super-resolution semantic segmentation and produce 2.5 m building recognition results, and there is little difference between the accuracy of 2.5 m results by FSRSS-Net and 10 m results by U-Net. More importantly, the 2.5 m building recognition results by FSRSS-Net have higher accuracy than the 2.5 m results by U-Net 10 m building recognition results interpolation up-sampling; (2) from the spatial visualization of the results, the building recognition results of 2.5 m are more precise than those of 10 m, and the outline of the building is better depicted. Qualitative analysis shows that: (1) the learned FSRSS-Net can be also well generalized to other cities that are far from training regions; (2) the FSRSS-Net can still achieve comparable results to the U-Net 2 m building recognition results, even when the U-Net is directly trained using both 2-meter resolution GF2 satellite images and corresponding semantic labels.},

ABSTRACT = {It is important for equipment to operate safely and reliably so that the working state of mechanical parts pushes forward an immense influence. Therefore, in order to enhance the dependability and security of mechanical equipment, to accurately predict the changing trend of mechanical components in advance plays a significant role. This paper introduces a novel condition prediction method, named error fusion of hybrid neural networks (EFHNN), by combining the error fusion of multiple sparse auto-encoders with convolutional neural networks for predicting the mechanical condition. First, to improve prediction accuracy, we can use the error fusion of multiple sparse auto-encoders to collect multi-feature information, and obtain a trend curve representing machine condition as well as a threshold line that can indicate the beginning of mechanical failure by computing the square prediction error (SPE). Then, convolutional neural networks predict the state of the machine according to the original data when the SPE value exceeds the threshold line. It can be seen from this result that the EFHNN method in the prediction of mechanical fault time series is available and superior.},

ABSTRACT = {Pilgerodendron uviferum (D. Don) Florin is an endemic, threatened conifer that grows in South America. In the sub-Antarctic territory, one of the most isolated places in the world, some forest patches remain untouched since the last glaciation. In this study, we analyze the tree structure and tree diversity and characterize the environmental conditions where P. uviferum-dominated stands develop within the Magellanic islands in Kawésqar National Park, Chile. An environmental matrix using the databases WorldClim and SoilGrids and local topography variables was used to identify the main environmental variables that explain the P. uviferum-dominated stands. PCA was used to reduce the environmental variables, and PERMANOVA and nMDS were used to evaluate differences among forest communities. The results show that two forest communities are present within the Magellanic islands. Both forest communities share the fact that they can persist over time due to the high water table that limits the competitive effect from other tree species less tolerant to high soil water table and organic matter. Our results contribute to knowledge of the species’ environmental preference and design conservation programs.},

ABSTRACT = {The diameter distributions of trees in 50 temporary sample plots (TSPs) established in Pinus halepensis Mill. stands were recovered from LiDAR metrics by using six probability density functions (PDFs): the Weibull (2P and 3P), Johnson’s SB, beta, generalized beta and gamma-2P functions. The parameters were recovered from the first and the second moments of the distributions (mean and variance, respectively) by using parameter recovery models (PRM). Linear models were used to predict both moments from LiDAR data. In recovering the functions, the location parameters of the distributions were predetermined as the minimum diameter inventoried, and scale parameters were established as the maximum diameters predicted from LiDAR metrics. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic (Dn), number of acceptances by the KS test, the Cramér von Misses (W2) statistic, bias and mean square error (MSE) were used to evaluate the goodness of fits. The fits for the six recovered functions were compared with the fits to all measured data from 58 TSPs (LiDAR metrics could only be extracted from 50 of the plots). In the fitting phase, the location parameters were fixed at a suitable value determined according to the forestry literature (0.75·dmin). The linear models used to recover the two moments of the distributions and the maximum diameters determined from LiDAR data were accurate, with R2 values of 0.750, 0.724 and 0.873 for dg, dmed and dmax. Reasonable results were obtained with all six recovered functions. The goodness-of-fit statistics indicated that the beta function was the most accurate, followed by the generalized beta function. The Weibull-3P function provided the poorest fits and the Weibull-2P and Johnson’s SB also yielded poor fits to the data.},

ABSTRACT = {The detection and counting of wheat ears are very important for crop field management, yield estimation, and phenotypic analysis. Previous studies have shown that most methods for detecting wheat ears were based on shallow features such as color and texture extracted by machine learning methods, which have obtained good results. However, due to the lack of robustness of these features, it was difficult for the above-mentioned methods to meet the detection and counting of wheat ears in natural scenes. Other studies have shown that convolutional neural network (CNN) methods could be used to achieve wheat ear detection and counting. However, the adhesion and occlusion of wheat ears limit the accuracy of detection. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of wheat ear detection and counting in the field, an improved YOLOv4 (you only look once v4) with CBAM (convolutional block attention module) including spatial and channel attention model was proposed that could enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network by adding receptive field modules. In addition, to improve the generalization ability of the model, not only local wheat data (WD), but also two public data sets (WEDD and GWHDD) were used to construct the training set, the validation set, and the test set. The results showed that the model could effectively overcome the noise in the field environment and realize accurate detection and counting of wheat ears with different density distributions. The average accuracy of wheat ear detection was 94%, 96.04%, and 93.11%. Moreover, the wheat ears were counted on 60 wheat images. The results showed that R2 = 0.8968 for WD, 0.955 for WEDD, and 0.9884 for GWHDD. In short, the CBAM-YOLOv4 model could meet the actual requirements of wheat ear detection and counting, which provided technical support for other high-throughput parameters of the extraction of crops.},

ABSTRACT = {The global economy is now under threat due to the ongoing domestic and international lockdown for COVID-19. Many have already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the Corona era. Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and agriculture, there are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The roles of modern technology, the Internet of things, and artificial intelligence are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic prosperity in the post-COVID-19 economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by 2050 to meet global food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving food production and distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and addressing the double burden of malnutrition. As the world’s population is growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods, technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced. The urban smart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production, which can be introduced at any adaptive reuse, retrofit, or new buildings in vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity as well as its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and benefits. This review has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations in the development of the system, vertical farming management, and modern technologies approach.},

ABSTRACT = {With the advances in networking technologies, robots can use the almost unlimited resources of large data centers, overcoming the severe limitations imposed by onboard resources: this is the vision of Cloud Robotics. In this context, we present DewROS, a framework based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) which embodies the three-layer, Dew-Robotics architecture, where computation and storage can be distributed among the robot, the network devices close to it, and the Cloud. After presenting the design and implementation of DewROS, we show its application in a real use-case called SHERPA, which foresees a mixed ground and aerial robotic platform for search and rescue in an alpine environment. We used DewROS to analyze the video acquired by the drones in the Cloud and quickly spot signs of human beings in danger. We perform a wide experimental evaluation using different network technologies and Cloud services from Google and Amazon. We evaluated the impact of several variables on the performance of the system. Our results show that, for example, the video length has a minimal impact on the response time with respect to the video size. In addition, we show that the response time depends on the Round Trip Time (RTT) of the network connection when the video is already loaded into the Cloud provider side. Finally, we present a model of the annotation time that considers the RTT of the connection used to reach the Cloud, discussing results and insights into how to improve current Cloud Robotics applications.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a novel adaptive object movement and motion tracking (AdaMM) framework in a hierarchical edge computing system for achieving GPU memory footprint reduction of deep learning (DL)-based video surveillance services. DL-based object movement and motion tracking requires a significant amount of resources, such as (1) GPU processing power for the inference phase and (2) GPU memory for model loading. Despite the absence of an object in the video, if the DL model is loaded, the GPU memory must be kept allocated for the loaded model. Moreover, in several cases, video surveillance tries to capture events that rarely occur (e.g., abnormal object behaviors); therefore, such standby GPU memory might be easily wasted. To alleviate this problem, the proposed AdaMM framework categorizes the tasks used for the object movement and motion tracking procedure in an increasing order of the required processing and memory resources as task (1) frame difference calculation, task (2) object detection, and task (3) object motion and movement tracking. The proposed framework aims to adaptively release the unnecessary standby object motion and movement tracking model to save GPU memory by utilizing light tasks, such as frame difference calculation and object detection in a hierarchical manner. Consequently, object movement and motion tracking are adaptively triggered if the object is detected within the specified threshold time; otherwise, the GPU memory for the model of task (3) can be released. Moreover, object detection is also adaptively performed if the frame difference over time is greater than the specified threshold. We implemented the proposed AdaMM framework using commercial edge devices by considering a three-tier system, such as the 1st edge node for both tasks (1) and (2), the 2nd edge node for task (3), and the cloud for sending a push alarm. A measurement-based experiment reveals that the proposed framework achieves a maximum GPU memory reduction of 76.8% compared to the baseline system, while requiring a 2680 ms delay for loading the model for object movement and motion tracking.},

ABSTRACT = {Airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (RS) collecting hyperspectral imagery provides unprecedented opportunities for the detection and monitoring of floating riverine and marine plastic debris. However, a major challenge in the application of RS techniques is the lack of a fundamental understanding of spectral signatures of water-borne plastic debris. Recent work has emphasised the case for open-access hyperspectral reflectance reference libraries of commonly used polymer items. In this paper, we present and analyse a high-resolution hyperspectral image database of a unique mix of 40 virgin macroplastic items and vegetation. Our double camera setup covered the visible to shortwave infrared (VIS-SWIR) range from 400 to 1700 nm in a darkroom experiment with controlled illumination. The cameras scanned the samples floating in water and captured high-resolution images in 336 spectral bands. Using the resulting reflectance spectra of 1.89 million pixels in linear discriminant analyses (LDA), we determined the importance of each spectral band for discriminating between water and mixed floating debris, and vegetation and plastics. The absorption peaks of plastics (1215 nm, 1410 nm) and vegetation (710 nm, 1450 nm) are associated with high LDA weights. We then compared Sentinel-2 and Worldview-3 satellite bands with these outcomes and identified 12 satellite bands to overlap with important wavelengths for discrimination between the classes. Lastly, the Normalised Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) and Floating Debris Index (FDI) were calculated to determine why they work, and how they could potentially be improved. These findings could be used to enhance existing efforts in monitoring macroplastic pollution, as well as form a baseline for the design of future multispectral RS systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Spectral indices rarely show consistency in estimating crop traits across growth stages; thus, it is critical to simultaneously evaluate a group of spectral variables and select the most informative spectral indices for retrieving crop traits. The objective of this study was to explore the optimal spectral predictors for above-ground biomass (AGB) by applying Random Forest (RF) on three types of spectral predictors: the full spectrum, published spectral indices (Pub-SIs), and optimized spectral indices (Opt-SIs). Canopy hyperspectral reflectance of potato plants, treated with seven nitrogen (N) rates, was obtained during the tuber formation and tuber bulking from 2015 to 2016. Twelve Pub-SIs were selected, and their spectral bands were optimized using band optimization algorithms. Results showed that the Opt-SIs were the best input variables of RF models. Compared to the best empirical model based on Opt-SIs, the Opt-SIs based RF model improved the prediction of AGB, with R2 increased by 6%, 10%, and 16% at the tuber formation, tuber bulking, and for across the two growth stages, respectively. The Opt-SIs can significantly reduce the number of input variables. The optimized Blue nitrogen index (Opt-BNI) and Modified red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (Opt-mND705) combined with an RF model showed the best performance in estimating potato AGB at the tuber formation stage (R2 = 0.88). In the tuber bulking stage, only using optimized Nitrogen planar domain index (Opt-NPDI) as the input variable of the RF model produced satisfactory accuracy in training and testing datasets, with the R2, RMSE, and RE being 0.92, 208.6 kg/ha, and 10.3%, respectively. The Opt-BNI and Double-peak nitrogen index (Opt-NDDA) coupling with an RF model explained 86% of the variations in potato AGB, with the lowest RMSE (262.9 kg/ha) and RE (14.8%) across two growth stages. This study shows that combining the Opt-SIs and RF can greatly enhance the prediction accuracy for crop AGB while significantly reduces collinearity and redundancies of spectral data.},

ABSTRACT = {Urban green infrastructures (UGI) can effectively reduce surface runoff, thereby alleviating the pressure of urban waterlogging. Due to the shortage of land resources in metropolitan areas, it is necessary to understand how to utilize the limited UGI area to maximize the waterlogging mitigation function. Less attention, however, has been paid to investigating the threshold level of waterlogging mitigation capacity. Additionally, various studies mainly focused on the individual effects of UGI factors on waterlogging but neglected the interactive effects between these factors. To overcome this limitation, two waterlogging high-risk coastal cities—Guangzhou and Shenzhen, are selected to examine the effectiveness and stability of UGI in alleviating urban waterlogging. The results indicate that the impact of green infrastructure on urban waterlogging largely depends on its area and biophysical parameter. Healthier or denser vegetation (superior ecological environment) can more effectively intercept and store rainwater runoff. This suggests that while increasing the area of UGI, more attention should be paid to the biophysical parameter of vegetation. Hence, the mitigation effect of green infrastructure would be improved from the “size” and “health”. The interaction of composition and spatial configuration greatly enhances their individual effects on waterlogging. This result underscores the importance of the interactive enhancement effect between UGI composition and spatial configuration. Therefore, it is particularly important to optimize the UGI composition and spatial pattern under limited land resource conditions. Lastly, the effect of green infrastructure on waterlogging presents a threshold phenomenon. The excessive area proportions of UGI within the watershed unit or an oversized UGI patch may lead to a waste of its mitigation effect. Therefore, the area proportion of UGI and its mitigation effect should be considered comprehensively when planning UGI. It is recommended to control the proportion of green infrastructure at the watershed scale (24.4% and 72.1% for Guangzhou and Shenzhen) as well as the area of green infrastructure patches (1.9 ha and 2.8 ha for Guangzhou and Shenzhen) within the threshold level to maximize its mitigation effect. Given the growing concerns of global warming and continued rapid urbanization, these findings provide practical urban waterlogging prevention strategies toward practical implementations.},

ABSTRACT = {The accurate and timely estimation of regional crop biomass at different growth stages is of great importance in guiding crop management decision making. The recent availability of long time series of remote sensing data offers opportunities for crop monitoring. In this paper, four machine learning models, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were adopted to estimate the seasonal corn biomass based on field observation data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data from 2012 to 2019 in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, China. Nine variables were selected with the forward feature selection approach from among twenty-seven variables potentially influencing corn biomass: soil-adjusted total vegetation index (SATVI), green ratio vegetation index (GRVI), Nadir_B7 (2105–2155 nm), Nadir_B6 (1628–1652 nm), land surface water index (LSWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Nadir_B4 (545–565 nm), and Nadir_B3 (459–479 nm). The results indicated that the corn biomass was suitably estimated (the coefficient of determination (R2) was between 0.72 and 0.78) with the four machine learning models. The XGBoost model performed better than the other three models (R2 = 0.78, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 2.86 t/ha and mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.86 t/ha). Moreover, the RF model was an effective method (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 2.91 t/ha and MAE = 1.91 t/ha), with a performance comparable to that of the XGBoost model. This study provides a reference for estimating crop biomass from MOD43A4 datasets. In addition, the research demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to achieve a relatively accurate estimation of daily corn biomass at a large scale.},

ABSTRACT = {Hydroelectric dams are a major threat to rivers in the Amazon. They are known to decrease river connectivity, alter aquatic habitats, and emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Multiscale remotely sensed data can be used to assess and monitor hydroelectric dams over time. We analyzed the Sinop dam on the Teles Pires river from high spatial resolution satellite imagery to determine the extent of land cover inundated by its reservoir, and subsequent methane emissions from TROPOMI S-5P data. For two case study areas, we generated 3D reconstructions of important endemic fish habitats from unmanned aerial vehicle photographs. We found the reservoir flooded 189 km2 (low water) to 215 km2 (high water) beyond the extent of the Teles Pires river, with 13–30 m tall forest (131.4 Mg/ha average AGB) the predominant flooded class. We further found the reservoir to be a source of methane enhancement in the region. The 3D model showed the shallow habitat had high complexity important for ichthyofauna diversity. The distinctive habitats of rheophile fishes, and of the unique species assemblage found in the tributaries have been permanently modified following inundation. Lastly, we illustrate immersive visualization options for both the satellite imagery and 3D products.},

ABSTRACT = {With increasingly higher levels of automation in aerospace decision support systems, it is imperative that the human operator maintains the required level of situational awareness in different operational conditions and a central role in the decision-making process. While current aerospace systems and interfaces are limited in their adaptability, a Cognitive Human Machine System (CHMS) aims to perform dynamic, real-time system adaptation by estimating the cognitive states of the human operator. Nevertheless, to reliably drive system adaptation of current and emerging aerospace systems, there is a need to accurately and repeatably estimate cognitive states, particularly for Mental Workload (MWL), in real-time. As part of this study, two sessions were performed during a Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) scenario, including a session for offline calibration and validation and a session for online validation of eleven multimodal inference models of MWL. The multimodal inference model implemented included an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), which was used in different configurations to fuse data from an Electroencephalogram (EEG) model’s output, four eye activity features and a control input feature. The online validation of the ANFIS models produced good results, while the best performing model (containing all four eye activity features and the control input feature) showed an average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 0.67 ± 0.18 and Correlation Coefficient (CC) = 0.71 ± 0.15. The remaining six ANFIS models included data from the EEG model’s output, which had an offset discrepancy. This resulted in an equivalent offset for the online multimodal fusion. Nonetheless, the efficacy of these ANFIS models could be confirmed by the pairwise correlation with the task level, where one model demonstrated a CC = 0.77 ± 0.06, which was the highest among all of the ANFIS models tested. Hence, this study demonstrates the suitability for online multimodal fusion of features extracted from EEG signals, eye activity and control inputs to produce an accurate and repeatable inference of MWL.},

ABSTRACT = {One of the main challenges for the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture includes the low replicability and the corresponding difficulty in systematic data gathering, as no two fields are exactly alike. Therefore, the comparison of several pilot experiments in different fields, weather conditions and farming techniques enhances the collective knowledge. Thus, this work provides a summary of the most recent research activities in the form of research projects implemented and validated by the authors in several European countries, with the objective of presenting the already achieved results, the current investigations and the still open technical challenges. As an overall conclusion, it can be mentioned that even though in their primary stages in some cases, AI technologies improve decision support at farm level, monitoring conditions and optimizing production to allow farmers to apply the optimal number of inputs for each crop, thereby boosting yields and reducing water use and greenhouse gas emissions. Future extensions of this work will include new concepts based on autonomous and intelligent robots for plant and soil sample retrieval, and effective livestock management.},

ABSTRACT = {The focus of the present paper is the development of a resilience framework suitable to be applied in assessing the safety of ship LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) bunkering process. Ship propulsion considering LNG as a possible fuel (with dual fuel marine engines installed on board) has favored important discussions about the LNG supply chain and delivery on board to the ship power plant. Within this context, a resilience methodological approach is outlined, including a case study application, to demonstrate its actual effectiveness. With specific reference to the operative steps for LNG bunkering operations in the maritime field, a dynamic model based on Bayesian inference and MCMC simulations can be built, involving the probability of operational perturbations, together with their updates based on the hard (failures) and soft (process variables deviations) evidence emerging during LNG bunkering operations. The approach developed in this work, based on advanced Markov Models and variational fitting algorithms, has proven to be a useful and flexible tool to study, analyze and verify how much the perturbations of systems and subsystems can be absorbed without leading to failure.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rise of Deep Learning approaches in computer vision applications, significant strides have been made towards vehicular autonomy. Research activity in autonomous drone navigation has increased rapidly in the past five years, and drones are moving fast towards the ultimate goal of near-complete autonomy. However, while much work in the area focuses on specific tasks in drone navigation, the contribution to the overall goal of autonomy is often not assessed, and a comprehensive overview is needed. In this work, a taxonomy of drone navigation autonomy is established by mapping the definitions of vehicular autonomy levels, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, to specific drone tasks in order to create a clear definition of autonomy when applied to drones. A top–down examination of research work in the area is conducted, focusing on drone navigation tasks, in order to understand the extent of research activity in each area. Autonomy levels are cross-checked against the drone navigation tasks addressed in each work to provide a framework for understanding the trajectory of current research. This work serves as a guide to research in drone autonomy with a particular focus on Deep Learning-based solutions, indicating key works and areas of opportunity for development of this area in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Neurophysiological studies have shown that the hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal cortex play different roles in animal navigation, but it is still less clear how these structures work together. In this paper, we establish a navigation learning model based on the hippocampal–striatal circuit (NLM-HS), which provides a possible explanation for the navigation mechanism in the animal brain. The hippocampal model generates a cognitive map of the environment and performs goal-directed navigation by using a place cell sequence planning algorithm. The striatal model performs reward-related habitual navigation by using the classic temporal difference learning algorithm. Since the two models may produce inconsistent behavioral decisions, the prefrontal cortex model chooses the most appropriate strategies by using a strategy arbitration mechanism. The cognitive and learning mechanism of the NLM-HS works in two stages of exploration and navigation. First, the agent uses a hippocampal model to construct the cognitive map of the unknown environment. Then, the agent uses the strategy arbitration mechanism in the prefrontal cortex model to directly decide which strategy to choose. To test the validity of the NLM-HS, the classical Tolman detour experiment was reproduced. The results show that the NLM-HS not only makes agents show environmental cognition and navigation behavior similar to animals, but also makes behavioral decisions faster and achieves better adaptivity than hippocampal or striatal models alone.},

An effective task scheduling strategy can maximize the utilization of satellite resources and obtain larger objective observation profits. In this paper, inspired by the success of deep reinforcement learning in optimization domains, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is adopted to solve a time-continuous satellite task scheduling problem. Moreover, an improved graph-based minimum clique partition algorithm is proposed for preprocessing in the task clustering phase by considering the maximum task priority and the minimum observation slewing angle under constraint conditions. Experimental simulation results demonstrate that the deep reinforcement learning-based task scheduling method is feasible and performs much better than traditional metaheuristic optimization algorithms, especially in large-scale problems.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate and spatially explicit yield information is required to ensure farmers’ income and food security at local and national levels. Current approaches based on crop cutting experiments are expensive and usually too late for timely income stabilization measures like crop insurances. We, therefore, utilized a Gradient Boosted Regression (GBR), a machine learning technique, to estimate rice yields at ~500 m spatial resolution for rice-producing areas in India with potential application for near real-time estimates. We used resampled intermediate resolution (~5 km) images of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and observed yields at the district level in India for calibrating GBR models. These GBRs were then used to downscale district yields to 500 m resolution. Downscaled yields were re-aggregated for validation against out-of-sample district yields not used for model training and an additional independent data set of block-level (below district-level) yields. Our downscaled and re-aggregated yields agree well with reported district-level observations from 2003 to 2015 (r = 0.85 &amp; MAE = 0.15 t/ha). The model performance improved further when estimating separate models for different rice cropping densities (up to r = 0.93). An additional out-of-sample validation for the years 2016 and 2017, proved successful with r = 0.84 and r = 0.77, respectively. Simulated yield accuracy was higher in water-limited, rainfed agricultural systems. We conclude that this downscaling approach of rice yield estimation using GBR is feasible across India and may complement current approaches for timely rice yield estimation required by insurance companies and government agencies.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great potential in various applications such as surveillance, search and rescue. To perform safe and efficient navigation, it is vitally important for a UAV to evaluate the environment accurately and promptly. In this work, we present a simulation study for the estimation of foliage distribution as a UAV equipped with biosonar navigates through a forest. Based on a simulated forest environment, foliage echoes are generated by using a bat-inspired bisonar simulator. These biosonar echoes are then used to estimate the spatial distribution of both sparsely and densely distributed tree leaves. While a simple batch processing method is able to estimate sparsely distributed leaf locations well, a wavelet scattering technique coupled with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is shown to be effective to estimate densely distributed leaves. Our approach is validated by using multiple setups of leaf distributions in the simulated forest environment. Ninety-seven percent accuracy is obtained while estimating thickly distributed foliage.},

ABSTRACT = {Edge computing brings artificial intelligence algorithms and graphics processing units closer to data sources, making autonomy and energy-efficient processing vital for their design. Approximate computing has emerged as a popular strategy for energy-efficient circuit design, where the challenge is to achieve the best tradeoff between design efficiency and accuracy. The essential operation in artificial intelligence algorithms is the general matrix multiplication (GEMM) operation comprised of matrix multiplication and accumulation. This paper presents an approximate general matrix multiplication (AGEMM) unit that employs approximate multipliers to perform matrix–matrix operations on four-by-four matrices given in sixteen-bit signed fixed-point format. The synthesis of the proposed AGEMM unit to the 45 nm Nangate Open Cell Library revealed that it consumed only up to 36% of the area and 25% of the energy required by the exact general matrix multiplication unit. The AGEMM unit is ideally suited to convolutional neural networks, which can adapt to the error induced in the computation. We evaluated the AGEMM units’ usability for honeybee detection with the YOLOv4-tiny convolutional neural network. The results implied that we can deploy the AGEMM units in convolutional neural networks without noticeable performance degradation. Moreover, the AGEMM unit’s employment can lead to more area- and energy-efficient convolutional neural network processing, which in turn could prolong sensors’ and edge nodes’ autonomy.},

ABSTRACT = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of the practical application of unmanned aerial vehicles and RGB vegetation indices (VIs) in the monitoring of a coffee crop. The study was conducted in an experimental coffee field over a 12-month period. An RGB digital camera coupled to a UAV was used. Nine VIs were evaluated in this study. These VIs were subjected to a Pearson correlation analysis with the leaf area index (LAI), and subsequently, the VIs with higher R2 values were selected. The LAI was estimated by plant height and crown diameter values obtained by imaging, which were correlated with these values measured in the field. Among the VIs evaluated, MPRI (0.31) and GLI (0.41) presented greater correlation with LAI; however, the correlation was weak. Thematic maps of VIs in the evaluated period showed variability present in the crop. The evolution of weeds in the planting rows was noticeable with both VIs, which can help managers to make the decision to start crop management, thus saving resources. The results show that the use of low-cost UAVs and RGB cameras has potential for monitoring the coffee production cycle, providing producers with information in a more accurate, quick and simple way.},

ABSTRACT = {Most remote sensing studies of urban areas focus on a single scale, using supervised methodologies and very few analyses focus on the “neighborhood” scale. The lack of multi-scale analysis, together with the scarcity of training and validation datasets in many countries lead us to propose a single fast unsupervised method for the characterization of urban areas. With the FOTOTEX algorithm, this paper introduces a texture-based method to characterize urban areas at three nested scales: macro-scale (urban footprint), meso-scale (“neighbourhoods”) and micro-scale (objects). FOTOTEX combines a Fast Fourier Transform and a Principal Component Analysis to convert texture into frequency signal. Several parameters were tested over Sentinel-2 and Pleiades imagery on Bouake and Brasilia. Results showed that a single Sentinel-2 image better assesses the urban footprint than the global products. Pleiades images allowed discriminating neighbourhoods and urban objects using texture, which is correlated with metrics such as building density, built-up and vegetation proportions. The best configurations for each scale of analysis were determined and recommendations provided to users. The open FOTOTEX algorithm demonstrated a strong potential to characterize the three nested scales of urban areas, especially when training and validation data are scarce, and computing resources limited.},

ABSTRACT = {Nitrogen (N) is one of the key nutrients supplied in agricultural production worldwide. Over-fertilization can have negative influences on the field and the regional level (e.g., agro-ecosystems). Remote sensing of the plant N of field crops presents a valuable tool for the monitoring of N flows in agro-ecosystems. Available data for validation of satellite-based remote sensing of N is scarce. Therefore, in this study, field spectrometer measurements were used to simulate data of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites developed for vegetation monitoring by the ESA. The prediction performance of normalized ratio indices (NRIs), random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for plant-N-related traits was assessed on a diverse real-world dataset including multiple crops, field sites and years. The plant N traits included the mass-based N measure, N concentration in the biomass (Nconc), and an area-based N measure approximating the plant N uptake (NUP). Spectral indices such as normalized ratio indices (NRIs) performed well, but the RFR and GPR methods outperformed the NRIs. Key spectral bands for each trait were identified using the RFR variable importance measure and the Gaussian processes regression band analysis tool (GPR-BAT), highlighting the importance of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region for estimation of plant Nconc—and to a lesser extent the NUP. The red edge (RE) region was also important. The GPR-BAT showed that five bands were sufficient for plant N trait and leaf area index (LAI) estimation and that a surplus of bands effectively reduced prediction performance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed on all traits simultaneously, showing the dominance of the LAI in the mixed remote sensing signal. To delineate the plant-N-related traits from this signal, regional and/or national data collection campaigns producing large crop spectral libraries (CSL) are needed. An improved database will likely enable the mapping of N at the agro-ecosystem level or for use in precision farming by farmers in the future.},

ABSTRACT = {The leaf area index (LAI) is an essential input parameter for quantitatively studying the energy and mass balance in soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer systems. As an active remote sensing technology, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) provides a new method to describe forest canopy LAI. This paper reviewed the primary LAI retrieval methods using point cloud data (PCD) obtained by discrete airborne LiDAR scanner (DALS), its validation scheme, and its limitations. There are two types of LAI retrieval methods based on DALS PCD, i.e., the empirical regression and the gap fraction (GF) model. In the empirical model, tree height-related variables, LiDAR penetration indexes (LPIs), and canopy cover are the most widely used proxy variables. The height-related proxies are used most frequently; however, the LPIs proved the most efficient proxy. The GF model based on the Beer-Lambert law has been proven useful to estimate LAI; however, the suitability of LPIs is site-, tree species-, and LiDAR system-dependent. In the local validation in previous studies, poor scalability of both empirical and GF models in time, space, and across different DALS systems was observed, which means that field measurements are still needed to calibrate both types of models. The method to correct the impact from the clumping effect and woody material using DALS PCD and the saturation effect for both empirical and GF models still needs further exploration. Of most importance, further work is desired to emphasize assessing the transferability of published methods to new geographic contexts, different DALS sensors, and survey characteristics, based on figuring out the influence of each factor on the LAI retrieval process using DALS PCD. In addition, from a methodological perspective, taking advantage of DALS PCD in characterizing the 3D structure of the canopy, making full use of the ability of machine learning methods in the fusion of multisource data, developing a spatiotemporal scalable model of canopy structure parameters including LAI, and using multisource and heterogeneous data are promising areas of research.},

ABSTRACT = {Underground utilities are important assets that provide basic services for society’s daily life. They are generally very complex and remain unnoticed until they fail due to any particular reason. The stakeholders involved in the design, construction, and maintenance of utility infrastructure face many problems due to the traditional underground utility management system, resulting in injuries, loss of life, disruptions, project delays, and financial loss. The problem with the traditional system is that it uses 2D drawings and keeps unreliable information or a lack of updated information, which makes it an inefficient utility management system. With the advancement in construction information technology, we can address this effectively by integrating BIM and GIS. In this paper, a novel integrated BIM-GIS framework for underground utility management systems was developed on the basis of IFC to CityGML mapping. It provides an effective underground utility management system that facilitates designers in optimization of the design, assists in the excavator’s operator by providing real-time three-dimensional spatial information during the construction process, and acts as an as-built information database for utility facility management. For validation, a real-time project case study indicated that the proposed system can effectively provide comprehensive underground utility information at different project stages.},

ABSTRACT = {The deficiency of nitrogen (N) in soil restricts agricultural productivity and its overdosage pollutes the atmosphere. Nitrogen is a vital component of protein, chlorophyll and various physiological processes. When it is applied at a recommended dose, it may be lost through fixation, leaching, volatilization and denitrification, etc. Therefore, there is a dire need to harmonize the supply of nitrogen according to crop and soil requirements. Under this situation, precision nitrogen management is one of the best options. GreenSeekerTM is an integrated optical sensor with a variable application rate and mapping system that measures crops’ nitrogen requirements. To ascertain the abovementioned facts, a research study was conducted at the National Agriculture Research Center, Islamabad, Pakistan, to examine the response of fodder oat to nitrogen management (N0 = control, N1 = 80 kg ha−1 basal dose, N2 = 40 + 40 kg ha−1 split doses, N3 = 40 kg ha−1 with one-time management with GreenSeekerTM and N4 = 20 kg ha−1 with two-time management with GreenSeekerTM) and seed rate (S1 = 80, S2 = 100, S3 = 120 and S4 = 140 kg ha−1). Data were recorded on the agronomic and physiological aspects of the crop and economic analysis was performed for GreenSeekerTM-based N application against the conventional recommended dose of nitrogen application. Mean values showed that greater number of tillers plant−1 (6), fresh weight (16572 kg) and photosynthetic rate (11.64 mmol m−2 s−1) were noted in the treatment N4 (20 kg ha−1 and two-time management with GreenSeekerTM). Greater plant height (70.8 cm) and leaf area (64.14 cm2) were recorded in treatment N2 (40 + 40 kg ha−1 split doses) as compared to the control. The effects of nitrogen on fodder oat were forecasted through NDVI. The results suggested that nitrogen treatment N4 (18 kg ha−1) managed by GreenSeeker in the PARC Oat cultivar produced the maximum NDVI value (0.68) at the booting stage among all treatments. The correlation of NDVI at the tillering and booting stages with green fodder yield was positive (R2 = 0.80). Therefore, the tillering and booting stages can be good depictive stages at early and later growth stages of fodder oat under the agro-climatic conditions of Islamabad, Pakistan. Based on the results, it is recommended to apply an initial dose of 20 kg ha−1 nitrogen along with two-time management with GreenSeekerTM for obtaining more green fodder yield in fodder oat. In Crux, with N1, a total of 80 kg ha−1 nitrogen was applied to achieve an estimated net profitability of USD 582.13. With N4, a total 58 kg ha−1 nitrogen was used to achieve a net profitability of USD 836.16; therefore, this treatment was found to be environmentally safe as compared to N1 (80 kg ha−1).},

ABSTRACT = {Introduction: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding, with many applications seen routinely in health care, industry, and education, and increasingly in workplaces. Although there is growing evidence of applications of AI in workplaces across all industries to simplify and/or automate tasks there is a limited understanding of the role that AI contributes in addressing occupational safety and health (OSH) concerns. Methods: This paper introduces a new framework called Risk Evolution, Detection, Evaluation, and Control of Accidents (REDECA) that highlights the role that AI plays in the anticipation and control of exposure risks in a worker’s immediate environment. Two hundred and sixty AI papers across five sectors (oil and gas, mining, transportation, construction, and agriculture) were reviewed using the REDECA framework to highlight current applications and gaps in OSH and AI fields. Results: The REDECA framework highlighted the unique attributes and research focus of each of the five industrial sectors. The majority of evidence of AI in OSH research within the oil/gas and transportation sectors focused on the development of sensors to detect hazardous situations. In construction the focus was on the use of sensors to detect incidents. The research in the agriculture sector focused on sensors and actuators that removed workers from hazardous conditions. Application of the REDECA framework highlighted AI/OSH strengths and opportunities in various industries and potential areas for collaboration. Conclusions: As AI applications across industries continue to increase, further exploration of the benefits and challenges of AI applications in OSH is needed to optimally protect worker health, safety and well-being.},

ABSTRACT = {Armillaria genus represents one of the most common causes of chronic root rot disease in woody plants. Prompt recognition of diseased plants is crucial to control the pathogen. However, the current disease detection methods are limited at a field scale. Therefore, an alternative approach is needed. In this study, we investigated the potential of hyperspectral techniques to identify fungi-infected vs. healthy plants of Vitis vinifera. We used the hyperspectral imaging sensor Specim-IQ to acquire leaves’ reflectance data of the Teroldego Rotaliano grapevine cultivar. We analyzed three different groups of plants: healthy, asymptomatic, and diseased. Highly significant differences were found in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region with a decreasing pattern from healthy to diseased plants attributable to the leaf mesophyll changes. Asymptomatic plants emerged from the other groups due to a lower reflectance in the red edge spectrum (around 705 nm), ascribable to an accumulation of secondary metabolites involved in plant defense strategies. Further significant differences were observed in the wavelengths close to 550 nm in diseased vs. asymptomatic plants. We evaluated several machine learning paradigms to differentiate the plant groups. The Naïve Bayes (NB) algorithm, combined with the most discriminant variables among vegetation indices and spectral narrow bands, provided the best results with an overall accuracy of 90% and 75% in healthy vs. diseased and healthy vs. asymptomatic plants, respectively. To our knowledge, this study represents the first report on the possibility of using hyperspectral data for root rot disease diagnosis in woody plants. Although further validation studies are required, it appears that the spectral reflectance technique, possibly implemented on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), could be a promising tool for a cost-effective, non-invasive method of Armillaria disease diagnosis and mapping in-field, contributing to a significant step forward in precision viticulture.},

ABSTRACT = {The issue of energy balancing in Wireless Sensor Networks is a pivotal one, crucial in their deployment. This problem can be subdivided in three areas: (i) energy conservation techniques, usually implying minimizing the cost of communication at the nodes since it is known that the radio is the biggest consumer of the available energy; (ii) energy-harvesting techniques, converting energy from not full-time available environmental sources and usually storing it; and (iii) energy transfer techniques, sharing energy resources from one node (either specialized or not) to another one. In this article, we survey the main contributions in these three areas and identify the main trending topics in recent research. A discussion and some future directions are also included.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, due to the strong mobility, easy deployment, and low cost of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), great interest has arisen in utilizing UAVs to assist in wireless communication, especially for on-demand deployment in emergency situations and temporary events. However, UAVs can only provide users with data transmission services through wireless backhaul links established with a ground base station, and the limited capacity of the wireless backhaul link would limit the transmission speed of UAVs. Therefore, this paper designed a UAV-assisted wireless communication system that used cache technology and realized the transmission of multi-user data by using the mobility of UAVs and wireless cache technology. Considering the limited storage space and energy of UAVs, the joint optimization problem of the UAV’s trajectory, cache placement, and transmission power was established to minimize the mission time of the UAV. Since this problem was a non-convex problem, it was decomposed into three sub-problems: trajectory optimization, cache placement optimization, and power allocation optimization. An iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation and alternate optimization techniques was proposed to solve these three optimization problems. Finally, in the power allocation optimization, the proposed algorithm was improved by changing the optimization objective function. Numerical results showed that the algorithm had good performance and could effectively reduce the task completion time of the UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning (DL) is a powerful, recently developed image classification approach. With origins in the computer vision and image processing communities, the accuracy assessment methods developed for CNN-based DL use a wide range of metrics that may be unfamiliar to the remote sensing (RS) community. To explore the differences between traditional RS and DL RS methods, we surveyed a random selection of 100 papers from the RS DL literature. The results show that RS DL studies have largely abandoned traditional RS accuracy assessment terminology, though some of the accuracy measures typically used in DL papers, most notably precision and recall, have direct equivalents in traditional RS terminology. Some of the DL accuracy terms have multiple names, or are equivalent to another measure. In our sample, DL studies only rarely reported a complete confusion matrix, and when they did so, it was even more rare that the confusion matrix estimated population properties. On the other hand, some DL studies are increasingly paying attention to the role of class prevalence in designing accuracy assessment approaches. DL studies that evaluate the decision boundary threshold over a range of values tend to use the precision-recall (P-R) curve, the associated area under the curve (AUC) measures of average precision (AP) and mean average precision (mAP), rather than the traditional receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and its AUC. DL studies are also notable for testing the generalization of their models on entirely new datasets, including data from new areas, new acquisition times, or even new sensors.},

ABSTRACT = {The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (also referred to as drones) has transformed the digital landscape of surveillance and supply chain logistics, especially in terrains where such was previously deemed unattainable. Moreover, the adoption of drones has further led to the proliferation of diverse drone types and drone-related criminality, which has introduced a myriad of security and forensics-related concerns. As a step towards understanding the state-of-the-art research into these challenges and potential approaches to mitigation, this study provides a detailed review of existing digital forensic models using the Design Science Research method. The outcome of this study generated in-depth knowledge of the research challenges and opportunities through which an effective investigation can be carried out on drone-related incidents. Furthermore, a potential generic investigation model has been proposed. The findings presented in this study are essentially relevant to forensic researchers and practitioners towards a guided methodology for drone-related event investigation. Ultimately, it is important to mention that this study presents a background for the development of international standardization for drone forensics.},

ABSTRACT = {Since December 2019, the global health population has faced the rapid spreading of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). With the incremental acceleration of the number of infected cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported COVID-19 as an epidemic that puts a heavy burden on healthcare sectors in almost every country. The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in this context is difficult to ignore. AI companies have been racing to develop innovative tools that contribute to arm the world against this pandemic and minimize the disruption that it may cause. The main objective of this study is to survey the decisive role of AI as a technology used to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Five significant applications of AI for COVID-19 were found, including (1) COVID-19 diagnosis using various data types (e.g., images, sound, and text); (2) estimation of the possible future spread of the disease based on the current confirmed cases; (3) association between COVID-19 infection and patient characteristics; (4) vaccine development and drug interaction; and (5) development of supporting applications. This study also introduces a comparison between current COVID-19 datasets. Based on the limitations of the current literature, this review highlights the open research challenges that could inspire the future application of AI in COVID-19.},

ABSTRACT = {Many natural disasters in South America are linked to meteorological phenomena. Therefore, forecasting and monitoring climatic events are fundamental issues for society and various sectors of the economy. In the last decades, machine learning models have been developed to tackle different issues in society, but there is still a gap in applications to applied physics. Here, different machine learning models are evaluated for precipitation prediction over South America. Currently, numerical weather prediction models are unable to precisely reproduce the precipitation patterns in South America due to many factors such as the lack of region-specific parametrizations and data availability. The results are compared to the general circulation atmospheric model currently used operationally in the National Institute for Space Research (INPE: Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais), Brazil. Machine learning models are able to produce predictions with errors under 2 mm in most of the continent in comparison to satellite-observed precipitation patterns for different climate seasons, and also outperform INPE’s model for some regions (e.g., reduction of errors from 8 to 2 mm in central South America in winter). Another advantage is the computational performance from machine learning models, running faster with much lower computer resources than models based on differential equations currently used in operational centers. Therefore, it is important to consider machine learning models for precipitation forecasts in operational centers as a way to improve forecast quality and to reduce computation costs.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning (ML) technology has shown its unique advantages in many fields and has excellent performance in many applications, such as image recognition, speech recognition, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. Recently, the applicability of ML in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has attracted much attention. As resources are limited in WSNs, identifying how to improve resource utilization and achieve power-efficient load balancing is becoming a critical issue in WSNs. Traditional green routing algorithms aim to achieve this by reducing energy consumption and prolonging network lifetime through optimized routing schemes in WSNs. However, there are usually problems such as poor flexibility, a single consideration factor, and a reliance on accurate mathematical models. ML techniques can quickly adapt to environmental changes and integrate multiple factors for routing decisions, which provides new ideas for intelligent energy-efficient routing algorithms in WSNs. In this paper, we survey and propose a theoretical hypothetic model formulation of ML as an effective method for creating a power-efficient green routing model that can overcome the limitations of traditional green routing methods. In addition, the study also provides an overview of past, present, and future progress in green routing schemes in WSNs. The contents of this paper will appeal to a wide range of audiences interested in ML-based WSNs.},

ABSTRACT = {The present work proposed a low-cost portable device as an enabling technology for agriculture using multispectral imaging and machine learning in soil texture. Clay is an important factor for the verification and monitoring of soil use due to its fast reaction to chemical and surface changes.

ABSTRACT = {Timely and reliable information about crop management, production, and yield is considered of great utility by stakeholders (e.g., national and international authorities, farmers, commercial units, etc.) to ensure food safety and security. By 2050, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, around 70% more production of agricultural products will be needed to fulfil the demands of the world population. Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of “zero hunger”, potential technologies like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the 5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications, through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing. The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability. These technologies have made the orientation of current research towards the estimation of plant physiological traits rather than the structural parameters possible. Futuristic approaches for benefiting from these cutting-edge technologies are discussed in this study. This study can be helpful for researchers, academics, and young students aspiring to play a role in the achievement of sustainable agriculture.},

ABSTRACT = {The Kobresia pygmaea (KP) community is a key succession stage of alpine meadow degradation on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, most of the grassland classification and mapping studies have been performed at the grassland type level. The spatial distribution and impact factors of KP on the QTP are still unclear. In this study, field measurements of the grassland vegetation community in the eastern part of the QTP (Counties of Zeku, Henan and Maqu) from 2015 to 2019 were acquired using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology. The machine learning algorithms for grassland vegetation community classification were constructed by combining Gaofen satellite images and topographic indices. Then, the spatial distribution of KP community was mapped. The results showed that: (1) For all field observed sites, the alpine meadow vegetation communities demonstrated a considerable spatial heterogeneity. The traditional classification methods can hardly distinguish those communities due to the high similarity of their spectral characteristics. (2) The random forest method based on the combination of satellite vegetation indices, texture feature and topographic indices exhibited the best performance in three counties, with overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient ranged from 74.06% to 83.92% and 0.65 to 0.80, respectively. (3) As a whole, the area of KP community reached 1434.07 km2, and accounted for 7.20% of the study area. We concluded that the combination of satellite remote sensing, UAV surveying and machine learning can be used for KP classification and mapping at community level.},

ABSTRACT = {Crop diseases constitute a serious issue in agriculture, affecting both quality and quantity of agriculture production. Disease control has been a research object in many scientific and technologic domains. Technological advances in sensors, data storage, computing resources and artificial intelligence have shown enormous potential to control diseases effectively. A growing body of literature recognizes the importance of using data from different types of sensors and machine learning approaches to build models for detection, prediction, analysis, assessment, etc. However, the increasing number and diversity of research studies requires a literature review for further developments and contributions in this area. This paper reviews state-of-the-art machine learning methods that use different data sources, applied to plant disease detection. It lists traditional and deep learning methods associated with the main data acquisition modalities, namely IoT, ground imaging, unmanned aerial vehicle imaging and satellite imaging. In addition, this study examines the role of data fusion for ongoing research in the context of disease detection. It highlights the advantage of intelligent data fusion techniques, from heterogeneous data sources, to improve plant health status prediction and presents the main challenges facing this field.

ABSTRACT = {Developing a bridge management strategy at the network level with efficient use of capital is very important for optimal infrastructure remediation. This paper introduces a novel decision support system that considers many aspects of bridge management and successfully implements the investigated methodology in a web-based platform. The proposed decision support system uses advanced prediction models, decision trees, and incremental machine learning algorithms to generate an optimal decision strategy. The system aims to achieve adaptive and flexible decision making while entailing powerful utilization of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods. The NDE data integration and visualization allow automatic retrieval of inspection results and overlaying the defects on a 3D bridge model. Furthermore, a deep learning-based damage growth prediction model estimates the future condition of the bridge elements and utilizes this information in the decision-making process. The decision ranking takes into account a wide range of factors including structural safety, serviceability, rehabilitation cost, life cycle cost, and societal and political factors to generate optimal maintenance strategies with multiple decision alternatives. This study aims to bring a complementary solution to currently in-use systems with the utilization of advanced machine-learning models and NDE data integration while still equipped with main bridge management functions of bridge management systems and capable of transferring data to other systems.},

ABSTRACT = {In the framework of evidence theory, one of the open and crucial issues is how to determine the basic probability assignment (BPA), which is directly related to whether the decision result is correct. This paper proposes a novel method for obtaining BPA based on Adaboost. The method uses training data to generate multiple strong classifiers for each attribute model, which is used to determine the BPA of the singleton proposition since the weights of classification provide necessary information for fundamental hypotheses. The BPA of the composite proposition is quantified by calculating the area ratio of the singleton proposition’s intersection region. The recursive formula of the area ratio of the intersection region is proposed, which is very useful for computer calculation. Finally, BPAs are combined by Dempster’s rule of combination. Using the proposed method to classify the Iris dataset, the experiment concludes that the total recognition rate is 96.53% and the classification accuracy is 90% when the training percentage is 10%. For the other datasets, the experiment results also show that the proposed method is reasonable and effective, and the proposed method performs well in the case of insufficient samples.},

ABSTRACT = {Plant phenomics has been rapidly advancing over the past few years. This advancement is attributed to the increased innovation and availability of new technologies which can enable the high-throughput phenotyping of complex plant traits. The application of artificial intelligence in various domains of science has also grown exponentially in recent years. Notably, the computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning aspects of artificial intelligence have been successfully integrated into non-invasive imaging techniques. This integration is gradually improving the efficiency of data collection and analysis through the application of machine and deep learning for robust image analysis. In addition, artificial intelligence has fostered the development of software and tools applied in field phenotyping for data collection and management. These include open-source devices and tools which are enabling community driven research and data-sharing, thereby availing the large amounts of data required for the accurate study of phenotypes. This paper reviews more than one hundred current state-of-the-art papers concerning AI-applied plant phenotyping published between 2010 and 2020. It provides an overview of current phenotyping technologies and the ongoing integration of artificial intelligence into plant phenotyping. Lastly, the limitations of the current approaches/methods and future directions are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Multirotor UAVs have become ubiquitous in commercial and public use. As they become more affordable and more available, the associated security risks further increase, especially in relation to airspace breaches and the danger of drone-to-aircraft collisions. Thus, robust systems must be set in place to detect and deal with hostile drones. This paper investigates the use of deep learning methods to detect UAVs using acoustic signals. Deep neural network models are trained with mel-spectrograms as inputs. In this case, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are shown to be the better performing network, compared with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs). Furthermore, late fusion methods have been evaluated using an ensemble of deep neural networks, where the weighted soft voting mechanism has achieved the highest average accuracy of 94.7%, which has outperformed the solo models. In future work, the developed late fusion technique could be utilized with radar and visual methods to further improve the UAV detection performance.},

ABSTRACT = {The recent development and adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is due to its wide variety of applications in public and private sector from parcel delivery to wildlife conservation. The integration of UAVs, 5G, and satellite technologies has prompted telecommunication networks to evolve to provide higher-quality and more stable service to remote areas. However, security concerns with UAVs are growing as UAV nodes are becoming attractive targets for cyberattacks due to enormously growing volumes and poor and weak inbuilt security. In this paper, we propose a UAV- and satellite-based 5G-network security model that can harness machine learning to effectively detect of vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. The solution is divided into two main parts: the model creation for intrusion detection using various machine learning (ML) algorithms and the implementation of ML-based model into terrestrial or satellite gateways. The system identifies various attack types using realistic CSE-CIC IDS-2018 network datasets published by Canadian Establishment for Cybersecurity (CIC). It consists of seven different types of new and contemporary attack types. This paper demonstrates that ML algorithms can be used to classify benign or malicious packets in UAV networks to enhance security. Finally, the tested ML algorithms are compared for effectiveness in terms of accuracy rate, precision, recall, F1-score, and false-negative rate. The decision tree algorithm performed well by obtaining a maximum accuracy rate of 99.99% and a minimum false negative rate of 0% in detecting various attacks as compared to all other types of ML classifiers.},

ABSTRACT = {Rocky desertification occurs in many karst terrains of the world and poses major challenges for regional sustainable development. Remotely sensed data can provide important information on rocky desertification. In this study, three common open-access satellite image datasets (Sentinel-2B, Landsat-8, and Gaofen-6) were used for extracting information on rocky desertification in a typical karst region (Guangnan County, Yunnan) of southwest China, using three machine-learning algorithms implemented in the Python programming language: random forest (RF), bagged decision tree (BDT), and extremely randomized trees (ERT). Comparative analyses of the three data sources and three algorithms show that: (1) The Sentinel-2B image has the best capability for extracting rocky desertification information, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 85.21% using the ERT method. This can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2B image than that of Landsat-8 and Gaofen-6 images and Gaofen-6’s lack of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands suitable for mapping carbonate rocks. (2) The ERT method has the best classification results of rocky desertification. Compared with the RF and BDT methods, the ERT method has stronger randomness in modeling and can effectively identify important feature factors for extracting information on rocky desertification. (3) The combination of the Sentinel-2B images and the ERT method provides an effective, efficient, and free approach to information extraction for mapping rocky desertification. The study can provide a useful reference for effective mapping of rocky desertification in similar karst environments of the world, in terms of both satellite image sources and classification algorithms. It also provides important information on the total area and spatial distribution of different levels of rocky desertification in the study area to support decision making by local governments for sustainable development.},

ABSTRACT = {Hyperspectral technology is used to obtain spectral and spatial information of samples simultaneously and demonstrates significant potential for use in seed purity identification. However, it has certain limitations, such as high acquisition cost and massive redundant information. This study integrates the advantages of the sparse feature of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and the classification feature of the logistic regression model (LRM). We propose a hyperspectral rice seed purity identification method based on the LASSO logistic regression model (LLRM). The feasibility of using LLRM for the selection of feature wavelength bands and seed purity identification are discussed using four types of rice seeds as research objects. The results of 13 different adulteration cases revealed that the value of the regularisation parameter was different in each case. The recognition accuracy of LLRM and average recognition accuracy were 91.67–100% and 98.47%, respectively. Furthermore, the recognition accuracy of full-band LRM was 71.60–100%. However, the average recognition accuracy was merely 89.63%. These results indicate that LLRM can select the feature wavelength bands stably and improve the recognition accuracy of rice seeds, demonstrating the feasibility of developing a hyperspectral technology with LLRM for seed purity identification.},

ABSTRACT = {High-resolution urban image clustering has remained a challenging task. This is mainly because its performance strongly depends on the discrimination power of features. Recently, several studies focused on unsupervised learning methods by autoencoders to learn and extract more efficient features for clustering purposes. This paper proposes a Boosted Convolutional AutoEncoder (BCAE) method based on feature learning for efficient urban image clustering. The proposed method was applied to multi-sensor remote-sensing images through a multistep workflow. The optical data were first preprocessed by applying a Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation. Then, these MNF features, in addition to the normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) and vegetation indexes such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Excess Green (ExG(2)), were used as the inputs of the BCAE model. Next, our proposed convolutional autoencoder was trained to automatically encode upgraded features and boost the hand-crafted features for producing more clustering-friendly ones. Then, we employed the Mini Batch K-Means algorithm to cluster deep features. Finally, the comparative feature sets were manually designed in three modes to prove the efficiency of the proposed method in extracting compelling features. Experiments on three datasets show the efficiency of BCAE for feature learning. According to the experimental results, by applying the proposed method, the ultimate features become more suitable for clustering, and spatial correlation among the pixels in the feature learning process is also considered.},

ABSTRACT = {The importance of mixed forests is increasingly recognized on a scientific level, due to their greater productivity and efficiency in resource use, compared to pure stands. However, a reliable quantification of the actual spatial extent of mixed stands on a fine spatial scale is still lacking. Indeed, classification and mapping of mixed populations, especially with semi-automatic procedures, has been a challenging issue up to date. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Very-High-Resolution imagery (VHR) to detect and map mixed forests of broadleaves and coniferous trees with a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 500 m2. This study evaluates segmentation-based classification paired with non-parametric method K- nearest-neighbors (K-NN), trained with a dataset independent from the validation one. The forest area mapped as mixed forest canopies in the study area amounts to 11%, with an overall accuracy being equal to 85% and K of 0.78. Better levels of user and producer accuracies (85–93%) are reached in conifer and broadleaved dominated stands. The study findings demonstrate that the very high resolution images (0.20 m of spatial resolutions) can be reliably used to detect the fine-grained pattern of rare mixed forests, thus supporting the monitoring and management of forest resources also on fine spatial scales.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate temporal land use mapping provides important and timely information for decision making for large-scale management of land and crop production. At present, temporal land cover and crop classifications within a study area have neglected the differences between subregions. In this paper, we propose a classification rule by integrating the terrain, time series characteristics, priority, and seasonality (TTPSR) with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Based on the time series of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Vegetation Index (NDVI), a dynamic decision tree for forests, cultivation, urban, and water was created in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for each subregion to extract cultivated land. Then, with or without this cultivated land mask data, the original classification results for each subregion were completed based on composite image acquisition with five vegetation indices using Random Forest. During the post-reclassification process, a 4-bit coding rule based on terrain, type, seasonal rhythm, and priority was generated by analyzing the characteristics of the original results. Finally, statistical results and temporal mapping were processed. The results showed that feature importance was dominated by B2, NDWI, RENDVI, B11, and B12 over winter, and B11, B12, NDBI, B2, and B8A over summer. Meanwhile, the cultivated land mask improved the overall accuracy for multicategories (seven to eight and nine to 13 during winter and summer, respectively) in each subregion, with average ranges in the overall accuracy for winter and summer of 0.857–0.935 and 0.873–0.963, respectively, and kappa coefficients of 0.803–0.902 and 0.835–0.950, respectively. The analysis of the above results and the comparison with resampling plots identified various sources of error for classification accuracy, including spectral differences, degree of field fragmentation, and planting complexity. The results demonstrated the capability of the TTPSR rule in temporal land use mapping, especially with regard to complex crops classification and automated post-processing, thereby providing a viable option for large-scale land use mapping.},
