abstract = {In this research paper, a novel hybrid technique named KSVGRNN, which combines a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN), has been developed for obtaining the composition of boiler flue gas mixtures. This hybridization was made by the support of K-means clustering algorithm and grid search technique. In the first phase, K-Means clustering technique has been utilized and the size of the training vectors has been reduced by employing a multiclass SVM. In the second, a GRNN has been trained for estimating the individual gas concentration in the flue gas mixture. The reduction of training vectors through SVM has been shown to improve the generalization capability of GRNN. Grid search has been utilized to obtain the optimal parameters of SVM. This hybrid technique has been validated by measuring its performance by processing volatile organic component (VOC) data acquired from quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and SnO2 semiconductor type sensors utilized by other researchers in this domain. Further studies have been carried out to assess the discriminating and estimation capability of the proposed hybrid technique for real-time flue gas data obtained from two different analyzers namely ORSAT® and KANE®. The outcome of these studies, observations and analysis clearly indicate the exceptional performance of the proposed hybrid model in classifying and estimating the flue gas components in the machine (Analyzer) independent manner.}

abstract = {Harvesting wind energy is promising for extending long-endurance flights, which can be greatly facilitated by a flight technique called dynamic soaring. The presented study is concerned with generating model-based trajectories with smooth control histories for dynamic soaring maneuvers exploiting wind gradients. The desired smoothness is achieved by introducing a trigonometric series parameterization for the controls, which are formulated with respect to the normalized time. Specifically, the periodicity of the trigonometric functions is leveraged to facilitate the connection of cycles and streamline the problem formulation. Without relying on a specified wind profile, a free-final-time quadratic programming-based control strategy is developed for the online correction of the flight trajectory, which requires only the instant wind information. Offline and online numerical studies show the trade-off to achieve the smoothness and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a varying wind field.}

abstract = {The paper presents a direct visual-inertial odometry system. In particular, a tightly coupled nonlinear optimization based method is proposed by integrating the recent development in direct dense visual tracking of camera and the inertial measurement unit (IMU) pre-integration. Then a factor graph optimization is adopted to estimate the pose and position of the camera, and a semi-dense map is created simultaneously. Two sliding windows are maintained in the proposed approach. The first one, based on direct sparse odometry (DSO), is to estimate the depths of candidate points for mapping and dense visual tracking. In the second one, measurements of both the IMU pre-integration and direct dense visual tracking are fused probabilistically based on a tightly-coupled, optimization-based sensor fusion framework. As a result, the scale drift of visual odometry is compensated by the constraints from the IMU pre-integration. Evaluations on real-world benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves competitive results in indoor scenes.}

Studies of various economic deposits are discussed, as well as techniques used for data correction, integration with other datasets, and validation of spectral mapping results using geochemical techniques. Machine learning algorithms suggested for automation of the mining workflow are reviewed, as well as systems for environmental monitoring such as gas leak detection. Three new case studies that use a ground-based hyperspectral scanning system with sensors collecting data in the Visible Near-Infrared and Short-Wave Infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum in active and abandoned mines are presented. Vertical exposures in a Carlin Style sediment-hosted gold deposit, an active Cu-Au-Mo mine, and an active asphalt quarry are studied to produce images that delineate the extent of alteration minerals at centimeter scale to demonstrate an efficient method of outcrop characterization, which increases understanding of petrogenesis for mining applications. In the Carlin-style gold deposit, clay, iron oxide, carbonate, and jarosite minerals were mapped. In the copper porphyry deposit, different phases of alteration are delineated, some of which correspond to greater occurrence of ore deposits. A limestone quarry was also imaged, which contains bitumen deposits used for road paving aggregate. Review of current literature suggests use of this technology for automation of mining activities, thus reducing physical risk for workers in evaluating vertical mine faces.}

The instantaneous frequency (IF) and instantaneous amplitude (IA) of the first IMF show irregularities at the damage position. We demonstrate through computer simulation that VMD is superior for detecting damage when compared to the well-known Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method. A new damage sensitive feature (DSF) is also introduced that considers synchronisation of peaks between the IA and IF signals. The results show that the new DSF can enhance the peak at the damage positions while suppressing peaks at other locations.}

Each GNSSs’ rover unit was mounted on a field robot that travelled by manual remote control along a pre-defined test track in six repeated trials. The precision of the two systems was evaluated through F-test statistics. The combined accuracy of the two GNSSs was determined by comparing the positioning data to a fixed known distance between the GNSS antennas on the robot (472 mm). In three out of six trials, both GNSSs remained in fixed solution status, and showed a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of less than 50 mm, which was within the expected range. In two other trials, one of the GNSSs started in float solution status, and subsequently transitioned to fixed solution status. In these trials, the RMSE was still well within one meter, which was expected in float solution status. In one trial, a false fixed position status was encountered, where the NavSpark GNSS falsely claimed it was in fixed solution status. This issue needs to be alleviated in the future by improvements in signal conditioning, noise, and software, and/or by sensor fusion. Although the Emlid GNSS had superior localization performance, as its percentage of data in fixed solution status was 94.0% compared to 71.5% for the NavSpark GNSS, both were deemed promising for use on experimental field robots.}

Here, six (I-VI) hail damage simulation treatments with four damage levels (0%, 30%, 60%, and 90%) each time (for modeling) and natural hailstorm tracking experiment (for model verification) were conducted between 2018 and 2019 to explore the feasibility of yield prediction at field scale in different damage stages according to the reflectance of spectral characteristic bands (RSCB). The performance of models was analyzed with three regression methods (partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression, and backpropagation neural network) based on RSCB and vegetation indices. The model developed at different damage stages showed higher accuracy in predicting yield reduction than a general model developed over the whole vegetation period. The yield prediction model based on RSCB showed better performance compared to that based on the vegetation indices, and overall, PLSR performed the best. A general model was developed for pre-bloom hail damage, whereas three models were developed for damage stage IV (accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) ranging between 975.9 °C·d and 1291.6 °C·d), V (AGDD ranging between 1291.6 °C·d and 1550.0 °C·d) and VI (AGDD greater than 1550.0 °C·d), respectively for post-bloom hail damage. Employing RSCB at different damage stages is a viable approach to predicting cotton yield reduction ascribed to hail damage.}

We propose an alternative method based on the low cost additional transform of textual watermark using barcoding that allows us to restore the distorted watermark with a high probability achieving its full restoration under some typical Internet attacks.

The safety of both the passengers and pedestrians has been a major concern in ITS. Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a promising technology that can provide a wide range of services, such as safety, convenience, and infotainment for both the passengers and drivers. However, due to the dynamic nature of the vehicular environment, VANET has to deal with several challenges such as intermittent connectivity, provisioning of quality of service (QoS), and heterogeneity of applications. Moreover, the deployment of new services/protocols on a large-scale is a daunting task due to the inflexible architecture of VANET. The distinctive features of software-defined vehicular network (SDVN) such as programmability and flexibility leverages the vehicular network to satisfy the performance and management requirements of VANET. In this paper, we first present the taxonomy of SDVN architecture based on its modes of operation. Then we survey the state-of-the-art SDVN routing protocols and classify them based on different criteria. Finally, we highlight the challenges of current SDVNs.}

The current work investigates the extent of vertical morphological components impact on the UHI intensity and proposes a novel vertical urban morphological parameter defined as the elevation factor. Using remote-sensing satellite images and a GIS based approach, both horizontal and vertical morphological components of San-Francisco, as the case study city, was investigated for 20 representative built up areas. High-resolution geometrical data of these areas were then correlated with their land surface temperatures (LST). Linear regression analysis and ANOVA test revealed that the model with the newly proposed elevation factor has a significant impact on representing of the UHI behaviour with a coefficient of determination factor (R²) of 0.68. The model was then successfully validated with the UHI prediction of 24 randomly selected points from each of the five new areas. Furthermore, the impact of elevation morphology on the UHI intensity was investigated as the elevation factor was seen to provide a stronger correlation between urban morphology and UHI spatial distribution.}

Unfortunately, ADS-B is prone to cyber-attacks. To verify the ADS-B positioning data of aircraft, multilateration (MLAT) techniques that use Time Differences of Arrivals (TDoAs) have been proposed. MLAT exhibits low accuracy in determining aircraft positions. Recently, a novel technique using a theoretically calculated TDoA fingerprint map has been proposed. This technique is less dependent on the geometry of sensor deployment and achieves better accuracy than MLAT. However, the accuracy of the existing technique is not sufficiently precise for determining aircraft positions and requires a long computation time. In contrast, this paper presents a reliable surveillance framework using an Actual TDoA-Based Augmentation System (ATBAS). It uses historically recorded real-data from the OpenSky network to train our TDoA fingerprint grid network. Our results show that the accuracy of the proposed ATBAS framework in determining the aircraft positions is significantly better than those of the MLAT and expected TDoA techniques by 56.93% and 48.86%, respectively. Additionally, the proposed framework reduced the computation time by 77% compared with the expected TDoA technique.}

As such, it is vital to be able to accurately predict their distributions, particularly in areas where species composition is unknown. Species distribution modeling was used to determine the relationship between environmental, anthropogenic and distance factors on the occurrence of two mosquito genera, Culex Linnaeus and Stegomyia Theobald (syn. Aedes), in the Taita Hills, southeastern Kenya. This study aims to test whether any of the statistical prediction models produced by the Biomod2 package in R can reliably estimate the distributions of mosquitoes in these genera in the Taita Hills; and to examine which factors best explain their presence. Mosquito collections were acquired from 122 locations between January–March 2016 along transects throughout the Taita Hills. Environmental-, anthropogenic- and distance-based geospatial data were acquired from the Taita Hills geo-database, satellite- and aerial imagery and processed in GIS software. The Biomod2 package in R, intended for ensemble forecasting of species distributions, was used to generate predictive models. Slope, human population density, normalized difference vegetation index, distance to roads and elevation best estimated Culex distributions by a generalized additive model with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.791. Mean radiation, human population density, normalized difference vegetation index, distance to roads and mean temperature resulted in the highest AUC (0.708) value in a random forest model for Stegomyia distributions. We conclude that in the process towards more detailed species-level maps, with our study results, general assumptions can be made about the distribution areas of Culex and Stegomyia mosquitoes in the Taita Hills and the factors which influence their distribution.}

abstract = {A considerable percentage of Internet of Things end-devices are characterised by mobility, a feature that adds extra complexity to protocols used in Wireless Sensor Networks. LoRa is one of the newly introduced wireless sensor protocols, capable of delivering messages in long distances and consuming low energy, features that make it proper for low cost devices. Although LoRa was introduced as a technology for stationary devices, it can also be used for mobile devices of low speed. In this paper, we introduce an enhancement to Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism to enable mobile LoRa, by improving the connection reliability of mobile end-devices, while keeping energy consumption at low levels. Firstly, we propose the Linear Regression-ADR (LR-ADR) mechanism for the Network Server side to smooth the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) estimates per gateway and predict the SNR of the next transmission. Secondly, we propose the Linear Regression + ADR (LR+ADR) mechanism, an adaptive method for the end-device side to regain the connectivity faster with the Network Server. We conducted simulation modelling to evaluate the performance of our implementation while we compared our results with four alternative solutions ADR, ADR+, EMA-ADR, G-ADR. The results prove that our first approach (LR-ADR) performs better than the best competitor, and our second approach (LR+ADR) brings an additional improvement in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), while they retain the Energy Consumption per Packet Delivered (ECPD) at low levels. In particular, in a scenario that mimics real world conditions, LR+ADR presents an increase of up to 520% for PDR compared to the original ADR and an improvement of up to 38% compared to the best competitor (G-ADR). Moreover, it reduces ECPD up to 74% compared to the original ADR, while keeping it at the same level with the best competitor (G-ADR).}

Therefore, better understating of factors controlling gully erosion and prediction of gully headcuts' (GHs) location is still highly relevant. This study aimed to examine the spatial distribution of GHs and to assess the importance of pedological (i.e. aggregate stability, organic matter, bulk density, silt, clay, and sand content) and topographical factors (i.e. altitude, slope length, gradient, and aspect) using summary statistics and the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model. The study was conducted in the loess-covered region of NE Iran. The highly precise data of 287 GHs locations were obtained by extensive fieldwork and the interpretation of UAV images. The spatial distribution of GHs was evaluated by univariate pair correlation function and O-ring statistics. The spatial effect of GHs density controlling factors was assessed by the cumulative density correlation function Cm,K(r). Variable importance was analyzed using the MaxEnt model, which was also for the susceptibility modelling of GHs. The results of univariate tests showed the aggregated distribution of GHs. The Cm,K(r) analyses indicated that the areas characterized by higher values of bulk density, aggregate stability, and organic matter content have lower GHs density, whereas the areas with high silt content and higher slope gradient have higher GHs density. According to the MaxEnt, there is no one single factor responsible for GHs location, but rather the combination of topographical and pedological factors with the predominance of slope gradient (0.86) and silt content (0.57). The MaxEnt modelling of GHs susceptibility has revealed that the best accuracy (0.958) is given when all pedological and topographical factors are used in the model. The susceptibility maps prepared in the study can be used for soil conversation and land use planning and, consequently, for sustainable development in the region.}

A framework that integrates computer vision and traffic modeling is proposed to link the real-world transport systems and operable virtual traffic models for the signal timing optimization at multiple intersections. The integrative framework consists of six main steps, including configuring real-time video sources, conducting transfer-learning to develop the vehicle detector, comparing and selecting vehicle trackers, collecting traffic parameters by referring to the CV-TM ontology, establishing and running the traffic model, and operating simulation-based optimizations. The proposed integrative framework is demonstrated through a case study of the signal timing optimization at multi-intersections in a real-world road network. Three critical information items including the traffic volumes, vehicle compositions, and vehicles’ turning ratios are derived from real-time surveillance videos, and the extracted information is then automatically incorporated into TM to optimize the signal timings of interconnected intersections in a near-real-time manner. In comparison with the original signal scheme, the optimized one can reduce 14.2 % of average vehicle delays, 18.9 % of vehicle stops, 9.1 % of average travel time, and 2.3 % of pollutant emissions in this specific case. The results indicate that synchronously optimizing signal timings at multiple intersections increase not only the transportation efficiency but also the environmental friendliness of road transport systems. The proposed CV-TM integration framework is demonstrated to be a promising way for conducting near-real-time signal timing optimizations in intricate traffic scenes instead of at isolated intersections, helping decision-makers to promptly respond to the time-varying traffic conditions during various real-world events, and facilitating the transportation systems and cities to achieve sustainable development goals.}

However, they are susceptible to damage arising from complex and irregular loading or even cause catastrophic collapse, and they are expensive to maintain. Defects or damages on wind turbine blades (WTBs) not only reduce the lifespan and power generation efficiency of the wind turbine, but also increase monitoring errors, safety risks and maintenance costs. Therefore, damage detection for WTBs is of great importance for failure avoidance, maintenance planning, and operation sustainability of wind turbines. This paper provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art damage detection techniques for WTBs, including most of those updated methods based on strain measurement, acoustic emission, ultrasound, vibration, thermography and machine vision. Firstly, typical damages of WTBs are comprehensively introduced. Secondly, detection principles, development methods, pros and cons of the aforementioned techniques for blade inspection, and their fault indicators are reviewed. Finally, potential research directions of WTB damage detection techniques are addressed via a comparative analysis, and conclusions are drawn. It is expected that this review will provide guidelines for practical WTB inspections, as well as research prospects for damage detection techniques.}

abstract = {Modelling rockfall phenomena is complex and requires various inputs, including an accurate location of the source areas. Source areas are controlled by geomorphological, geological, or other geo-environmental factors and may largely influence the results of the modelling. In the Canary Islands, rockfalls are extremely common and pose a major threat to society, costing lives, disrupting infrastructure, and destroying livelihoods. In 2011, the volcanic event on the island of El Hierro triggered numerous rockfalls that affected strategic infrastructures, with a substantial impact on the local population. During the emergency, the efforts performed to map the source areas and to model the rockfalls in the considerably steep landscape characterising the island were not trivial. To better identify the rockfall source areas, we propose a probabilistic modelling framework that applies a combination of multiple statistical models using the source area locations mapped in the field as the dependent variable and a set of thematic data as independent variables. The models use as input morphometric parameters derived from the Digital Elevation Model and lithological data as an expression of the mechanical behaviour of the rocks. The analysis of different training and validation scenarios allowed us to test the model sensitivity to the input data, select the optimal model training configuration, and evaluate the model applicability outside the training areas. The final map obtained from the model for the entire island of El Hierro provides the probability of a given location being a potential source area and can be used as the input for rockfall runout simulation modelling.}

Recent research demonstrated that, during motion planning and due to uncertainties, manipulators may accidentally assume low performance or singular configurations. Thus, reliable motion planning algorithms are required. Very few algorithms were proposed to avoid such problem in parallel manipulators. This paper presents a reliable motion planning technique. First, failure modes are defined. Then, a Monte Carlo simulation is used to provide information on how the manipulator’s uncertainties affect its conditioning. Based on this simulation, probabilities of failure are computed for several manipulator workspace configurations. After that, an artificial neural network metamodel is trained to overcome Monte Carlo’s computational inefficiency on the failure probability estimation. This metamodel is assessed by an iterative strategy that exploits genetic operators to compute optimal trajectories avoiding regions that are considerably affected by uncertainties. Due to its modular methodology, the technique can be easily adapted for different applications. A 3RRR manipulator is used as a case study.}

To address this challenge, we propose a real-time infrared maritime target tracker based on adaptive context-aware and spatially-regularized discriminative correlation filters (ACSDCF). The adaptive context-aware strategy is utilized to incorporate more negative samples explicitly and suppress background interference. We design an automatic spatial regularization mechanism to alleviate the inherent drawbacks of correlation filter-based trackers by utilizing response map information. Moreover, an adaptive updating strategy based on response map variation is introduced to cast a tradeoff between tracking speed and accuracy. Extensive experimental results in different infrared maritime target sequences demonstrate that the comprehensive properties of the proposed ACSDCF, with a tracking speed of 40 + frames per second, are superior to state-of-the-art trackers.}

Although remote sensing of SIF – especially from space – is seen as a contemporary new specialty for terrestrial plants, it is founded upon a multi-decadal history of research, applications, and sensor developments in active and passive sensing of chlorophyll fluorescence. Current technical capabilities allow SIF to be measured across a range of biological, spatial, and temporal scales. As an optical signal, SIF may be assessed remotely using high-resolution spectral sensors in tandem with state-of-the-art algorithms to distinguish the emission from reflected and/or scattered ambient light. Because the red to far-red SIF emission is detectable non-invasively, it may be sampled repeatedly to acquire spatio-temporally explicit information about photosynthetic light responses and steady-state behaviour in vegetation. Progress in this field is accelerating with innovative sensor developments, retrieval methods, and modelling advances. This review distills the historical and current developments spanning the last several decades. It highlights SIF heritage and complementarity within the broader field of fluorescence science, the maturation of physiological and radiative transfer modelling, SIF signal retrieval strategies, techniques for field and airborne sensing, advances in satellite-based systems, and applications of these capabilities in evaluation of photosynthesis and stress effects. Progress, challenges, and future directions are considered for this unique avenue of remote sensing.}

In several capture sessions during summer jump season, motions of four junior ski jumpers were captured by inertial sensors over the complete jump, from the start of the in-run to the end of the outrun phase. Additionally, style points were collected from an experienced judge to serve as ground truth and control data for the machine learning algorithms. All jumps were randomly separated into a training and a test database. Next, we determined kinematic factors such as body segment orientation and body joint position and segmented every jump into its main motion phases on the base of the raw sensor data. Specific motion characteristics that influence the performance and length of a jump were then used to create machine style knowledge from the training database in compliance to the official scoring guidelines. In a last step, we computed the similarity of every jump within the test database to the trained knowledge on a ski jump's style parameters and evaluated the presence or absence of jump errors. Results showed that the computed error annotations conform largely to the human-based judging scores. Adding automatic score measures to the algorithm in future, this method might be an important step towards better measurability and objectivity of performance-oriented sports in form of a mobile competition evaluation system.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of composite adaptive learning and tracking control for discrete-time nonlinear uncertain systems in general normal form. To deal with the system’s unstructured nonlinear uncertain dynamics, novel adaptive neural network (NN) learning control strategies are proposed by extending methodologies from the continuous-time deterministic learning theory. Both state-feedback and output-feedback cases are considered. The proposed control schemes are compelling in the sense that (i) they are capable of rendering not only stable tracking control, but also locally-accurate learning/identification of unknown system dynamics during stable closed-loop control; (ii) the learned knowledge can be effectively represented and stored as constant NN models, whose weights are guaranteed to partially converge to ideal/optimal values. Based on this, experience-based controllers are also developed to pursue improved tracking control performance without online adaptation. In particular for the output-feedback control case, a new observer-less adaptive NN learning control scheme is proposed without resorting to high-gain observers, followed by an observer-less output-feedback experience-based controller. Numerical simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.}

Hyperspectral images of both healthy and diseased citrus were collected in the spectral region of 396−1010 nm. After raw image calibration, spectral reflectance of diseased (early hard spot, advanced hard spot, cracked spot, early virulent, and virulent) and healthy samples were extracted and used as independent variables for classification. Effective wavelengths were selected using regression coefficients based on partial least squares analysis. K-nearest neighbor models were established to classify the symptoms in each group (early hard spot vs. advanced hard spot, early virulent vs. virulent, hard spot vs. cracked spot, hard spot vs. virulent, cracked spot vs. virulent, diseased vs. healthy, and early stage vs. advanced stage). In diseased vs. healthy group, the models yielded the correct classification accuracies of 99.4 % (using full wavelengths) and 100.0 % (using selected wavelengths) for diseased samples. The correct classification accuracies were 92.5 % (using full wavelengths) and 93.8 % (using selected wavelengths) for early stage samples (early disease). Besides, the selected wavelengths were 549, 668, 706, and 790 nm for diseased vs. healthy group, and 675, 711, and 835 nm for early stage vs. advanced stage group.

abstract = {The use of robots in our daily lives is increasing. As we rely more on robots, thus it becomes more important for us that the robots will continue on with their mission successfully. Unfortunately, these sophisticated, and sometimes very expensive, machines are susceptible to different kinds of faults. It becomes important to apply a Fault Detection (FD) mechanism which is suitable for the domain of robots. Two important requirements of such a mechanism are: high accuracy and low computational-load during operation (online). Supervised learning can potentially produce very accurate FD models, and if the learning takes place offline then the online computational-load can be reduced. Yet, the domain of robots is characterized with the absence of labeled data (e.g., “faulty”, “normal”) required by supervised approaches, and consequently, unsupervised approaches are being used. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach - an unsupervised approach can label a data set, with a low degree of inaccuracy, and then the labeled data set is used offline by a supervised approach to produce an online FD model. Now, we are faced with a choice – should we use the unsupervised or the hybrid fault detector? Seemingly, there is no way to validate the choice due to the absence of (a priori) labeled data. In this paper we give an insight to why, and a tool to predict when, the hybrid approach is more accurate. In particular, the main impacts of our work are (1) we theoretically analyze the conditions under which the hybrid approach is expected to be more accurate. (2) Our theoretical findings are backed with empirical analysis. We use data sets of three different robotic domains: a high fidelity flight simulator, a laboratory robot, and a commercial Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV). (3) We analyze how different unsupervised FD approaches are improved by the hybrid technique and (4) how well this improvement fits our prediction tool. The significance of the hybrid approach and the prediction tool is the potential benefit to expert and intelligent systems in which labeled data is absent or expensive to create.}

Three cameras are used to capture various images that expose different dimensions of the mechanical part. Back lighting is used to illuminate the part placed on the V-shaped translucent surface, which results in images with improved contrast thereby improving the measurement accuracy compared to front lighting. The software algorithm performs camera calibration to eliminate the lens distortion and pre-processing for image enhancement and noise elimination. Next, image binarization is performed to highlight the edges of the object. The desired dimensions are extracted from the image followed by pixel to physical measurement mapping. The system is tested by measuring physical dimensions of a drill bit and a screwdriver bit and it achieves an accuracy of tenth of a millimeter (mm). Several dimensions of the test parts are measured, such as, total length, back radius, groove length etc., which are the most number of dimensions considered, compared to previous studies. The results demonstrate that the maximum difference between the measured and the actual dimensions is ± 0.05 mm. A conceptual model of IoT-enabled CViM system for parts inspection in small and medium-sized industries is also presented. The system has a fairly low cost and is very suitable for such industries with similar accuracy requirements for their parts inspection.}

abstract = {Precision nitrogen (N) management requires rapid and real-time technologies for in-season crop N status diagnosis. The leaf fluorescence sensor Dualex 4 is an effective and promising tool to monitor crop N status. N nutrition index (NNI) is the most widely recognized diagnostic tool for accurate in-season diagnosis of crop N status. However, studies focusing on revealing the relationships between fluorescence sensing indices and NNI and assessing the N status of maize is limited. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the potential of using Dualex 4 indices measured on three differently positioned leaves to estimate NNI across different stages; and (2) determine if the incorporation of environmental (weather) and management information can significantly improve the in-season N status prediction and diagnosis of maize. In 2016 and 2017, a total of four experiments with six N rates and three plant densities were conducted in two fields in Northeast China. Dualex sensor readings – Chlorophyll (Chl) and N balance index (NBI) – were collected from three differently positioned leaves at three growth stages. Some external factors including weather and management conditions were included for in-season N status assessment. The results indicated that the two Dualex indices (Chl and NBI) had strong relationships with NNI at different growth stages, and both stage-specific and across-stage models could estimate NNI based on their values acquired from differently positioned leaves. Nevertheless, the N diagnostic accuracies based on the estimated NNI by the Dualex indices were not satisfactory with Kappa values all lower than 0.40. Likewise, similar results were found in the multiple linear regression (MLR) models only based on the Dualex readings (MLRChl, MLRNBI and MLRChl+NBI). However, when weather and management variables were used together with Dualex sensor measurements in MLR analysis, the prediction of NNI (R2 = 0.81 to 0.85) and the accuracy of maize N status diagnosis (areal agreement = 0.79 and Kappa = 0.52 to 0.55) were significantly improved. More studies are needed to develop strategies combining more environmental and management variables with sensor data to further improve in-season N status diagnosis and N management and/or combine proximal with remote sensing for large-scale crop N nutritional status diagnosis and in-season site-specific N management.}

abstract = {River floods frequently occur when tropical cyclones hit land. Nonetheless, systematic, long-term discharge data remain rather scarce in many tropical countries, which prevent proper analysis of peak discharges occurring during floods. The Térraba catchment is the biggest and most dynamic catchment in Costa Rica. In this study, we developed regional flood-frequency analyses combining tree-ring based estimation and measurement of peak discharge at monitoring stations during tropical cyclones to derive flood quartiles. Flood quartiles were combined with the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) to determine regional flood hazards along floodplains. The flood risk assessment was based on a high-resolution mapping of infrastructure, population density (as a measure of exposure), and a social development index (to represent vulnerability). We show that peak discharge of cyclone-induced floods can be assessed accurately with flood-frequency analyses including dendrogeomorphic reconstructions and systematic discharge measurements. We also show that regional flood risk assessments can be performed in large-scale catchments if both coarse and detailed inputs are used. The results of this study will be useful for the development of flood risk schemes promoting resilience of local populations.}

abstract = {Detecting green-attacked trees on satellite imagery with high accuracy provides very important broad-scale tools required to control the spreads of infestations to healthy trees. The scale or resolution plays a critical role in such equations but very often lacks adequate attentions in remote sensing investigations of environmental issues, including mapping green-attacked trees. We reviewed and synthesized current understanding about mapping green-attacked trees, vegetation remote sensing, and spatial statistics to characterize the uncertainty associated with major factors influencing the accuracy of detecting green-attacked trees. These factors include the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of satellite imagery, and a type of model used. Satellite imagery with spatial resolutions less than 4 m (approximately 2/3 size of the crown diameter of a host tree on average) on bidaily to weekly acquisitions are required to improve the accuracy of mapping infested trees on a continuous basis. Changes in, forest structure, needle age, leaf intercellular structure of air-to-cell wall interfaces, forest floor moisture content, and tree physiology, over the growing seasons affect the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) more prominently than visible and red-edge spectral reflectance in healthy coniferous forests. These variabilities in forest parameters lead to more uncertainties in models using NIR and SWIR spectral reflectance, or their dependent spectral vegetation indices (SVIs), to map green-attacked trees. The high correlation between far-red or red-edge (red-to-NIR transition) reflectance, in particular shifts in the red-edge inflection point, with changes in the leaf chlorophyll contents makes red-edge spectra or red-edge dependent indices strong candidates to map green-attacked trees. The red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI; red-edge NDVI or NDVI705) that incorporates red and red-edge values, found to be useful to estimate chlorophyll a and b concentrations as well as minimizing the effects of background soil reflectance. Future investigations are required to improve red-edge NDVI or explore other SVIs, by using preferably visible to red-edge spectral reflectance, to increase the accuracy of mapping green-attacked trees. When the attack occurs in, or spreads from a tree to, the stand level, causes spatial autocorrelation in the spectral properties of infested trees. Ignoring the spatial autocorrelation, as it usually is, inflates type I error in the parametric models. A non-parametric model, with no need to fulfill the assumptions of data independency, is recommended to map green-attacked trees as the spatial property of underlying process of the infested trees is usually non-stationary.}

CPS and IoT are undergoing an explosive growth to a large degree related to advanced mobile systems like smart automotive and avionic systems, mobile robots and wearable devices. The huge and rapidly developing markets of sophisticated mobile cyber-physical systems represent great opportunities, but these opportunities come with a price of unusual system complexity, as well as, stringent and difficult to satisfy requirements of many modern applications. Specifically, smart cars and various wearable systems to a growing degree involve big instant data from multiple complex sensors or other systems, and are required to provide continuous autonomous service in a long time. In consequence, they demand a guaranteed (ultra-)high performance and/or (ultra-)low energy consumption, while requiring a high reliability, safety and security. To adequately address these demands, sophisticated embedded computing and embedded design technologies are needed. After an introduction to modern mobile systems, this paper discusses the huge heterogeneous area of these systems, and considers serious issues and challenges in their design. Subsequently, it discusses the embedded computing and design technologies needed to adequately address the issues and overcome the challenges in order to satisfy the stringent requirements of the modern mobile systems.}

The actuation is considered via periodic morphing surface, and the dynamical behaviors between morphing surface and unsteady flow are studied from the viewpoint of fluid transport. Attention is drawn to fluid transport and lift improvement when the actuation frequency is locked onto the vortex shedding frequency. The results show that the fluid particle near the actuator is accelerated by the actuation and interacts with the slow fluid particle in boundary layer on the airfoil surface. The so-called stirring jet mechanism is observed, whereby a cusp structure is formed like a jet acting on the flow, which enhances the fluid transport from main stream into separation zone by reducing dead air zone effectively. The results also show that the actuation frequency is found to be the key factor for lift enhancement and determines the cusp structures and the vortex strength on the upper surface of the airfoil.}

The proposed heuristic optimization method can auto-tune a PID controller without a precise plant model.

The degrees of flexibility range from adjustable power only to full control over frequency assignment, routing, beam pointing and beam shape. Furthermore, the current satcom landscape is expected to be governed by highly variable demand, making old and new satellite operators face a new challenge in how to manage demand and capacity. Previous literature has pointed out the similarities of the current satcom market with highly established industries, like Airline or Car Rental, remarking its huge potential for a new Revenue Management strategy. We present two different strategies that can leverage a satcom-adapted Revenue Management framework to lift the revenues of satcom operators by more than 20%. Both strategies are based on monetizing the available capacity through existing customers: either selling more capacity or selling additional products. We outline the complete process: we first detail the general and specific assumptions of each monetizing approach and the pricing optimization strategy employed. We then set up a simulation that contains actual demand data and quantify the benefit of dynamic power allocation in terms of available capacity, compared to fixed-by-design allocation. Finally, we present the results of applying the two mentioned strategies and provide a comparison between them.}

abstract = {Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an emerging climate change mitigation technology which prevents carbon dioxide (CO2) from entering the atmosphere, so as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental monitoring in CCS sites is critical for ensuring that any CO2 leakage and its effect on biota, especially vegetation, is detectable. It also plays an important role in creating a social license to operate and assuring the general public that the mechanisms for leak detection and remediation are in place. This review overviews current remote sensing technologies for vegetation monitoring of CCS sites/regions (with a focus on rangelands and pastures), including medium-to-high resolution satellite, aerial (both manned and unmanned aircrafts) and in situ sensors and methods. Our literature survey has pointed out that remote sensing, particularly hyperspectral sensors, can accurately detect CO2 leakage derived effects on vegetation. It can compensate the two main drawbacks of operational systems for detecting these effects over large areas. One is the areas affected tend to be relatively small (1–15 m); and the other is symptoms in vegetation tissues tend to be similar to other stresses, such as nutrient or water deficiency. With this in mind, we have recommend that a comprehensive system should be put in place. It integrates continuous monitoring with ad-hoc detection to assess vegetation conditions in a planned CCS site. Site-based pheonocams and area-based medium-resolution satellite remote sensing sources can be used to compare any given point in time (e.g. the injection point) with the condition at the same location in the past. Before an injection commences, a baseline assessment should be conducted using the combination of high-resolution aerial hyperspectral imaging and medium-resolution long-term data from Landsat sensors. Further acquisition of high-resolution aerial imagery (ideally hyperspectral) is particularly useful following specific detected CO2 leaking events. Aiming at bridging the gaps between research, development and implementation of CCS, this review will contribute to environmental and social impacts of sustainable energy policies, including climate change mitigation and environmental pollution reduction.}

Manual segmentation and recognition of fruit symptoms is a hard job because of many aspects such like time-consuming and waste of money. Lately, several scholars came up with image processing and pattern recognition based methods for segmentation and recognition of fruit symptoms based on their features such as color, texture, and shape. In this article, we proposed an automated system for segmentation and recognition of grape leaf diseases. The proposed system comprises of four main steps. In first step, a local contrast haze reduction (LCHR) enhancement technique is proposed for increasing the local contrast of symptoms. Thereafter, LAB color transformation is held in the second step and the best channel is selected based on the pixels information that is later utilized into thresholding function. Color, texture, and geometric features are extracted and fused by canonical correlation analysis (CCA) approach. At the time of features fusion, a noise is added in the form of irrelevant and redundant features that are removed by Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA). The classification of final reduced features is then performed by M-class SVM. The introduced system is assessed on Plant Village dataset of three types of grape leaf diseases such as black measles, black rot, and leaf blight including healthy. The proposed method acquired an average segmentation accuracy rate of 90% and classification accuracy is above 92% which is superior in contrast of existing techniques.}

The use of high-resolution multispectral satellite images for such purpose is very promising, since satellite images can systematically monitor much larger areas in comparison to the traditional in situ observations. This paper contains a literature review of the published research regarding the optical remote detection of floating marine debris and the proposed associated methodologies. The main aim of this review is to compile all available information on detection methodologies, providing at the same time valuable insights into the different approaches used for floating marine litter monitoring. First, a brief introduction into the theoretical basis of a spaceborne floating marine litter detection system is given. Next, published articles, or relevant research work have been compartmentalised, for analysing the proposed procedures and assisting in a further assessment of their methodological frameworks. Lastly, conclusions and bottlenecks of the existing knowledge on marine litter detection from space are derived. Although the remote detection of floating marine litter is currently limited by inherent restrictions of the available satellite sensors specifications, we highlight how the methodological processing chain can significantly affect the future accuracy of plastic detection from space.}

The paper investigates the evolution characteristics of these landslides and presents a novel forecasting model for their displacements. The distribution characteristics and behavior of landslides developed along Xiangxi River is revealed by the database of landslides in the larger Zigui basin, of which this area is part. Most landslides occur at rather low elevations of <300 m and in areas of moderate rainfall. The geological evolution of landslides in the Xiangxi River valley can be divided into four stages, beginning with anticline formation, followed by valley incision, then by weathering and erosion, and culminating in formation of the colluvial landslides. The accumulative displacement curves of landslides with a stair-step sliding surface in Xiangxi River region also present obvious, step-like characteristics. A novel GA-CEEMD-RF algorithm was developed to predict the displacement of these stair-step landslides, which helps to define the combination of induced factors and weak stableness of prediction results using a single displacement prediction model and the multi-field monitoring data.}

However, to the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been solved by using tension-based attitude tracking control. In this paper, a novel solution to the tension-based controller design for the quadrotor–load system has been demonstrated. Even more, pendular characteristics of the quadrotor with suspended load have been fully analyzed for the first time. Based on the results of the above-mentioned analysis and applying it to the proposed model, the expected attitude trajectory not only ensures the flight safety, but also reduces the energy consumption of the controller. Compared with existing control methods, this method provides the desired tension by a windlass mechanism which is mounted on the quadrotor. By employing the terminal sliding surfaces in a hierarchical way and performing the Lyapunov stability analysis, it has been shown that the tracking error in finite time converges to zero. Finally, a numerical simulation has been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.}

The first two categories are (1) land cover, and (2) building morphology. These govern the main interactions between the city and the urban climate and the Urban Heat Island. Interdependence between morphological parameters and UCM geometric hypotheses are discussed. Building height, plan and wall area densities are recommended as the main input variables for UCMs, whereas ORMs require 3D building data. Recently, three other categories of urban data became relevant for finer urban studies and adaptation to climate change: (3) building design and architecture, (4) building use, anthropogenic heat and socio-economic data, and (5) urban vegetation data. Several methods for acquiring spatial information are reviewed, including remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS) processing from administrative cadasters, expert knowledge and crowdsourcing. Data availability, data harmonization, costs/efficiency trade-offs and future challenges are then discussed.}

abstract = {The amount of remote sensing and ancillary datasets captured by diverse airborne and spaceborne sensors has been tremendously increased, which opens up the possibility of utilizing multimodal datasets to improve the performance of processing approaches with respect to the application at hand. However, developing a generic framework with high generalization capability that can effectively fuse diverse datasets is a challenging task since the current approaches are usually only applicable to two specific sensors for data fusion. In this paper, we propose an accurate fusion-based technique called SubFus with capability to integrate diverse remote sensing data for land cover classification. Here, we assume that a high dimensional multisensor dataset can be represented fused features that live in a lower-dimensional space. The proposed classification methodology includes three main stages. First, spatial information is extracted by using spatial filters (i.e., morphology filters). Then, a novel low-rank minimization problem is proposed to represent the multisensor datasets in subspaces using fused features. The fused features in the lower-dimensional subspace are estimated using a novel iterative algorithm based on the alternative direction method of multipliers. Third, the final classification map is produced by applying a supervised spectral classifier (i.e., random forest) on the fused features. In the experiments, the proposed method is applied to a three-sensor (RGB, multispectral LiDAR, and hyperspectral images) dataset captured over the area of the University of Houston, the USA, and a two-sensor (hyperspectral and LiDAR) dataset captured over the city of Trento, Italy. The land-cover maps generated using SubFus are evaluated based on classification accuracies. Experimental results obtained by SubFus confirm considerable improvements in terms of classification accuracies compared with the other methods used in the experiments. The proposed fusion approach obtains 85.32% and 99.25% in terms of overall classification accuracy on the Houston (the training portion of the dataset distributed for the data fusion contest of 2018) and trento datasets, respectively.}

However, the limited land and water resources, climate change, and an increase in extreme events likely to pose a significant threat for achieving the sustainable agriculture goal. Given these challenges, food security is included in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Since the advent of Sputnik, followed by the Explorer missions, satellite remote sensing is assisting us in collecting the data at global scales. In this work, we review how satellite remote sensing information is utilized to assess and manage agriculture, an important component of ecohydrology. Overall, three critical aspects of agriculture are considered: (a) crop growth and yield through empirical models, physics-based models, and data assimilation in crop models, (b) applications pertaining to irrigation, which include mapping irrigation areas and quantification of irrigation, and (c) crop losses due to pests, diseases, crop lodging, and weeds. The emphasis is on satellite sensors in optical, thermal, microwave, and fluorescence frequencies. We conclude the review with an outlook of challenges and recommendations. This paper is the first of a two-part review series. The second part reviews the role of satellite remote sensing in water security, wherein we discuss the aspects of water quality and quantity along with extremes (floods and droughts).}

However, several technological issues amongst others fault detection of MCT blades still require further progress for their successful implementation. Indeed, power generation is likely to progressively degrade due to blade faults and then causes disruptive disturbance when the marine current generator is connected to the grid. Fault detection of MCT blades still presents several challenges due to the complexity of the underwater environment. It appears that attachment like plankton or biofouling may have a considerable influence on the turbine blade as these may be triggering different imbalance faults. This survey reviews different blade fault types under the condition of wave and turbulence. We also review current blade fault detection methods, including multi-domain approaches. It appears from our study that built-in sensor-based fault detection methods, which use phase currents and voltages across the generator windings, provide several advantages for MCT blade fault detection. It also proposes several trends.}

Often, the dynamics of the payload are unknown and cannot be represented with an a priori model before a flight. This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) architecture that controls a multirotor carrying an unknown suspended payload using a plant model from data-driven system identification techniques. Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and Hankel Alternative View Of Koopman with Control (HAVOKc) are the regression techniques used to identify system models without relying on modelling assumptions and by using only time series measurements. The standard Hankel Alternative View Of Koopman (HAVOK) is adapted slightly in this work for use with controlled systems. These two techniques are combined in the MPC architecture and compared against a conventional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) system to control a multirotor with an unknown suspended payload within simulation. The results show that both MPC systems outperform the conventional system and achieve velocity control while simultaneously damping the payload swing angle. The proposed systems also show good adaptability with different payload parameters. Both system identification methods perform well with the presence of measurement noise.}

An improved genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the initial expert empirical fuzzy rules, which avoids the traditional method from falling into the local optimal solution in the process of optimization. Specifically, adaptive crossover and mutation probability are adopted to accelerate the convergence speed of the genetic algorithm. We then apply the proposed algorithm to optimize the membership function and fuzzy control rules of the fuzzy controller.

However, camera-based traffic monitoring does not collect complete data, cover all areas, provide quick medical services, or take vehicle follow-ups in case of an incident. Drone-based system helps to derive important information (such as commuter's behavior, traffic patterns, vehicle follow-ups) and sends this information to centralized or distributed authorities for making traffic diversions or necessary decisions as per laws. The present approaches fail to meet the requirements such as (i) collision free, (ii) drone navigation, and (iii) less computational and communicational overheads. This work has considered the collision-free drone-based movement strategies for road traffic monitoring using Software Defined Networking (SDN). The SDN controllable drone network results in lesser overhead over drones and provide efficient drone-device management. In simulation, two case studies are simulated using JaamSim simulator. Results show that the zones-based strategy covers a large area in few hours and consume 5 kWs to 25 kWs energy for 150 drones (Case study 1). Zone-less based strategies (case study-2) show that the energy consumption lies between 5 kWs to 18 kWs for 150 drones. Further, the use of SDN-based drones controller reduces the overhead over drone-network and increases the area coverage with a minimum of 1.2% and maximum of 2.6%. Simulation (using AnyLogic simulator) shows the 3D view of successful implementation of collision free strategies.}

abstract = {Infrared dim target detection under complex backgrounds is of great importance in many applications. However, it is difficult for the conventional detection method to enhance dim targets and suppress clutter effectively and simultaneously, which leads to a low detection rate, poor background adaptability, and many false alarms. To address this issue, a simple method based on local feature contrast and energy concentration degree (LFC-ECD) is proposed in this paper to detect infrared dim targets under backgrounds with clutters. The LFC-ECD consists of the LFC model and ECD model; the former suppresses most background and effectively enhances the target, the latter suppresses residual clutter having similar features to the real target. Eventually, the true target is extracted from the background by adaptive threshold segmentation. The experiment is conducted on six infrared sequences that have different backgrounds and a minimum average signal-to-clutter rate (SCR) of 0.9299. The experimental results indicate that, compared with the other 7 methods, LFC-ECD not only achieves background suppression and target enhancement with higher values of the background suppression factor (BSF) and gain of SCR (GSCR) but also has a faster processing speed. In conclusion, LFC-ECD improves the effectiveness of IR dim target detection under complex background.}

Given the large quantities of data types generated from unmanned aerial system (UAS) platforms, uncovering the most appropriate candidate UAS data–based phenotype (UASDP) with a strong relationship to target crop traits may be a challenge with the traditional regression models. We hypothesized that by employing machine learning modeling techniques, the contributions of multiple vegetative indices as predictors of biomass and water-use could be defined and ranked. The objective of this study was to apply predictive machine techniques in determining the phase of spinach growth and UASDP variables that best predict yield and water-use efficiency. UASDPs were derived using red-green-blue and multi-spectral sensors mounted on a UAS platform flown weekly on 10 spinach genotypes under well-watered and partial water deficit conditions. Candidate UASDPs including mean and maximum plant height, canopy cover and volume, excess greenness index (ExG), chlorophyll red-edge (ChlRE), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference red-edge (NDRE) were generated. UASDPs were used to predict above-ground biomass-based fresh yield, biological dry yield, and field water-use efficiency (WUEf). This study highlights the use of bootstrap forest partitioning, and partition rank fraction as methods for selecting among many UASDPs as predictors of WUEf and yield. We also used a weighted geometric mean to integrate various model performance metrics to further refine the UASDPs rankings. UASDPs from mid to late growth stages were better predictors of yield and WUEf than UASDPs from earlier periods. Canopy volume, NDRE and ExG were the best predictors overall and were useful for distinguishing varieties, particularly in water-stress conditions. We expect that the approaches detailed here will improve reliability of discriminating the importance of UAS-acquired data types thereby improving UAS data-processing efficiency.}

The common method adopts a bottom-up strategy which requires a ground filtering process first, and the subsequent process of region growing based on a single seed point easily causes oversegmentation problem. This paper proposes a novel method to extract roofs. A top-down strategy based on cloth simulation is first used to detect seed point sets with semantic information; then, the roof seed points are extracted instead of a single seed point for region-growing segmentation. The proposed method is validated by three point cloud datasets that contain different types of roof and building footprints. The results show that the top-down strategy directly extracts roof seed point sets, most roofs are extracted by the region-growing algorithm based on the seed point set, and the total errors of roof extraction in the test areas are 0.65%, 1.07%, and 1.45%. The proposed method simplifies the workflow of roof extraction, reduces oversegmentation, and determines roofs in advance based on the semantic seed point set, which suggests a practical solution for rapid roof extraction.}

The advantages of affordability, easy assembling and quick driving, allow the deployment of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) on a large scale, and provide the elevation for the industrial and the civilian implementations ubiquitously. With the enhancement of cellular networking, the control range of UAS can extend significantly which allows the controller finish their mission far away from workplace and prevents the threats derived from the hazards in the uncertain environment. The Base Stations (BSs) are vital to the cellular-connected UAS because the BSs can provide the Internet access for the UAS and the remote controllers that sends instructions to the UAS and backhauls the packets to the controllers precisely and timely. However, the malicious BSs are great threats to the cellular-connected UAS. Specifically, the malicious BSs are scattered in the legislative BSs and cannot provide formal networking access services to the UAS. What is worse, the attackers can leverage the malicious BSs to disclose the controllers’ privacy and set threats to the public property. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based approach to mitigate the threats from accessing the malicious BSs. We implement the consensus construction on the authentication of networking access to enhance the efficiency of verification between BSs. To achieve the security of cellular connected UAS, we deploy blockchain to maintain the high online rate for accessing networking. Apart from the prevention of accessing malicious BSs, our approach can detect the malicious BSs and eliminate the proportion of the malicious BSs in the cellular networking. The evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional point-to-point authentication method. Concurrently, we enhanced the verification between BSs and the cellular-connected UAS. Our proposed blockchain enabled verification for cellular UAS networking has high potentials to rise the efficiency and the security of the UAS deployment on a large scale.}

Because the mobile nodes of a MANET are free to move rapidly and arbitrarily, the network topology may change unexpectedly. This paper presents a decentralized approach to maintain the connectivity of a MANET using autonomous, intelligent agents. Autonomous agents are special mobile nodes in a MANET, but unlike other nodes, their function is to proactively prevent network bottlenecks and service problems by intelligently augmenting the network topology. To achieve this function without depending on a central network management system, autonomous agents are expected to dynamically relocate themselves as the topology of the network changes during the mission time. A flocking-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to determine agent locations. A computational study is performed to investigate the effect of basic flocking behaviors on the connectivity of a MANET.}

abstract = {Gap acceptance represents a pedestrian’s assessment of how safe it may be to use an available gap in traffic flow at a particular point in time. Though walking is a major component of urban mobility, the high rate of fatal interaction with motor vehicle traffic raises safety issues around how pedestrians decide to accept the available gap. This paper explored these interactions by modeling gap acceptance behavior at the midblock crosswalks. Unlike other pedestrian gap acceptance studies that focus on individual psychological and sociological factors that are difficult to control or manage, this study focused on six environmental factors that we considered important and as having the potential to affect the pedestrians’ gap acceptance decision at the crosswalks, i.e. gap size, crossing distance, number of waiting pedestrians, waiting time, vehicle traffic volume and position of pedestrian (whether on street kerb or median). Video data was collected on pedestrian gap acceptance from 13 midblock crosswalk locations in Shanghai, China. A Logit model with 96% accuracy was developed to describe and predict the pedestrian gap acceptance behaviors. The results show that gap size and crossing distance have the highest effect on the pedestrian gap acceptance decision. Pedestrians waiting at the kerbside could confidently accept gaps (with a 95% probability) when the gap is longer than 2.2s, 5.9s, and 9.6s under the condition that the crossing distance is 4 m (one lane), 7.5 m (two lanes), and 11 m (three lanes), respectively while pedestrians waiting at the median could confidently accept gaps when the gap is longer than 1.6s, 5.3s, and 8.5s respectively under the same conditions. The recommendations on improving the crossing safety are proposed accordingly.}

abstract = {This paper studies a consensus problem for discrete-time linear nabla fractional order multi-agent systems with Riemann-Liouville difference operator. With the help of the discrete fractional Lyapunov direct method, a state feedback stabilization problem of a discrete-time linear nabla fractional order system is firstly analyzed. Then a distributed consensus control law is proposed for a discrete-time linear nabla fractional order multi-agent system. Some sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee that the leader-following consensus can be achieved by the proposed algorithm. The control gain is determined according to an algebraic Riccati inequality. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical analysis.}

abstract = {This paper suggests a novel three-level model-free hierarchical learning approach that solves the reference trajectory tracking problem for control systems (CSs). The new approach consists of the low level, the intermediate level and the high level, it relies on past memorized optimal input output execution patterns and adaptively merges them using a similarity measure. The low level feedback control is carried out in a novel model-free framework using a neural network (NN) controwller tuned by Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) in order to linearize the closed-loop CS and to match a linear reference model. The NN controller is tuned in two phases, an offline one and an online one. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is first employed in the novel offline tuning phase. The online tuning phase makes next use only of the process sign in the dynamic back-propagation mechanism that updates the NN parameters. After the NN controller is trained and the feedback CS is fixed, the optimal execution patterns (input/output patterns) are defined in terms of optimal control problems, which balance control accuracy and control effort. The input/output patterns are formulated over a feedback CS and are solved in a model-free Iterative Learning Control (ILC) framework for linear time-invariant systems at the intermediate level. Once the optimal executions are learned at the intermediate level over the feedback CS, they are stored in a database (DB). Then each time a new trajectory is to be tracked as required by the high level planner, similar patterns of executions are looked-up in the DB and are merged by the weighted average sum of most similar patterns resulted from a sort algorithm using a distance metric. The proposed approach is tested on the position control of a Single Input-Single Output nonlinear aerodynamic control system and shows trajectory tracking performance improvement with respect to the case when no learnt experience is used.}

An example case study of the benchmark is quantifying an optimization approach for a PID controller with 5.4% improved performance. A multivariate example shows the quantified performance improvement by using model predictive control with a physics-based model, an autoregressive time series model, and a Hammerstein model with an artificial neural network to capture the static nonlinearity. These results demonstrate the potential of a hardware benchmark for transient modeling and regulatory or advanced control methods.}

CAV technologies are being developed rapidly and they are foreseen to penetrate the market at a rapid pace. On the other hand, work zones (WZs) have become common areas on highway systems as a result of the increasing construction and maintenance activities. The near future will therefore bring the coexistence of CAVs and WZs which makes their interaction inevitable. WZs expose all vehicles to a sudden and complex geometric change in the roadway environment, something that may challenge many of CAV navigation capabilities. WZs however also impose a space contraction resulting in adverse traffic impacts, something that legitimately calls for benefiting from the highly efficient CAV functions. CAVs should be able to reliably traverse WZ geometry and WZs should benefit from CAV intelligent functions. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art and the key concepts, opportunities, and challenges of deploying CAV systems at WZs. The reviewed subjects include traffic performance and behaviour, technologies and infrastructure, and regulatory considerations. Eighteen CAV mobility, safety, and environmental concepts and functions were distributed over the WZ area which was subdivided into five segments: further upstream, approach area, queuing area, WZ activity, and termination area. In addition, among other topics reviewed and discussed are detection of WZ features, smart traffic control devices, various technologies at connected WZs, cross-border harmonization, liability, insurance, and privacy. The paper also provides a research agenda with a list of research needs supported by experts rating and inputs. The paper aims to provide a bird’s eye view, but with necessary details that can benefit researchers, practitioners, and transportation agencies.}

Across Antarctica, moss beds are experiencing changes in health as their environment changes. As Antarctic moss beds are spatially fragmented with relatively small extent they require very high resolution remotely sensed imagery to monitor their distribution and dynamics. This study demonstrates that multi-sensor imagery collected by an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) provides a novel data source for assessment of moss health. In this study, we train a Random Forest Regression Model (RFM) with long-term field quadrats at a study site in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica and apply it to UAS RGB and 6-band multispectral imagery, derived vegetation indices, 3D topographic data, and thermal imagery to predict moss health. Our results suggest that moss health, expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100% healthy, can be estimated with a root mean squared error (RMSE) between 7 and 12%. The RFM also quantifies the importance of input variables for moss health estimation showing the multispectral sensor data was important for accurate health prediction, such information being essential for planning future field investigations. The RFM was applied to the entire moss bed, providing an extrapolation of the health assessment across a larger spatial area. With further validation the resulting maps could be used for change detection of moss health across multiple sites and seasons.}

In this position paper, we discuss the impact on optical networks of all major classes of disaster events mentioned above, and we overview recent relevant techniques that have been proposed to increase the disaster resilience of optical networks against the various classes of disaster events. We start by presenting some proactive methods to be applied before the occurrence of a disaster. Then we move our focus also on other preparedness methods that can be executed in the (typically short) time frame between the occurrence of an early alert of an incoming disaster and the time a disaster actually hits the network. Finally, we discuss reactive procedures that allow performing post-disaster recovery operations effectively. The analysis of disaster resilience mechanisms provided in this paper covers both wired and optical wireless communication infrastructures and also contains explicit remarks covering the role of emerging technologies (e.g., fixed-mobile convergence in the 5G era and beyond) in disaster resilience.}

One major ecological perturbation underway over the past several decades of the Anthropocene is extensive tree and shrub mortality, or forest die-off, triggered by elevated temperatures and prolonged drought, and/or insect and pathogen outbreaks. This increasingly common disturbance has affected forests and woodlands on all vegetated continents and may alter terrestrial carbon fluxes in the biosphere. Remote sensing has enabled mapping of the extent and ecological patterns of tree loss and damage, assessing potential carbon emissions and monitoring ecosystem trajectories after tree mortality. In this review article, we cover drought-induced changes in plant physiology, chemistry, and structure that occur as an individual tree progresses from healthy to stressed to standing dead or coarse woody debris, and corresponding responses in remotely sensed data that provide the opportunity and potential for observation and analysis at large spatial scales and early detection. The linkages between changes associated with tree mortality and remote sensing show exceptional promise for strategic and adaptive natural resource management as climate models project warmer and drier climates in the coming decades.}

In particular, mangrove canopy assessments using remote sensing methods can be undertaken rapidly and, if freely available, optimize costs. Although such spaceborne data have been used for such purposes, their application to map mangroves at the species level has been limited by the capacity to provide continuous data. The objective of this study was to assess mangrove seasonal patterns using seven multispectral vegetation indices based on a Sentinel-2 (S2) time series (July 2018 to October 2019) to assess phenological trajectories of various semiarid mangrove classes in the Google Earth Engine platform using Fourier analysis for an area located in Western Mexico. The results indicate that the months from November through December and from May through July were critical in mangrove species discrimination using the EVI2, NDVI, and VARI series. The Random Forest classification accuracy for the S2 image was calculated at 79% during the optimal acquisition period (June 25, 2019), whereas only 55% accuracy was calculated for the non-optimal image acquired date (March 2, 2019). Although mangroves are considered evergreen forests, the phenological pattern of various mangrove canopies, based on these indices, were shown to be very similar to the surrounding land-based semiarid deciduous forest. Consequently, it is believed that the rainfall pattern is likely to be the key environmental factor driving mangrove phenology in this semiarid coastal system and thus the degree of success in mangrove remote sensing classification endeavors. Identifying the optimal dates when canopy spectral conditions are ideal in achieving mangrove species discrimination could be of utmost importance when purchasing more expensive very-high spatial resolution satellite images or collecting spatial data from UAVs.}

Mechanical specific energy (MSE) is the required energy in underground formations to drill the rock formations, which should be analyzed parametrically to estimate drilling inefficiencies correctly. It has caused to improve the drilling operations and effectiveness of drilling bite lifetime. Using SPSS-Ver023 software as an appropriate statistical and analytical model, the drilling bit rate of penetration (ROP) was optimized. Then, the drilling parameters such as weight on bit (WOB) was optimized as the energy-efficient parameter in MSE design. Data gathering was collected from three underground formations to derive linear and non-linear correlations from having a proper analysis. It allows us to have an accurate analysis of the appropriateness of derived correlations. It is concluded that non-linear correlations would provide accurate results as it is derived by more sensitive data and can be extended to similar formations in the specific area.}

In this study, we assessed the potential of Sentinel-2 configuration to predict forage quality in high diverse Mediterranean permanent grasslands of open woodlands. We evaluated the performance of Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) models to predict crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and enzyme digestibility of organic matter (EDOM) by using three different reflectance datasets: (i) laboratory measurements of reflectance of dry and ground pasture samples re-sampled to Sentinel-2 configuration (Spec-lab) (ii) field in-situ measurements of grasslands canopy reflectance resampled to Sentinel-2 configuration (Spec-field); (iii) and Bottom Of Atmosphere Sentinel-2 imagery. For the three reflectance datasets, the models to predict CP content showed moderate performance and predictive ability. Mean R2test = 0.68 were obtained using Spec-lab data, mean R2test decreased by 0.11 with Spec-field and by 0.18 when Sentinel-2 reflectance was used. Statistics for NDF showed worse predictions than those obtained for CP: predictions produced with Spec-lab showed mean R2test = 0.64 and mean RPDtest = 1.73. The mean values of R2test = 0.50 and RPDtest = 1.54 using Sentinel-2 BOA reflectance were marginally better than the values obtained with Spec-field (mean R2test = 0.48, mean RPDtest = 1.43). For ADF and EDOM, only predictions made with Spec-lab produced acceptable results. Bands from the red-edge region, especially band 5, and the SWIR regions showed the highest contribution to estimating CP and NDF. Bands 2, blue and 4, red also seem to be important. The implementation of field spectroscopy in combination with Sentinel-2 imagery proved to be feasible to produce forage quality maps and to develop larger datasets. This study contributes to increasing knowledge of the potential and applicability of Sentinel-2 to predict the quality of Mediterranean permanent grasslands in open woodlands.}

In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-based Injection Network (AIN) to address this issue. Instead of directly learning the relationship between the source and target image, we decompose the process into two accessible modules, namely Semantic-guided Attention Network (SAN) and Pose-guided Attention Network (PAN). SAN is proposed to capture the semantic information which can embed the human attributes into the latent space via the semantic layout. PAN enables a natural re-coupling of the pose and appearance, which can selectively integrate features to complete the human pose transformation. Additionally, a semantic layout loss is proposed to focus on the semantic content similarity between the source and generated images. Compared with other methods, our networks can enforce the local textures and styles consistency between the source and generated image. Experiments show that superior both qualitative and quantitative results are obtained on Market-1501 and DeepFashion datasets. On the basis of AIN, our network can further achieve the data augmentation for person re-identification (Re-ID) with dramatically improving the person Re-ID accuracy.}

This technique is useful in tasks that require robots or other automated motion systems to automatically inspect parts or structures. One specific method of visual servoing is Image Based Visual Servoing (IBVS), a method that simply minimizes the differences between an observed image orientation and a desired one. This method works well for orientations where these differences are small, but in the case where the desired orientation is more difficult to reach, the motion system can follow non-optimal trajectories and requires more computation time. In this paper we attempt to address this large difference issue by applying Dynamic Programming, an optimal control method that can determine an optimal trajectory by partitioning possible trajectories into multiple smaller trajectories. Using a cost function to penalize undesirable subtrajectories, the optimal overall trajectory can be determined. We present the method in an application of a camera mounted to a servo positioning system for part inspection.}

However, there are limited works on vehicle detection with partial appearance, and the method for partially visible vehicle localization has not been explored. In this paper, a novel framework for vehicle detection and localization with partial appearance is proposed using stereo vision and geometry. First, the original images from the stereo camera are processed to form a v-disparity map. After object detection using v-disparity, vehicle candidates are generated with prior knowledge of possible vehicle locations on the image. Deep learning-based verification completes vehicle detection. For each detected vehicle, partially visible vehicle tracking algorithm is newly introduced. To track partially visible vehicles, this algorithm detects the vehicle edge on the ground, defined as the grounded edge, and then selects a reference point for Kalman filter tracking. Finally, a rectangular box is drawn on the bird’s eye view to represent vehicle’s longitudinal and lateral location. The proposed system successfully performs partially visible vehicle detection and tracking. For testing the localization performance, the datasets in a highway and an urban setting are used and provide less than 1.5 m longitudinal error and 0.4 m lateral error in standard deviation.}

Firstly, the spectrum information of network channel sharing available to users is obtained, and the cuckoo search algorithm is used to optimize under the condition of satisfying the quality of service (QoS) guarantee of users, and the optimal allocation scheme is obtained by iterating for many times. The use steps are illustrated by examples. Compared with the traditional genetic algorithm, the calculation complexity can be reduced, and it can also be extended to more users and networks. In this algorithm, each cuckoo represents an agent, and all the agents constitute a von-Neumann structure. Through the neighborhood competition cooperation operator, mutation operator, self-learning operator and the evolution mechanism of cuckoo algorithm, they can continuously enhance the energy and improve the adaptability, and can quickly and accurately find the optimal solution of the problem.}

About half are being struck by and caught-in/between objects or vehicles, resulting from insufficient or delayed detection of pedestrian workers.

This work has three objectives: First, a comprehensive synthesis on close call reporting processes and individual technologies. Second, a system focusing on (a) autonomous close call data generation from real-time proactive proximity detection and alerting technology and (b) cloud-based data processing and visualization in building information models at run time. Test results demonstrate that the developed system reaches purposes for decision making in safety management beyond the scope of existing detection and alarming devices.

abstract = {In recent years, the integration of intelligent condition monitoring systems has become crucial for the Operation and Maintenance in the industry. Condition-based maintenance strategies allow the identification of the current health status of industrial assets. Consequently, downtimes and maintenance costs are reduced by the efficient planning of corrective actions and the early detection of costly damages. However, the implementation of data-based monitoring techniques is often hampered by two main difficulties: Firstly, the lack of understanding of the monitored equipment; and secondly, the lack of data related to failures and their evolution, which is one of the major obstacles for the implementation. This article proposes a method based on the use of dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques to perform real-time monitoring of the state of the machine. The performance of the approach is studied with four different DR techniques: PCA, LDA, Relief, and Autoencoders. The algorithms are tested in a simulation of various asset lifetimes in which they determine when the assets are working under abnormal conditions. Next, the results of the simulation are evaluated under a specifically designed evaluation criterion based on three key performance indicators; cost, interpretability, and effectiveness. In this way, a common situation in industrial field applications is imitated, where the information is gathered in real-time and there is not enough prior knowledge of the machine nor data about its degradation or failures.}

This translates into rapid development, where each service is developed and deployed by small teams, enabling continuous shipping of new features and fast-evolving applications. However, the underlying complexity of this type of architecture can hinder observability and maintenance by the user. In particular, identifying the root cause of an anomaly detected in the application can be a difficult and time-consuming task, considering the numerous services and connections to be examined. In this work, we present a root cause analysis framework, based on graph representations of these architectures. The graphs can be used to compare any anomalous situation that happens in the system with a library of anomalous graphs that serves as a knowledge base for the user troubleshooting those anomalies. We use the Grid’5000 testbed to deploy three different architectures and inject a set of anomalies. The results show how our graph-based approach is 19.41% more effective than a machine learning method that does not take into account the relationship between elements.}

Dynamic transportation assignment has attracted more interest in the smart city construction under the new era of the Internet of things (IoT) because the urban road traffic is the heart of many problems in many fields, such as in the case of city congestion and processing center planning system. In this paper, we analyzed the processing center’s economic indexes and optimized the dynamic transportation network assignment based on continuous big IoT input database, and a high performance computing model is proposed for the dynamic traffic planning. Specifically, while the previous methods exploited the geographical information system (GIS) or K-means separately, the proposed transportation planning is based on the real-time IoT and GIS data, which is processed by DBN and K-means to make the final solution close to the practice and meet the requirements of high performance computing and economic cost. which is regarded as the key target index. Moreover, considering the large data characteristic of real-time online stream, the deep belief network (DBN) model is built to preprocess the data to improve the clustering effect of the K-means. This study works on the example case of hotel service centers problem in Tianjin to evaluate the optimal dynamic traffic network planning result. The experiment test has proved that based on the performance of super high computing, the model is precisely helpful for the optimal planning of traffic network under real time mass data situation and low cost, and promoting the construction and development of the smart city.}

Hence the acquisition of images of high spatial and spectral quality simultaneously is of crucial importance. To resolve the problem of structural limitations of sensors that influence the quality of acquired images, it is necessary to integrate data from different sensors. Using both original and simulated high spatial resolution images, the authors proposed an effective methodology for integrating image data from aerial and satellite sensors, allowing the generation of sharpened images while maintaining the highest degree possible of the spectral features of photographed objects. At the same time, the article concerns the impact assessment of spectral resolution of high spatial images upon the spectral quality of an enhanced image in multisensor data fusion process with the use of the pan-sharpening method. It is of extreme importance from the viewpoint of precision farming, where it is necessary to have as many parameters as possible that characterise agricultural and forest land. Moreover, the aim is for such parameters to reflect the reliable spectral characteristics of the studied objects. Increased spectral quality of sharpened images translates not only to more credible quantitative evaluation of photographed land-use areas, including but not limited to the assessment of the condition of plants, as well as to more accurate automatic plant classification process.}

However, their excellent performance usually comes at the cost of sacrificing the computational speed. Furthermore, training correlation filters using high dimensional raw features may introduce the risk of severe over-fitting. To address the above issues, we propose Spatio-Temporal adaptive and Channel selective Correlation Filters (STCCF) for robust tracking. Specifically, we first select a set of target-specific features from high dimensional features via an effective channel selective scheme based on the Taylor expansion. Then, we reformulate the filter learning problem from ridge regression to elastic net regression to adaptively select the discriminative features inside the target bounding box at the spatial level. Moreover, we constrain the filters to be adaptive across temporal frames by learning a transformation matrix from the initial filters to the previous filters. In particular, with a specific spatio-temporal-channel constraint, STCCF can not only alleviate the over-fitting problem and reduce the computational cost, but also enhance the discriminability and interpretability of the learned filters. The proposed STCCF can be optimized by using a few iterations of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Experiments on six challenging datasets show that STCCF can achieve promising performance with fast running speed.}

An improved grasshopper optimization algorithm (IGOA) was proposed in this paper. Chaotic initialization was carried out to improve the quality of initial population. Then differential evolution strategy was introduced to maintain the diversity of the population through mutation, crossover and selection process, leading to getting rid of local optimums and searching for better solutions in GOA. To accelerate the convergence speed of the algorithm, the positions of particles were updated with current particle optimal values as targets as in particle swarm optimization. The optimization experiments on standard test functions shown the superiority of IGOA compared with other intelligent optimization algorithms. IGOA was then used to identify the parameters of polycrystalline silicon solar cells. The identification accuracy and stability of IGOA are much higher than harris hawks optimization, grey wolf optimization and ant lion optimization. The effectiveness of IGOA in identifying parameters of solar cell under different illuminations was also verified by experiments.}

abstract = {The idea of utilizing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that employ an array of severally-controllable meta-material elements to scatter incoming data in a desirable way, in wireless communication systems has created new opportunities for transmission in various scenarios. For instance, RISs are envisioned as potential candidates to achieve smart radio environments in fifth generation (5G) network technology, which is usually described as incapable of controlling the environment. Nevertheless, existing studies analyzing RIS-empowered wireless networks generally discuss the cases with ideal hardware despite the fact that both physical transceiver and RISs suffer from unignorable hardware imperfections, which may exceedingly reduce the system performance in practical communication scenarios. This paper investigates the performance of an RIS-assisted spatial modulation (SM) scheme in the presence of in-phase/quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI) at the base station (BS) constituting a substantial impairment in direct-conversion transceivers. The concept of the RIS-assisted SM scheme is discussed by comparing three different implementation scenarios depending on the awareness of both the channel phases at the RIS and the severity of the IQI at the destination (D). The average bit error rate (ABER) is derived analytically by use of maximum likelihood (ML) detection method to tackle the distorting impact of the IQI taking the effects of path loss into account. Extensive computer simulation results, which verify theoretical findings, show that the performance of the traditional SM schemes with IQI can remarkably be improved by utilizing RISs, while having the knowledge of the adjusted phases at the receiver (Rx) provides substantial gain in terms of energy.}

In this paper, we propose optimal spectral bands to classify Allium (garlic and onion) and Brassicaceae (Chinese cabbage and radish) by using higher-dimensional data from hyperspectral imagery. A decision-tree classifier was used to determine the optimal method to use the high-dimensional data. The high-dimensional data were analysed for all growth stages and considering bandwidths with different full width at half maximum (FWHM) values at 25, 40, 50 and 80 nm. The spectral bands selected for Allium were differentiated into green, blue, and NIR bands for each growth stage. The results show that Allium can be classified clearly as overall accuracy (OA) 1 and kappa coefficient 1 for all FWHM based on March 22 data. For each April 19 and May 12 data, the decision-tree classifier with each 80 nm FWHM and 50 nm FWHM yielded a better classification accuracy of more than OA 0.921 and kappa coefficient 0.839 than other FWHM. The spectral bands selected for Brassicaceae were found to be similar to blue band for all growth stages. Brassicaceae was classified clearly for all FWHM based on October 27 data.

The proper functioning of the insulators is essential for the continuity in the supply of electrical energy. When an insulator has its properties damaged, disruptive discharges may shut down the system and impairs the network’s reliability. For this reason, classifying adverse conditions is a critical task to keep the system running. In this paper, the echo state network is used for the classification of the insulators based on the ultrasound signal. Hypertuning is applied to automate the evaluation of the parameters and optimize the network to have a general application. The insulators are evaluated in the laboratory under controlled conditions from the application of 7.95 kV (phase-to-ground), under the same conditions that are found in the field. The assessment is made on perforated and contaminated insulators, which were removed from service due to defects. The echo state network achieves 87.36 % accuracy for the multiclassification and 99.99 % for the specific classification of drilling. For comparative analysis, the multilayer perceptron and support-vector machines are evaluated based on the fast fourier transform. The results show that echo state network is promising to classify the evaluated conditions, being more accurate than the multilayer perceptron and support-vector machines based on fast fourier transform.}

abstract = {Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) has been widely adopted in field plant phenotyping activities. Current HSI solutions such as airborne remote sensing platforms and handheld spectrometers have been proven effective and have become popular in various phenotyping applications. However, the imaging quality of current airborne sensing systems still suffers from various noises due to the changing ambient lighting condition, long imaging distance, and comparatively low resolution. Handheld leaf spectrometers provide a higher quality of spectral data, but they only measure a small spot on the leaf, which cannot represent the whole leaf or canopy very well due to the great variation between different locations. In 2018, the Purdue Ag engineers developed a new handheld hyperspectral leaf imager, LeafSpec. For the first time, phenotyping researchers were able to collect high-resolution hyperspectral leaf images without the impacts of the changing ambient light and leaf slopes. However, the application of LeafSpec was still limited by its low throughput and intensive labor cost in the field measurements. The goal of this project was to develop a robotic system that could replace the human operator to perform in-field and leaf-level HSI using LeafSpec. The system consisted of a machine-operable version of the LeafSpec device, a machine vision system for target leaf detection, and a customized cartesian robotic manipulator with five Degrees of Freedom (DOF). In the 2019 field test, the designed system collected data from corn plants with two genotypes and three levels of nitrogen treatments with an average cycle time of 86 s. The nitrogen content predicted by the designed system had an R2 value of 0.7307 against the ground truth. The prediction could also differentiate the different nitrogen treatments with P-values of 0.0193 and 0.0102. The performance was similar to human operators’. The developers, therefore, conclude that the robotic system has the potential of replacing human operators for LeafSpec hyperspectral corn leaf imaging in the field.}

abstract = {During about 30 years, a lot of research teams have worked on the big challenge of detection of moving objects in various challenging environments. First applications concern static cameras but with the rise of the mobile sensors studies on moving cameras have emerged over time. In this survey, we propose to identify and categorize the different existing methods found in the literature. For this purpose, we propose to classify these methods according to the choose of the scene representation: one plane or several parts. Inside these two categories, the methods are grouped according to eight different approaches: panoramic background subtraction, dual cameras, motion compensation, subspace segmentation, motion segmentation, plane+parallax, multi planes and split image in blocks. A reminder of methods for static cameras is provided as well as the challenges with both static and moving cameras. Publicly available datasets and evaluation metrics are also surveyed in this paper.}

abstract = {Target search and tracking is a classical but difficult problem in many research domains, including computer vision, wireless sensor networks and robotics. We review the seminal works that addressed this problem in the area of swarm robotics, which is the application of swarm intelligence principles to the control of multi-robot systems. Robustness, scalability and flexibility, as well as distributed sensing, make swarm robotic systems well suited for the problem of target search and tracking in real-world applications. We classify the works we review according to the variations and aspects of the search and tracking problems they addressed. As this is a particularly application-driven research area, the adopted taxonomy makes this review serve as a quick reference guide to our readers in identifying related works and approaches according to their problem at hand. By no means is this an exhaustive review, but an overview for researchers who are new to the swarm robotics field, to help them easily start off their research.}

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) have a variety of applications in our daily life that have attracted the attention of many researchers around the world. There are a variety of innovations in the flight mechanisms that UASs are applying for flight. There is also a significant interest in the development of new types of drones that can fly autonomously in different locations, such as cities, marine, and space environments and perform various missions. This paper reviews the different configurations, flight mechanisms, and applications of UASs. First of all, UASs are divided into four main categories, including Horizontal Takeoff and Landing (HTOL), Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL), Hybrid, and Bio-Based drones. Then each category is divided into some sub-categories in order to have a coherent review. The characteristics, advantages and drawbacks of each category are discussed elaborately. Moreover, a comprehensive study is carried out on the applications of UASs and their specifications.}

abstract = {This paper addresses a secure bipartite tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear multi-agents (MASs) with nonsymmetric input constraints. In the presence of adversarial sensor attacks, a secure measurement preselector, along with an explicit sufficient condition, and a neural network (NN) secure state observer are introduced for achieving secure state estimation. Then, a secure bipartite tracking control strategy is proposed, where observation predictors are designed to reconstruct prediction errors in such a way as to improve control performance. Furthermore, an auxiliary system is presented to eliminate influence from nonsymmetric input saturations. It is theoretically proved that the proposed control strategy not only guarantees bipartite tracking of the MAS but also preserves the stability of the resulting closed-loop system in spite of senor attacks. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the obtained results.}
