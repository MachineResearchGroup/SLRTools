abstract = {Recent visualizations of smart cities, factories, healthcare system and etc. raise challenges on the capability and connectivity of massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hence, edge computing is emerged to complement these capability-constrained devices with an idea offloading intensive computation tasks from them to edge nodes. By taking advantage of this feature, IoT devices are able to conserve more energy and still maintain the quality of services they shall provide. Nevertheless, computation offloading decisions concern joint and complex resource management and should be determined in real time facing dynamic workloads and radio environment. Therefore, in this work, we use multiple Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents deployed on IoT devices to instruct the decision making of themselves. On the other hand, Federated Learning is utilized to train DRL agents in a distributed fashion, aiming to make the DRL-based decision making practical and further decrease the transmission cost between IoT devices and Edge Nodes. Experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of both the DRL and Federated Learning in the dynamic IoT system.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a dynamic pricing of edge cooperative offloading scenario in a multi-periods system that maximizes the total expected discounted profit of requesting MEC server over a finite horizon. Keeping track of the pricing decisions in each of the resource scheduling waiting time gives rise to the curse of dimensionality. In order to deal with the curse-of-dimensionality problem, we apply a simple heuristic algorithm. The idea of the heuristic stems from analytical findings which suggest that the shape of the myopic price is close to that of the optimal pricing policy. We firstly introduce the myopic price as the heuristic resource pricing policy, which is a function of the expected resource request quantity. For further simplified calculation, we then construct a linear approximation to the myopic expected resource request, which is a function of the initial computing resource of requesting MEC server. Finally, we illustrate the heuristic resource pricing and data offloading policy in detail. The proposed algorithm can transform a recurrence summation optimization problem into a single-period optimization, and efficiently make a decision of resource pricing and data offloading policy in collaborative computation offloading scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is near-optimal.},

abstract = {Nowadays, we are witnessing the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) with numerous devices performing interactions between them or with their environment. The huge number of devices leads to huge volumes of data that demand the appropriate processing. The “legacy” approach is to rely on Cloud where increased computational resources can realize any desired processing. However, the need for supporting real-time applications requires a reduced latency in the provision of outcomes. Edge Computing (EC) comes as the “solver” of the latency problem. Various processing activities can be performed at EC nodes having direct connection with IoT devices. A number of challenges should be met before we conclude a fully automated ecosystem where nodes can cooperate or understand their status to efficiently serve applications. In this article, we perform a survey of the relevant research activities towards the vision of Edge Mesh (EM), i.e., a “cover” of intelligence upon the EC. We present the necessary hardware and discuss research outcomes in every aspect of EC/EM nodes functioning. We present technologies and theories adopted for data, tasks, and resource management while discussing how machine learning and optimization can be adopted in the domain.},

abstract = {Given that cognitive capabilities of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices often have huge differences, especially due to their deployments in highly personal environments, it is plausible that collaborating IoT devices for cognition can lead to higher accuracy. However, designing a collaborative cognition mechanism for resource-constrained IoT devices is challenging because the collaboration needs to involve a subset of IoT devices, yet still be accurate. Although existing methods (e.g., ensemble pruning) can help the models to ensemble without sacrificing accuracy, these approaches only consider accuracy without computational cost, which is especially important for resource-scarce IoT devices. In this paper, we propose RC2, a resource-efficient collaborative cognition approach for IoT devices collaboration. We propose to explicitly incorporate computational cost information into the main objective so that the approach can obtain a collaboration that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. We conduct empirical evaluation of our method compared with two state-of-the-art methods; and the evaluation shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.},

abstract = {Traffic flow prediction plays an important role in many spatial-temporal data applications, e.g., traffic management and urban planning. Various deep learning techniques are developed to model the traffic dynamic patterns with different neural network architectures, such as attention mechanism, recurrent neural network. However, two important challenges have yet to be well addressed: (i) Most of these methods solely focus on local spatial dependencies and ignore the global inter-region dependencies in terms of traffic distributions; (ii) It is important to capture channel-aware semantics when performing spatial-temporal information aggregation. To address these challenges, we propose a new traffic prediction framework--Spatial-Temporal Convolutional Graph Attention Network (ST-CGA), to enable the traffic prediction with the modeling of region dependencies, from locally to globally in a comprehensive manner. In our ST-CGA framework, we first develop a hierarchical attention networks with a graph-based neural architecture, to capture both the multi-level temporal relations and cross-region traffic dependencies. Furthermore, a region-wise spatial relation encoder is proposed to supercharge ST-CGA mapping spatial and temporal signals into different representation subspaces, with channel-aware recalibration residual network. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that ST-CGA achieve substantial gains over many state-of-the-art baselines.

Existing spatially fine-grained estimation methods and forecasting methods have the following problems: 1) Only a part of data related to air quality is considered. 2) Features are defined and extracted artificially. 3) Due to the lack of training samples, they usually cannot achieve good generalization performance. Therefore, we propose a deep multi-task learning (MTL) based urban air quality index (AQI) modelling method (PANDA). On one hand, a variety of air quality-related urban big data (meteorology, traffic, factory air pollutant emission, point of interest (POI) distribution, road network distribution, etc.) are considered. Deep neural networks are used to learn the representations of these relevant spatial and sequential data, as well as to build the correlation between AQI and these representations. On the other hand, PANDA solves spatially fine-grained AQI level estimation task and AQI forecasting task jointly, which can leverage the commonalities and differences between these two tasks to improve generalization performance. We evaluate PANDA on the dataset of Hangzhou city. The experimental results show that our method can yield a better performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

Considering such devices, e.g., surveillance cameras or AR/VR gadgets, are resource constrained, although there has been significant work in creating lightweight deep neural networks (DNNs) for such clients, none of these can adapt to changing runtime conditions, e.g., changes in resource availability on the device, the content characteristics, or requirements from the user. In this article, we introduce ApproxNet, a video object classification system for embedded or mobile clients. It enables novel dynamic approximation techniques to achieve desired inference latency and accuracy trade-off under changing runtime conditions. It achieves this by enabling two approximation knobs within a single DNN model rather than creating and maintaining an ensemble of models, e.g., MCDNN [MobiSys-16]. We show that ApproxNet can adapt seamlessly at runtime to these changes, provides low and stable latency for the image and video frame classification problems, and shows the improvement in accuracy and latency over ResNet [CVPR-16], MCDNN [MobiSys-16], MobileNets [Google-17], NestDNN [MobiCom-18], and MSDNet [ICLR-18].},

abstract = {This paper studies the classification principle and process of SVM algorithm, and classifies the text containing movie information, so as to achieve the research purpose of movie classification. It focuses on the various steps that need to be completed in the process of classification, such as text word segmentation, feature engineering, text representation, etc., and designs and implements a movie classification system based on SVM algorithm. In addition, the following work has been done: i) In the process of sample selection and processing, all the sample data used in the experiment come from the film profile information of Douban Film Network. In order to facilitate data acquisition and formatting, the function of automatically crawling the film profile web page is also implemented in the experiment. ii) By combining document frequency with word frequency, text feature selection can effectively avoid the disadvantage of "low word frequency first" caused by using document frequency alone. The experimental results show that the size of word frequency also has a certain influence on the classification results when feature selection is carried out. iii) In the parameter optimization stage of SVM, the principle of using kernel function and the influence of the classification model trained by observing different parameter values on the classification results are analyzed. The crosschecking method based on grid search is used to find the relatively optimal parameters. The results proves that SVM is capable for movie classification with relatively high F-Score. The performance evaluation indicates that non-linear kernel such as RBF cannot outperform linear kernel when dealing with large amount of features.},

abstract = {Sound event detection SED methods are tasked with labeling segments of audio recordings by the presence of active sound sources. SED is typically posed as a supervised machine learning problem, requiring strong annotations for the presence or absence of each sound source at every time instant within the recording. However, strong annotations of this type are both labor- and cost-intensive for human annotators to produce, which limits the practical scalability of SED methods. In this paper, we treat SED as a multiple instance learning MIL problem, where training labels are static over a short excerpt, indicating the presence or absence of sound sources but not their temporal locality. The models, however, must still produce temporally dynamic predictions, which must be aggregated pooled when comparing against static labels during training. To facilitate this aggregation, we develop a family of adaptive pooling operators—referred to as autopool—which smoothly interpolate between common pooling operators, such as min-, max-, or average-pooling, and automatically adapt to the characteristics of the sound sources in question. We evaluate the proposed pooling operators on three datasets, and demonstrate that in each case, the proposed methods outperform nonadaptive pooling operators for static prediction, and nearly match the performance of models trained with strong, dynamic annotations. The proposed method is evaluated in conjunction with convolutional neural networks, but can be readily applied to any differentiable model for time-series label prediction. While this paper focuses on SED applications, the proposed methods are general, and could be applied widely to MIL problems in any domain.},

abstract = {A new generation of cyber-physical systems has emerged with a large number of devices that continuously generate and consume massive amounts of data in a distributed and mobile manner. Accurate and near real-time decisions based on such streaming data are in high demand in many areas of optimization for such systems. Edge data analytics bring processing power in the proximity of data sources, reduce the network delay for data transmission, allowlargescale distributed training, and consequently help meeting real-time requirements. Nevertheless, the multiplicity of data sources leads to multiple distributed machine learning models that may suffer from sub-optimal performance due to the inconsistency in their states. In this work, we tackle the insularity, concept drift, and connectivity issues in edge data analytics to minimize its accuracy handicap without losing its timeliness benefits. Thus, we propose an efficient model synchronization mechanism for distributed and stateful data analytics. Staleness Control for Edge Data Analytics (SCEDA) ensures the high adaptability of synchronization frequency in the face of an unpredictable environment by addressing the trade-off between the generality and timeliness of the model.},

abstract = {Mobile WiFi is a newly emerging service in recent years, which provides convenience for users to access online resources and increases revenues for operators via services such as advertisements and application promotions. However, in practice, the prohibitively high system implementation and operational costs, especially the costs of perpetual data traffic, hinder the further deployment of mobile WiFi services. In this paper, we present MIMU, a usage inference system for data traffic saving suitable for ubiquitous mobile WiFi services. We demonstrate the performance of the system via an example from the real-world nationwide edge computing mobile WiFi infrastructure. To address the impact of diverse user behaviors, we investigate the WiFi network usage from the perspective of users and devices, focusing on two unique features of mobile WiFi: user mobility regularity and access irregularity. In particular, we first design a deep learning-based two-dimension usage predictor to infer the future mobile WiFi usage with 1) a user dimension model with temporal attention addressing dominant users with heavy bus WiFi usage, and 2) a device dimension model with spatial attention addressing diverse WiFi usage and connection. Based on the results of the predictor, an application of content caching is implemented in an iterative fashion to save the data traffic. We evaluate MIMU by real-world bus WiFi system data sets of three major cities with 6,643 bus WiFi devices and 150k daily active users in total. Our results show that MIMU outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of usage inference. Moreover, we summarize the lessons learned from our large-scale bus WiFi system investigation.},

abstract = {Speeding up pattern matching for intrusion detection systems has been a growing field of research. There has been a flux of new algorithms, modifications to existing algorithms and even hardware architectures aimed at improving pattern matching performance. Establishing an accurate comparison to related work is a real challenge because researchers use different datasets and metrics to evaluate their work. The purpose of this paper is to characterize and identify realistic workloads, propose standard benchmarks, and establish common metrics to better compare work in the area of pattern matching for intrusion detection. We collect traffic traces and attack signatures from popular open source platforms. The datasets are processed, cleansed and studied, to give the researchers a better understanding of their characteristics. The final datasets along with detailed information about their origins, contents, features, statistical analysis and performance evaluation using well-known pattern-matching algorithms are available to the public. In addition, we provide a generic parser capable of parsing different intrusion detection systems rule formats and extract attack signatures. Finally, a pattern-matching engine that enables researchers to plug-and-play their new pattern matching algorithms and compare to existing algorithms using the predefined metrics.},

abstract = {Sound event detection (SED) is a task to detect sound events in an audio recording. One challenge of the SED task is that many datasets such as the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) datasets are weakly labelled. That is, there are only audio tags for each audio clip without the onset and offset times of sound events. We compare segment-wise and clip-wise training for SED that is lacking in previous works. We propose a convolutional neural network transformer (CNN-Transfomer) for audio tagging and SED, and show that CNN-Transformer performs similarly to a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). Another challenge of SED is that thresholds are required for detecting sound events. Previous works set thresholds empirically, and are not an optimal approaches. To solve this problem, we propose an automatic threshold optimization method. The first stage is to optimize the system with respect to metrics that do not depend on thresholds, such as mean average precision (mAP). The second stage is to optimize the thresholds with respect to metrics that depends on those thresholds. Our proposed automatic threshold optimization system achieves a state-of-the-art audio tagging F1 of 0.646, outperforming that without threshold optimization of 0.629, and a sound event detection F1 of 0.584, outperforming that without threshold optimization of 0.564.},

abstract = {Forecasting epidemics of dengue in the population as time series models is a challenging task for providing useful information in planning public health surveillance. While Thailand's dengue usually outbreaks in the rainy season every year, and the number of patients is increasing. Although the SARIMA model is a tool for developing an appropriate model for dengue fever outbreak prediction, the user needs to find out the optimal value for each parameter. This article aims to find an appropriate model with optimal parameter values, to predict the occurrence of dengue fever in Thailand provinces in the eastern and central regions of Thailand. Moreover, the authorities are possible to use these models for posing strategies for the prevention and control of dengue fever.Time series analysis with the SARIMA model developed on the data of dengue patients from January 2014 to December 2018, collected from the laboratory of the Bureau of Epidemiology (BoE), Ministry of Public Health Thailand. The Box-Jenkins method is applied to suit the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model to forecast dengue patients. In model performance evaluation, we plot the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The SARIMA model (1,2,2) (1,1,1)12 is the best model for the prediction. The number of dengue patients in each month can be estimated from the trend of dengue cases that occurred one, two, and twelve months in the past. The predicted value for 2019 is quite close to the observed value. The model was examined by the dengue fever, significant correlations at lag 12, 10, and 2. This article has results as an indication that the SARIMA model is a useful tool for monitoring dengue incidence. We also found that the SARIMA model can accurately show the number of dengue patients in the next year. The model can be used to plan the allocation of resources for public health services. Furthermore, these results offer innovations to prediction, surveillance, and alert the people in the eastern and regions central of Thailand via smartphone.},

The proposed models possess a nice capacity to dig up the deeply hidden information of crowd flow. Moreover, they are able to make efficient use of crowd flow data and precipitation recordings. The forecast architectures are assessed on taxi trajectory data and bike trajectory data in Chongqing with additional precipitation recordings collected from China Meteorological Data Service Center. Experiments based on two kinds of datasets demonstrate that the proposed models have a more ideal performance in comparison with other model architectures.},

The detailed, dynamic data that are collected in large quantities from sensor devices provide the basis for a variety of applications. Automatic interpretation of these evolving large data is required for timely detection of interesting events. This article develops and exemplifies two new relatives of the visual assessment of tendency (VAT) and improved visual assessment of tendency (iVAT) models, which uses cluster heat maps to visualize structure in static datasets. One new model is initialized with a static VAT/iVAT image, and then incrementally (hence inc-VAT/inc-iVAT) updates the current minimal spanning tree (MST) used by VAT with an efficient edge insertion scheme. Similarly, dec-VAT/dec-iVAT efficiently removes a node from the current VAT MST. A sequence of inc-iVAT/dec-iVAT images can be used for (visual) anomaly detection in evolving data streams and for sliding window based cluster assessment for time series data. The method is illustrated with four real datasets (three of them being smart city IoT data). The evaluation demonstrates the algorithms’ ability to successfully isolate anomalies and visualize changing cluster structure in the streaming data.},

abstract = { Urban flow prediction benefits smart cities in many aspects, such as traffic management and risk assessment. However, a critical prerequisite for these benefits is having fine-grained knowledge of the city. Thus, unlike previous works that are limited to coarse-grained data, we extend the horizon of urban flow prediction to fine granularity which raises specific challenges: 1) the predominance of inter-grid transitions observed in fine-grained data makes it more complicated to capture the spatial dependencies among grid cells at a global scale; 2) it is very challenging to learn the impact of external factors (e.g., weather) on a large number of grid cells separately. To address these two challenges, we present a Spatio-Temporal Relation Network (STRN) to predict fine-grained urban flows. First, a backbone network is used to learn high-level representations for each cell. Second, we present a Global Relation Module (GloNet) that captures global spatial dependencies much more efficiently compared to existing methods. Third, we design a Meta Learner that takes external factors and land functions (e.g., POI density) as inputs to produce meta knowledge and boost model performances. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The results show that STRN reduces the errors by 7.1% to 11.5% compared to the state-of-the-art method while using much fewer parameters. Moreover, a cloud-based system called UrbanFlow 3.0 has been deployed to show the practicality of our approach. },

abstract = {Pay as you drive (PAYD) can help release the injustice and inefficiency of traditional vehicle insurance models. Based on the analysis of users driving behavior data, we propose a deep ensemble learning based PAYD method with multi-dimensional factors. This method first divides all relevant factors into five dimensions. Then the model we proposed can deal with each dimension of the factors separately and improve the efficiency of the model. At the same time, in order to analysis each dimension, we use DNNRegressor to build weak classifiers in each dimension. Then the output of the weak classifiers are put into the final DNNRegressor to produce final output. Finally, we conducted experiments on real-world data to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods.},

abstract = {Malware attacks are widespread in an era of growing technology by targeting most computing resources. Plenty of the technology nowadays is based on digital data exchange and it leads to the Internet of Things (IoT) development. A massive growth of IoT technology attracts attackers' interest in exploiting a number of IoT devices using a variety of attacks. Consequently, this has caused difficulty to the researcher in distinguishing a characteristic of such variant specifically for IoT botnet-based attack. Current approaches are weak in recognizing such behavior by analyzing registry information more accurately due to the fact that the attack pattern usually hard to construct. Hence, in this paper, selected features of suspicious registry information that's been affected by IoT botnet action i.e. Mirai is further analyzed using the graph-theoretical approach. Using a dependency graph, the similar and dissimilar pattern of distinct botnet composed to facilitate the process of malware variant characteristic identification. As a result of doing this, a precise attack pattern can be constructed and could be considered for future botnet prediction. A series of experiments conducted as a proof-of-concept in order to assess and validate the formed attack pattern. The findings have shown that the proposed prediction model could overcome the issues of undetectable IoT botnet behavior. From this forward, this model could be used to obtain accurate detection results for any variant of malware.},

abstract = {Emerging smart cities are typically equipped with thousands of outdoor cameras. However, these cameras are typically not calibrated, i.e., information such as their precise mounting height and orientation is not available. Calibrating these cameras allows measurement of real-world distances from the video, thereby, enabling a wide range of novel applications such as identifying speeding vehicles, city road planning, etc. Unfortunately, robust camera calibration is a manual process today and is not scalable.In this paper, we propose AutoCalib, a system for scalable, automatic calibration of traffic cameras. AutoCalib exploits deep learning to extract selected key-point features from car images in the video and uses a novel filtering and aggregation algorithm to automatically produce a robust estimate of the camera calibration parameters from just hundreds of samples. We have implemented AutoCalib as a service on Azure that takes in a video segment and outputs the camera calibration parameters. Using video from real-world traffic cameras, we show that AutoCalib is able to estimate real-world distances with an error of less than 12%.},

abstract = {This paper presents ArmTroi, a wearable system for understanding and analyzing the detailed arm motions of people primarily by using the motion sensors from wrist-worn wearable devices. ArmTroi can achieve real-time 3D arm skeleton tracking and reliable gesture inference tolerant to missing wearable sensors for enabling numerous useful application designs. We have coped with two major challenges through ArmTroi. First, the skeleton of each arm is determined from the locations of the elbow and wrist, whereas a wearable device only senses a single point from the wrist. We find that the potential solution space is huge. This underconstrained nature fundamentally challenges the achievement of accurate and real-time arm skeleton tracking. Second, wearable sensors may not reliably provide sensory data. For example, devices are not worn by the user, yet the learning tools for gesture inference, such as deep learning, typically have static network structures, which require nontrivial network adaptation to match the input's varying availability and ensure reliable gesture inference. We propose effective techniques to address above challenges, and all computations can be conducted on the user's smartphone. ArmTroi is thus a fully lightweight and portable system. We develop a prototype and extensive evaluation shows the efficacy of the ArmTroi design.},

abstract = {In light of the rapid progress in building smart cities and smart traffic systems, the need for an accurate and real-time counting vehicles system has become a very urgent need. Finding a robust and accurate counting system is a challenge, as the system must detect, classify and track multi vehicles in complex and dynamic scene situations, different models and classes, and various traffic densities. Several hardware and software systems have emerged for this purpose and their results have varied. In recent years, and due to the great growth in computational capacities and deep learning techniques, deep learning based vehicle counting systems have delivered an impressive performance at low costs. In this study, several state-of-the-art detection and tracking algorithms are studied and combined with each other to render different models. These models are applied in automatic vehicle counting frameworks in traffic videos to assess how accurate are their results against the ground truth. Experiments on these models present the existing challenges that hinder their ability to extract the distinctive object features and thus undermine their efficiency such as problems of occlusion, large scale objects detection, illumination, and various weather conditions. The study revealed that the detectors coupled with the Deep Sort tracker, such as YOLOv4, Detectron2 and CenterNet, achieved the best results compared to the rest of the models.},

abstract = {We present in this paper a wireless acoustic sensor network (WASN) that recognizes a set of sound events or classes from urban environments. The nodes of the WASN are Raspberry Pi devices that not only record the ambient sound, but they also process and recognize a sound event by means of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). To our knowledge, this is the first WASN running a CNN classifier over low-cost devices. Moreover, the network has been designed according to the open standard FIWARE, so the whole system can be replicated without the need of proprietary software or specific hardware. Although our low-cost WASN achieves similar accuracy compared to other WASNs that perform the classification through cloud or edge computing, our problem is the high computation load required by deep learning algorithms, even in testing mode. Moreover, the WASNs are designed to be constantly monitoring the ambient, which in our case means constantly classifying the "background sound''. We propose here to introduce a pre-detection stage prior to the CNN classification in order to save power consumption. In our case, the WASN is placed in a big avenue where the "background sound'' event is the usual traffic noise, and we want to detect other sound events as horns, sirens or very loud sounds. We have designed a pre-detection stage that activates the classifier only when an event different from traffic is likely occurring. For this purpose, two parameters based on the sound pressure level are computed and compared with two corresponding thresholds. Experimental results have been carried out with the proposed WASN in the city of Valencia, achieving a six-times reduction of the Raspberry Pi CPU's usage due to the pre-detection stage.},

abstract = {With the rise of the IoT, there has been a growing demand for people counting and occupancy estimation in Intelligent buildings for adapting their heating, ventilation and cooling systems. This can have a significant impact on energy consumption at a global scale as such systems consume about 40% of electricity and create about 36% of the CO2 emissions in Europe. Previous approaches to occupancy estimation either utilize methods that do not ensure people's privacy when obtaining high accuracy estimations, such as RGB cameras, or utilize thermal or radar sensors with lower accuracy. Thermal vision for people detection has several advantages. It protects people's privacy while being less affected by changes in the environment. In addition, most of the previous image processing approaches rely on streaming the data to the cloud to be analyzed. However, with the development of the more distributed network paradigms edge and fog computing, there has been a trend in moving computation towards the edge of the network. This process of embedding intelligence into end-devices enables more efficient energy consumption and network load distribution. In this work, we present an embedded algorithm for room occupancy estimation based on a thermal sensor with accuracy over the state-of-the-art. We study the performance of a variety of deep learning models on different embedded processors. We achieve a prediction accuracy of 98.9% for people counting estimation with minimal 2 KB RAM utilization. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has very low latency achieving execution times under 14 ms.},

In this paper, we propose a novel method for human activity recognition from a collection of outdoor mobility traces acquired through wearable devices. Our method exploits the regularities naturally present in human mobility patterns to construct syntactic models in the form of finite state automata, thanks to an approach known as grammatical inference. We also introduce a measure of similarity that accounts for the intrinsic hierarchical nature of such models, and allows to identify the common traits in the paths induced by different activities at various granularity levels. Our method has been validated on a dataset of real traces representing movements of users in a large metropolitan area. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our similarity measure to correctly identify a set of common coarse-grained activities, as well as their refinement at a finer level of granularity.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm holds significant promises for remote health monitoring systems. Due to their life- or mission-critical nature, these systems need to provide a high level of availability and accuracy. On the one hand, centralized cloud-based IoT systems lack reliability, punctuality and availability (e.g., in case of slow or unreliable Internet connection), and on the other hand, fully outsourcing data analytics to the edge of the network can result in diminished level of accuracy and adaptability due to the limited computational capacity in edge nodes. In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing a hierarchical computing architecture, HiCH, for IoT-based health monitoring systems. The core components of the proposed system are 1) a novel computing architecture suitable for hierarchical partitioning and execution of machine learning based data analytics, 2) a closed-loop management technique capable of autonomous system adjustments with respect to patient’s condition. HiCH benefits from the features offered by both fog and cloud computing and introduces a tailored management methodology for healthcare IoT systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of HiCH via a comprehensive performance assessment and evaluation on a continuous remote health monitoring case study focusing on arrhythmia detection for patients suffering from CardioVascular Diseases (CVDs).},

Crowd management includes modelling the movements of a crowd to project effective mechanisms that support quick emersion from a dangerous and fatal situation. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, machine learning techniques and communication methods can be used to sense the crowd density and offer early detection of such events or even better prediction of potential accidents to inform the management authorities. Different machine learning methods have been applied for crowd management; however, the rapid advancement in deep hierarchal models that learns from a continuous stream of data has not been fully investigated in this context e.g. Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) has shown good potential for application domains that require online learning and modelling temporal information. In this paper, we propose a new HTM framework for crowd management. The proposed framework aims to detect anomalies in crowd movements and to predict potential overcrowding.},

abstract = {With the development of low-cost, low-power sensing and communication technologies, there has been growing interest in the IoT for realizing smart cities, in order to maximize the productivity and reliability of urban infrastructure. One of the most representative examples is smart parking system, which consists of parking sensors and backend servers. In existing systems, parking sensors are placed in each parking spot to monitor the status of the parking spot, and then the sensing data is send to backend servers for further processing. Based on these sensor data, the smart parking system can provide some smart services, such as parking spot availability prediction, remote booking and parking guidance. The premise of all these smart services is that the sensor data is accurate and reliable. However, as the sensor ages, the sensor may produce some unreliable data, which brings great challenges to our smart services. In this paper, we present a novel anomaly detection and calibration system in "Suzhou Center", one of the largest most advanced urban complexes in China. Our system uses supervised machine learning algorithms, focusing on capturing spatio-temporal features. The experimental results show that our system can identify most anomalies and improve the accuracy of the sensor.},

abstract = {Software embedded in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) usually has a large life-cycle and is continuously evolving. The increasing expansion of IoT and CPSs has highlighted the need for additional mechanisms for remote deployment and updating of this software, to ensure its correct behaviour. Performance problems require special attention, as they may appear in operation due to limitations in lab testing and environmental conditions.In this context, we propose a microservice-based method to detect performance problems in CPSs. These microservices will be deployed in installation to detect performance problems in run-time when new software versions are deployed. The problem detection is based on Machine Learning algorithms, which predict the performance of a new software release based on knowledge from previous releases. This permits taking corrective actions so that system reliability is guaranteed.},

abstract = {Bioimage classification is increasingly becoming more important in many biological studies including those that require accurate cell phenotype recognition, subcellular localization, and histopathological classification. In this paper, we present a new General Purpose GenP bioimage classification method that can be applied to a large range of classification problems. The GenP system we propose is an ensemble that combines multiple texture features both handcrafted and learned descriptors for superior and generalizable discriminative power. Our ensemble obtains a boosting of performance by combining local features, dense sampling features, and deep learning features. Each descriptor is used to train a different Support Vector Machine that is then combined by sum rule. We evaluate our method on a diverse set of bioimage classification tasks each represented by a benchmark database, including some of those available in the IICBU 2008 database. Each bioimage classification task represents a typical subcellular, cellular, and tissue level classification problem. Our evaluation on these datasets demonstrates that the proposed GenP bioimage ensemble obtains state-of-the-art performance without any ad-hoc dataset tuning of the parameters thereby avoiding any risk of overfitting/overtraining. To reproduce the experiments reported in this paper, the MATLAB code of all the descriptors is available at https://github.com/LorisNanni and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bguw035yrqz0pwp/ElencoCode.docx?dl=0.},

abstract = {We propose a novel framework for predicting the paths of vehicles that move on a road network. The framework leverages global and local patterns in spatio-temporal data. From a large corpus of GPS trajectories, we predict the subsequent path of an in-progress vehicle trajectory using only spatio-temporal features from the data. Our framework consists of three components: (1) a component that abstracts GPS location data into a graph at the neighborhood or street level, (2) a component that generates policies obtained from the graph data, and (3) a component that predicts the subsequent path of an in-progress trajectory. Hierarchical clustering is used to construct the city graph, where the clusters facilitate a compact representation of the trajectory data to make processing large data sets tractable and efficient. We propose four alternative policy generation algorithms: a frequency-based algorithm (FreqCount), a correlation-based algorithm (EigenStrat), a spectral clusteringbased algorithm (LapStrat), and a Markov Chain-based algorithm (MCStrat). The algorithms explore either global patterns (FreqCount and EigenStrat) or local patterns (MCStrat) in the data, with the exception of LapStrat which explores both. We present an analysis of the performance of the alternative prediction algorithms using a large real-world taxi data set.},
