abstract = {Impacts of human civilization on ecosystems threaten global biodiversity. In a changing environment, traditional in situ approaches to biodiversity monitoring have made significant steps forward to quantify and evaluate BD at many scales but still, these methods are limited to comparatively small areas. Earth observation (EO) techniques may provide a solution to overcome this shortcoming by measuring entities of interest at different spatial and temporal scales. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the role of EO to detect, describe, explain, predict and assess biodiversity. Here, we focus on three main aspects related to biodiversity − taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and structural diversity, which integrate different levels of organization − molecular, genetic, individual, species, populations, communities, biomes, ecosystems and landscapes. In particular, we discuss the recording of taxonomic elements of biodiversity through the identification of animal and plant species. We highlight the importance of the spectral traits (ST) and spectral trait variations (STV) concept for EO-based biodiversity research. Furthermore we provide examples of spectral traits/spectral trait variations used in EO applications for quantifying taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and structural diversity. We discuss the use of EO to monitor biodiversity and habitat quality using different remote-sensing techniques. Finally, we suggest specifically important steps for a better integration of EO in biodiversity research. EO methods represent an affordable, repeatable and comparable method for measuring, describing, explaining and modelling taxonomic, functional and structural diversity. Upcoming sensor developments will provide opportunities to quantify spectral traits, currently not detectable with EO, and will surely help to describe biodiversity in more detail. Therefore, new concepts are needed to tightly integrate EO sensor networks with the identification of biodiversity. This will mean taking completely new directions in the future to link complex, large data, different approaches and models.}

The range of the natural hazards and the way the latter affect the natural and manmade environments make the selection of the appropriate data types and analyses a challenging mission. Therefore, it is important that we understand the effects of each phenomenon as well as the potential relations between them, both in the temporal and spatial dimension.

Those which are of global interest and which occur more frequently during the last decades as a result of climate change are wild fires, flash floods in the urban and rural environments, landslides, tsunamis and soil erosion. Last but not least, the occurrence of volcanic activity, especially those in close proximity to urban areas, and heatwaves in the urban environment, are also mentioned.}

Of these, only levels 0 and 1 are routinely undertaken at present. To highlight a diverse range of contexts relevant to the aquatic ecosystem modelling community, we present several case studies of improved validation approaches using the level 0–3 assessment hierarchy.

Specifically, the focus is on the selection of the sensor locations which minimizes the estimation error at a fusion center, and to optimally allocate power and bandwidth for each selected sensor subject to a prescribed spectral and energy budget. To do so, measurement accuracy, communication link quality, and the amount of energy harvested are all taken into account. The sensor selection is studied under both analog and digital transmission schemes from the selected sensors to the fusion center. In the digital transmission case, an information theoretic approach is used to model the transmission rate, observation quantization, and encoding. We numerically prove that with a sufficient system bandwidth, the digital system outperforms the analog system with a possibly different sensor selection. The design problem of interest is a Boolean non convex optimization problem, which is solved by relaxing the Boolean constraints. To efficiently round the obtained relaxed solution, we propose a randomized rounding algorithm which generalizes the existing algorithm.}

abstract = {In wireless networks, the peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm has been extensively used for information sharing due to the similarities of both networks. Both P2P and wireless networks are decentralized and designed to cope with node and link failures. As a consequence of this synergy, P2P services are employed for file sharing, resource discovery, instant messaging and online collaboration services in wireless environments. Unstructured P2P protocols are the most commonly used protocol in dynamic wireless networks, due to their high degree of tolerance to failure and support of more sophisticated query mechanisms. It has been demonstrated that the performance of P2P protocols depends heavily on the deployment. Thus, the parameters of the protocol must be tuned to maximize performance. This article proposes a controller that adjusts the load of the P2P application in real-time by tuning the “number of neighbors” of unstructured P2P protocols. This adaptation avoids the saturation of the network, allowing more messages to be delivered and reducing the transmission delay at the MAC layer. Simulations for a Gnutella-like protocol show that, on each deployment, the controller-based network presents a hit rate and response time comparable to the best manual configuration while presenting an acceptable energy consumption and fairness.}

These requirements are stated in a multi-objective optimization problem to find the most suitable controller parameters. Nevertheless, these parameters are tough to find because of the conflicting control performance requirements (i.e., a requirement cannot be met without harming the others). Hence, the use of techniques from computational intelligence and soft computing is necessary to solve multi-objective problems and handle the trade-offs among control performance objectives. Meta-heuristics have shown to obtain outstanding results when solving complex multi-objective problems at a reasonable computational cost.

To improve A/C safety and autonomy, the early detection of unexpected events is of primary importance for handling the Flight Control System and providing enhanced cueing of the envelope limits to the pilot. The approach proposed for achieving this on-line monitoring relies on a real time parameter identification technique. Owing to its robustness to measurement noises, an output error method in the frequency domain is developed to estimate the stability/control derivatives of a linearized state-space model. The process includes also pre and post-processing stages, to prevent from and to filter out inaccurate estimations. Evaluation results involve actuator Fault Detection, Isolation and Estimation as well as icing detection, and are compared to a time domain batch algorithm used as a reference method.}

They formulate the problem as one of constrained optimization in the velocity space of the robot. The constraints include the obstacles in the environment assuming they are static. In this paper, we present an efficient, real-time method (BCM-DO) to include the restrictions imposed by dynamic objects. The optimization function has also been adapted to include these new restrictions. The new function is evaluated in two sets of points. A first set is obtained from a coarse sampling in the reachable window of velocities and a second set is selected in the limits of each curvature interval to avoid missing small openings between static objects. The whole system has first been extensively tested in several simulated robots and finally applied to a hotel assistant robot (BellBot) resulting in an efficient, real-time obstacle avoidance method that produces smooth and reliable routes.}

However, many existing methods regularize all rank components equally, and shrink with the same threshold. In addition, these methods ignore the discriminative and structured information among tasks during the tracking. In this paper, we propose an online discriminative multi-task tracker with structured and weighted low rank regularization (ODMT-SL). Specifically, the total tracking task is accomplished by the combination of multiple subtasks, and each subtask corresponds to the trace of the image patch from the tracked object. In order to improve the flexibility of multi-task tracker, the weighted nuclear norm is introduced to adaptively assign different tracking importance on different rank components of multiple tasks. The geometric structure relationship among and inside candidates (or training samples) are mined to learn the collaborate representation, according to the discriminative subspace and optimal classifier. They are simultaneously learned and updated by minimizing the developed tracking model. The best candidate is selected by jointly evaluating the normalized metric. The proposed tracker is empirically compared with the state-of-the-art trackers on a large set of public video sequences. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of effectiveness, accuracy and robustness.}

In such applications, robots must establish collaborative interactions so to achieve their individual and collective goals and a key problem is for robots to make individual decisions so to optimize a system wide objective function. This problem is typically referred to as coordination. In this paper, we first describe modern optimization techniques for coordination in multiRobot systems. Specifically, we focus on approaches that are based on algorithms widely used to solve graphical models and constraint optimization problems, such as the max-sum algorithm. We then analyze the coordination problem faced by a set of robots operating in a warehouse logistic application. In this context robots must transport items from loading to unloading bays so to complete packages to be delivered to customers. Robots must cooperate to maximize the number of packages completed in the unit of time. To this end a crucial component is to avoid interferences when moving in the environment. We show how such problem can be formalized as a Distributed Constrained Optimization problem and we provide a solution based on the binary max-sum algorithm. Finally, we provide a quantitative evaluation of our approach in a simulated scenario using standard robotics tools (ROS and Gazebo).}

Firstly, the homotopy singular perturbation method (HSPM) is proposed to simplify the fractional order nonlinear model, to reduce the long memory attribute, and to decrease the mechanical stress. This method is a composition of fractional order singular perturbation method (SPM) and modification of the homotopy perturbation method (HPM). Using this method, the nonlinear fractional order DFIG based VSWT is separated into two lower order subsystems, including nonlinear integer order subsystem and linear fractional order subsystem. Integer order modeling is applied to have the maximum wind power extraction and to increase the trajectory tracking speed, while the fractional order modeling is exerted to reduce the mechanical loads and to ensure better tracking. Then, a sliding mode controller based on HSPM is designed and applied to the original fractional order nonlinear system. Stability of the original system is evaluated by investigating the Lyapunov stability theorem for each subsystem. The controller performance designed based on HSPM is compared to the designed controller performance for fractional order nonlinear system decomposed using fractional order SPM, integer order nonlinear system decomposed by SPM, and integer order nonlinear system without simplification. The simulation results affirm the effectiveness of the controller design based on the proposed method.}

The proposed method introduces the leader-follower structure for effective organization of the multi-agent coordination.

abstract = {A dual scheme for the compression and restoration of sequentially transmitted images over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is presented. These networks are characterized by low transmission rates, extended packet losses and limited power resources, factors that degrade the overall system performance. Especially in the cases of transmitting multimedia content, a considerable number of data packets are dropped, with a corresponding direct effect on the received image quality. For dealing with this loss of valuable information, various retransmission schemes have been proposed that act as quality of service modules. However, this approach increases energy consumption and inserts considerable time delays, due to the rise of the traffic load in the network. This article proposes a novel dual transmission scheme, targeting mainly the area of Multimedia WSNs (WMSN), that aims to decrease the overall traffic load introduced by the retransmission schemes, by performing image restoration for lost data packets, at the receiver side. The proposed novel dual scheme is based on: (a) the quad tree decomposition algorithm that is adopted for compressing the image data before transmission over the WSN, and (b) the fast image inpainting algorithm for restoring the effect of the missing data packets. The overall proposed scheme has been applied in multiple experimental studies that prove its efficacy.}

abstract = {Water-oriented forest management is an urgent need in semiarid catchments. In the case of low-biomass forests and shrublands, the magnitude, efficiency and temporal duration of thinning effects on rainfall partitioning needs further attention. This work studies the effects of juvenile thinning and shrub clearing on stemflow (Stf), throughfall (Thr) and interception (It) in two low-biomass forests (CAL: post-fire Aleppo pine saplings with 74% of basal area, BA, removed; and HU: evergreen oak coppice with 41% of BA removed), as well as the relative contribution of the event meteorology. The effects are compared with a control plot during the first 3–4 years. Stf rate (%) decreased with density and, on a tree scale, it was enhanced by the treatment only in the bigger oaks. Event Thr increased from 55 to 81% and from 68 to 86% of gross rainfall (Pg) for CAL and HU respectively after thinning, resulting in about 15% less intercepted Pg. High evaporative conditions and an open (ventilated) forest structure led to high It rates in the controls when comparing with other studies, thus making the treatments more efficient in net precipitation (Pn) gain (Pg intercepted decreased 17% or 2.3% per unit of LAI or BA removed respectively). In general, depths (mm) were mostly explained (>75%) by the rainfall characteristics of the event (e.g. amount, duration, intensity), with a limited contribution from forest structure (e.g. cover, LAI) and event meteorology (e.g. temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit). On the contrary, when expressed as rates (% of Pg), forest structure and event-meteorology gained importance (explaining 25–65%), especially in the drier site (CAL). In this site, the low gain in Pn (∼25 mm per year on average) was offset with no temporal dampening during the span of this study, as observed in the wetter site (HU), where plant growth tended to mitigate the effect of the treatment by the end of the study. The results presented here make a contribution to a better understanding of the effects of water-oriented forest management in low-biomass semiarid forests.}

A number of previous works showed significant progress on security effectiveness evaluation for MTD mechanisms. While, a lesser amount of studies considered the impact of running MTD mechanisms on system dependability metrics, exposing a critical missing on the comprehension of pros and cons of MTD mechanisms in terms of security and dependability. In this paper, we present comprehensive modelling and analysis of time-based switch-over MTD strategies complying with IP shuffling techniques deployed in a Software Defined Network (SDN) using stochastic reward net (SRN). To investigate the impact of MTD strategies along with system availability on service performance metrics, we propose performability SRN models for various switch-over MTD strategies. The modelled behaviours of the switch-over MTD strategies are based on the integration of service management policies (drop/accept) with time-based switch-over policies (zero-time, fixed-time, and variable-time waiting policies) Critical performability metrics are comprehensively evaluated, including (i) system availability, downtime minutes, and Capacity-oriented Availability (COA) of a service, (ii) service throughput, (iii) response time of a job, (iv) average utilization of a server, (v) number of lost jobs, and (vi) operational cost (power consumption and business profit loss). The analysis results reveal sophisticated operational system behaviours and the impact of MTD strategies on system performability metrics. This study can help design and plan the development and adoption of MTD strategies in practice regarding the trade-offs between security and performability assurance.}

abstract = {A reliable accuracy is essential for the application of land surface temperature (LST) products. Current satellite retrieved LSTs are mainly validated over a few homogeneous sites. However, most of the existing ground sites are located in inhomogeneous areas: thus, their spatial representativeness on satellite pixel scales is unknown. In this situation, how to evaluate the spatial representativeness of these inhomogeneous sites, quantify the influence introduced by the spatial representativeness and describe the variation of the site's spatial representativeness are critical questions for satellite LST validation. In an attempt to answer those questions, a so-called temporal variation method (TVM) is proposed for evaluating a ground site's spatial representativeness. The method defines a spatial representativeness indicator (SRI), which is the LST difference between a ground radiometer's field-of-view (FOV) and a satellite pixel, and describes a site's spatial representativeness. Based on the temporal variation of LST, the SRI time series consists of three temporal components: ∆ATC, ∆DTCF-P, and ∆USC, which describe the annual, diurnal, and instantaneous variations of SRI, respectively. Associated with the Landsat TM/ETM+ data and weather parameters, the method is implemented and tested at 16 Chinese ground sites for the validation of MODIS and AATSR LST products. Results show that the temporally continuous SRI (SRITPR) shows high correlations with the original SRI (SRIORI). The variation of SRITPR is mainly determined by changes in surface coverage (i.e. NDVI difference on the two scales) and affected by weather conditions (e.g. near-surface air temperature, accumulative downward solar radiation, and wind speed). Since the SRI is defined as the LST difference between the two scales, it can be used as a bridge to convert the in-situ LST to pixel scale to address the spatial scale mismatch in LST validation. With this idea, the in-situ LST at daytime was converted to pixel scale associated with the SRITPR, and the corresponding MODIS and AATSR LST were validated at the 16 ground sites. Results for MODIS and AATSR LST show that the effect of spatial representativeness on the validation results over the sites is large, with mean biases between −1.95 K and 5.60 K and standard deviations between 0.07 K and 3.72 K. Since the TVM method does not rely on a specific satellite or land surface product, it is readily applied to other LST products (e.g. Sentinel-3 SLSTR LST, NOAA VIIRS LST) and surface parameters (e.g. surface longwave radiation).}

abstract = {Satellite altimetry is an important tool for monitoring water levels over oceans and inland water bodies, particularly over poorly gauged or ungauged areas. This study uses satellite altimetry (Jason-2/3 and Envisat) to derive water levels of the Great Brahmaputra River (GBR) originating from the Tibetan Plateau. Although the width of the river channels of the Lower Brahmaputra River (LBR) is ~1 km, the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) (which is part of the Yarlung Zangbo River of China) and the Middle Brahmaputra River (MBR) located in high-mountain regions have river widths that are generally less than 400 m. This poses considerable challenges for existing retracking algorithms to obtain accurately retrieved water levels. In this study, an improved approach for deriving water levels in high-mountain regions with complex terrain is proposed, comprising (1) an improved footprint selection and (2) an improved waveform retracking, called the 50% Threshold and Ice-1 Combined algorithm (TIC). It was applied to river channels of varying widths, ranging from 200 m in the UBR to more than 1 km in the LBR. Results show an increase in both the accuracy and sampling of water levels. Most of the derived water levels at 13 virtual stations (VSs) along the GBR agree reasonably well with gauged water levels (for VSs in the UBR) or published results (for VSs in the LBR). The standard deviation of the difference between the TIC-derived water levels and gauged data at the VSs ranges from 0.3 m to 0.8 m with the highest improvement percentage relative to the unretracked ranges reaching 80% in the UBR. In addition, the developed approach increases water level sampling by reasonably demarcating the buffer zone for footprint selection, thereby generating more water levels in the time series than the published results for VSs in the LBR. However, 3 out of the 13 virtual stations show poor performance for Envisat, primarily due to the extremely narrow river channels. Furthermore, TIC can potentially be applied to estimate water levels near ground tracks of altimetric missions, even where there is no crossover between the river and the track. It could also be applied to other altimetric missions, which would further contribute to monitoring water levels and potentially river discharge in high-mountain regions with narrow river channels.}

abstract = {While vehicular sensor networks (VSNs) have earned the stature of a mobile sensing paradigm utilizing sensors built into cars, they have limited sensing scopes since car drivers only opportunistically discover new events. Conversely, social sensing is emerging as a new sensing paradigm where measurements about the physical world are collected from humans. In contrast to VSNs, social sensing is more pervasive, but one of its key limitations lies in its inconsistent reliability stemming from the data contributed by unreliable human sensors. In this paper, we present DASC, a road Damage-Aware Social-media-driven Car sensing framework that exploits the collective power of social sensing and VSNs for reliable disaster response applications. However, integrating VSNs with social sensing introduces a new set of challenges: (i) How to leverage noisy and unreliable social signals to route the vehicles to accurate regions of interest? (ii) How to tackle the inconsistent availability (e.g., churns) caused by car drivers being rational actors? (iii) How to efficiently guide the cars to the event locations with little prior knowledge of the road damage caused by the disaster, while also handling the dynamics of the physical world and social media? The DASC framework addresses the above challenges by establishing a novel hybrid social-car sensing system that employs techniques from game theory, feedback control, and Markov Decision Process (MDP). In particular, DASC distills signals emitted from social media and discovers the road damages to effectively drive cars to target areas for verifying emergency events. We implement and evaluate DASC in a reputed vehicle simulator that can emulate real-world disaster response scenarios. The results of a real-world application demonstrate the superiority of DASC over current VSNs-based solutions in detection accuracy and efficiency.}

With these promising set of safety applications, which are the main reason why they were developed, VANETs are considered as a tremendous support for the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, several key issues remain to be solved before VANET becomes fully applicable; one of them being privacy preservation. To fulfill safety-requirements in VANETs, the vehicle needs to broadcast its status wirelessly. Consequently, any adversary can hear the broadcast messages at the aim of analyzing them, identifying, tracking and generating profile of his target. In other words, privacy of individuals may be seriously breached in VANETs if no safety measures were been taken. Using pseudonyms instead of the real identities of individuals, and changing them periodically during the communication is a promising solution for such crucial problems. There is a significant body of research work addressing this issue and a lot of researchers proposed various privacy protections basing on pseudonym change strategies. In this survey paper, we present an introduction to the privacy problem and give a recent and detailed state of the art of the different suggested pseudonym change strategies and approaches. We also propose a novel taxonomy to classify these strategies to diverse concepts.

The proposed framework makes use of a graphical representation of the world in order to build a map consisting of qualitative constraints on the geometric relationships between landmark triplets. This process allows a mobile robot to extract information about landmark positions using a set of minimal sensors in the absence of GPS. A novel measurement method based on camera imagery is presented which extends previous work from the field of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning. A Branch-and-Bound approach is taken to solve a set of non-convex feasibility problems required for generating off-line operator lookup tables and on-line measurements, which are fused into the map using an iterative graph update. A navigation approach for travel between distant landmarks is developed, using estimates of the Relative Neighborhood Graph extracted from the qualitative map in order to generate a sequence of landmark objectives based on proximity. Average and asymptotic performance of the mapping algorithm is evaluated using Monte Carlo tests on randomly generated maps, and a data-driven simulation is presented for a robot traversing the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Mars Yard while building a relational map. These results demonstrate that the system can be effectively used to build a map sufficiently complete and accurate for long-distance navigation as well as other applications.}

abstract = {As part of expanding the implementation and use of the behavioral programming (BP) approach in a variety of languages and configurations, we tackle some of the challenges associated with applying the approach in a truly distributed, decentralized manner, where different modules run on separate machines. BP supports the development of reactive applications from modules that are aligned with the desired and undesired scenarios of system behaviors as described, say, in a requirements document, in an enhancement request, or a field problem report. A key advantage of this approach is that it facilitates incremental development where loosely coupled modules are added as requirements are introduced, and meaningful prototype execution can be carried out from early stages of development. In BP, each behavioral module (called a behavior thread) takes care of a separate facet of the requirements, thus control is conceptually decentralized. However, as the underlying principles of BP call for constant synchronization of, and “consultation” with, all behavior threads, efficient implementation in a physically distributed environment is a significant challenge on the road to broader acceptance of BP as a viable new way to develop systems. We begin by describing an implementation of BP in Erlang, where the coordination protocol is implemented via message passing. We demonstrate through examples how developing distributed systems in Erlang can benefit from BP advantages of incremental development and alignment of the code modules with the requirements. Next, we propose general BP design patterns (not limited to Erlang) for using BP in distributed applications, showing how to design applications using BP without forcing full synchronization among all threads at each step of the execution. This allows modules to run at different time scales and to wait for external input without stalling the entire system. Finally, we propose ways to alter the execution mechanism of BP so that execution can progress without necessarily waiting for the synchronization of all the threads. The enhanced execution algorithm has the potential of accelerating the distributed execution of behavioral programs.}

Based on the design of an effective estimator, an altitude controller is firstly constructed to synchronously compensate for fluctuations of the main rotor thrust which might lead to crashes in a gusty environment. Afterwards, a nonlinear state feedback controller is proposed to stabilize horizontal positions of the RUAS with gust-attenuation property. Performance of the proposed control framework is evaluated using parameters of a Vario XLC helicopter and high-fidelity simulations show that the proposed controllers can effectively reduce side-effect of gusts and demonstrate performance improvement when compared with the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers.}

The infrastructural issues in the post-disaster scenario leads to the requirement of immediate dissemination of relief/rescue to the victims. This process in turn would help in reducing the fatality and hence, would be effective to minimize risks associated with a natural disaster. However, most of the time, it has been observed that there is a lack of coordination among different relief organizations in resource distribution, which begs for the need of an efficiently coordinated resource distribution model. The required model optimally serves all the affected sites with a part of the resource amount always kept in reserve in the Resource pool (RP) to cater to emergency needs. In the proposed work, a Resource Allocation Problem (RAP) has been considered for designing such an allocation model for scarce resources like food, water, clothes, medical equipment, and rescue members. The objective is to provide the intended number of resources to all the affected sites while preserving a pre-computed amount of resources in RP for utilizing in the future. The proposed RAP has been implemented for a case study using popular evolutionary techniques like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE) and two other versions of PSO, i.e., PSO_TVAC and APSO. The performances of these five techniques are evaluated considering two factors: a) the quality of optimization and b) time efficiency to reach an optimal/near optimal solution. Finally, out of the five approaches, it has been observed that PSO achieves the best allocation results with maximum convergence speed.}

Protocol convergence in weighted directed/undirected and fixed/switching networks is explored based on a Lyapunov analysis. The stability of the system and the solvability of the consensus algorithm are proved for network topologies that contain a spanning tree frequently enough over contiguous time intervals. The decision value for different topologies and for multi-rate integrator agents is investigated, and a novel approach is proposed to determine the leader subgroup of agents. Communication time-delay and chattering phenomenon in the system are assessed, and additionally some protocols with Lipschitz right-hand sides are introduced. Herein, all proposed consensus strategies use a limited-gain control input to account for the physical limitation of control actuation devices, which, in general, are subject to amplitude saturation.}

Precisely, we evaluate the promise held by the new modern low power architectures in accelerating the execution time of SLAM algorithms. Throughout this, we map and implement 4 well-known SLAM algorithms that find utility in very different robot applications and autonomous navigation, on different architectures based embedded systems. We present first a processing time evaluation of these algorithms on different CPU based architectures. Results demonstrate that FastSLAM2.0 allows a compromise between the computation time and the consistency of the localization results. The algorithm has been modified to be adapted to large environments. It is then optimized for parallel implementations on GPU and FPGA. A comparative study of the resulting implementations is given. Our results show that an embedded FPGA based SoC architecture is an interesting alternative for a SLAM algorithm implementation using the hardware–software co-design approach. Hence, the system meets performance requirements of a robot to operate in real-time constraints.}

Range-only sensors work at greater distances when compared to other commonly used sensors in aerial robotics and they are low-cost. However, the spherical shell uniform distribution inherent to range-only observations poses significant technological challenges, restricting the approaches that can be used to solve this problem. This paper presents an undelayed multi-hypothesis Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and a reduced parameterization of the state vector to improve its efficiency. The paper also proposes a new robot-to-landmark and landmark-to-landmark range-only observation model for EKF-SLAM which takes advantage of the reduced parameterization. Finally, a new scheme is proposed for updating hypothesis weights based on an independence of beacon parameters. The method is firstly validated with simulations comparing the results with other state-of-the-art methods and later validated with real experiments for 3D RO-SLAM using several radio-based range-only sensors and an aerial robot.}

abstract = {The lower shoreface provides the connection between the continental shelf and the shoreline via its onshore transition called the upper shoreface. Lower shorefaces are diverse, and range from bedrock-controlled, through sediment-starved to sediment-rich, siliciclastic, carbonate, low to high wave-energy, microtidal to macrotidal, and are variably affected by storm and wind-driven flows. The lower shoreface can be a repository for deposits of terrestrial origin, and a zone of active carbonate production. It can therefore be an important source of sediment for beaches, dunes, estuaries, and tidal basins. There has been progress in the ability to predict suspended sediment transport under non-breaking and shoaling waves across the lower shoreface. However, high-resolution measurement of sediment transport over unknown seabed configurations with unpredictable bed-level changes under hydrodynamic conditions that are unknown at the outset, and especially involving bedload transport, is still faced with significant challenges. Non-linear interactions between processes contributing to sediment transport render calculations and modelling of transport directions and magnitudes uncertain, and the spatial and temporal scales of transport are much larger than those of the upper shoreface. On the other hand, transport rates and morphological change may be much smaller on the lower shoreface compared to the upper shoreface. Another challenge is the upscaling of short-term measurements to explain the long-term morphological evolution of the lower shoreface. This limited understanding implies that current paradigms of lower shoreface dynamics based on morphological equilibrium and disequilibrium relative to the ocean-forcing conditions may be too simplistic, though possibly appropriate over long timescales (decades to millennia), and modelling work and prediction of change no more than exploratory. Over such long timescales, boundary conditions (sea level, wave climate) are likely to change. Making way forward on these issues is important for understanding the connectivity between the lower shoreface and beach recovery after major storm erosion, and for estimating coastal sediment budgets, short- to long-term coastal change and response to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. At geological timescales, the lower shoreface is a central element in tracking shoreline changes. Progress is needed in measuring sediment transport and upscaling to timescales compatible with lower shoreface change. It is also important to take advantage of on-going rapid progress in seabed and shallow stratigraphic mapping, bed-level changes, including remote-sensing approaches, for a better understanding of lower shoreface morphodynamics and sediment connectivity with the coast. This includes the now routine identification of large subaqueous bedforms, possibly ubiquitous features on the world's continental shelves, their mobility over time, and their potential link with the shoreline. The common relationship between fine sand, dissipative beaches and large aeolian dunes also poses the question of how fine sand is abundantly supplied from the lower shoreface, given the common perception that it is readily swept offshore on beaches. These multi-theme challenges need to be addressed in order to advance our understanding of the lower shoreface and its connectivity with the upper shoreface and beach.}

In the last decade, the use of distributed optimal Kalman filters (KF) to address this problem has been studied extensively. In this paper, we propose to use a very simple encounter based averaging process (denoted by EA). The idea behind EA is the following: every time two robots meet, they simply average their location estimates. We assume that two robots meet whenever they are close enough to allow relative location estimation and communication. At each meeting event, the robots average their location estimations thus reducing the localization error. Naturally, the frequency of the meetings affects the localization quality. The meetings are determined by the robots’ movement pattern. In this work we consider movement patterns which are “well mixing”, i.e. every robot meets other robots and eventually all of the robots frequently. For such a movement pattern, the time course of the expected localization error is derived. We prove that EA is asymptotically optimal and requires significantly less computation and communication resources than KF.}

This trailing edge noise is emitted from aircraft wings, turbomachinery blades, wind turbine blades, helicopter blades, etc. Being dominant at high frequencies, this trailing-edge noise is a key element that annoys human hearing. This article covers virtually the entire landscape of modern research into trailing-edge noise including theoretical developments, numerical simulations, wind tunnel experiments, and applications of trailing-edge noise. The theoretical approach includes Green’s function formulations, Wiener–Hopf methods that solve the mixed boundary-value problem, Howe’s and Amiet’s models that relate the wall pressure spectrum to acoustic radiation. Recent analytical developments for poroelasticity and serrations are also included. We discuss a hierarchy of numerical approaches that range from semi-empirical schemes that estimate the wall pressure spectrum using mean-flow and turbulence statistics to high-fidelity unsteady flow simulations such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) that resolve the sound generation and scattering process based on the first-principles flow physics. Wind tunnel experimental research that provided benchmark data for numerical simulations and unravel flow physics is reviewed. In each theoretical, numerical, and experimental approach, noise control methods for mitigating trailing-edge noise are discussed. Finally, highlights of practical applications of trailing-edge noise prediction and reduction to wind turbine noise, fan noise, and rotorcraft noise are given. The current challenges in each approach are summarized with a look toward the future developments.

abstract = {In an era of significant air traffic expansion characterized by a rising congestion of the radiofrequency spectrum and a widespread introduction of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are being exposed to a variety of threats including signal interferences, adverse propagation effects and challenging platform-satellite relative dynamics. Thus, there is a need to characterize GNSS signal degradations and assess the effects of interfering sources on the performance of avionics GNSS receivers and augmentation systems used for an increasing number of mission-essential and safety-critical aviation tasks (e.g., experimental flight testing, flight inspection/certification of ground-based radio navigation aids, wide area navigation and precision approach). GNSS signal deteriorations typically occur due to antenna obscuration caused by natural and man-made obstructions present in the environment (e.g., elevated terrain and tall buildings when flying at low altitude) or by the aircraft itself during manoeuvring (e.g., aircraft wings and empennage masking the on-board GNSS antenna), ionospheric scintillation, Doppler shift, multipath, jamming and spurious satellite transmissions. Anyone of these phenomena can result in partial to total loss of tracking and possible tracking errors, depending on the severity of the effect and the receiver characteristics. After designing GNSS performance threats, the various augmentation strategies adopted in the Communication, Navigation, Surveillance/Air Traffic Management and Avionics (CNS + A) context are addressed in detail. GNSS augmentation can take many forms but all strategies share the same fundamental principle of providing supplementary information whose objective is improving the performance and/or trustworthiness of the system. Hence it is of paramount importance to consider the synergies offered by different augmentation strategies including Space Based Augmentation System (SBAS), Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS), Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS) and Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). Furthermore, by employing multi-GNSS constellations and multi-sensor data fusion techniques, improvements in availability and continuity can be obtained. SBAS is designed to improve GNSS system integrity and accuracy for aircraft navigation and landing, while an alternative approach to GNSS augmentation is to transmit integrity and differential correction messages from ground-based augmentation systems (GBAS). In addition to existing space and ground based augmentation systems, GNSS augmentation may take the form of additional information being provided by other on-board avionics systems, such as in ABAS. As these on-board systems normally operate via separate principles than GNSS, they are not subject to the same sources of error or interference. Using suitable data link and data processing technologies on the ground, a certified ABAS capability could be a core element of a future GNSS Space-Ground-Aircraft Augmentation Network (SGAAN). Although current augmentation systems can provide significant improvement of GNSS navigation performance, a properly designed and flight-certified SGAAN could play a key role in trusted autonomous system and cyber-physical system applications such as UAS Sense-and-Avoid (SAA).}

Platooning brings advantages such as lower fuel consumption and better traffic efficiency, which are maximized when the inter-vehicle spacing can be steadily maintained at a feasible minimum. This can be achieved with Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control, an automated cruise controller that relies on the complex interplay among V2V communications, on-board sensing, and actuation. This work provides a clear mapping between the performance of the V2V communications, which is measured in terms of latency and reliability, and of the platoon, which is measured in terms of achievable inter-truck spacing. Two families of radio technologies are compared: IEEE 802.11p and 3GPP Cellular-V2X (C-V2X). The C-V2X technology considered in this work is based on the Release 14 of the LTE standard, which includes two modes for V2V communications: Mode 3 (base-station-scheduled) and Mode 4 (autonomously-scheduled). Results show that C-V2X in both modes allows for shorter inter-truck distances than IEEE 802.11p due to more reliable communications performance under increasing congestion on the wireless channel caused by surrounding vehicles.}

Thus, supported by Circular Economy, Agriculture, Industry 4.0 literature and expert opinions, agricultural supply chain challenges are modelled and analysed using ISM methodology to help uncover 12 agricultural challenges which ultimately impede goods moving within the supply chain.

Although extensive research has been performed on the optimisation of aircraft trajectories and very efficient algorithms were widely adopted for the optimisation of vertical flight profiles, it is only in the last few years that higher levels of automation were proposed for integrated flight planning and re-routing functionalities of innovative Communication Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Avionics (CNS+A) systems. In this context, the implementation of additional environmental targets and of multiple operational constraints introduces the need to efficiently deal with multiple objectives as part of the trajectory optimisation algorithm. This article provides a comprehensive review of Multi-Objective Trajectory Optimisation (MOTO) techniques for transport aircraft flight operations, with a special focus on the recent advances introduced in the CNS+A research context. In the first section, a brief introduction is given, together with an overview of the main international research initiatives where this topic has been studied, and the problem statement is provided. The second section introduces the mathematical formulation and the third section reviews the numerical solution techniques, including discretisation and optimisation methods for the specific problem formulated. The fourth section summarises the strategies to articulate the preferences and to select optimal trajectories when multiple conflicting objectives are introduced. The fifth section introduces a number of models defining the optimality criteria and constraints typically adopted in MOTO studies, including fuel consumption, air pollutant and noise emissions, operational costs, condensation trails, airspace and airport operations. A brief overview of atmospheric and weather modelling is also included. Key equations describing the optimality criteria are presented, with a focus on the latest advancements in the respective application areas.

In order to address this issue, and to increase the accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the health-care domain, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) was proposed. IoMT can be considered as an enhancement and investment to respond more effectively and efficiently to patients’ needs. However, IoMT suffers from different issues and challenges such as the lack of security and privacy measures, in addition to the necessary training and awareness. In this paper, we highlight the importance of implementing the right security measures and the required training skills, in order to enhance the immunity of IoMT against cyber-attacks. Moreover, we review the main IoMT security and privacy issues, and the existing security solutions. These solutions are classified as cryptographic or non-cryptographic. Then, the different solutions are analyzed and compared in terms of computational complexity and required resources. It is important to note that the security measures for IoMT exhibit a trade-off between the security level and the system performance, especially in the rise of digital healthcare v4.0 era. Next, we discuss the appropriate security solutions such as lightweight cryptographic algorithms, and protocols that attempt to reduce the overhead in terms of computations and resources. This leads to the conclusion that there is a need to design an efficient intrusion detection/prevention system that cooperates with dynamic shadow honeypots. Finally, we propose a security solution, which is divided into five different layers to detect and prevent attacks, in addition to reducing/correcting the damage of these known attacks and preserving the patients’ privacy. However, it should be noted that zero-day attacks and exploits are still the main challenging issue that surrounds IoMT.}

Metallic glasses (MGs), called also bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) (or glassy metals, amorphous metals, liquid metals) are considered to be the materials of the future. Due to their high strength, metallic glasses have a number of interesting applications, for example as coatings. Metallic glasses can also be corrosion resistant. Metallic glasses, and the crystalline materials derived from them, can have very good resistance to sliding and abrasive wear. Combined with their strength – and now, toughness – this makes them ideal candidates for bio-implants or military applications. Prestigious Journals such as “Nature Materials”, “Nature” frequently publish new findings on these unusual glass materials. Moreover Chinese and Asian scientists have also been showing an interest in the study of metallic glasses. This review paper is far from exhaustive, but tries to cover the areas of interest as it follows: a short history, the local structure of BMGs and the glass forming ability (GFA), BMGs’ properties, the manufacturing and some applications of BMGs and finally, about the future of BMGs as valuable materials.}

Moreover, a particular Nussbaum-type function is introduced to compensate for the nonlinear terms arising for actuator saturation. Within the Lyapunov framework, it is then shown that the proposed control strategy can guarantee the relative position and attitude errors converge into small regions containing the origin. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the designed control strategy.}

The presented approach exploits the locality of relations in causal probabilistic processes, which facilitates decentralized modeling and information fusion. Observed events resulting from stochastic causal processes can be modeled with the help of Bayesian networks, compact and mathematically rigorous probabilistic models. With the help of the theory of Bayesian networks and factor graphs we derive design and organization rules for modular fusion systems which implement exact belief propagation without centralized configuration and fusion control. These rules are applied in distributed perception networks (DPN), a multi-agent systems approach to distributed Bayesian information fusion. While each DPN agent has limited fusion capabilities, multiple DPN agents can autonomously collaborate to form complex modular fusion systems. Such self-organizing systems of agents can adapt to the available information sources at runtime and can infer critical hidden events through interpretation of complex patterns consisting of many heterogeneous observations.}

abstract = {This paper presents the design of an automatic deep stall recovery algorithm for large transport aircraft using optimal trajectory planning. Deep stall is a condition where an aircraft is trapped in a nose-high stall condition and its elevators cannot produce enough nose-down pitching moment to recover the aircraft from the stall. The NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM) is used as the basis for the design and verification of the system. The aerodynamic model of the NASA GTM simulation model is modified to exhibit deep stall behaviour. Simulations are performed to show that the modified aircraft model can be pushed into deep stall, and cannot be recovered using elevator actions only. The deep stall recovery task is formulated as an optimal path planning problem and solved using an A* search algorithm to find the optimal sequence of control actions and the resulting optimal state trajectory to escape from the deep stall. The A* algorithm performs the planning using a simplified, three-degrees-of-freedom (3DOF) aircraft model that models only the fast rotational dynamics. The automatic deep stall recovery is then verified in simulation using the full six-degrees-of-freedom (6DOF) NASA GTM aircraft model. The simulation results show that the system successfully recovers the aircraft from deep stall. The optimal sequence of control actions first uses the rudder to yaw the horizontal tailplane out of the aircraft’s own wake to regain elevator effectiveness, and then uses the elevators to pitch the nose down and recover from the stall.}

abstract = {Non-planned agricultural land abandonment is affecting natural hydrological processes. This is especially relevant in vulnerable arid karstic watersheds, where water resources are scarce but vital for sustaining natural ecosystems and human settlements. However, studies assessing the spatiotemporal evolution of the hydrological responses considering land-use changes and precipitation cycles for long periods are rare in karstic environments. In this research, we selected a representative karstic watershed in a Mediterranean semiarid domain, since in this belt, karst environments are prone to land degradation processes due to human impacts. Geographic Information Systems-based tools and hydrological modeling considering daily time steps were combined with temporal analysis of climate variables (wavelet analysis) to demonstrate possible interactions and vulnerable responses. Observed daily flow data were used to calibrate/validate these hydrological models by applying statistic indicators such as the NSE efficiency and a self-developed index (the ANSE index). This new index could enhance goodness-of-fit measurements obtained with traditional statistics during the model optimization. We hypothesize that this is key to adding new inputs to this research line. Our results revealed that: i) changes in the type of sclerophyllous vegetation (Quercus calliprinos, ilex, rotundifolia, suber, etc.) from 81.5% during the initial stage (1990) to natural grasslands by 81.6% (2018); and, ii) decreases in agricultural areas (crops) by approximately 60% and their transformation into coniferous forests, rock outcrops, sparsely natural grasslands, etc. in the same period. Consequently, increases in the curve number (CN) rates were identified as a result of land abandonment. As a result, an increase in peak flow events jointly with a relevant decrease of the average flow rates (water scarcity) in the watershed was predicted by the HEC-HMS model and verified through the observed data. This research provides useful information about the effects of anthropogenic changes in the hydrodynamic behaviour of karstic watersheds and water resource impacts, especially key in water-scarce areas that depict important hazards for the water supply of related populations and natural ecosystems.}

Thus in order to mitigate these problems and improve the working properties, seven new versions of SSA are proposed in present work. All the new versions employ new set of mutation properties along with some common properties. The common properties of all the algorithms include division of generations, adaptive switching and adaptive population strategy. Overall, the proposed algorithms are self-adaptive in nature along with some added mutation properties. For performance evaluation, the proposed algorithms are subjected to variable initial population and dimension sizes. The best among the proposed is then tested on CEC 2005, CEC 2015 benchmark problems and real world problems from CEC 2011 benchmarks.

The key materials and novel theories are reviewed, and some personal viewpoints have been proposed, targeting providing some inductive opinions.}

abstract = {H∞/µ methods are commonly used in Airbus Defence and Space for the design and validation of control solutions. Formulated in a worst-case paradigm, these methods necessarily lead to overly conservative solutions since sized on the extreme cases. However, the acceptance for relaxed control performances requires mastering the risk associated to the detected unlikely events calling for probabilistic performances metrics in the validation process. A probabilistic µ-analysis method is presented in this paper to exhaustively explore the uncertain parametric domain while evaluating the cumulative probability density function of the performance index. Recent µ-analysis tools implemented in the ONERA’s SMAC toolbox are coupled with a dichotomic search algorithm in order to delimit the safe parametric domain while incrementing the probability of success of criteria. The proposed algorithm is applied to a didactic second order system to demonstrate the performances of the method.}

The proposed algorithm is compared to other similar algorithms and also to results from literature. The motivation of this work is to provide an alternative to the current glider mission control systems, that are based mostly on multidisciplinary human-expert teams from robotic and oceanographic areas. Initially configured as a decision-support expert system, the natural evolution of the tool is targeting higher autonomy levels. To assess the performance of the applied optimizers, the test functions for UGPP are utilized as defined in literature, which simulate real-life oceanic mission scenarios. Based on these test functions, in this paper, the performance of the proposed application of L-SHADE to UGPP is aggregated using statistical analyis. The depicted fitness convergence graphs, final obtained fitness plots, trajectories drawn, and per-scenario analysis show that the new proposed algorithm yields stable and competitive output trajectories. Over the set of benchmark missions, the newly obtained results with a configured L-SHADE outperforms existing literature results in UGPP and ranks best over the compared algorithms. Moreover, some additional previously applied algorithms have been reconfigured to yield improved performance. Thereby, this new application of evolutionary algorithms to UGPP contributes significantly to the capacity of the decision-makers, when they use the improved UGPP expert system yielding better trajectories.}

abstract = {Self-deployment of sensors with maximized coverage in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UWASNs) is challenging due to difficulty of access to 3-D underwater environments. The problem is further compounded if the connectivity of the final network is desired. One possible approach to this problem is to drop the sensors on the water surface and then move them to certain depths in the water to maximize the 3-D coverage while maintaining the initial connectivity. In this paper, we propose a fully distributed node deployment scheme for UWASNs which only requires random dropping of sensors on the water surface. The idea is based on determining the connected dominating set (CDS) of the initial network on the surface and then adjust the depths of all neighbors of a particular dominator node (i.e., the backbone of the network) for minimizing the coverage overlaps among them while still keeping the connectivity with the dominator. The process starts with a leader node and spans all the dominators in the network for repositioning them. In addition to depth adjustment, we studied the effects of possible topology alterations due to water mobility caused by several factors such as waves, winds, currents, vortices or random surface effects, on network coverage and connectivity performance. On the one hand the mobility of nodes may help the topology to get stretched in 2-D, which helps to maximize the coverage in 3-D. On the other hand the mobility may cause the network to get partitioned where some of the nodes are disconnected from the rest of the topology. We investigated the best node deployment time where 2-D coverage is maximized and the network is still connected. To simulate the mobility of the sensors, we implemented meandering current mobility model which is one of the existing mobility models for UWASNs that fits our needs. The performance of the proposed approach is validated through simulation. Simulations results indicate that connectivity can be guaranteed regardless of the transmission and sensing range ratio with a coverage very close to a coverage-aware deployment approach.}

By exploiting a parametric algebraic Riccati equation (ARE)-based low-gain feedback approach, a static state feedback control protocol and a dynamic observer-based output feedback control protocol are developed utilizing local information. It is shown that under the presented protocols, semi-global bipartite consensus tracking can be achieved if the underlying signed communication graph is structurally balanced and contains a spanning tree rooted at the leader. A numerical example is finally given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.}

Among optical techniques, Quartz-Enhanced Photoacoustic Spectroscopy (QEPAS) has been demonstrated to be a leading-edge technology for addressing multi-gas detection, thanks to the modularity, ruggedness, portability and real time operation of the QEPAS sensors. The detection module consists in a spectrophone, mounted in a vacuum-tight cell and detecting sound waves generated via photoacoustic excitation within the gas sample. As a result, the sound detection is wavelength-independent and the volume of the absorption cell is basically determined by the spectrophone dimensions, typically in the order of few cubic centimeters. In this review paper, the implementation of the QEPAS technique for multi-gas detection will be discussed for three main areas of applications: i) multi-gas trace sensing by exploiting non-interfering absorption features; ii) multi-gas detection dealing with overlapping absorption bands; iii) multi-gas detection in fluctuating backgrounds. The fundamental role of the analysis and statistical tools will be also discussed in detail in relation with the specific applications. This overview on QEPAS technique, highlighting merits and drawbacks, aims at providing ready-to-use guidelines for multi-gas detection in a wide range of applications and operating conditions.}

Particular system we have in mind comprises of agents with different mobility, energy harvesting and energy sharing capabilities herein called aPads, aFish and aMussels. aPads are surface vehicles that harvest energy and are able to transmit it to both aFishes and aMussels. aFish are underwater vehicles that can transmit energy to aMussels or to other aFish, and receive energy from aPads. aMussels, that can either be attached to the sea-ground or float on the surface, can only receive energy, either from aFish or aPads. For such a system to be able to function for an extended period of time, a decentralized energy management protocol should be designed, whose purpose is to schedule and coordinate charging of agents over time. These decisions depend on the current battery levels of different agents, as well as their positions, and should be done in a decentralized manner. In this paper we apply an energy sharing protocol based on TÆMS framework, originally applied to planning and coordination in aerial-ground robotics systems for search and rescue missions. We refine the obtained plans using the coalition-based metaheuristic for vehicle routing problems. We show execution schedules achieved using the proposed protocol and highlight its advantages and flaws when applied to our underwater scenario.}

Optical indirect methods based on the Beer-Lambert law are widely adopted in numerous fields given their high efficiency and feasibility for LAI estimation. These methods have undergone considerable progress in the past decades, thereby making them operational in ground-based LAI measurement and even in airborne estimation. However, several challenges remain, given the requirement of increasing accuracy and new applications. Clumping effect correction attained significant progress for continuous canopies with non-randomly disturbed leaves while non-continuous canopies are rarely studied. Convenient and operational measurement of leaf angle distribution and woody components is lacked. Accurate and comprehensive validations are still very difficult due to the limitations of direct measurement. The introduction of active laser scanning technology is a driving force for addressing several challenges, but its three-dimensional information has not been fully explored and utilized. In order to update the general knowledge and identify the possible error source, this study comprehensively reviews the temporal development, theoretical framework, and issues of indirect LAI measurement, followed by current methods, instruments, and platforms. Latest methods and instruments are introduced and compared to traditional ones. Current challenges, recent advances, and future perspectives are discussed to provide recommendations for further research.}

The main feature of SOFC power systems is production of less harmful chemical and acoustic emissions at a higher efficiency compared to conventional power production technologies. Microturbines have been shown amenable to integration with a high temperature fuel cell due to the well-matched temperature and pressure characteristics of an SOFC and microturbine in a hybrid system. Different configurations of hybrid SOFC-GT systems are briefly discussed. The main focus of this paper is investigation of different control strategies and transient performance characteristics of hybrid SOFC-GT systems in the literature. Different control strategies including variable and fixed speed operation of shaft using PI control methods are discussed. Different types of bypass valves for hybrid system control such as recuperator bypass are used to control the inlet temperature of the air entering the stack. In addition, SOFC bypass valves are used to control the mass flow through the SOFC stack. Different control methods are described to avoid stall/surge in the compressor. The main components of a hybrid system and their effects on the system performance are thoroughly discussed. Impacts of heat exchangers on a hybrid system are also determined and pressure losses between the recuperator and combustor for three different conditions are evaluated. Effects of different system parameters such as Steam-to-Carbon ratio (S/C), fuel utilization and operating pressures on system performance are determined. Net efficiencies of different hybrid system configurations are compared. Other applications of a hybrid system such as those that include CO2 capture and sequestration are investigated. Finally, system optimization and investigation of alternative fuels are discussed.}

HP is a wide and complex domain: systems in this domain are large (in terms of size and scope) integrated (each subsystem cannot be considered as an isolated system) and different in purpose. Such systems require a multidisciplinary approach for their design and analysis and they are necessarily required to provide data and information fusion in the most general sense. The first data fusion algorithms employed in real systems in the radar field go back to the early seventies; now a days new concepts have been developed and spread to be applied to very complex systems with the aim to achieve the highest level of intelligence as possible and hopefully to support decision. Data fusion is aimed to enhance situation awareness and decision making through the combination of information/data obtained by networks of homogeneous and/or heterogeneous sensors. The aim of this chapter is to give an overview of the several approaches that can be followed to design and analyze systems for homeland protection. Different fusion architectures can be drawn on the basis of the employed algorithms: they are analyzed under several aspects in this chapter. Real study cases applied to real world problems of homeland protection are provided in the chapter.}

Three theorems of shape formation problem with three agents are addressed by the Lagrangian multiplier method, however, the Lagrangian multiplier method difficultly solves optimal shape formation problem where the number of agents is strictly larger than 3 and the number of constraints is larger than 2. In order to tackle the continuous and discrete optimization problem, the continuous-discrete particle swarm optimization (CDPSO) algorithm is developed to search for the rotated angle of the desired shape and the matching pair between points in the initial shape and points in the desired shape. Additionally, the parameters in CDPSO algorithm are set by three theorems on convergence analysis of the random PSO algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness and the feasibility of the CDPSO algorithm on the shape formation problem, numerical results not only discuss the optimal virtual helicopters formation between two typical shapes in the three dimensional space, but also provide one searching and rescuing strategy of MH370 plane to minimize the whole moving distance of all virtual rescuing ships. Moreover, the shape conversion problem including multiple agents is also solved by the CDPSO algorithm when the number of agents is equal to 100, 200, 500 and 1000. Additionally, the optimization results and the computational time are compared among the Lagrange multiplier method, CDPSO, CDDE, CDGA, CDPSOI and CDPSOE algorithms.}

In this paper, a novel rapid-sizing procedure for the initial design phases of H-tail Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) based on the factor analysis technique is proposed. The main concept of this methodology consists in finding the latent design tendencies within the sample of study, that are represented by unobservable factors, which can be employed as specifications in a novel design procedure based on the most prominent design trends of the sample of study. The classical factor analysis procedure has been adapted to the characteristics of the aircraft conceptual design discipline, including a new criterion for the extraction of factors taking into account the desirable accuracy in this phase of design. From the findings of this analysis, a novel conceptual rapid-sizing methodology based on the main design tendencies of H-tail RPA is proposed. This methodology is then tested with a design example case and compared with the results obtained from a conventional approach based purely on regression analysis for the same aircraft in order to validate the procedure. This analysis shows that the results fall within the expected accuracy of the conceptual design phase, with the added novelty of considering the extracted design tendencies as specifications for the initial sizing of the RPA, and constituting a methodology with higher robustness than the contrasting traditional procedure due to the capacity to account simultaneously for the interrelations amongst all the variables and the ability to control a wide range of statistical indicators to augment the confidence in the results.}
