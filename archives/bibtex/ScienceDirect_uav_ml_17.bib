abstract = {Timely and accurate data regarding the distribution of paddy rice are valuable for various agricultural studies. In this study, we aimed to develop a sub-pixel method for estimating the planting fraction of paddy rice in Northeast China. This method assumes low seasonal variations in moisture in paddy rice fields compared with other upland crops due to the presence of flooding water throughout the growing season. We used the coefficient of variation (CV) of the land surface water index (LSWI) derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) to indicate the water condition. High resolution images obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were used to test this assumption and to develop the relationship between the CV of LSWI and the planting fraction of paddy rice. The results showed that the CV of LSWI could effectively indicate the planting fraction of paddy rice, where our method explained 84% of the variation in the planting fraction of paddy rice in the UAV survey sites. Validation based on the statistical data showed that this method explained 78% and 85% of the variations in the paddy rice area at the county and prefecture levels, respectively. Moreover, the performance of this method was good independent of the field survey data, and this alternative approach may facilitate mapping of the planting distribution of paddy rice over large areas.}

abstract = {Most of Flying Adhoc Networks (FANETs) applications consume GPS based location information for their services, which are also shared in real-time with other UAVs, ground control stations and centralized service operators. GPS spoofing is among the most popular attacks in FANETs that lead the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers to generate false navigation solutions. Several anti-spoofing techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, Conventional detection methods present vulnerabilities against Colluding GPS Spoofing Attack where multiple GPS spoofing signal sources are used. In this paper, we propose a policy-based distributed detection mechanism to face colluding GPS-Spoofing attack in FANETs. Based on Burglary scene and the location of each UAV at the time of the attack, we can distinguish between Active and Passive witnesses that are respectively used to help the target to detect and confirm the presence of GPS spoofing signal using respectively Absolute power and Carrier-to-Noise density ratio. A trust model based on Beta and Weibull Distribution has been adopted as a combination technique of different testimonies to both mitigate the spread of false rumors and classify the different signals. Simulation results depict that our proposal is able to detect and revoke the GPS Spoofing signal with high accuracy reaching the 99% and low communication overhead.}

However, traditional tree counting methods require expensive feature engineering, which causes additional mistake and cannot be optimized overall. Recently, deep learning based approaches have been adopted for this task which demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, a point-wise supervised segmentation network is proposed based on a deep segmentation network with only weak supervision, which can complete localization and generate mask of each tree simultaneously. In the first step, a tree feature extractor module is adopted to extract features of input images with a novel encoder–decoder network. In the second step, an effective strategy is designed to deal with different conditions with mask predictions. Finally, the basic localization and rectification guidance are introduced to train the whole network. In addition, two different datasets are created and an existing challenging plant dataset is selected to evaluate the proposed method. Experimental results on those datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in most challenging conditions. This method has great potential to reduce human labor due to effective automatic generated masks.}

abstract = {This research targets the robust routing protocols in airborne networks (ANs). Particularly, we target the AN which is equipped with the latest antenna technology, called Multi-Beam Directional Antenna (MBDA) [1]. MBDA allows the simultaneously packet delivery in multiple directions without RF interference between directions/beams. We have found that MBDAs can actually bring new opportunities to enhance a popularly used AN routing scheme, i.e., optimized link state routing protocol (OLSR). In particular, MBDAs enable OLSR to better achieve low probability of detection (LPD), a critical requirement in many military applications with adversary nodes nearby which try to eavesdrop the signals. Therefore, we propose a multi-path enhanced OLSR, which is able to exploit the advantages of multi-beam transmissions and select the proper multi-point relays (MPRs) to easily reach all nodes by using only a small number of message broadcasts. An innovative method based on social network concept is used for the selection of MPRs in multi-beam OLSR. Finally, we have conducted the simulations and showed that the enhanced OLSR is suitable for mobile and dense airborne networks with LPD requirements.}

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of wireless communications over the Terahertz-band (0.75–10 THz) at various atmospheric altitudes, considering different transmission distances and directions by realistically calculating the absorption loss, which is the major limiting factor affecting the propagation of THz waves through the earth’s atmosphere. Four practical altitudes are considered, corresponding to Drone-to-Drone (D2D), Jet plane-to-Jet plane (J2J), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-to-UAV, and near-space Satellite-to-Satellite (S2S) communications. Following comparison and validation with two real-world experimental results from the literature measured at the sea-level, Line by Line Radiative Transfer Models (LBLRTM) is used to obtain realistic THz-band transmittance values against each altitude case and setting. Subsequently, absorption loss and total path loss values are computed and mean total path loss sensitivity is further observed against a range of transmission directions via zenith angle variations from vertically-up to vertically-down communication. Numerical results show that as the altitude increases, the concentration of the water vapor molecules decreases, enabling the communication over the THz-band (0.75–10 THz) to be more feasible as compared to the sea-level communication. Moreover, the total usable bandwidth results over the THz-band (0.75–10 THz) exhibit that the upper bounds of 8.218 THz, 9.142 THz and 9.25 THz are usable up to the transmission distance of 2 km against the total antenna gains of 80 dBi for J2J, U2U and S2S communication cases, respectively.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) has made its way into everyday activities, particularly through new techniques such as machine learning (ML). These techniques are implementable with little domain knowledge. This, combined with the difficulty of testing AI systems with traditional methods, has made system trustworthiness a pressing issue.
Objective:
This paper studies the methods used to validate practical AI systems reported in the literature. Our goal is to classify and describe the methods that are used in realistic settings to ensure the dependability of AI systems.
Method:
A systematic literature review resulted in 90 papers. Systems presented in the papers were analysed based on their domain, task, complexity, and applied validation methods.
Results:
The validation methods were synthesized into a taxonomy consisting of trial, simulation, model-centred validation, and expert opinion. Failure monitors, safety channels, redundancy, voting, and input and output restrictions are methods used to continuously validate the systems after deployment.
Conclusions:
Our results clarify existing strategies applied to validation. They form a basis for the synthesization, assessment, and refinement of AI system validation in research and guidelines for validating individual systems in practice. While various validation strategies have all been relatively widely applied, only few studies report on continuous validation.}

The Sentinel-2 imagery provides an efficient and cost-effective way for the production of inventories of glaciers. Efficient conventional glacial methods can overcome the drawbacks of manual interpretation by generating glacier maps in a fast and accurate manner. However, these methods are difficult to obtain discriminative spatial-spectral features, so that it is difficult capture the subtle differences between glaciers and surrounding material on Sentinel-2 imagery. In this paper, a novel spatial-spectral attention neural network approach, which integrates a novel spatial-spectral attention module with UNet architecture, is designed for better addressing these challenges in glacier mapping. The proposed approach builds an interdependencies between spatial-spectral domains via adaptively recalibrating the weighs of spatial-spectral features for each pixel, which is benefit to highlight the difference between glaciers and surroundings. The proposed module is effectively integrated in UNet architecture, and the optimal model overcomes the noise effect on Sentinel-2 imagery, which outperforms the original UNet approach about 1 percent. The result indicates that a consistent improvement of glacier feature extraction. Furthermore, the proposed approach is compared with several existing glacier mapping algorithm, and results demonstrate that the proposed approach has stronger generalization ability and can obtain satisfactory accuracy for glacier mapping with test accuracy about 98.61%.}

A fire detection system should detect fires in various environments (e.g., buildings, forests, and rural areas) in the shortest time in order to reduce financial losses and humanistic disasters. Fire sensors are, in fact, complementary to conventional point sensors (e.g., smoke and heat detectors), which provide people the early warnings of fire occurrences. Cameras combined with image processing techniques detect fire occurrences more quickly than point sensors. Moreover, they provide the size, growth, and direction of fires more easily than their conventional detectors. This paper, initially, presents a glance view on the main features of various environments including buildings, forests, and mines that should be considered in the design of fire detection systems. Afterwards, it describes some of the intelligent and vision-based fire detection systems that have been presented by researchers in the last decade. These systems are categorized, in this paper, into two groups: intelligent detection systems for forest fires and intelligent fire detection systems for all of the environments. They use various intelligent techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks, color models, and fuzzy logic) to detect fire occurrences with a high accuracy in various environments. Performances of the fire detection systems are compared to each other in terms of detection rate, precision, true-positive rate, false-positive rate, etc. under different evaluation scenarios.}

The present study applies systematic review methodology traversing a number of articles to find the trends in studies utilizing DOMs. The articles included in this review indicate that the technologies used to generate DOMs are still predominantly classified as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and digital photogrammetry, with the first being present in most of the works, and the latter attracting attention owing to the popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

To validate the utilisation of this practise, this research aims (i) to assess the benefits of trees on microclimate studying the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and tree canopy cover (TCC) in farmlands and (ii) to propose an operative tree density threshold to be set as objective by restoration activities in the area. Data collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle were integrated with Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. LST was retrieved through the practical single channel algorithm and TCC was calculated with a supervised classification. Pixel-based analyses at a resolution of 30 m and 10 m were performed, and the resulting data statistically analysed through the coefficient of determination, the Kruskal–Wallis test, and the Dunn test. Results showed that the TCC of the surveyed areas was 5.1%, and a significant decrease in LST of 1.32 °C (p < 0.01) was found in the areas with the highest TCC, during the late dry season. From these preliminary analyses, a threshold of 10% TCC is suggested for farmlands in this agroecological zone to bring beneficial microclimate changes in terms of temperature. Considering the average plant phenotype characteristic of the area, it corresponds to a tree density of 50 trees ha−1.}

A systematic review of various sensors and systems for AQ management may strengthen our understanding of the monitoring and management of AQ. Thus, the current review presents details on sensors/systems available for AQ assessment, monitoring, and management. First, we had gone through the published literature based on special keywords including AQM, Particulate Matter (PM), Carbon Mono-oxide (CO), Sulfur di-Oxide (SO2), and Nitrogen di-Oxide (NO2) among others, and identified the current scenario of research in AQ management. We discussed various sensors/systems available for the AQ management based on self-conceptualised five major categories including, ground-based AQS (wet chemistry) systems, ground-based digital sensors systems, aerial sensors systems, satellite-based sensors systems, and integrated systems. The prospects in the field of AQ assessment and management (AQA&M) were then discussed in detail. We concluded that the AQA&M can be better achieved by coupling new technologies like ground-based smart sensors, satellite remote sensing sensors, Geospatial technologies, and computational technologies like machine learning, Artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT). The current work may lead to a junction of information for connecting these sensors/systems, which is expected to be beneficial in future AQ research and management.}

In recent years, various models and algorithms using big data techniques have been proposed. To summarize these methodologies of air quality study, in this paper, we first classify air quality monitoring by big data techniques into three categories, consisting of the spatial model, temporal model and spatial–temporal model. Second, we summarize the typical methods by big data techniques that are needed in air quality forecasting into three folds, which are statistical forecasting model, deep neural network model, and hybrid model, presenting representative scenarios in some folds. Third, we analyze and compare some representative air pollution traceability methods in detail, classifying them into two categories: traditional model combined with big data techniques and data-driven model. Finally, we provide an outlook on the future of air quality analysis with some promising and challenging ideas.}

The role of multiple sensors in smart connected applications helps to improve their efficiency regardless of the users. However, the assimilation of different information is subject to resource and time constraints at the time of application response. This results in partial fulfillment of the application services, and hence, this article introduces a service selective information fusion processing (SSIFP) scheme. The proposed scheme identifies service-specific sensor information for satisfying the application service demands. The identification process is eased with deep recurrent learning in determining the level of sensor information fusion. This level identification reduces the unavailability of services (resource constraint) and delays in application services (time constraint). Through this identification, the applications' precise demands are detected, and selective fusion is performed to mitigate the issues above. The proposed system's performance is verified using the metrics delay, fusion rate, service loss, and backlogs.}

abstract = {An onsite sewage system (OSS) is a complex system that takes advantage of nature's biological processes to remove harmful pathogens from wastewater and reintroduces clean water back into the natural water cycle. However, the failure of an OSS can contaminate drinking water, surface water and release hazardous pathogen and chemicals creating hazardous conditions within the local environment. This research aims to provide an artificial intelligence (AI) solution using machine learning (ML) algorithms such as logistic regression (LR), random forest classifier, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) to understand and examine the underlying factors that could cause septic failures. Septic records from 1970 to 2019 were collected from five different counties across the State of Indiana and ML algorithms were applied to predict areas of possible septic failures. The algorithms demonstrated accuracy of approximately 80% in prediction of OSS failures. Such algorithms can assist state and county health departments in alerting homeowners of impending failures. Such an approach has the ability to not only prevent failures but also in the maintenance of a safe environment for communities reliant of OSSs. This approach was implemented and tested in the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH).}

MOSM is a complex system affected by various factors, such as characteristics of spilled oil and environmental conditions. Oil spill detection, characterization, and monitoring; risk evaluation; response selection and process optimization; and waste management are the key components of MOSM demanding timely decision-making. Applying robust computational techniques based on real-time data (e.g., satellite and aerial observations) and historical records of oil spill incidents may considerably facilitate decision-making processes. Various soft-computing and artificial intelligence-based models and mathematical techniques have been used for the implementation of MOSM’s components. This study presents a review of literature published since 2010 on the application of computational techniques in MOSM. A statistical evaluation is performed concerning the temporal distribution of papers, publishers’ engagement, research subfields, countries of studies, and selected case studies. Key findings reported in the literature are summarized for two main practices in MOSM: spill detection, characterization, and monitoring; and spill management and response optimization. Potential gaps in applying computational techniques in MOSM have been identified, and a holistic computational-based framework has been suggested for effective MOSM.}

However, current trackers are usually updated online based on random sampling with a probability distribution. The performance of the learning-based TBD trackers is limited by the lack of discriminative features, especially when the background is full of semantic distractors. We propose an attention-driven data augmentation method, in which a residual attention mechanism is integrated into the TBD tracking network as supplementary references to identify discriminative image features. A mask generating network is used to simulate changes in target appearances to obtain positive samples, where attention information and image features are combined to identify discriminative features. In addition, we propose a method for mining hard negative samples, which searches for semantic distractors with the response of the attention module. The experiments on the OTB2015, UAV123, and LaSOT benchmarks show that this method achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.}

Existing GCN-based methods commonly adopt the strategy of fusing the data flow of joints and bones to obtain better results. However, these approaches ignore the reversibility of the skeleton data in the temporal dimension. Compared with the forward sequences input, which can achieve better results in certain actions through the end-to-end networks, the reverse skeleton data has excellent discrimination and richer information for some specific actions. In this work, we propose the novel forward-reverse adaptive graph convolutional networks (FR-AGCN) for skeleton-based action recognition. The sequences of joints and bones, as well as their reverse information, are modeled in the multi-stream networks at the same time. By extracting the features of forward and reverse deep information and performing multi-stream fusion, this strategy can significantly improve the recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets NTU 60 & 120 show that the performance of our strategies has exciting advantages. On the latest dataset UAV-Human, the proposed FR-AGCN outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Concretely, compared with 4s Shift-GCN, one of the most advanced models, FR-AGCN obtains significant improvements of +6.0% on CSv1 benchmark and +2.46% on CSv2 benchmark.}

The vehicle monitoring and prediction model is used to detect four kinds of targets, namely, small cars, buses, trucks and pedestrians. The multi-target trajectory tracking is used to carry out the traffic statistics of multi vehicle types, the detection of two kinds of abnormal behaviors of traffic targets is low speed and parking, and the capture of pedestrians.

We show the results when the proposed methodology is applied to model a magnetorheological damper, with real acquired data, and other two well-known benchmarks. The canonical genetic and differential evolution algorithms are used in cascade to decompose the problem of defining the lags taken as the inputs of the model and its related parameters based on the simultaneous minimization of the residuals and higher orders correlation functions. The inner layer of the cascaded approach is composed of a population which represents the lags on the inputs and outputs of the system and an outer layer represents the corresponding parameters of the RBFNN. The approach is able to define both the inputs of the model and its parameters. This is interesting as it frees the designer of manual procedures, which are time consuming and prone to error, usually done to define the model inputs. We compare the proposed methodology with other works found in the literature, showing overall better results for the cascaded approach.}

The state-of-the-art lightweight CNN is MobileNetV3. However, it was designed to achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and latency on a single large core of a Google Pixel 1 smartphone. Accordingly, MobileNetV3 is not optimized for platforms with different hardware characteristics and its predecessors may perform better for a given target platform. The aim of this paper is twofold: 1) to analyze the performance of different compact CNNs on Raspberry Pi 4; 2) to manually adapted the most promising models to better utilize the Raspberry Pi 4 hardware.

The validation work revealed that more than 85 % of acquired building footprints had absolute relative errors less than 10 %, and this percentage was 87 %, 74 % and 75 %, for height of residential buildings, height of non-residential buildings and WWR, respectively.

This study proposes an intelligent system and digital twin composed of four main components to collect, manage, process and visualize the tunnel fire information. As demonstrated in a laboratory-scale tunnel model, the AI model is trained with a large numerical database to successfully identify the fire size and location. The whole system is assessed in terms of accuracy, timeliness and robustness. The AI model attained an overall accuracy of 98% in predicting the tunnel fire scenarios. The total time delay is around 1 s from the on-site measurement of temperature to the final display of the tunnel fire scenario on a remote user interface. Moreover, the system is robust enough to predict fire, even if part of the temperature sensors is failed or destroyed by fire.

A distributed adaptive consensus protocol driving all agents to track the trajectory is presented using the backstepping technique and neural networks. The Lyapunov theory is applied to guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded and that all agents' outputs synchronize to the desired trajectory with bounded residual errors. Compared with prior work, the dynamics of each agent discussed here is more general and does not require the assumption “linearity in the unknown parameters” or the matching condition. Moreover, the bounded residual errors can be reduced as small as desired by appropriately choosing design parameters. Simulation results are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}

This paper extends the distance-based formation control for the case of holonomic robots moving in 3D space.

The control strategy uses a combined distance-based attractive-repulsive potentials to ensure convergence to the formation pattern avoiding possible inter-robot collisions. In order to avoid unwanted formation patterns that verify the distance constraints, each robot control law includes a volume condition which provides information about the unique desired position of each robot in the formation pattern. The proposed algorithm is tested by numerical simulations and extended to the case of quadcopters UAV’s by an input-output linearization showing good behavior.}

The conventional method of employing military personnel, fences, and building bulletproof walls and excavation caves at borders are replaced by WSN based sensors, radars, surveillance cameras and Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAV) by creating a virtual fence. A hybrid WSN based Border Surveillance System (BSS) architecture using activation scheduling strategy for high energy efficiency, load balancing capabilities, and network lifetime increment is proposed. The proposed integrated BSS architecture reduces manual intervention to a high extent by deploying sensors radars, cameras, and UAVs in place of humans. The results show that the proposed structure and activation methodology are accurate and precise in surveillance and require less maintenance, involve low-cost deployment and provide improved reliability.

However, automatic point cloud classification for civil infrastructures such as piers is challenging due to untidy scenes, gigantic sizes, and image feature-rich objects that can generate many cloud points. Moreover, the lack of training point clouds and unrealistic synthetic data preventing deep learning to fully support the three-dimensional point cloud classification. This paper proposes Point cloud Classification based on image-based Instance Segmentation (PCIS), an automated point cloud classification based on two-dimensional digital images from a daily work basis. These images are processed into the pre-trained network in PCIS to generate mask images, which are later used to create three-dimensional masks based on the projection from the solved camera parameters. The cloud points located inside these masks are classified as the cloud point of interest. The experiment result showed that PCIS correctly classified the point cloud and achieved up to 0.96 F1-score from a one-class classification sample and 0.83 F1-score from a six-class classification sample in our validation process. Our study has proved that normal digital images can also be used to train deep learning to classify the three-dimensional point cloud.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the event-triggered control problem for networked control systems subject to deception attacks. An improved event-triggered scheme is proposed to reduce transmission rate by using both the information of the relative error and the past released signals. Under the proposed event-triggered scheme, a new switched time-delay system model is proposed for the event-triggered control systems. Based on the new model, the exponential mean-square stability criteria are derived by using the constructed Lyapunov function. Then, a co-design method is developed to obtain both trigger parameters and mode-dependent controller gains. Finally, the proposed scheme is verified by an unmanned aerial vehicle system.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel hierarchical control strategy based on adaptive radical basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) and double-loop integral sliding mode control (IntSMC) for the position and attitude tracing of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subjected to sustained disturbances and parameter uncertainties. The dynamical motion equations are obtained by the Lagrange–Euler formalism. The proposed controller combines the advantage of the IntSMC with the approximation ability of arbitrary functions ensured by RBFNNs to generate a control law to guarantee the faster convergence of the state variables to their desired values in short time and compensation for the disturbances and uncertainties. Capabilities of online adaptive estimating of the unknown uncertainties and null tracking error are proved by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results, also compared with traditional PD/IntSMC algorithms and with the backstepping/nonlinear H∞ controller, verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control laws.}

In this systematic review, we evaluated 67 studies on the interplay between AI and urban forestry surveyed on Science Direct and Scopus to provide an overview of the state of the art and identify new research avenues. The sample includes studies in 23 countries and 85 cities, including 5 megacities, comprising the remote assessment of canopy cover and species distribution; ecosystem services assessment; management practices; and socioeconomic aspects of urban forestry. Most studies focused on extant urban forests, with few examples evaluating temporal trends, and only one focused on future scenarios despite the predictive potential of AI. A total of 22 AI methods were employed in these studies. Only half of them point to clear advantages of the chosen methods, such as robustness against missing data, overfitting, collinearity, non-linearity, non-normality, the combination of discrete and continuous variables, and higher accuracy. The choice of these methods depends on the various combinations of aim, timescale, data type, and data source.

abstract = {High spatial resolution images have been widely applied to the monitoring of land surfaces during the past decades. However, satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sensors (e.g., IKONOS, and QuickBird) usually only provide visible and near-infrared spectral bands with a high spatial resolution. Such limited spectral bands at a high spatial resolution are not adequate for crucial environmental and agricultural studies that require essential bands (e.g., the red-edge (RE) and the short-wave infrared (SWIR)), such as land cover classification and the estimation of plant physiological parameters. On the contrary, abundant spectral information is commonly available on sensors with a medium spatial resolution (e.g., Landsat, and Sentinel-2). Existing spatial-spectral fusion methods can leverage the unique advantages of these two types of sensors, and produce synthesized images with both spatial and spectral detail. However, most spatial-spectral methods ignore the inherent geometric registration errors when using multi-source data, inevitably introducing the errors into the fusion result. To address the limitation, this study presents a new spatial-spectral fusion method, the Misregistration-Resistant Data Fusion approach (MRDF), to add new spectral bands to the high spatial resolution images from medium resolution images. The proposed method is composed of a local-model-based similar pixel searching and a global partial least square (PLS) regression, and has the following advantages: (1) the local model utilizes neighborhood similar pixels to generate predictions robust against geometric misregistration; (2) the combined model integrates a global PLS regression to improve fusion accuracy for the SWIR bands; (3) the extended-box strategy and spatial filtering can relieve geometric errors when minimizing residuals for the SWIR bands. Satellite and airborne data from three sites were used to compare the performance of MRDF with seven other typical methods. Results showed that MRDF not only produced accurate fusion results with above-average efficiency but also improved the classification accuracy, which substantiated its great potential for various applications.}

In computation offloading, offloading modeling plays a crucial role in determining the overall edge computing performance. We present a comprehensive overview on the past development as well as the recent advances in research areas related to offloading modeling in edge computing. First, we present some important edge computing architectures and classify the previous works on computation offloading into different categories. Second, we discuss some basic models such as channel model, computation and communication model, and energy harvesting model that have been proposed in offloading modeling. Next, we elaborate on different offloading modeling methods which are based on (non-)convex optimization, Markov decision process, game theory, Lyapunov optimization, or machine learning.

abstract = {Quantifying fuel load over large areas is essential to support integrated fire management initiatives in fire-prone regions to preserve carbon stock, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It also allows a better understanding of global climate regulation as a potential carbon sink or source. Large area assessments usually require data from spaceborne remote sensors, but most of them cannot measure the vertical variability of vegetation structure, which is required for accurately measuring fuel loads and defining management interventions. The recently launched NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) full-waveform lidar sensor holds potential to meet this demand. However, its capability for estimating fuel load has yet not been evaluated. In this study, we developed a novel framework and tested machine learning models for predicting multi-layer fuel load in the Brazilian tropical savanna (i.e., Cerrado biome) using GEDI data. First, lidar data were collected using an unnamed aerial vehicle (UAV). The flights were conducted over selected sample plots in distinct Cerrado vegetation formations (i.e., grassland, savanna, forest) where field measurements were conducted to determine the load of surface, herbaceous, shrubs and small trees, woody fuels and the total fuel load. Subsequently, GEDI-like full-waveforms were simulated from the high-density UAV-lidar 3-D point clouds from which vegetation structure metrics were calculated and correlated to field-derived fuel load components using Random Forest models. From these models, we generate fuel load maps for the entire Cerrado using all on-orbit available GEDI data. Overall, the models had better performance for woody fuels and total fuel loads (R2 = 0.88 and 0.71, respectively). For components at the lower stratum, models had moderate to low performance (R2 between 0.15 and 0.46) but still showed reliable results. The presented framework can be extended to other fire-prone regions where accurate measurements of fuel components are needed. We hope this study will contribute to the expansion of spaceborne lidar applications for integrated fire management activities and supporting carbon monitoring initiatives in tropical savannas worldwide.}

Guidance and control framework based on second order sliding modes is presented to solve the problem of two dimensional path-following. The overall closed-loop system generally consists of an inner control (designed considering system dynamics) and outer guidance (designed considering system kinematics) loop configuration. The main contribution of the technique presented here is the partial integration of the two loops i.e., a guidance and control system via series interconnection of two stable sliding manifolds. In the outer guidance loop, the proposed guidance scheme relies on a nonlinear switching surface with the real twisting algorithm derived at the kinematic level, generating roll error commands. The autopilot based on the super-twisting algorithm using a linear sliding surface forms the inner loop. Proof of existence of the 2-sliding mode, control boundedness and stability of the closed-loop, i.e., the overall guidance and control path-following system with the UAV kinematics and autopilot dynamics, is given. The proposed guidance and control system performance is verified via extensive flight tests of a scaled YAK-54 UAV. Flight results validate the proposed framework for guidance and control design.}

The sensor system consists of electrochemical sensors measuring O3, NO2, NO, SO2, CO, an optical counting (OPC) particulate matter (PM) sensor for PM1.0, PM2.5, and PM10, a miniature photoionization detector (PID) for total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), and metrological sensors for air temperature, relative humidity (RH) and air pressure. All sensor signals were collected and transferred by a data acquirement (DAQ) logger. The sensor data were saved in a microcomputer and transmitted wireless by a GSM/GPS module. All sensors and the accessories were integrated and installed in a thermal insulation foam package, of which temperature was stable at 25 °C to avoid the temperature effect. A silicone desiccant tube was connected to the inlet of air sample to minimize the RH influence. The sensor performances were compared with on-ground reference instruments for a 21-day field campaign and commercial portable instruments from Thermal Scientific and Vaisala in aerial observations. All gas sensors and PM sensor showed good correlations with the reference instruments with R2 varying from 0.81 to 0.93 and slope from 0.89 to 1.35. The O3 sensor performed best with R2 = 0.93 and slope = 1.02. In aerial measurements PM and O3 sensors obtained similar vertical profiles of PM and O3 with those obtained by commercial Thermal PTR PM monitor and Vaisala O3 sounding sensor, respectively. The sensor package was successfully deployed to observe the vertical profiles of air pollutants on a tethered balloon and to exactly locate exhaust sources in an industrial park with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Our sensor package was substantiated to be a reliable and accurate device for aerial measurements of air pollutants in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).}

However, many group maintenance models, which only consider the health of components without regard for reliability information at system-level, have difficulty meeting the increasing system task-performance demands. Based on system multi-level information, an age-based group maintenance method that trades off cost and system reliability is proposed. The method considers different failure mechanisms of units and system structures, and achieves a grouping strategy and maintenance decision-making approach according to multi-level lifetime prediction data. The reliability information at system- level is predicted by Bayesian network (BN) from life information of units, and multi-objective programming of cost and system reliability is used to optimize maintenance grouping strategies. This method is applicable to multi-level systems of varying sizes. A simulation example and a solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) application illustrate the method. The results verify the feasibility and superiority, and meet the high security and reliability standards.}

abstract = {Vehicle detection in traffic surveillance images is an important approach to obtain vehicle data and rich traffic flow parameters. Recently, deep learning based methods have been widely used in vehicle detection with high accuracy and efficiency. However, deep learning based methods require a large number of manually labeled ground truths (bounding box of each vehicle in each image) to train the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the modern urban surveillance cameras, there are already many manually labeled ground truths in daytime images for training CNN, while there are little or much less manually labeled ground truths in nighttime images. In this paper, we focus on the research to make maximum usage of labeled daytime images (Source Domain) to help the vehicle detection in unlabeled nighttime images (Target Domain). For this purpose, we propose a new situation-sensitive method based on Faster R-CNN with Domain Adaptation (DA) to improve the vehicle detection at nighttime. Furthermore, a situation-sensitive traffic flow parameter estimation method is developed based on the traffic flow theory. We collected a new dataset of 2,200 traffic images (1,200 for daytime and 1,000 for nighttime) of 57,059 vehicles to evaluate the proposed method for the vehicle detection. Another new dataset with three 1,800-frame daytime videos and one 1,800-frame nighttime video of about 260 K vehicles was collected to evaluate and show the estimated traffic flow parameters in different situations. The experimental results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.}

abstract = {The accurate prediction of crop yield at field scale is important for precision agriculture to understand crop production response to agronomic management practice and environmental stress. In this study, we developed a method to predict yield based entirely on remotely sensed data in oilseed rape under different planting methods and nitrogen fertilizer applications. Leaf are index (LAI) measured at four developmental stages were correlated with oilseed rape yield. It is found that LAI at the initiation of stem elongation stage closely related to yield, thus the remote estimation of LAI at this stage can be used to indicate the yield in oilseed rape. The red edge vegetation index (CIred edge), which was derived from canopy reflectance collected at close range as well as by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), was able to accurately estimate LAI thus can be used to predict yield in oilseed rape with the estimation error below 15%. Based on remote predictions of field-scale yield in oilseed rape, it is observed that with the same nitrogen fertilizer the oilseed rape plots planted by seed sowing method consistently produced higher yield than plots planted by seedling transplanting method. With the increase of nitrogen fertilizer, the yield of oilseed rape increased but became saturated for the high level of nitrogen applications above 225 kg/ha.}

To address communication interference and energy overconsumption problems caused by the lack of adaptability to changeful scenes, a power allocation algorithm based on scenes adaptive cooperative Q-learning (SACL) is proposed in the paper. Specifically, the scene variable is added into the state space, and the reward function in the algorithm is improved to achieve a larger system capacity with less power. Then, in order to improve the convergence speed of SACL algorithm, the balance factor is introduced based on the location distribution of multiple agents, and a fast scene adaptive reinforcement learning (FSACL) algorithm is proposed. Simulation experiments verify the adaptability of SACL and FSACL algorithm when the scene is changed. Compared with traditional cooperative Q-learning algorithm (CL) and independent Q-learning (IL) algorithms, the SACL and FSACL algorithm can obtain larger system capacity with smaller power to some extent. In addition, the FSACL algorithm converges faster than the CL, IL and the SACL algorithm.}

First, the instantaneous contact force during the gliding grasping is analyzed by the impulse and momentum theorem, and some factors affecting grasping performance are considered to complete an analysis of grasping force including the irregular shape of the object, the object scrolling, and geometrically asymmetric grasping. Meanwhile, the mass of the grasping object and the inertia tensor are considered unknown bounded items. As a benefit, an accurate dynamics model of the UAM gliding grasping is guaranteed. Second, a hybrid force/position controller based on an adaptive neural network estimator is adopted for UAM to overcome both internal disturbances and external disturbances. The proposed method stability is analyzed through the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, through a dynamic gliding grasping simulation, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme are verified.}

A new approach suggested in this work considers the control system synthesis problem as the set of optimal control problems and suggests a two-step algorithm to solve it. At the first step evolutionary algorithms are used to solve the optimal control problem numerically for each initial state from a given domain. As a result of the first step a set of optimal trajectories is obtained. At the second step symbolic regression methods are considered to solve the problem of approximating the found in the first step set of trajectories optimally. The result of the second step is a solution of the control system synthesis problem as a multidimensional control function of object’s state vector. Compared to the known approach to solve the control system synthesis problem using symbolic regression methods, the suggested approach provides betters results since the search of control function is carried out based on the set of optimal trajectories. Computational experiment presents the solution of the applied problem of synthesizing the optimal control system for the spacecraft landing on the Moon. It is experimentally demonstrated that the synthesized control system provides a close to optimal landing trajectory for any initial state from a given domain.}

To achieve high quality of experience (QoE) for users and to perform resource allocation for cells intelligently, we first propose a distributed traffic-processing framework (SDVTS) for elastic resource partitioning, to accommodate dynamics from the user-centric and resource-oriented perspectives respectively. Assisted by a software defined infrastructure, SDVTS fulfills the responsibilities of the request-based and push-based services in an interactive loop. Second, we formulate a traffic-processing time model that computes the delay of handling traffic. The non-convex model is decomposed and a dual evolution algorithm is explored to approximate the optimal solution. Furthermore, we introduce a low-complexity reinforcement learning algorithm with the personalized QoE profiling. A distributed algorithm in coalition between user and cell is designed for seamless connection of an advanced reinforcement learning system (ARLS) components and engines embedded in SDVTS. Extensive simulation results with thorough analysis demonstrate that our framework SDVTS dominates in terms of QoE and cell′s system performance when compared with competing approaches.}

We need to produce 70% more food to meet the demands of 9.5 billion people by 2050. Climate changes have posed challenges for global food supply, while the narrow genetic base of elite crop cultivars has further limited our capacity to increase genetic gain through conventional breeding. The effective utilization of genetic resources in germplasm collections for crop improvement is crucial to increasing genetic gain to address challenges in the global food supply. Genomic selection (GS) uses genome-wide markers and phenotype information from observed populations to establish associations, followed by genome-wide markers to predict phenotypic values in test populations. Characterizing an extensive germplasm collection can serve a dual purpose in GS, as a reference population for predicting model, and mining desirable genetic variants for incorporation into elite cultivars. New technologies, such as high-throughput genotyping and phenotyping, machine learning, and gene editing, have great potential to contribute to genome-assisted breeding. Breeding programmes integrating germplasm characterization, GS and emerging technologies offer promise for accelerating the development of cultivars with improved yield and enhanced resistance and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Finally, scientifically informed regulations on new breeding technologies, and increased sharing of genetic resources, genomic data, and bioinformatics expertise between developed and developing economies will be the key to meeting the challenges of the rapidly changing climate and increased demand for food.}

They are insufficient when used in specific applications, such as the detection of military objects, as in these instances, a large number of samples is hard to obtain. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes the use of Gabor-CNN for object detection based on a small number of samples. First of all, a feature extraction convolution kernel library composed of multi-shape Gabor and color Gabor is constructed, and the optimal Gabor convolution kernel group is obtained by means of training and screening, which is convolved with the input image to obtain feature information of objects with strong auxiliary function. Then, the k-means clustering algorithm is adopted to construct several different sizes of anchor boxes, which improves the quality of the regional proposals. We call this regional proposal process the Gabor-assisted Region Proposal Network (Gabor-assisted RPN). Finally, the Deeply-Utilized Feature Pyramid Network (DU-FPN) method is proposed to strengthen the feature expression of objects in the image. A bottom-up and a top-down feature pyramid is constructed in ResNet-50 and feature information of objects is deeply utilized through the transverse connection and integration of features at various scales. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper achieves better results than the state-of-art contrast models on data sets with small samples in terms of accuracy and recall rate, and thus has a strong application prospect.}

abstract = {Paddy rice mapping in an accurate and timely manner was of significance as the explicitly spatial paddy rice maps played a critical role in food security and market stability. Over the decades, remote sensing (RS) techniques offered great potential to extract paddy rice from the optical satellite images. Two main categories of paddy rice mapping methods were commonly utilized. The first one was the phenology-oriented methods by utilizing the distinctive phenology of paddy rice, and the machine learning-based approaches were the other mainstream for paddy rice extraction by being recognized as a classification task. However, neither of the above methods were actually applicable to automatically map paddy rice for the large cloudy areas. The phenological methods were subject to the availability of time-series cloud-free RS inputs due to cloud contamination, and machine learning-based methods were often confined to the availability of high-quality collected training samples. Therefore, this study proposed a new flexible framework to integrate the above two methods, in an attempt to achieve the goal of automatic paddy rice mapping for large cloudy area. Firstly, phenological paddy rice mapping was implemented for the areas with cloud-free time series satellite images available to generate the paddy rice potentials. Following that, the derived paddy rice potentials were purified through filtering operations. Finally, the machine learning classifier was trained using the purified samples, and spatially transferred to other regions for the extraction of paddy rice. Several experiments were carried out to assess our proposed framework and the subsequent mapping results. The experimental results were promising, indicating that our framework contributed to overcoming the strong reliance on training data for machine learning methods, and reducing the number of multi-temporal inputs for automated paddy rice mapping, which potentially provided a new paradigm for the purpose of paddy rice extraction.}

The control design is categorized into two envelopes. One is to steer individual marine surface vehicle to track a given spatial path. The other is to synchronize the speed of each vehicle along its path and path variables under the constraints of an underlying communication network in order to holding a desired formation pattern. The key features of the developed controllers are that, first, the neural network adaptive technique allows one to handle the dynamical uncertainty and ocean disturbances, without the need for explicit knowledge of the model; second, the proposed dynamic surface control technique simplifies the controller design by introducing the first-order filters and avoids the calculation of derivatives of virtual control signals. Further, this result is extended to the output feedback case, where a high-gain observer based cooperative path following controller is developed without measuring the velocity of each vehicle. Under the proposed controllers, all signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded for both state and output feedback cases. Simulation results validate the performance and robustness improvement of the proposed strategy.}

Studies have been proposed to classify fruits from input images, exploiting image processing and machine learning techniques. Though a lot of improvements have been achieved in recent years, many approaches still suffer prolonged training/testing time, or a considerably high number of false positives. For several applications, it is crucial to provide users with not only precise but also real-time recommendations. In this paper, we propose a practical solution to fruit recognition by exploiting two recently-developed classifiers that have demonstrated themselves to be both effective and efficient. We adopted EfficientNet and MixNet, two families of deep neural networks to build an expert system being able to accurately and swiftly identify fruits. Such a system can be deployed onto devices with limited computational resources to prompt exact and timely recommendations. The approach’s performance has been validated on a real dataset consisting of 48,905 images for training and 16,421 images for testing. The experimental results showed that the application of EfficientNet and MixNet on the considered dataset substantially improves the overall prediction accuracy in comparison to a well-established baseline.}

abstract = {Fast assessment of damaged buildings is important for post-disaster rescue operations. Building damage detection leveraging image processing and machine learning techniques has become a popular research focus in recent years. Although supervised learning approaches have made considerable improvement for damaged building assessment, rapidly deploying supervised classification is still difficult due to the complexity in obtaining a large number of labeled samples in the aftermath of disasters. We propose an unsupervised self-attention domain adaptation (USADA) model, which transforms instances of the source domain to those of the target domain in pixel space, to address the aforementioned issue. The proposed USADA consists of three parts: a set of generative adversarial networks (GANs), a classifier, and a self-attention module. The GAN adapts source domain images to ensure their similarity to target domain images. Once adapted, the classifier can be trained using the adapted images along with the original images of the source domain to classify damaged buildings. The self-attention module is introduced to maintain the foreground of the generated images conditioned on source domain images for generating plausible samples. As a case study, aerial images of Hurricane Sandy, Maria, and Irma, are used as the source and target domain datasets in our experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that classification accuracies of 68.1% and 84.1% are achieved, and our method obtains improvements of 2.0% and 3.6% against pixel-level domain adaptation, which is the basis of our model.}

abstract = {Precision farming aims to optimizing the crop production process and managing sustainable supply chain practices as more efficient and reasonable as possible. Recently, various advanced technologies, such as deep-learning and internet of things (IoT), have achieved remarkable intelligence progress in realistic agricultural conditions. However, crops species recognition can be considered as fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) problem, suffering the low inter-class discrepancy and high intra-class variances from the subordinate categories, which is more challenging than common basic-level category classification depended on traditional deep neural networks (DNNs). This paper presents a fine-grained visual recognition model named as MCF-Net to classifying different crop species in practical farmland scenes. Proposed MCF-Net is consisted of cross stage partial network (CSPNet) as backbone module, three parallel sub-networks, and cross-level fusion module. With multi-stream hybrid architecture utilizing massive fine-granulometric information, MCF-Net obtains preferable representation ability for distinguishing interclass discrepancy and tolerating intra-class variances. In addition, the end-to-end implementation of MCF-Net is optimized by cross-level fusion strategy to accurately identify different crop categories. Several experiments on in-field CropDeepv2 datasets demonstrate that our method favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. The recognition accuracy and F1-score of MCF-Net achieves very competitive results up to 90.6% and 0.962 separately, both of which outperforming contrasted models indicate better recognition accuracy and model stability of our method. Moreover, the overall parameters of MCF-Net are only 807 MByte with achieving a good balance between model’s performance and complexity. It is acceptable and suitable to the implementation of IoT platforms in precision agricultural practices.}

Moreover, accurate recognition and extraction of field operation area (FOA) boundary is a crucial basic data to implement precision agriculture. Due to the irregular shape, different planting ways and inconsistent size of FOA, it is difficult to recognize and extract the boundary. Therefore, the boundary of FOA based on UAV remote sensing images was classified in this paper, and a priori rule was proposed according to the boundary characteristics. Combined with the classical algorithm of image processing, a boundary recognition and extraction system was developed by LabVIEW to obtain the effective boundary of FOA. At last, the boundary recognition method and the accuracy and real-time performance of the extraction system were tested, and the result shows the method and system can accurately recognize and extract the actual boundary of FOA, and they are adapted to three different types of boundaries and image resolutions. The system has good real-time performance, and the single-frame image processing time does not exceed 100ms when the image resolution is lower than 1920⁎1280.}

Finally, P-N learning is used to maintain target appearance by utilizing novel structural constraints to select positive and negative samples, where data association decisions are used as positive (P) constraints. After learning target appearance, a cascaded classifier is employed to detect the target in case of association failure. The proposed framework enables to recapture targets after being out of camera field of view and helps discriminating between targets with similar appearance while alleviating drift problems.

We propose a novel integer program to formulate the problem and devise a column generation approach to obtain provably high-quality solutions that are used to train the learning algorithm. Results of our numerical experiments with four groups of instances show that the classification algorithms can effectively identify the features that determine the timing and location of the recharging visits, and L&F generates energy feasible routes in a few seconds with around 5% optimality gap on the average.}

However, insect species identification is challenging and labour-intensive. This has prompted increasing interest in image-based systems for rapid, reliable identification supported by advances in deep learning, computer vision, and sensing technologies. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to analyse and compare primary studies of image-based insect detection and species classification methods. We initially identified 980 studies published between 2010–2020 and selected from these 69 relevant studies using explicitly defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. In this SLR, we conducted a detailed analysis of the primary studies’ dataset properties (i.e. insect species targeted, crops, geographical locations, image capture methods) and insect classification techniques. We provide recommendations for future research based on the gaps our survey identified. We found many studies were conducted in China, the USA, and Brazil, but none in the African continent. The majority of the studies (78.3%) aimed to identify crop pests, mainly of rice and wheat. Only three studies specifically targeted beneficial insects, bee species and predatory species. Insect species targeted by the studies were centred around 10 insect orders out of 28. The analysis of classification methods shows a recent trend toward applying deep learning techniques compared to shallow learning techniques for insect identification. The SLR provides insight into the current state of the art and indicates promising future directions for image-based insect identification and species classification relevant to Computer Science, Agriculture and Ecology research.}

abstract = {At road intersections, vehicles frequently stop with idling engines during the red-light period and speed up rapidly in the green-light period, which generates higher velocity fluctuation and thus higher emission rates. Additionally, the frequent changes of wind direction further add the highly variable dispersion of pollutants at the street scale. It is, therefore, very difficult to estimate the distribution of pollutant concentrations using conventional deterministic causal models. For this reason, a hybrid model combining wavelet neural network and genetic algorithm (GA–WNN) is proposed for predicting 5-min series of carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in proximity to an intersection. The proposed model is examined based on the measured data under two situations. As the measured pollutant concentrations are found to be dependent on the distance to the intersection, the model is evaluated in three locations respectively, i.e. 110 m, 330 m and 500 m. Due to the different variation of pollutant concentrations on varied time, the model is also evaluated in peak and off-peak traffic time periods separately. Additionally, the proposed model, together with the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), is examined with the measured data in these situations. The proposed model is found to perform better in predictability and precision for both CO and PM2.5 than BPNN does, implying that the hybrid model can be an effective tool to improve the accuracy of estimating pollutants' distribution pattern at intersections. The outputs of these findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed model to be applicable to forecast the distribution pattern of air pollution in real-time in proximity to road intersection.}

Fast and effective maize water stress detection is of great help to monitor the plant status and provide scientific guidance for crop irrigation. Most of the methods are based on manual measurements of soil water content, or laboratory imaging techniques, such as hyperspectral and thermal images at plant level. With the collection of 656 original maize plant images under natural environment, a novel maize leaf image dataset with different water stress levels (well-watered, reduced-watered and drought-stressed) was constructed. This paper considers maize water status detection as a fine-grained classification problem using local leaf images. Inspired by deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied for the first time to maize water stress recognition. In the designed CNN architecture, feature maps from different convolutional layers are merged. Through visualization and importance analysis of the multi-scale feature maps, several specific feature maps are selected as learned features, which provide a strong discrimination ability. An SVM classifier is finally trained using the feature representation as inputs. Compared with existing techniques, the proposed method achieves the satisfying classification performance with an accuracy of 88.41%. This study also provides a quantitative measure of water stress degree using a regression model. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned features perform better than hand-crafted features to detect water stress and quantify stress severity. The proposed framework can be deployed in practical applications for a non-destructive, near real-time, and automatic monitoring of plant water status in fields.}

An integral-form adaptive law based on Lyapunov's stability theorem is applied to estimate both the linear and nonlinear uncertainties. A modified algorithm is proposed based on the transformation between energy and autocorrelation function to solve the parameter drift problem caused by nonlinear terms in the adaptive law. The absolute value of the function is minimized by selecting an appropriate step length to eliminate the influence of noise on the adaptive law. A parameter design method for several common forms of noise is proposed. Compared with existing robust modification techniques, autocorrelation modification is demonstrated using MATLAB simulations to solve the parameter drift problem and ensure the robustness of the system. Flight tests examining the stability of the controller and the performance robustness of the nonlinear L1 adaptive control system to sensor noise and actuator failure are described. The variable gain control system is verified through flight tests. Comparative experiments show that the proposed modification suppresses the system oscillations caused by noise and solves the parameter drift problem within 5 s.}

According to the reflectance extracted from the BRDF model, the dependences of 16 commonly-used VIs on observation angles are analyzed, and the SPAD values of maize and soybean canopy are predicted by using the 16 VI values at different observation angles and their combinations as input parameters. The results show that the 16 VIs have different sensitivity to angle in the principal plane: green ratio vegetation index (GRVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), red edge chlorophyll index (CIRE), and modified chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (MCARI/OSAVI) are very sensitive to angles, among which MCARI/OSAVI of maize fluctuated the most (138.83 %); in contrast, the green optimal soil adjusted vegetation index (GOSAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) hardly change with the observation angles. In terms of SPAD prediction, the accuracy of different VI is different, the mean absolute error (MAE) showed that MCARI1 provided the highest accuracy of retrieval for soybean (MAE=1.617), while for maize it was MCARI/OSAVI (MAE=2.422). However, when using the same VI, there was no significant difference in the accuracy of the predicted results, whether the VI from different angles was used or the combination of multi-angles was used. The present results provide guiding significance and practical value for the retrieval of SPAD value in vegetation canopies and in-depth applications of multi-angular remote sensing.}

The presented approach includes a new MTS heuristic that exploits the probability and spatial properties of the problem, allowing our ant based algorithm to quickly obtain high-quality high-level straight-segmented UAV trajectories. The potential of the algorithm is tested for different ACO parameterizations, over several search scenarios with different characteristics such as number of UAVs, or target dynamics and location distributions. The statistical comparison against other techniques previously used for MTS (ad hoc heuristics, cross entropy optimization, bayesian optimization algorithm and genetic algorithms) shows that the new approach outperforms the others.}

This work proposes an adaptive neural network image-based visual servo (IBVS) controller for positioning an underwater vehicle with respect to a fixed target in camera-in-hand configuration. The visual servoing error is defined by projecting the image error to the vehicle space using a pseudo inverse of the estimated Jacobian matrix. In the proposed dual-loop system architecture, the velocity command is designed to stabilize the visual servoing error in the kinematic loop, and the desired acceleration is derived to track the velocity command in the dynamic loop. A single hidden layer (SHL) feedforward neural network, in conjunction with a conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller, is applied to the cascaded systems to compensate for the uncertainties in both the Jacobian matrix and the vehicle dynamics. The thruster control signals are obtained by using the approximate dynamic inversion (ADI) of the vehicle. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the visual servoing error and the neural network weight matrices are proved by Lyapunov theory. Simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the controller with two candidate methods of estimating the image Jacobian matrix.}

This has created a new challenge called task offloading, where computation intensive tasks need to be offloaded to more resource powerful remote devices. Naturally, the Cloud Computing is a well-tested infrastructure that can facilitate the task offloading. However, Cloud Computing as a centralized and distant infrastructure creates significant communication delays that cannot satisfy the requirements of the emerging delay-sensitive applications. To this end, the concept of Edge Computing has been proposed, where the Cloud Computing capabilities are repositioned closer to the end devices at the edge of the network. This paper provides a detailed survey of how the Edge and/or Cloud can be combined together to facilitate the task offloading problem. Particular emphasis is given on the mathematical, artificial intelligence and control theory optimization approaches that can be used to satisfy the various objectives, constraints and dynamic conditions of this end-to-end application execution approach. The survey concludes with identifying open challenges and future directions of the problem at hand.}

This leads to a variety of responses, including “business as usual”, technological optimism, technological fatalism and technological ignorance. To explore this perplexity and its justification, we examine four areas of technological advance relevant to transport: mobility as a service; unmanned aerial vehicles (drones); automated vehicles; and telehealth. In each case, we identify the principal underlying shifts which are driving these technological advances, concluding that there is considerable overlap: three of the advances rely on ubiquitous sensing and on artificial intelligence and all four rely, to some degree, on connectedness. We then explore these three “drivers”, finding that progress is steadier than may be generally thought. We discuss the implications for our set of transport-related technological developments, concluding that policy makers could approach the future with greater confidence than is currently typical. They could also draw on the concepts of anticipatory governance to support their management of emerging technology and, at the same time, of the influence of external actors.}

However, a detailed analysis of the results shows that the accuracy in the detection of small objects is still far from being satisfactory. A recent trend that will likely improve the overall object detection success is to use the spatial information operating alongside temporal video information. This paper introduces STDnet-ST, an end-to-end spatio-temporal convolutional neural network for small object detection in video. We define small as those objects under 16×16 px, where the features become less distinctive. STDnet-ST is an architecture that detects small objects over time and correlates pairs of the top-ranked regions with the highest likelihood of containing those small objects. This permits to link the small objects across the time as tubelets. Furthermore, we propose a procedure to dismiss unprofitable object links in order to provide high quality tubelets, increasing the accuracy. STDnet-ST is evaluated on the publicly accessible USC-GRAD-STDdb, UAVDT and VisDrone2019-VID video datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results for small objects.}

In southcentral Alaska, willow (Salix spp.) and alder (Alnus spp.) shrubs grow taller than many tree species and account for a substantial proportion of aboveground biomass, yet they are not individually measured as part of the operational Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program. The goal of this research was to test methods for landscape-scale mapping of tall shrub biomass in upper montane and subalpine environments using FIA-type plot measurements (n = 51) and predictor variables from imagery-based structure-from-motion (SfM) and airborne lidar. Specifically, we compared biomass models constructed from imagery acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV; ~1.7 cm pixels), imagery from the NASA Goddard's Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal Airborne Imager (G-LiHT; ~3.1 cm pixels), and concomitant G-LiHT small-footprint lidar. Tall shrub biomass was most accurately predicted at 5 m resolution (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 1.09 kg m−2) using G-LiHT SfM color and structure variables. Lidar-only models had lower precision (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 1.26 kg m−2), possibly due to reduced model information content from variable multicollinearity or lower data density. Separate models for upper montane zones with trees and shrubs and subalpine zones with only shrubs were always chosen over single models based on minimization of Akaike's Information Criterion, indicating the need for variable sets robust to overhanging tree canopy. Decreasing point density from UAV (5000–8000 pts. m−2) to the G-LiHT SfM point cloud (500–2000 pts. m−2) had little impact on model fit, suggesting that high-resolution airborne imagery can extend SfM approaches well beyond line-of-sight restrictions for UAV platforms. Overall, our results confirmed that SfM from high-resolution imagery is a viable approach to estimate shrub biomass in the boreal region, especially when an existing lidar terrain model and local field calibration data are available to quantify uncertainty in the SfM point cloud and landscape-scale estimates of shrub biomass.}

GEDGWO employs the Gauss probability model to estimate the distribution of the selected superior individuals and shifts the weighted mean to adjust the search directions. Additionally, a Gaussian distribution based inferior solutions repair (ISR) method is introduced to modify the ill-shaped distribution of the population. A disturbed Gaussian random walk method is utilized to strengthen the local exploration ability. The performance of GEDGWO is compared with those of other promising GWO variants and state-of-the-art algorithms on a benchmarking CEC 2014 test suite. Non-parametric Wilcoxon and Friedman tests as well as the post hoc Iman–Davenport test are performed to further verify the efficacy of GEDGWO. Moreover, GEDGWO is applied to solve multi-UAV multi-target urban tracking path planning problem. To overcome the shortcomings of the previous solution model, a new model is described to address this complex real-time engineering optimization problem. The validity and practicability of the problem models as well as the accuracy and efficiency of GEDGWO are demonstrated by the experimental results.}

Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications.}

Notably, ITS has been cited in various journal articles and proceedings papers around the world, and it has become increasingly popular. Additionally, ITS involves multidisciplinary science. The growing number of journal articles makes ITS reviews complicated, and research gaps can be difficult to identify. The existing software for systematic reviews still relies on highly laborious tasks, manual reading, and a homogeneous dataset of research articles. This study proposes a framework that can address these issues, return a comprehensive systematic review of ITS, and promote efficient systematic reviews. The proposed framework consists of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods i.e., Named Entity Recognition (NER), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and word embedding (continuous skip-gram). It enables this study to explore the context of research articles and their overall interpretation to determine and define the directions of knowledge growth and ITS development. The framework can systematically separate unrelated documents and simplify the review process for large dataset.

With the proliferation of physical things being connected to internet and enabled with sensory capabilities to form an Internet of Thing (IoT) network, it is increasingly important to run CNN inference, a computationally intensive application, on the resource constrained IoT devices. Object detection is a fundamental computer vision problem that provides information for image understanding in several artificial intelligence (AI) applications in smart cities. Among various object detection algorithms, CNN has emerged as a new paradigm to improve the overall performance. The Multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which are used repeatedly in the convolution layers of CNN, hold extreme computational complexity. Hence, the overall computational workloads and their respective energy consumption of any CNN applications are on the rise. To overcome these escalating challenges, approximate computing mechanism has played a vital role in reducing power and area of computation intensive CNN applications. In this paper, we have designed an approximate MAC architecture, termed Shift and Accumulator Unit (SAC), for the error-resilient CNN based object detection algorithm targeting embedded platforms. The proposed computing unit deliberately trades accuracy to reduce design complexity and power consumption, thus suiting the resource constrained IoT devices. The pipeline architecture of the SAC unit saves approximately 1.8× clock cycles than the non-pipeline SAC architecture. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed computing unit has better energy efficiency and resource utilization than the accurate multiplier and state-of-the-art approximate multipliers without noticeable deterioration in overall performance.}

This involves a few tasks such as exploring areas of interest, keeping network connectivity, and potentially surveilling and monitoring some buildings of interest. As interests of exploring an area and sustaining communication conflict, two different groups of UAVs undertake non-overlapping tasks, i.e., some of them explore the points and the rest act as communication relay. Moreover, the proposed approach decomposes the problem into a sequence of logical phases and solves them step by step. Implementing the sequential solutions provides a visiting sequence of the points for each UAV, and efficient and feasible paths. Note that, in order to generate those paths, the paper also develops a new approach to the Travelling Salesman Problem and multiple Travelling Salesman Problem and uses visibility graphs. Compared to other existing approaches, the proposed approach can dramatically reduce the computational load, the total distance covered by the agents, and the distance difference among agents while keeping the communication link. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated via numerical simulations and compared to other existing solutions such as the Genetic Algorithm or Consensus Based Bundle Algorithm.}

Currently, deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) structures are applied widely for object detection. Nevertheless, existing deep CNN-based models consist of complex network structures and require immense amounts of graphics processing unit (GPU) computation power with high energy consumption. Thus, achieving efficient real-time object detection for limited memory and processing capacity embedded device is a major challenge. This paper proposes a feasible and lightweight object detection model based on deep CNN where a mobile inverted bottleneck module is adopted in the backbone structure. Moreover, an enhanced spatial pyramid pooling is adopted to increase the receptive field in the network by concatenating the multi-scale local region features. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model achieved higher average precision and required the smallest memory storage compared to previous works. Moreover, the proposed model offers the best trade-offs in terms of detection accuracy, model size, and detection time which has excellent potential to be deployed on limited capacity embedded device.}

This study evaluated the mapping accuracies of supervised and unsupervised image classifiers for mapping Harrisia pomanensis (a cactus plant commonly known as the Midnight Lady) using two interlinked evaluation strategies i.e. point and area based accuracy assessment. Results of the point-based accuracy assessment show that with reference to 219 ground control points, the supervised image classifiers (i.e. Maxver and Bhattacharya) mapped H. pomanensis better than the unsupervised image classifiers (i.e. K-mediuns, Euclidian Length and Isoseg). In this regard, user and producer accuracies were 82.4% and 84% respectively for the Maxver classifier. The user and producer accuracies for the Bhattacharya classifier were 90% and 95.7%, respectively. Though the Maxver produced a higher overall accuracy and Kappa estimate than the Bhattacharya classifier, the Maxver Kappa estimate of 0.8305 is not significantly (statistically) greater than the Bhattacharya Kappa estimate of 0.8088 at a 95% confidence interval. The area based accuracy assessment results show that the Bhattacharya classifier estimated the spatial extent of H. pomanensis with an average mapping accuracy of 86.1% whereas the Maxver classifier only gave an average mapping accuracy of 65.2%. Based on these results, the Bhattacharya classifier is therefore recommended for mapping H. pomanensis. These findings will aid in the algorithm choice making for the development of a semi-automated image classification system for mapping IAPs.}

abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is a key diagnostic indicator of agricultural water use and crop stress. LST data retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) band imagery, however, tend to have a coarser spatial resolution (e.g., 100 m for Landsat 8) than surface reflectance (SR) data collected from shortwave bands on the same instrument (e.g., 30 m for Landsat). Spatial sharpening of LST data using the higher resolution multi-band SR data provides an important path for improved agricultural monitoring at sub-field scales. A previously developed Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) approach has shown great potential in the sharpening of Landsat LST using Landsat SR data co-collected over various landscapes. This work evaluates DMS performance for sharpening ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LST (~70 m native resolution) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LST (375 m) data using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) SR data, providing the basis for generating 30-m LST data at a higher temporal frequency than afforded by Landsat alone. To account for the misalignment between ECOSTRESS/VIIRS and Landsat/HLS caused by errors in registration and orthorectification, we propose a modified version of the DMS approach that employs a relaxed box size for energy conservation (EC). Sharpening experiments were conducted over three study sites in California, and results were evaluated visually and quantitatively against LST data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) flights and from Landsat 8. Over the three sites, the modified DMS technique showed improved sharpening accuracy over the standard DMS for both ECOSTRESS and VIIRS, suggesting the effectiveness of relaxing EC box in relieving misalignment-induced errors. To achieve reasonable accuracy while minimizing loss of spatial detail due to the EC box size increase, an optimal EC box size of 180–270 m was identified for ECOSTRESS and about 780 m for VIIRS data based on experiments from the three sites. Results from this work will facilitate the development of a prototype system that generates high spatiotemporal resolution LST products for improved agricultural water use monitoring by synthesizing multi-source remote sensing data.}
