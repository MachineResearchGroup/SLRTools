abstract={Class-incremental learning has received considerable attention due to the better adaptability to constantly changing characteristic of online learning. The neural network is suitable for class-incremental learning because of batch training style and fine-tuning. However, as the rapid growth of data centers and data category, data isolated island problem presents a new challenge to the current machine learning model: how to provide an accurate training method in a distributed and incremental manner. Existing solutions cannot adapt to incremental classes without aggregating data. In this paper, we propose a distributed class-incremental learning framework, called DCIL, which iteratively updates new class parameters and fixes existing class parameters to achieve high training accuracy. Especially, we propose MF, a parameter fusion method to integrate the parameters of multi-nodes into a new global parameter. In order to match the requirements of identical columns corresponding to the known classes, we propose a single node class-incremental learning, called SCIL. To evaluate the performance of DCIL, we conduct experiments on 5 datasets under various parameter settings on both 2 and 4 nodes distributed scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm that DCIL outperform the general baselines and achieve classification accuracy closes to the method of data aggregating.},

abstract={Cloud computing is a technology that has gained rapid popularity in recent years. It has enabled use of immense computational power in a scalable and cost-efficient manner. Deployment of biometric technology in government and commercial organizations has become a standard security practice. However, independent biometric systems tend to be computationally and financially expensive, especially when user enrollment is high. A feasible solution is to create a biometric system on the cloud which can be used ubiquitously as an authentication service. In this paper, we propose a first cancelable biometric framework based on deep learning on the cloud. We establish that cloud is a good solution for biometric systems where intensive computation, quick response times, and high accuracy is required.},

abstract={In this fast developing world, the number of motor vehicles is increasing rapidly but road resources remain limited, causing severe congestion problem of city traffic. In order to predict short-term traffic condition accurately, we propose a short-term traffic condition prediction method for urban road network based on improved support vector machine. As outliers inevitably exist in collected traffic data, our method can effectively deal with the negative effects of outliers, thus enhance the robustness of the model and improve the generalization ability.

abstract={Urban living in modern large cities has significant adverse effects on health, increasing the risk of several chronic diseases. We focus on the two leading clusters of chronic diseases, heart disease and diabetes, and develop data-driven methods to predict hospitalizations due to these conditions. We base these predictions on the patients' medical history, recent and more distant, as described in their Electronic Health Records (EHRs). We formulate the prediction problem as a binary classification problem and consider a variety of machine learning methods, including kernelized and sparse Support Vector Machines (SVMs), sparse logistic regression, and random forests. To strike a balance between accuracy and interpretability of the prediction, which is important in a medical setting, we propose two novel methods: K -LRT, a likelihood ratio test-based method, and a Joint Clustering and Classification (JCC) method which identifies hidden patient clusters and adapts classifiers to each cluster. We develop theoretical out-of-sample guarantees for the latter method. We validate our algorithms on large data sets from the Boston Medical Center, the largest safety-net hospital system in New England.},

abstract={With the continuous growth of urban population, it is urgent for people to accurately plan the travel time. Therefore, travel time prediction of urban areas has become a key research direction in the field of smart cities. At present, several studies on travel time prediction are only conducted on a single mode, where the prediction process only treats a certain vehicle as an isolated traffic state on the route. However, the factors affecting traffic are extremely complex, thus making it very difficult to produce a comprehensive forecast. Based on this situation, the mixed existing model and mutual influence of multiple modes of transportation in the city are fully considered, and a multimodal deep learning model namely MC-GRU (Multimodal Convoluted Gated Recurrent Unit Network) is proposed. At the same time, to solve the problem of some objective factors, such as departure time and travel distance, we propose an attribute module to deal with these implicit factors. In addition, to explore the interaction between different modes of vehicles, a feature fusion module for obtaining the interaction effect between different modes of vehicles is proposed. Finally, we use GRU to learn the long-term dependence. MC-GRU can realize the accurate prediction of travel time in multimodal traffic state, as well as implement travel time prediction for three types of travel modes. The experimental results show that MC-GRU achieves higher prediction accuracy on a challenging real world dataset as compared with MAE, MAPE and RMSE.},

abstract={High penetration of renewable generations has imposed a significant challenge on power system small signal stability, as the stochastic nature of renewable energy makes the uncertainty scenarios increase dramatically. This paper proposes a data-driven model-free online small signal stability assessment (SSSA) method based on deep learning. The proposed method can provide real-time small signal stability results based on various historical data including wind speed, solar irradiation and power system operation data. The first step of the approach is to carry out the small signal analysis using modal analysis (MA) to generate the training database. Then from labeled database and other historical data, a deep learning based method is employed to learn how to make the right prediction of SSSA in real-time, without the knowledge of future wind or solar data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated and demonstrated in the paper by a typical 16-machine 68-bus test system.},

abstract={We propose a conceptual framework to predict the risk of freshwater source infestation by Schistosomiasis parasites. Our approach aims to combine two sources of information which are outputs of prediction models. The proposed framework is broken down into three Y-shaped branches. The left branch is a water quality prediction model built on the basis of machine learning algorithms applied on data collected by an IoT platform. These data represent physical and chemical parameters of a freshwater source which affect the development of snails and parasites that cause Schistosomiasis. The branch on the right is a non autonomous mathematical model which through its derived reproduction number R0 determines the density evolution of all actors involved in Schistosomiasis transmission life cycle. In the middle branch happens a fusion process which combines the two information by taking into account their uncertainty and complementary. The output of the fusion is the final decision about the risk of infestation. This work has focused on the identification of applicable machine learning algorithms for water quality prediction and the identification of a mathematical model. The work has consisted also to give the characteristics of the fusion problem to handle.},

abstract={Urban planning typically relies on experience-based solutions and traditional methodologies to face urbanization issues and investigate the complex dynamics of cities. Recently, novel data-driven approaches in urban computing have emerged for researchers and companies. They aim to address historical urbanization issues by exploiting sensing data gathered by mobile devices under the so-called mobile crowdsensing (MCS) paradigm. This work shows how to exploit sensing data to improve traditionally experience-based approaches for urban decisions. In particular, we apply widely known Machine Learning (ML) techniques to achieve highly accurate results in predicting categories of local businesses (LBs) (e.g., bars, restaurants), and their attractiveness in terms of classes of temporal demands (e.g., nightlife, business hours). The performance evaluation is conducted in Luxembourg city and the city of Munich with publicly available crowdsensed datasets. The results highlight that our approach does not only achieve high accuracy, but it also unveils important hidden features of the interaction of citizens and LBs.},

abstract={Recommender systems (RSs) commonly adopt a user-item rating matrix to describe users' preferences on items. With users and items exploding, such a matrix is usually high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS). Recently, the idea of deep learning has been applied to RSs. However, current deep-structured RSs suffer from high computational complexity. Enlightened by the idea of deep forest, this paper proposes a deep latent factor model (DLFM) for building a deep-structured RS on an HiDS matrix efficiently. Its main idea is to construct a deep-structured model by sequentially connecting multiple latent factor (LF) models instead of multilayered neural networks through a nonlinear activation function. Thus, the computational complexity grows linearly with its layer count, which is easy to resolve in practice. The experimental results on four HiDS matrices from industrial RSs demonstrate that when compared with state-of-the-art LF models and deep-structured RSs, DLFM can well balance the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, which well fits the desire of industrial RSs for fast and right recommendations.},

abstract={With the ubiquitous deployment of wireless systems and pervasive availability of smart devices, indoor localization is empowering numerous location-based services. With the established radio maps, WiFi fingerprinting has become one of the most practical approaches to localize mobile users. However, most fingerprint-based localization algorithms are computationintensive, with heavy dependence on both offline training phase and online localization phase. In this paper, we propose CNNLoc, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based indoor localization system with WiFi fingerprints for multi-building and multifloor localization. Specifically, we devise a novel classification model by combining a Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) with a onedimensional CNN. The SAE is utilized to precisely extract key features from sparse Received Signal Strength (RSS) data while the CNN is trained to effectively achieve high success rates in the positioning phase. We evaluate the proposed system on the UJIIndoorLoc dataset and Tampere dataset with several stateof-the-art methods. The results show CNNLoc outperforms the existing solutions with 100% and 95% success rates on buildinglevel localization and floor-level localization, respectively.},

abstract={Recommender systems make recommendations on items to users according to historical information such as ratings and comments. Most traditional recommender systems focus on mining the ratings but ignore the comments which contain abundant information. These systems suffer from the cold-start problem very much when there is insufficient ratings. In this paper, we introduce a deep neural network framework which learns latent factors of users and items jointly from the comment texts. The proposed framework, named Parallel Deep Neural Networks (PDNNs), has two parallel deep neural networks. One for learning latent factors of users and the other for items. A shared layer couples these two DNNs and makes rating prediction in the manner of matrix factorization techniques. In practice, we use Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for comments mining. Sufficient experiments on various datasets show that both models perform better than traditional rating-only recommendation methods, especially for cold-start problem.},

abstract={Brain Hemorrhage is the eruption of the brain arteries due to high blood pressure or blood clotting that could be a cause of traumatic injury or death. It is the medical emergency in which a doctor also need years of experience to immediately diagnose the region of the internal bleeding before starting the treatment. In this study, the deep learning models Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), hybrid models CNN + LSTM and CNN + GRU are proposed for the Brain Hemorrhage classification. The 200 head CT scan images dataset is used to boost the accuracy rate and computational power of the deep learning models. The major aim of this study is to use the abstraction power of deep learning on a set of fewer images because in most crucial cases extensive datasets are not available on the spot. The image augmentation and imbalancing the dataset methods are adopted with CNN model to design a unique architecture and named as Brain Hemorrhage Classification based on Neural Network (BHCNet). The performance of the proposed approach are analyzed in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score. Further, the experimental results are evaluated by comparative analyses of the balanced and imbalanced dataset with CNN, CNN + LSTM and CNN + GRU models. The promising results are achieved with CNN by imbalancing the dataset and gain highest accuracy that outperforms the hybrid CNN + LSTM and CNN + GRU models. The results reveals the effectiveness of the proposed model for accurate prediction to save the life of the patient in the meantime and fast employment in the real life scenario.},

Thus, how to track and locate these devices has become a problem. The traditional sensors positioning is achieved by manually recording the position of the sensor or using RSSI measurement. However, these traditional methods suffer from high costs, inaccurate positioning accuracy and high complexity. Different from the traditional sensor positioning algorithm, our design locates the position of sensors by learning the pattern of atmospheric pressure data collected by the sensor. Firstly, we designed the IoT data collection networks which can collect indoor environment data through WiFi, such as light, atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, etc. Secondly, the original data is preprocessed by removing abnormal points, adding missing points and filtering noise. Finally, using the processed data, a restricted Boltzmann machine is applied to obtain the pattern between the atmospheric pressure and floors. Experimental results indicated that our sensor positioning algorithm provides high-precision floor positioning.},

abstract={With the rise of smart cities, transportation systems are getting smarter every day. An Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) should be secure, autonomous, capable of discerning safeness levels at the roads, and provide services to improve human experience. To reach the gold standard, the ITS faces several issues such as centralization, trust, and data integrity. The Transportation System and the data generated from the vehicles can be intercepted, manipulated and corrupted with coordinated attacks. Moreover, every system might have bad actors who want to manipulate the system or data to his or her favor by exploiting the system. In order to guarantee data integrity, immutability, and availability for the ITS, we propose Blockchain based architecture with outlier detection to prevent malicious activity by the vehicles while preserving integrity in sharing information. The Outlier Detection is designed to reside before the consensus process, to identify and prevent participation of malicious vehicles in consensus process or block mining. In our proposed Blockchain based Intelligent Transportation system with Outlier Detection for Smart City (BITS), we used machine learning to detect the anomaly in the data. The proposed model can be used in various applications of ITS such as traffic monitoring, criminal activity profiling, accident detection and reporting, etc.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, systems, and applications demonstrate potential in serving smart city development. Crowdsensing approaches for road surface conditions monitoring can benefit smart city road information services. Deteriorated roads induce vehicle damage, traffic congestion, and driver discomfort which influence traffic management. In this paper, we propose a framework for monitoring road surface anomalies. We analyze the common road surface types and irregularities as well as their impact on vehicle motion. In addition to the traditional use of sensors available in smart devices, we utilize the vehicle motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) presently available in most land vehicles. Various land vehicles were used in this paper, spanning different sizes, and year model for extensive road experiments. These trajectories were used to collect and build multiple labeled data sets that were used in the system structure. In order to enhance the performance of the sensor measurements, wavelet packet de-noising is used in this paper to enable efficient classification of road surface anomalies. We adopt statistical, time domain, and frequency domain features to distinguish different road anomalies. The descriptive data sets collected in this paper are used to build, train, and test a system classifier through machine learning techniques to detect and categorize multiple road anomalies with different severity levels. Furthermore, we analyze and assess the capabilities of the smart devices and the other vehicle motion sensors to accurately geo-reference the road surface anomalies. Several road test experiments examine the benefits and assess the performance of the proposed architecture.},

abstract={With the booming development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and communication technologies such as 5G, our future world is envisioned as an interconnected entity where billions of devices will provide uninterrupted service to our daily lives and the industry. Meanwhile, these devices will generate massive amounts of valuable data at the network edge, calling for not only instant data processing but also intelligent data analysis in order to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. Both the traditional cloud computing and on-device computing cannot sufficiently address this problem due to the high latency and the limited computation capacity, respectively. Fortunately, the emerging edge computing sheds a light on the issue by pushing the data processing from the remote network core to the local network edge, remarkably reducing the latency and improving the efficiency. Besides, the recent breakthroughs in deep learning have greatly facilitated the data processing capacity, enabling a thrilling development of novel applications, such as video surveillance and autonomous driving. The convergence of edge computing and deep learning is believed to bring new possibilities to both interdisciplinary researches and industrial applications. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest efforts on the deep-learning-enabled edge computing applications and particularly offer insights on how to leverage the deep learning advances to facilitate edge applications from four domains, i.e., smart multimedia, smart transportation, smart city, and smart industry. We also highlight the key research challenges and promising research directions therein. We believe this survey will inspire more researches and contributions in this promising field.},

abstract={Apache Spark is an open source distributed data processing platform, which can use distributed memory abstraction to process large volume of data efficiently. With the application of Apache Spark more and more widely, some problems are exposed. One of the most important aspects is the performance problem. Apache Spark has more than 180 configuration parameters, which can be adjusted by users according to their own specific application so as to optimize the performance. Currently these parameters are tuned manually by trial and error, which is ineffective due to the large parameter space and the complex interactions among the parameters. In this paper, in order to make the parameter tuning process of Spark more effective, a novel method for tuning configuration of Spark based on machine learning is proposed, which is composed of binary classification and multi-classification. This method can be used to auto-tune the configuration parameters of Spark. Furthermore, several common machine learning algorithms based on the proposed method are explored, and experimental results show that decision tree model (C5.0) is the best model considering the accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, the experimental results also show that the performance can get average 36% gain with the proposed method compared with the default configuration of Spark.},

abstract={Smart-city intersections will play a crucial role in automated traffic management and improvement in pedestrian safety in cities of the future. They will (i) aggregate data from in-vehicle and infrastructure sensors; (ii) process the data by taking advantage of low-latency high-bandwidth communications, edge-cloud computing, and AI-based detection and tracking of objects; and (iii) provide intelligent feedback and input to control systems. The Cloud Enhanced Open Software Defined Mobile Wireless Testbed for City-Scale Deployment (COSMOS) enables research on technologies supporting smart cities. In this paper, we provide results of experiments using bird's eye cameras to detect and track vehicles and pedestrians from the COSMOS pilot site. We assess the capabilities for real-time computation, and detection and tracking accuracy - by evaluating and customizing a selection of video pre-processing and deep-learning algorithms. Distinct issues that are associated with the difference in scale for bird's eye view of pedestrians vs. cars are explored and addressed: the best multiple-object tracking accuracies (MOTA) for cars are around 73.2, and around 2.8 for pedestrians. The real-time goal of 30 frames-per-second - i.e., a total of 33.3 ms of latency for object detection for vehicles will be reachable once the processing time is improved roughly by a factor of three.},

Aiming at the problems of sparse user government behavior data and difficulty in mining hidden features, this paper proposes a two-tower model that integrates user churn. A deep neural network is constructed to characterize user item characteristics, and the influence of user churn factor on feature weights is also considered. At the same time, the random forest algorithm is introduced to weight the characteristics of user churn, and the characteristics of the two towers model are combined to achieve personalized ranking recommendation. The experimental results show that our proposed model is better than the original features, and this model has been successfully deployed in the “My Ningxia” government recommendation system, and the user experience has been significantly improved.},

abstract={COVID-19 is currently become a global problem, including in Jakarta, Indonesia. There have been many approaches to predict COVID-19 occurrence, including the forecasting approach. However, the traditional forecasting method, particularly machine learning, often does not consider the condition of the data, although it has forms of the count, such as the number of cases. This study employs an autoregression model using Poisson distribution in predicting the COVID-19 future cases, namely the positive and recovery number. We compare the Poisson Autoregression with several well-known forecasting methods, namely ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, BATS, and Prophet. This study found that Poisson Autoregression could create an accurate prediction with MAPE below 20% and tend to follows the actual data for the next 8 to 14 days to the future. Thus, this approach can forecast the future cases of COVID-19 and other cases that use count data in Jakarta, like the number of citizen complaints or transportation context.},

abstract={Latent factor (LF) models are highly effective in extracting useful knowledge from High-Dimensional and Sparse (HiDS) matrices which are commonly seen in various industrial applications. An LF model usually adopts iterative optimizers, which may consume many iterations to achieve a local optima, resulting in considerable time cost. Hence, determining how to accelerate the training process for LF models has become a significant issue. To address this, this work proposes a randomized latent factor (RLF) model. It incorporates the principle of randomized learning techniques from neural networks into the LF analysis of HiDS matrices, thereby greatly alleviating computational burden. It also extends a standard learning process for randomized neural networks in context of LF analysis to make the resulting model represent an HiDS matrix correctly. Experimental results on three HiDS matrices from industrial applications demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art LF models, RLF is able to achieve significantly higher computational efficiency and comparable prediction accuracy for missing data. I provides an important alternative approach to LF analysis of HiDS matrices, which is especially desired for industrial applications demanding highly efficient models.},

abstract={This paper proposes a new 3D multi-object tracker to more robustly track objects that are temporarily missed by detectors. Our tracker can better leverage object features for 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in point clouds. The proposed tracker is based on a novel data association scheme guided by prediction confidence, and it consists of two key parts. First, we design a new predictor that employs a constant acceleration (CA) motion model to estimate future positions, and outputs a prediction confidence to guide data association through increased awareness of detection quality. Second, we introduce a new aggregated pairwise cost to exploit features of objects in point clouds for faster and more accurate data association. The proposed cost consists of geometry, appearance and motion components. Specifically, we formulate the geometry cost using resolutions (lengths, widths and heights), centroids, and orientations of 3D bounding boxes (BBs), the appearance cost using appearance features from the deep learning-based detector backbone network, and the motion cost by associating different motion vectors. Extensive multi-object tracking experiments on the KITTI tracking benchmark demonstrated that our method outperforms, by a large margin, the state-of-the-art methods in both tracking accuracy and speed.},

The inspection results assist traffic management departments to take immediate measures to update and maintain traffic signs after natural disasters leading to many damaged traffic signs. Our approach involves four steps: Firstly, we use a deep learning network, Fast regions with convolutional neural network (Fast R-CNN), to train a traffic sign detector in an open benchmark, where the images are more variable and have a higher resolution. Then, traffic signs in images are detected by using the trained detector. Next, the area of the traffic sign, based on the sign area in the image, is roughly detected in MLS point clouds. Then, an accurate traffic sign is detected. Finally, some placement parameters of the traffic sign are measured for damage inspection and further inventory. Our proposed approach is validated on a set of point-clouds acquired by a RIEGL VMX-450 MLS system. Experimental results demonstrate that the rapidity and reliability of our proposed approach in traffic sign detection and damage inspection are robust.},

This paper proposes a communication method to decrease redundant transmissions of parameters without changing the semantics of the algorithm. Before the training, we identify the parts of the collective communication that can be omitted and replace them with direct communication between the nodes requesting the intermediate results. We implemented this algorithm and evaluated it on a cluster of five nodes connected with 10-Gbps Ethernet. The evaluation using a real dataset showed that our method reduced the number of elements exchanged between nodes and shortened the communication time.},

abstract={The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) technology enables smart building management and operation to improve building energy efficiency and occupant thermal comfort. In this paper, we perform data analysis using the IoT generated building data to derive accurate thermal comfort model for smart building control. Deep neural network (DNN) is used to model the relationship between the controllable building operations and thermal comfort. As thermal comfort is determined by multiple comfort factors, a fine-grained architecture is proposed, where an exclusive model is trained for each factor and accordingly the corresponding thermal comfort can be evaluated. The experimental results show that the proposed fine-grained DNN outperforms its coarse-grained counterpart by 3.5× and is 1.7×, 2.5×, 2.4×, and 1.9× more accurate compared to four popular machine learning algorithms. Besides, DNN's performance promotes with deeper network topology and more neurons, and a simple topology with the same number of neurons per network hidden layer is sufficient to achieve high modeling accuracy. Finally, the derived thermal comfort model reveals a linear relationship between comfort and air conditioning setpoint.

abstract={A significant problem nowadays is detection of Web traffic generated by automatic software agents (Web bots). Some studies have dealt with this task by proposing various approaches to Web traffic classification in order to distinguish the traffic stemming from human users' visits from that generated by bots. Most of previous works addressed the problem of offline bot recognition, based on available information on user sessions completed on a Web server. Very few approaches, however, have been proposed to recognize bots online, before the session completes. This paper proposes a novel approach to binary classification of a multivariate data stream incoming on a Web server, in order to recognize ongoing user sessions as generated by bots or humans. The present approach uses deep neural networks combined with Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test to express the relationship between subsequent HTTP requests in an ongoing session and to assess the likelihood of each session being generated by a bot or human before it ends. Experimental results showed the ability of the proposed approach to detect Web bots online with high performance scores and a small number of false negatives, as evidenced by the Recall index, minimizing the impact on human visitors. Another valuable indicator is the speed of decision: the present method allows very quick classification of nearly all sessions, leaving only very few of them undecided.},

abstract={With the development of visual devices and artificial intelligence technologies, many researchers focus on how to deploy a massive of IoT devices efficiently. The visual devices in smart cities produce large amount of real-time visual data, which challenges the ability of current transmission architecture in Cloud computing. We address how to improve the utilization of both computation and transmission resources for visual data processing through introducing the Fog computing technologies. We propose to use deep learning models and salient zones extraction method to decrease the data amount as well as maintaining important features of visual data. Furthermore, we develop how to arrange Fog nodes reasonably according to the location of the end devices and the data produced from the devices. Simulation results on public video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 48.85% in term of SSIM higher than that of HEVC. The proposed approach decreases the delay by around 75.93% than the traditional transmission without Fog nodes. The proposed method achieves a high compression ratio and guarantees the quality of the video.},

abstract={Deep learning-based algorithms provide a promising solution to efficiently generate offloading decisions in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. However, considering dynamic MEC devices or offloading tasks, most of them require large-scale training data and long training time to retrain the deep neural networks (DNNs). In this letter, we propose a MEta-Learning-based computation Offloading (MELO) algorithm for dynamic computation tasks in MEC networks. Specifically, it learns from historical MEC task scenarios and adapts to a new MEC task scenario with a few training samples. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can adapt to a new MEC task scenario and achieve 99% accuracy via 1-step fine-tuning using only 10 training samples.},

abstract={Smart Farming is a technique that offers high-ended application of modern farming by acquiring multiple data from sensors, robots, live stream, social media, etc. The concept of integrating these various data from multiple sources and processing it using multilevel databases is referred to as big data. Till today, there have been various developments in smart farming using image processing, data mining, IOT, etc. but as of now, Machine Learning is the industry which is emerging at a rapid pace. There has been an increasing demand related to real time applications in machine learning using supervised or unsupervised methods. The current scenario of traditional farming includes manually taking data, unpredictable weather conditions, sprinkling pesticides on diseases, etc. to yield productions, which is paving way to life threats for farmers especially in drought areas. With reference to the current scenario in traditional farming, there has been a dire need of predicated data in farming which can help farmers to know about their real time problems and act accordingly. To resolve their problems, we would like to propose a system which can predict cotton crop diseases using `Decision Tree Classifier' by taking parameters as temperature, soil moisture, etc. This would help farmers by providing better quality productions and we would be also focusing on building an android application which will give real time output to the farmers in efficient ways.},

abstract={The smart city landscape is rife with opportunities for mobility and economic optimization, but also presents many security concerns spanning the range of components and systems in the smart ecosystem. One key enabler for this ecosystem is smart transportation and transit, which is foundationally built upon connected vehicles. Ensuring vehicular security, while necessary to guarantee passenger and pedestrian safety, is itself challenging due to the broad attack surfaces of modern automotive systems. A single car contains dozens to hundreds of small embedded computing devices known as electronic control units (ECUs) executing hundreds of millions of lines of code; the inherent complexity of this tightly integrated cyber-physical system (CPS) is one of the key problems that frustrate effective security. We describe an approach to help reduce the complexity of security analyses by leveraging unsupervised machine learning to learn clusters of messages passed between ECUs that correlate with changes in the CPS state of a vehicle as it moves throughout the world. Our approach can help to improve the security of vehicles in a smart city, and can leverage smart city infrastructure to further enrich and refine the quality of the machine learning output.},

abstract={Exposure to natural daylight has a positive impact on human health and wellbeing. The non-visual effects of daylight stimulate a response in the circadian system which oversees fundamental mechanisms within the human body, such as metabolism, hormone balance and sleep-wake cycles. For people with dementia, the working capacity and regularity of these processes becomes further compromised as their exposure to daylight is reduced, due largely to age-contributing factors such as increased eye sensitivity and reduced mobility. In light of this, artificial lighting has been revolutionised to enable tailored output based on the photobiological demands of humans. This is known as biodynamic lighting which encompasses varying light intensity and spectral composition. Within dementia cohorts, this design concept has not been well studied, making it difficult to optimally administer and quantify related benefits. Fortunately, by building on the recent progression in the fields of machine learning and the internet of things, the potential for simultaneous behaviour monitoring and actuation of lighting intervention technologies is possible, enabling production of a viable biodynamic lighting solution. To this end, the present study provides a review of related work in the field of biodynamic technology designed to improve wellbeing in dementia, and identifies areas where improvements may be made. Following this, a proposed solution for future study designs and technologies is suggested. The proposed solution exists in the prototype stage, with a route to deploying in care facilities in the near future.},

abstract={Training a problem-solving Machine Learning (ML) model using large datasets is computationally expensive and requires a scalable distributed training platform to complete training within a reasonable time frame. In this paper, we propose a novel concept where, instead of distributed training within a GPU cluster, we train one ML model by utilizing the idle hardware of numerous resource-constrained IoT devices existing across the globe. In such a global setting, staleness and real-world network uncertainties like congestion, latency, bandwidth issues are proven to impact the model convergence speed and training scalability. To implement the novel concept, while simultaneously addressing the real-world global distributed training challenges, we present Globe2Train (G2T), a framework with two components named G2T-Cloud (G2T-C) and G2T-Device (G2T-D) that can efficiently connect together multiple IoT devices and collectively train to produce the target ML models at very high speeds. The evaluation results with analysis show how the framework components jointly eliminate staleness and improve training scalability and speed by tolerating the real-world network uncertainties and by reducing the communication-to-computation ratio.},

abstract={Nowadays, driven by the rapid development of smart mobile equipments and 5G network technologies, the application scenarios of Internet of Things (IoT) technology are becoming increasingly widespread. The integration of IoT and industrial manufacturing systems forms the industrial IoT (IIoT). Because of the limitation of resources, such as the computation unit and battery capacity in the IIoT equipments (IIEs), computation-intensive tasks need to be executed in the mobile edge computing (MEC) server. However, the dynamics and continuity of task generation lead to a severe challenge to the management of limited resources in IIoT. In this article, we investigate the dynamic resource management problem of joint power control and computing resource allocation for MEC in IIoT. In order to minimize the long-term average delay of the tasks, the original problem is transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP). Considering the dynamics and continuity of task generation, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based dynamic resource management (DDRM) algorithm to solve the formulated MDP problem. Our DDRM algorithm exploits the deep deterministic policy gradient and can deal with the high-dimensional continuity of the action and state spaces. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the DDRM can reduce the long-term average delay of the tasks effectively.},

abstract={Deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown good results in activity recognition. One of the advantages of using these methods resides in their ability to generate features automatically. This ability greatly simplifies the task of feature extraction that usually requires domain specific knowledge, especially when using big data where data driven approaches can lead to anti-patterns. Despite the advantage of this approach, very little work has been undertaken on analyzing the quality of extracted features, and more specifically on how model architecture and parameters affect the ability of those features to separate activity classes in the final feature space. This work focuses on identifying the optimal parameters for recognition of simple activities applying this approach on both signals from inertial and audio sensors. The paper provides the following contributions: (i) a comparison of automatically extracted CNN features with gold standard Human Crafted Features (HCF) is given, (ii) a comprehensive analysis on how architecture and model parameters affect separation of target classes in the feature space. Results are evaluated using publicly available datasets. In particular, we achieved a 93.38% F-Score on the UCI-HAR dataset, using 1D CNNs with 3 convolutional layers and 32 kernel size, and a 90.5% F-Score on the DCASE 2017 development dataset, simplified for three classes (indoor, outdoor and vehicle), using 2D CNNs with 2 convolutional layers and a 2×2 kernel size.},

abstract={Analyzing surveillance videos is mandatory for the public and industrial security. Overwhelming growth in computer vision fields has been made to automate the surveillance system in terms of human activity recognition such as behavior analysis, Violence Detection (VD), etc. However, it is challenging to detect and analyze the violent scenes intelligently to fulfill the notion of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based surveillance buoyed by constrained resources to reduce computational power. To tackle this challenge, an Artificial Intelligence enabled IIoT-based framework with VD-Network (VD-Net) is proposed. First, the input video frames are passed to light-weight convolutional neural network model for important information collection including humans or suspicious objects such as Knives/Guns. Upon suspicious object detection, an alert is generated as an earlier VD in IIoT network while the information is shared with concern departments. Only the frames with objects are forwarded to cloud for detail investigation where features are extracted using Convolutional Long Short-term Memory (ConvLSTM). The latter from ConvLSTM is propagated to Gated Recurrent Unit for final VD. The conducted experiments and ablation study on the existing surveillance and non-surveillance datasets empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed VD-Net by improving 3.9% increase in the accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VD methods.},

abstract={Monitoring traffic congestion in smart cities is a challenging problem of great importance in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Most previous works focused on developing machine learning models that can predict traffic congestion on a meshcode (i.e., a portion of an earth's surface) at a particular time instance. The key limitation of these studies is that they fail to provide holistic information regarding the sets of meshcodes in which regular congestion may happen in the forecasted data. This paper proposes a novel framework to address this problem. The proposed framework employs a 3DCNN multi-source deep learning model (hereafter, called Fusion-3DCNN) to predict traffic congestion on a particular meshcode at a particular time instance. The predicted traffic congestion data is later transformed into a temporal database and feed to the periodic-frequent pattern mining algorithm to identify the sets of meshcode in which regular congestions may happen in the predicted data. Experimental results on real-world traffic congestion data demonstrate that the proposed framework is efficient.},

abstract={Delivery route optimization is one of the possible applications on smart meter infrastructure. On the premise of security and user's agreement on data usage, electricity data from smart meter enables occupancy prediction for absent delivery avoidance. However, it is necessary to solve two technical issues to realize this. The occupancy prediction needs to be applicable without collecting the occupancy labels. The other is to calculate the shortest route while avoiding the absent destination using a given occupancy probability. For occupancy prediction, this study evaluated the generalization performance of proposed methods by collecting electricity consumption data and occupancy labels for 23 households in addition to the existing dataset. Then, we conducted actual parcel deliveries with delivery operators on the proposed system to 150 households. While it succeeded in reducing 50% of absent delivery in a real-world environment, total delivery distance increased. Thus, we constructed a new problem formulation, “Traveling Salesman Problem with Occupancy Prediction (TSP with OCP),” to solve route optimization problems considering occupancy probability and absent delivery cost. As a result of the simulation, TSP with OCP showed a 16% improvement in total distance than TSP without OCP.},

However, the amount of PV power generated is unstable because it depends on weather conditions. For this reason, accurate prediction of PV power is required by electric power suppliers, and various forecast methods have been proposed, such as methods using machine learning. This study uses another method that predicts the short-term output of geographically distributed PV systems from the optical flow which is one of image processing methods of normalized output power distribution by applying motion compensation prediction, which is a technology for estimation of motion images. In this paper, we compare the proposed method with the persistence forecast, and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. As a result, the average MAPE of the proposed method was 4.62 %, whereas that of persistence forecast was 6.4 %, which indicates that the proposed method is an effective approach for PV power forecast.},

abstract={Short-term traffic prediction in transportation net-work is a hot topic for next generation smart cities. Despite several research efforts, there is still a lack of consensus about the most effective way to predict traffic network-wide. Also, the majority of existing studies rely on either small data sets or limited portions of the transportation network. This paper presents the results of a forecasting study related to on-board units data of heavy-goods vehicles in the Brussels-Capital Region. The analysis, enabled by deployment of a big data infrastructure, concerns the short horizon (one hour ahead) forecasting of trucks flow (vehicles/hour) and mean speed (km/hour) over Brussels-Capital Region's network. Both parametric and non-parametric (notably machine learning) models are designed and assessed along with different strategies (simple and linear forecasts combination, individual model selection). The paper shows the potential of large amounts of real-time data obtained from moving sensors where forecasting techniques are applied network-wide. In particular, simple combination schemes (notably the simple median combination forecasts) appear to outperform the other methods in terms of prediction accuracy.},

abstract={Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) is an effective method for measuring the distance between two probability distributions, but it is not a metric. In particular, JSD does not satisfy the triangle inequality, thus raising concerns over robustness issue for qualifying as a valid distance measure. JSD's square root is a metric while preserving all other characteristics of JSD. However, it does not provide adequate separation when the difference between input distributions is subtle. We extend metric version of JSD by reformulating it using alternate operators that provide different properties concerning robustness. Furthermore, we prove a number of important mathematical properties for this extension. Finally, we propose a family of new kernels, based on metric JSD and Chisini mean. We explore the utility of proposed technique, Metric-Chisini-Jensen-Shannon Divergence (M-CJSD), in SVM classification for IoT sensor data which presents data nuances challenges making it difficult to discriminate distributions with discernible differences. Additionally, we build a deep neural network (DNN) for performance benchmark, and explore an optimization approach to improve k-Means clustering. We found that while clustering is unable to detect visually identifiable clusters, M-CJSDs were able to capture underlying data regularity and give statistically significant improvement over DNN model.},

abstract={In India, there is a paper based medical record of all citizens dispersed at various dispensaries and hospitals. A lack of central repository does not provide complete information about any patient's medical history. These are some of the major setbacks in the fields of medical science. Our aim is to address some of these setbacks by using technology to aid medical science. This paper aims at providing a smart solution by developing a project that comprises of a repository for obtaining the entire medical records of any Indian citizen by linking their medical details to the Aadhar card. Currently, each and every Indian citizen's details have been linked to their Aadhar card which has become a unique identification of all Indian citizens. On the same lines, this project adopts the use of Aadhar card to provide unique identity to the medical records for deep analysis and management. In addition, using the concept of data mining, it provides various functionalities to doctors, who can analyze the medical records to improve their diagnosis & amalgamate their observations. Further, it comprises of a prediction system for predicting the diseases and disorders which use the concepts of machine learning and artificial neural networks & also provides online upload or download of medical reports. It also provides various functionalities to Indian citizens, who can get continuous notifications regarding dosage timings as prescribed by their doctors. Lastly, they can store their entire medical related information & view the dispensaries or hospitals based on the consultation charges and ratings. Additionally, it provides chemists with a functionality to analyze sales of a particular medicine in a particular area by using the concept of data mining to provide smart analysis.},

abstract={Feature aggregation is a crucial step in many methods of image classification, like the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model or the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In this aggregation step, usually known as spatial pooling, the descriptors of neighbouring elements within a region of the image are combined into a local or a global feature vector. The combined vector must contain relevant information, while removing irrelevant and confusing details. Maximum and average are the most common aggregation functions used in the pooling step. To improve the aggregation of relevant information without degrading their discriminative power for classification in this work we propose the use of Ordered Weighted operators. We provide an extensive evaluation that shows that the final result of the classification using OWA aggregation is always better than average pooling and better than maximum pooling when dealing with small dictionary sizes.},

year={2018},
volume={},

pages={893-898},
abstract={Predicting vehicle flows is of great importance to traffic management and public safety in smart cities, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex factors, such as spatio-temporal dependencies with external factors (e.g., holidays, events and weather). Recently, deep learning has shown remarkable performance on traditional challenging tasks, such as image classification, due to its powerful feature learning capabilities. Some works have utilized LSTMs to connect the high-level layers of 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the spatio-temporal features, and have shown better performance as compared to many classical methods in traffic prediction. However, these works only build temporal connections on the high-level features at the top layer while leaving the spatio-temporal correlations in the low-level layers not fully exploited. In this paper, we propose to apply 3D CNNs to learn the spatio-temporal correlation features jointly from low-level to high-level layers for traffic data. We also design an end-to-end structure, named as MST3D, especially for vehicle flow prediction. MST3D can learn spatial and multiple temporal dependencies jointly by multiple 3D CNNs, combine the learned features with external factors and assign different weights to different branches dynamically. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework that utilizes 3D CNNs for traffic prediction. Experiments on two vehicle flow datasets Beijing and New York City have demonstrated that the proposed framework, MST3D, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose Federated Deep Learning (FDL) for intrusion detection in heterogeneous networks. Local Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are used to learn the hierarchical representations of the private network traffic data in multiple edge nodes. A dedicated central server receives the parameters of the local DNN models from the edge nodes, and it aggregates them to produce an FDL model using the Fed+ fusion algorithm. Simulation results show that the FDL model achieved an accuracy of 99.27 ± 0.79%, a precision of 97.03 ± 4.22%, a recall of 98.06 ± 1.72%, an F1 score of 97.50 ± 2.55%, and a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 2.40 ± 2.47%. The classification performance and the generalisation ability of the FDL model are better than those of the local DNN models. The Fed+ algorithm outperformed two state-of-the-art fusion algorithms, namely federated averaging (FedAvg) and Coordinate Median (CM). Therefore, the DNN-Fed+ model is preferable for intrusion detection in heterogeneous wireless networks.},

abstract={It is of great significance for load monitoring to monitor illegal use of electricity. Load monitoring can provide supervision for government and improve residents' awareness of safety. Compared with the intrusive load monitoring, non-intrusive load monitoring has the advantages of good economy, high reliability, and quickly realizing the electricity decomposition. Many scholars have carried out this research, but there still exists the problems: it is difficult to obtain key information from big data and the diagnostic results are inaccuracy. Therefore, load monitoring is conducted in this paper. To overcome the above shortcomings, firstly this paper obtains key information of sample based on harmonic analysis. Secondly, random forest based on multiple decision trees has better accuracy in recognition. So the random forest algorithm is applied to machine learning and pattern recognition. Finally, the proposed method is identified and analyzed. The results show that the accuracy of the online electrical detection based on the harmonic analysis and random forest algorithm is greater than 86%, which shows the effectiveness of the method.},

abstract={In the context of the European project SimuSafe, various studies using the Honda Riding Trainer (HRT) simulator have been carried out. The resulting simulations from these studies are designed on the basis of a set of predefined scenarios and aim to analyze the motorcyclists' behavior when interacting with the infrastructure. Furthermore, the analysis of the risk incurred by the riders' maneuvers is of utmost importance to ensure their safety in realistic situations. However, the nature of road patterns (left or right turns, roundabouts and straight lines) is unknown in advance and should be deduced from the rider's behavior or by extracting some infrastructure-based features from GPS track. This paper concentrates on the segmentation of trajectories and identification of different road patterns using sensory data and extracted features with the aim to facilitate the analysis of potential risks related to each pattern. To conduct this analysis, three non-supervised machine learning techniques are evaluated and their performances are compared. Finally, an exploratory cross analysis between the identified situations and rider's dynamic behaviors allows for a more in-depth understanding of riders' decisions.},

abstract={Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been widely used to address the sparsity and cold start problems in recommendation system. By propagating embeddings from multi-hop neighbor nodes among the interaction graph and update target user and item embeddings, GNNs-based methods can achieve better recommendation performance. But those methods directly concatenate the output of each layer and ignore the different influences between different layers, and they simply use the inner product of the user and item’s embeddings to calculate the similarity and make recommendation based on it, which is insufficient to reveal the complex and nonlinear interactions.In this work, we propose to learn multi-order interactions between users and items and capture correlations between different-order information. We design a new recommendation framework MCCR, which treats each layer’s output as differentorder feature, and propose a multi-order interaction module to represent feature interactions. We adopt a multi-layer 3D CNN module to learn high-order interaction signals between users and items in an explicit approach. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, which shows that MCCR evidently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods consistently.},

During natural disasters, users may post text and image data on social media platforms to report information about infrastructure damage, injured people, cautions and warnings. Effective processing and analysing tweets in real time can help city organisations gain situational awareness of the affected citizens and take timely operations. With the advances in deep learning techniques, recent studies have significantly improved the performance in classifying crisis-related tweets. However, deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which may be imperceptible to the human, but can lead to model's misclassification.

abstract={This paper proposes a novel framework for automated detection of urban road manhole covers using mobile laser scanning (MLS) data. First, to narrow searching regions and reduce the computational complexity, road surface points are segmented from a raw point cloud via a curb-based road surface segmentation approach and rasterized into a georeferenced intensity image through inverse distance weighted interpolation. Then, a supervised deep learning model is developed to construct a multilayer feature generation model for depicting high-order features of local image patches. Next, a random forest model is trained to learn mappings from high-order patch features to the probabilities of the existence of urban road manhole covers centered at specific locations. Finally, urban road manhole covers are detected from georeferenced intensity images based on the multilayer feature generation model and random forest model. Quantitative evaluations show that the proposed algorithm achieves an average completeness, correctness, quality, and F1-measure of 0.955, 0.959, 0.917, and 0.957, respectively, in detecting urban road manhole covers from georeferenced intensity images. Comparative studies demonstrate the advantageous performance of the proposed algorithm over other existing methods for rapid and automated detection of urban road manhole covers using MLS data.},

The need for protecting secure data hosted on the web has been rising exponentially as organizations are moving their applications online. Static methods of authentication cannot completely guarantee the genuineness of a user. This has led to the development of multi-factor authentication systems. Risk-based authentication, a form of multi factor authentication adapts itself according to the risk profile of the users. This paper puts forth the design of risk engine integrated with the system to examine the user's past login records and generate a suitable pattern using machine learning algorithms to calculate the risk level of the user. The risk level further decides the authentication method that the user will be challenged with. Thus the adaptive authentication model helps in providing a higher level of security to its users.},

abstract={In this paper, the sausage is taken as the research object. Firstly, the total number of sausage colonies is quantitatively analyzed using spectral data of hyperspectral imaging technology. In order to improve the accuracy of the regression prediction model, the key parameters C and gamma of the regression model are optimized, so that it could accurately and quickly predict the total number of sausage colonies. Then, a method of detecting, classifying and identifying sausage key qualities by combining hyperspectral curve features (spectrum) and hyperspectral image depth features is proposed. CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) is used to extract the features of hyperspectral images. At the same time, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of hyperspectral curve data (spectrum). Then, the two feature data are fused, and the machine learning algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM) is combined with PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm to classify sausage quality. At last, the experimental results show that PSO+SVM could be used for classification with 99% accuracy after the fusion of spectral curve features and image features. Moreover, the experimental results give the feasibility and effectiveness of this method.},

abstract={Identification of network traffic accurately at its early stage is very important for network traffic management and application traffic classification. In recent years, this becomes very hot topic to identify traffic at its early stage. Unidirectional and bidirectional statistical features are effective features and widely used in Internet traffic classification. However, it is important to evaluate and select effective features for Instant Messaging (IM) application traffic classification at early stage. In this paper we are interested to find out robust and effective features at early stage. We firstly extract 22 statistical features of the first flow on two different network environment traffic datasets include on HIT and NIMS datasets. Then mutual information is conducted between the extract statistical features to select the effective features. Additionally to select robust features, we execute attribute selection cfsSubsetEval with Best search evaluator that select the robust and stable features from the result achieved by mutual information. And then, we execute 10 well-known machine learning classifiers. Our experimental results show that max_fpktl, std_bpktl, max_biat, mean_fpktl, mean_bpktl and min_biat feature are robust features at early stage traffic classification.},

abstract={With the rapid development of e-commerce services and online transactions, an increasing number of advanced web robots are utilized by speculators and hackers in underground economy to perform click fraud, register fake accounts and commit other kinds of frauds, seriously harming the profit of businesses and the fairness of online activities. There is solid evidence that the vast majority of such malicious bot traffic comes from data centers. The malicious bot deployed on the hosts of data centers is referred to as a CloudBot. How to detect and block CloudBots effectively has become an urgent problem in practice, while the research on it can be seldom seen in public. To this end, we propose a traffic-based quasi-real-time method for CloudBot detection using machine learning, which exploits a new sample partitioning approach, as well as innovative multi-layer features that reveal the essential difference between CloudBots and human traffic. Our method achieves 93.4% precision in the experiment and performs well on the real-world dataset, which proves to be effective to detect unknown CloudBots and combat the concept drift caused by varying time. Besides, the approach is also privacy-preserving without using any specific application layer information. We believe our work can benefit network economy security and fairness in practice.},

abstract={Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated its powerful capabilities in the field of image inpainting, which could produce visually plausible results. Meanwhile, the malicious use of advanced image inpainting tools (e.g. removing key objects to report fake news, erasing visible copyright watermarks, etc.) has led to increasing threats to the reliability of image data. To fight against the inpainting forgeries (not only DL-based but also traditional ones), in this work, we propose a novel end-to-end Image Inpainting Detection Network (IID-Net), to detect the inpainted regions at pixel accuracy. The proposed IID-Net consists of three sub-blocks: the enhancement block, the extraction block and the decision block. Specifically, the enhancement block aims to enhance the inpainting traces by using hierarchically combined special layers. The extraction block, automatically designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm, is targeted to extract features for the actual inpainting detection tasks. To further optimize the extracted latent features, we integrate global and local attention modules in the decision block, where the global attention reduces the intra-class differences by measuring the similarity of global features, while the local attention strengthens the consistency of local features. Furthermore, we thoroughly study the generalizability of our IID-Net, and find that different training data could result in vastly different generalization capability. By carefully examining 10 popular inpainting methods, we identify that the IID-Net trained on only one specific deep inpainting method exhibits desirable generalizability; namely, the obtained IID-Net can accurately detect and localize inpainting manipulations for various unseen inpainting methods as well. Extensive experimental results are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed IID-Net, compared with the state-of-the-art competitors. Our results would suggest that common artifacts are shared across diverse image inpainting methods. Finally, we build a public inpainting dataset of 10K image pairs for future research in this area.},

abstract={License plate recognition systems are widely used in modern smart cities, such as toll payment systems, parking fee payment systems and residential access control. Such electronic systems are not only convenient for people's daily life, but also provide safe and efficient services for managers. License plate recognition algorithm is a mature but imperfect technology. The traditional location recognition algorithm is easily affected by light, shadow, background complexity or other factors, resulting in the failure to meet the application of real scenes. With the development of deep learning, the license plate recognition algorithm can extract deeper features, thus greatly improving the detection and recognition accuracy. Therefore, this paper discusses the application of deep learning in license plate recognition, and the main work is as follows: 1) Introduce the most advanced algorithms from the three main technical difficulties: license plate skew, image noise and license plate blur; 2) According to the process, the deep learning algorithms are classified into direct detection algorithms and indirect detection algorithms, and the advantages and disadvantages of the current license plate detection algorithms and character recognition algorithms are analyzed; 3) The differences in data sets, workstation, accuracy and time of different license plate recognition systems are compared; 4) Compare and illustrate the existing public license plate datasets according to the number of pictures, resolution and environmental complexity, and make a prospect for the future research direction of license plate recognition.},

abstract={One of the main reasons for death among women is breast cancer. The traditional diagnosis process of breast cancer is time-consuming and expensive. Also, an early cancer diagnosis may reduce the breast cancer death rate. With the help of computer-aided diagnosis system, the efficiency increased and the cost is reduced of the cancer diagnosis. Traditional classification methodologies are based on feature extraction techniques. Currently, deep learning techniques have become the alternative solution for diagnosis and overcame the problems of the handcrafted features methods. Increasing the depth in a deep convolutional neural network makes the network suffer from gradient vanishing problems, which are not caused by overfitting but instead by an increase in depth. Therefore, our proposed network is designed based on the idea of increasing the width of the network. A novel two-branch deep convolutional neural network is proposed for the classification of histopathological breast images. The proposed network is trained on the dataset of ICIAR-2018 to classify images into four classes; invasive carcinoma, in situ carcinoma, benign lesion, and normal tissue image. The proposed network is beneficial for gradient propagation as the error can be back-propagated through multiple paths. It also helps to combine different levels of features at each step of the network since it is a two-branch network. The proposed network is superior to the existing methods by achieving a patch-wise classification accuracy of 83.6% and image-wise classification accuracy of 91.3% on the divided part from the training set. Moreover, we have achieved an image-wise classification accuracy of 89.4% on the unseen test images of ICIAR-2018.},

abstract={Recently, various kinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions and services are provided such as smart industry, smart city, smart factory, smart agriculture and etc. Those solutions and services generate large amount of data from various devices which are connected through networks while they communicate with each other. However, it is a difficult problem to process the fast and massively produced data efficiently. To solve the problems in the framework level, there are many open-source big data processing and analysis frameworks. To process large-scale data in a fast manner, those frameworks use a cluster consisting of multiple computing machines. However, to set the framework running on large-scale cluster properly is not simple and it is difficult to verify its performance in the distributed environment. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Apache Spark which is one of the most popular big data processing and analysis frameworks. Especially, we conduct experiments by using a representative benchmark tool, called HiBench, and large-scale data in the cluster environment. From the experimental results, we can conclude that Spark is highly scalable for distributed machine learning as well as big data processing.},

In order to support the wide range of services and applications that are being offered by SCWNOS, spectrum leasing could be considered as an alternative solution to achieve improved Quality of Service (QoS). We consider a situation whereby in order to satisfy the QoS requirements, SCWNOs can decide to lease a certain part of the TVWS spectrum that is referred to as high priority TVWS channel (HPC) for a certain period and pay a fee depending on the duration of HPC spectrum usage. We develop an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based online algorithm to determine the optimal transmission decision per time slot that would minimise the overall HPC leasing cost of the SCWNOs while satisfying the QoS constraints. The simulations results shows that our proposed ANN based online algorithms outperforms the Lyapunov based online algorithm while its performance is very close to the optimal offline solution with 99% accuracy.},

abstract={Along with the rise of Event-Based Social Networks (EBSNs), event recommendation has become an increasing important problem. However, unlike recommending usual items, such as movies or music, event recommendation suffers from severe cold-start problem, because most events in EBSNs are typically short-lived and registered by only a few users. Additionally, the available feedbacks for events are implicit feedbacks. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Deep Neural Networks Collaborative Filtering Architecture (HDNN-CF) that collaboratively makes use of the events' semantic information and users' implicit feedbacks for event recommendation. Specifically, we extend state-of-the-art method AutoRec to model implicit feedbacks by proposing Probabilistic AutoRec (PAutoRec). We collaboratively train a Stacked Denoise AutoEncoder (SDAE) to learn the deep representation of the semantic information and a PAutoRec to collaborative filter based on implicit feedbacks. Extensive experiments on a real large scale dataset Meetup show that HDNN-CF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% on recall of top 30 recommendations.},

abstract={Majority of energy consumption in Singapore buildings is due to air-conditioning, because of its hot and humid weather. Besides attaining a healthy indoor environment, a prior knowledge about the occupant's thermal comfort can be beneficial in reducing energy consumption, as it can save energy which is otherwise spent in extra cooling. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to predict individual thermal comfort level (`cool-discomfort', `comfort', `warm-discomfort') using environmental and human factors as input. Six types of classifiers have been implemented-Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Classification Trees (CT), on a publicly available database of 817 occupants for air-conditioned and free-running buildings separately. Results show that our approach achieves prediction accuracies of 73.14-81.2%, outperforming the traditional Fanger's PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) model, which has accuracies of only 41.68-65.5%. Age, gender, and outdoor effective temperature, which are not included in the PMV model, are found to be important factors for thermal comfort. The proposed approach also outperforms modified PMV models-the extended PMV model and the adaptive PMV model which attain accuracies of 61.75% and 35.51% respectively.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) services have been implemented for several network applications from smart cities to rural areas. However, there are many barriers to provide an efficient solution for the IoT service deployment underlying innovation SDN/NFV-based technologies. First, though an IoT service can flexibly deploy via virtual network functions (VNFs), a deployment scheme needs to solve the joint routing and resource allocation problem, which becomes more difficult than the traditional centralized cloud/datacenter solution due to distributed resources in the edge-cloud network. In addition, due to uncertain workloads in IoT services, static optimization solutions may not deal with uncompleted knowledge of the entire input, which is often given by assumptions, but unrealistic in current provisioning approaches. Aiming to address these issues, we model an online mechanism for the dynamic IoT service chain deployment to optimize the operational cost in a finite horizon. We propose a JOint Routing and Placement problem for IoT service chain (JORP) that can dynamically scale in/out the number of VNF instances. We then propose a learning method to efficiently solve JORP based on branch-and-bound (BnB). Our proposed learning mechanism can intelligently imitate the branching/pruning actions of BnB, and remove unlikely solutions in the search space based on the deep neural network model to improve the performance. In that respect, we take an intensive simulation that illustrates the promising result of our proposed deep learning method compared to BnB and the greedy baseline in terms of the performance of the algorithm and the operational cost reduction.},

abstract={As a critical component in the concept of smart cities, autonomous vehicles are under extensive investigation. The need for intelligent fueling without human assistance stimulates the development of wireless charging. There are, however, several issues to be addressed to enhance the efficiency and reliability of charging. The vehicle battery exhibits varying resistance during the charging process. Additionally, the alignment and gap may change with external positioning, which affects the coupling coefficient of the transmitter and receiver coils. Thus, a data-driven control scheme is desired to tackle these environmental uncertainties. This paper adopts the control scheme of embedding a Buck converter at the receiver side. Different from state-of-the-art literature, a reinforcement learning-based data-driven control approach is employed to regulate the charging voltage. Stable charging voltage is attained regardless of the knowledge of the coupling coefficient, load variations, or component values. System simulations in Simulink have proved the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

abstract={Travel time prediction based on deep learning techniques has received much attention in recent years. It is of great importance to advanced traffic management systems but remains a challenging problem as historical data are available in some but not all areas. Our preliminary experiments on New York City road network demonstrated that GPS pings recorded by in-vehicle GPS devices providing speed, position and time, do not cover the whole road network, thus, travel time in some regions could not be predicted accurately. However, predicting accurate travel time in each and every region in a city is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems. To predict travel time of target areas where little historical traffic data are available, we propose a transfer learning framework that exploits historical data of some source areas which are data-abundant regions. To accurately predict travel time in source areas, we propose a hybrid architecture that models the spatial and temporal closeness as well as the road network typology. Experimental results on New York City road network show that our proposed model can achieve competitive performance comparing to baseline methods and classic regression models.},

In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network, named as ST-TransRec, for crossing-city POI recommendations which integrates the deep neural network, transfer learning technique, and density-based resampling method into a unified framework. In this model, the deep neural network is used to capture users' preferences for POIs and predict the textual context of POIs to enhance the embeddings of POIs. Besides, we employ the transfer learning technique to bridge the gap between cities which results from the city-dependent features. To address the imbalanced distribution over POIs, we designed a density-based spatial resampling model. In this way, POIs can be well matched across cities. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The experimental results show the advantages of ST-TransRec over the state-of-the-art methods for crossing-city POI recommendations.},

abstract={With the increase of the number of the elderly, healthcare systems to support the daily life and wellbeing of the elderly attracted attention. Especially, frailty syndrome is one of the most significant challenges faced by many countries because of its high association with mortality and hospitalization. Recently, with the progress of ICT (Information and Communication Technology), many frailty detection models which use sensors were proposed. However, many of them require very high costs caused by the installation and management of sensors. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a machine learning-based frailty detection model using only electric power consumption data from smart meter, which uses no other devices such as sensors. Also, we examined the feasibility of our model through a case study, in which we have conducted on 24 elderly people. As a result of a cast study, we could detect frailty with 82% accuracy, 77% precision, 84% recall, and 80% f-score for a 2-class classification problem (frailty or non-frailty). The results of our study show that more elderly people can receive frailty diagnoses through smart meters. Moreover, since frailty is a reversible condition that could be restored to a healthy status with early and appropriate intervention, our model has potential to extend the healthy expectancy of the elderly.},

abstract={The biggest growth rate of network traffic in the coming years will be for smartphones and Internet-connected devices, which relentless tend to perform increasingly demanding tasks on continuously increasing amounts of data. Machine Learning and Edge Computing are emerging as effective paradigms for processing huge amounts of data supplied by the Internet of Things and Smart Cities. An osmotic computing architecture for an IoT smart classroom is used for testing a deep learning model for person recognition. A comparative performance study and analysis was made by means of selecting a single deep learning model, that it was tried to be adapted to run over the cloud, a fog microserver and a mobile edge computing device.

abstract={Despite recent progress, computational visual aesthetic is still challenging. Image cropping, which refers to the removal of unwanted scene areas, is an important step to improve the aesthetic quality of an image. However, it is challenging to evaluate whether cropping leads to aesthetically pleasing results because the assessment is typically subjective. In this paper, we propose a novel cascaded cropping regression (CCR) method to perform image cropping by learning the knowledge from professional photographers. The proposed CCR method improves the convergence speed of the cascaded method, which directly uses random-ferns regressors. In addition, a two-step learning strategy is proposed and used in the CCR method to address the problem of lacking labelled cropping data. Specifically, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier is first trained on large-scale visual aesthetic datasets. The deep CNN model is then designed to extract features from several image cropping datasets, upon which the cropping bounding boxes are predicted by the proposed CCR method. Experimental results on public image cropping datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art image cropping methods.},

pages={54074-54084},
abstract={In recent years, computation offloading has become an effective way to overcome the constraints of mobile devices (MDs) by offloading delay-sensitive and computation-intensive mobile application tasks to remote cloud-based data centers. Smart cities can benefit from offloading to edge points in the framework of the so-called cyber-physical-social systems (CPSS), as for example in traffic violation tracking cameras. We assume that there are mobile edge computing networks (MECNs) in more than one region, and they consist of multiple access points, multi-edge servers, and N MDs, where each MD has M independent real-time massive tasks. The MDs can connect to a MECN through the access points or the mobile network. Each task be can processed locally by the MD itself or remotely. There are three offloading options: nearest edge server, adjacent edge server, and remote cloud. We propose a reinforcement-learning-based state-action-reward-state-action (RL-SARSA) algorithm to resolve the resource management problem in the edge server, and make the optimal offloading decision for minimizing system cost, including energy consumption and computing time delay. We call this method OD-SARSA (offloading decision-based SARSA). We compared our proposed method with reinforcement learning based Q learning (RL-QL), and it is concluded that the performance of the former is superior to that of the latter.},

abstract={Object tracking is a challenging task in computer vision based intelligent transportation systems. Recently, Siamese based object tracking methods have attracted significant attention due to their highly efficient performance. These tracking methods usually train a Siamese network to match the initial target patch of the first frame with candidates in a new frame. In these methods, the offline training of the deep neural network and the online instance searching are effectively combined. However, these methods usually do not include template update or object re-identification, which easily results in the drift problem. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time object tracking method to overcome the above problems by effectively combining a multi-stream Siamese network and a region-based convolutional neural network. Specifically, a novel multi-stream Siamese network is proposed to search the target and update the instance template in a new frame. In addition, a faster region-based convolutional neural network detector is used to perform object re-identification in order to improve the tracking performance by making full use of the object category information. These two networks are tightly coupled to ensure that the proposed tracking method has high efficiency and strong discriminative capability. Experimental results on several object tracking benchmarks show that our tracking method can effectively track vehicles and pedestrians in video sequences by exploiting the object category information. The proposed tracking method achieves real-time operations and outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods.},

pages={2459-2470},
abstract={Thermostatically controlled load (TCL, such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system) is a desirable demand-side flexibility source in distribution networks. It can participate in regulation services and mitigate power imbalances from fluctuating distributed renewable generation. To effectively utilize the load flexibility from spatially and temporally distributed TCLs in a distribution network, it is necessary to consider power flow constraints to avoid possible voltage or current violations. Published works usually adopt optimal power flow models (OPF) to describe these constraints. However, these models require accurate topology of the distribution network that is often unobservable in practice. To bypass this challenge, this paper proposes a novel learning-based OPF to optimize TCLs for regulation services. This method trains three regression multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) based on the distribution network's historical operation data to replicate its power flow constraints. The trained MLPs are further equivalently reformulated into linear constraints with binary variables so that the optimization problem becomes a mixed-integer linear program that can be effectively solved. Numerical experiments based on the IEEE 123-bus system validate that the proposed method can achieve better TCL power scheduling performance with guaranteed feasibility and optimality than other state-of-art models.},
