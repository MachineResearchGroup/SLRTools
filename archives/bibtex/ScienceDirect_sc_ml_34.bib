abstract = {Since Smart Cyber–Physical Systems (sCPS) are complex and decentralized systems of dynamically cooperating components, architecture-based adaptation is of high importance in their design. In this context, a key challenge is that they typically operate in uncertain environments. Thus, an inherent requirement in sCPS design is the need to deal with the uncertainty of data coming from the environment. Existing approaches often rely on the fact that an adequate model of the environment and/or base probabilities or a prior distribution of data are available. In this paper, we present a specific logic (CB logic), which, based on statistical testing, allows specifying transition guards in architecture-based adaptation without requiring knowledge of the base probabilities or prior knowledge about the data distribution. Applicable in state machines’ transition guards in general, CB logic provides a number of operators over time series that simplify the filtering, resampling, and statistics-backed comparisons of time series, making the application of multiple statistical procedures easy for non-experts. The viability of our approach is illustrated on a running example and a case study demonstrating how CB logic simplifies adaptation triggers. Moreover, a library with a Java and C ++ implementation of CB logic’s key operators is available on GitHub.}

abstract = {Challenges of high energy efficiency, water saving, low-carbon emissions, waste management and food saving have been considerable pressures on both regional and global sustainable development. This paper reviews the water-energy extended nexuses (e.g. food, greenhouse gases, waste, pollution, land and others) from the perspective of relationship and practicability in relieving the challenges towards environmentally-related sustainable development goals. A specific issue identified is that with the popularity of “nexus” and extension beyond resources nexus, the positioning and identity of nexuses become ambiguous. In most cases, nexus is a more attractively sounding term to replace specific expressions such as multi-criteria optimisation, trade-offs, correlation/relationship, input-output assessment, material flow analysis, and integrated design. The methodologies (e.g. input-output analysis and life cycle assessment) entail needing to be adequately integrated or expanded for diverse water-energy extended nexuses. It is crucial for evaluating resource flows in multiple regions and sectors and assessing the associated environment-economic impacts. A standardised understanding like establishing life cycle assessment and even more quantified footprints could ensure that the nexus would not fall as the group of a buzzword and contribute to sustainable development goals. This study serves as a stepping stone to establish quantified characteristics or components as eligibility to classify as nexus approaches and studies.}

I follow other critical analyses in recognizing the centrality of innovation processes in generating smart farming products, services, arrangements, and problematic outcomes. I subsequently use insights from critical human geography scholarship on the significance of understanding topological transformations to move beyond interpretations that identify only a narrow range of smart farming problems, such as a lack of coordination or limited uptake by farmers. Instead, I examine a broader set of challenges produced by smart farming developments. The overriding concern, I argue, is that smart farming unfolds via the production of numerous ‘misconfigured innovations.’ Using insights from literature on responsible research and innovation I then probe the stakes of looking beyond the misconfigured innovations of smart farming and discuss how new technologies might come to play a role in producing emancipatory smart farming. I pay attention to research on the ‘internet of people,’ which paints a stark new picture of social life generally, and in particular how rural life might be computed and calculated according to new conceptualizations of sociality and spatiality.}

Additionally, the paper contains a survey of IoT-based security testbeds in the research literature. In this research study, we introduce an open source platform for identifying weaknesses in IoT networks and communications. The platform is easily modifiable and extendible to enable the addition of new security assessment tests and functionalities. It automates security evaluation, allowing for testing without human intervention. The testbed reports the security problems of the tested devices and can detect all attacks made against the devices. It is also designed to monitor communications within the testbed and with connected devices, enabling the system to abort if malicious activity is detected. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed IoT security testbed, it is used to examine the vulnerabilities of two IoT devices: a wireless camera and a smart bulb.}

abstract = {Correctly identifying the home location is crucial for human mobility analysis with telecom data, more specifically call detail record (CDR) data. To that end, multiple heuristics have been developed in literature. Nevertheless, due to the lack of ground truth home location data, no study has thoroughly validated these widely used methods so far. We present a detailed performance analysis of existing home detection heuristics, using a unique dataset that enables this important validation on the lowest level, being the level of the cell tower. Our research indicates that simple heuristics surprisingly outperform their more complex counterparts. The benchmark study revealed that the best heuristic is able to identify the home location with an average error of approximately 4.5 km and selects the correct home tower in 60.69% of the cases. Based on the insights provided by our study, we propose a new heuristic that increases the accuracy to 61% and lowers the average distance error to 4.365 km. Secondly, if the home location is known for possibly only a fraction of the instances, we propose a labelled predictive modelling approach. Adding social network based variables in this predictive model further enhances the predictive performance. Our best model reduces the average distance error to 2.848 km and selects the correct home location in 72.08% of the cases. Furthermore, this result provides an indication of the upper bound for home detection with CDR data. Finally, models that only make use of social network based data are developed as well. Results show that even without using data of the focal individual, these models are able to select the correct home tower in 37.65% of the cases and achieve an average distance error of 8.1 km.}

In the non-dock bicycle-sharing system planning, the definition of coverage area and the division of sub service areas are highly essential and fundamental, which get little attention in the existing studies. In this paper, we propose a market-oriented methodology for non-dock bicycle-sharing system planning. Firstly, the potential demand of bicycle-sharing use is identified using mobile phone data. Then, a link network is constructed to represent the spatial distribution of potential demand. The algorithm of community detection is applied to the link network to discover the densely connected nodes in the area and define the division of sub service areas. Finally, the potential patterns of bicycle-sharing use, the spatial distribution of the potential demand, and the potential emission reduction are analysed based on the resulting division of sub service areas. The proposed method is tested using a data set of approximately 34 million GPS trajectories obtained in Tokyo. The area of Tokyo is subdivided into 21 sub service areas. Suggestions for bicycle management, infrastructure development, and the bicycle-sharing system planning are given regarding sub service areas with different properties. The potential emission reduction for the introduction of bicycle-sharing system is calculated in the area of Tokyo.}

abstract = {While vehicular sensor networks (VSNs) have earned the stature of a mobile sensing paradigm utilizing sensors built into cars, they have limited sensing scopes since car drivers only opportunistically discover new events. Conversely, social sensing is emerging as a new sensing paradigm where measurements about the physical world are collected from humans. In contrast to VSNs, social sensing is more pervasive, but one of its key limitations lies in its inconsistent reliability stemming from the data contributed by unreliable human sensors. In this paper, we present DASC, a road Damage-Aware Social-media-driven Car sensing framework that exploits the collective power of social sensing and VSNs for reliable disaster response applications. However, integrating VSNs with social sensing introduces a new set of challenges: (i) How to leverage noisy and unreliable social signals to route the vehicles to accurate regions of interest? (ii) How to tackle the inconsistent availability (e.g., churns) caused by car drivers being rational actors? (iii) How to efficiently guide the cars to the event locations with little prior knowledge of the road damage caused by the disaster, while also handling the dynamics of the physical world and social media? The DASC framework addresses the above challenges by establishing a novel hybrid social-car sensing system that employs techniques from game theory, feedback control, and Markov Decision Process (MDP). In particular, DASC distills signals emitted from social media and discovers the road damages to effectively drive cars to target areas for verifying emergency events. We implement and evaluate DASC in a reputed vehicle simulator that can emulate real-world disaster response scenarios. The results of a real-world application demonstrate the superiority of DASC over current VSNs-based solutions in detection accuracy and efficiency.}

To tackle these two research questions, we conducted a two-year pattern analysis with 2+ million user access records. The spatial pattern, temporal pattern and spatiotemporal pattern of user-data interactions were explored. For the second research question, we developed three spatiotemporal optimization strategies to respond to the three access challenges: a) spatiotemporal indexing to accelerate data access, b) spatiotemporal service modeling to improve data access accuracy and c) spatiotemporal cloud computing to enhance global access. This research is a pioneering framework for spatiotemporal optimization of EO Big Data access and valuable for other multidisciplinary geographic data and information research.}

This paper presents a novel Moving-target Defense (MtD) to enhance the channel secrecy capacity in a Decode-and- Forward (DF) dual-phase large network containing K relays and source nodes with multi-antennas operating on different frequencies. Our MtD approach enables multidimensional spatiotemporal diversification for the user’s traffic in cooperative wireless transmission, to obfuscate signal transmission-patterns and data, across the entire spectrum available. In time, we obfuscate the transmitted data by employing real-time shuffling between real and fake data. In space, we enforce real-time hopping between multiple frequencies to evade signal tracing. We examine the ergodic channel secrecy capacity considering two behavioral patterns; cooperative and uncooperative untrustworthy-relays. Simulation results showed that, for a powerful malicious user with multiple access points, and no pre-knowledge of the diversification patterns used by the system, it is very hard to eavesdrop a meaningful portion of the signal or the data stream.}

Owing to frequent changes in user mobility and demands, service systems deployed in an edge–cloud environment must continuously adapt to ensure that the quality of service (QoS) perceived by the end users is maintained at a stable and satisfactory level. As it is difficult for system operation engineers to manually deal with such frequent and large-scale evolution due to problems of cost and efficiency, self-adaptation of the system is essential. In this paper, we present a programming framework for microservices (EPF4M) and an infrastructure for self-adaptive microservice systems (EI4MS) for the cloud–edge environment based on microservice architecture. Our study follows a “monitoring–analyzing–planning–execution” control loop that empowers the service systems to redeploy the services according to changes in the QoS. A two-phase strategy is adopted to minimize the side effects of the loop on the performance of the service system. A prototype of this framework and infrastructure has been open-sourced and verified through experiments conducted in a real cloud–edge environment. The results demonstrate the usefulness and advantages of our approach.}

With this in mind, we have designed a strategy to optimize jointly the positions of the key devices of RF Mesh network such as routers and collectors to achieve the highest possible connectivity between different components of RF Mesh network. Furthermore, for a big amount of meters, the proposed strategy process becomes unfeasible in terms of processing time.

This paper elaborates on these generations of energy systems by critically reviewing relevant authoritative literature. This includes a discussion of modern concepts such as ‘smart grid’, ‘microgrid’, ‘virtual power plant’ and ‘multi-energy system’, and the relationships between them, as well as the trends towards distributed intelligence and interoperability. Each of these emerging urban energy concepts holds merit when applied within a centralized grid paradigm, but very little research applies these approaches within the emerging energy landscape typified by a high penetration of distributed energy resources, prosumers (consumers and producers), interoperability, and big data. Given the ongoing boom in these fields, this will lead to new challenges and opportunities as the status-quo of energy systems changes dramatically. We argue that a new generation of holonic energy systems is required to orchestrate the interplay between these dense, diverse and distributed energy components. The paper therefore contributes a description of holonic energy systems and the implicit research required towards sustainability and resilience in the imminent energy landscape. This promotes the systemic features of autonomy, belonging, connectivity, diversity and emergence, and balances global and local system objectives, through adaptive control topologies and demand responsive energy management. Future research avenues are identified to support this transition regarding interoperability, secure distributed control and a system of systems approach.}

The approach emphasizes the role of institutional rules of the game – the regulative, normative and cognitive institutional elements – in socio-technical transition processes. Using the Finnish cadastral system as a case study, we illustrate the approach by forming three alternative transition pathways: (1) a cadastral system under digital transformation, (2) differentiating urban and rural cadastral systems, and (3) a cadastral system facing new data management challenges. After describing each transition pathway with a narrative storyline, we reflect them in light of previous discourses of the cadastral domain.

abstract = {In the residential energy sector there is a growing interest in smart energy management systems able to monitor, manage and minimize energy consumption. A key factor to curb household energy consumption is the amendment of occupant erroneous behaviors and systems malfunctioning. In this scenario energy efficiency benefits can be either amplified or neutralized by, respectively, good or bad practices carried out by end users. Authors propose a diagnostic system for a residential microgrid application able to detect faults and occupant bad behaviors. In particular a nonlinear monitoring method, based on kernel canonical variate analysis, is developed. To overcome the normality assumption regarding the signals probability distribution, Upper Control Limits are derived from the estimated Probability Density Function through Kernel Density Estimation. The proposed method, applied to a smart residential microgrid, is tested on experimental data acquired from July 2012 to October 2013.}

What is Russia's strategy for boosting development of AI technologies, and what role do groups within the Russian elite play in shaping this strategy? Russia's AI development strategy is unique in that it is led not by the government, nor by the private sector, but by state-owned firms. The government's distrust of Russia's largest tech firm, Yandex, has sidelined the company from national AI planning. Meanwhile, Russia's defense conglomerate Rostec publicly appears to focus less on artificial intelligence than on other high-tech priorities. As a result, Russia's AI development has been left to a state-owned bank, Sberbank, which has taken the lead in devising plans for government-backed investment in AI.}

One challenge in AR is the segmentation of observed sensor events when interleaved or concurrent activities of daily living (ADLs) are performed. Several studies have proposed methods of separating and organising sensor observations and recognise generic ADLs performed in a simple or composite manner. However, little has been explored in semantically distinguishing individual sensor events directly and passing it to the relevant ongoing/new atomic activities. This paper proposes Semiotic theory inspired ontological model, capturing generic knowledge and inhabitant-specific preferences for conducting ADLs to support the segmentation process. A multithreaded decision algorithm and system prototype were developed and evaluated against 30 use case scenarios where each event was simulated at 10sec interval on a machine with i7 2.60GHz CPU, 2 cores and 8GB RAM. The result suggests that all sensor events were adequately segmented with 100% accuracy for single ADL scenarios and minor improvement of 97.8% accuracy for composite ADL scenario. However, the performance has suffered to segment each event with the average classification time of 3971ms and 62183ms for single and composite ADL scenarios, respectively.}

On-demand computing resources of Public Clouds have become a natural host for these MapReduce applications. However, the decision of what type and in what amount computing and storage resources should be rented is still a user’s responsibility. This is not a trivial task particularly when users may have performance constraints such as deadline and have several Cloud product types to choose with the intention of not spending much money. Even though there are several existing scheduling systems, however, most of them are not developed to manage the scheduling of MapReduce applications. That is, they do not consider things such as number of map and reduce tasks that are needed to be scheduled and heterogeneity of Virtual Machines (VMs) available. This paper proposes a novel greedy-based MapReduce application scheduling algorithm (MASA) that considers the user’s constraints in order to minimize cost of renting Cloud resources while considering Service Level Agreements (SLA) in terms of the user given budget and deadline constraints. The simulation results show that MASA can achieve 25–50% cost reduction in comparison to current SLA agnostic methods and there is only 10% performance disparity between MASA and an exhaustive search algorithm.}

Based on the internal characteristics of UGDVs, a multi-criteria comprehensive evaluation system for UGDVs is constructed. Then, a trust propagation and aggregation mechanism to yield expert weights based on a social trust network is suggested. Further, a self-confidence Pythagorean fuzzy aggregation operator is proposed to enhance the credibility of the decision results and compensate for the defects of existing methods.

Determining how to improve the service level and customer satisfaction are the keys to a successful bicycle sharing business in today’s fiercely competitive market and are also the keys to achieving a sustainable operation. In this paper, following a hierarchical structure, five main factors related to the bicycle sharing operations are identified: (1) convenience and flexibility, (2) operation service, (3) economic cost, (4) design and layout and (5) management specification. Eighteen sub factors are then derived. To determine the significant factors affecting bicycle sharing operations, the Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach based on Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2FSs), Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory Model (DEMATEL) and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) are proposed. First, IT2FSs and fuzzy DEMATEL are integrated to analyze the complex relationships among the various factors. DEMATEL is then integrated with ANP to rank the importance of these factors. Results are compared with those of other state-of-the-art MCDM methods. It is concluded that convenience and flexibility, rationality of the layout, and economic cost are the three most important factors impacting the bicycle sharing business model. Based on the findings, theoretical guidance for the development of bicycle sharing operations is provided.}

abstract = {The significance of urban metro stations extends beyond their roles as transport nodes in a city. Their surroundings are usually well-developed and attract a lot of human activities, which make the metro station areas important cognitive places characterized by vague boundaries and rich semantics. Current studies mainly define metro station areas based on an estimation of walking distance to the stations (e.g., 700 m) and investigate these areas from the perspectives of transportation and land use instead of as cognitive places perceived by the crowd. To fill this gap, this study proposes a novel framework for extracting and understanding the cognitive regions of urban metro stations based on points of interest (POIs). First, we extract the cognitive regions of metro stations based on co-occurrence patterns of the stations and their surrounding POIs on web pages by proposing a cohesive approach combined of spatial clustering, web page extraction, knee-point detection, and polygon generation techniques. Second, we identify the semantics of metro stations based on POI types inside the regions using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method. In total 166 metro stations along with more than one million POIs in Shenzhen, China are utilized as data sources of the case study. The results indicate that our proposed framework can well detect the place characteristics of urban metro stations, which enriches the place-based GIS research and provides a human-centric perspective for urban planning and location-based-service (LBS) applications.}

abstract = {Backtracking search optimisation algorithm (BSA) is a commonly used meta-heuristic optimisation algorithm and was proposed by Civicioglu in 2013. When it was first used, it exhibited its strong potential for solving numerical optimisation problems. Additionally, the experiments conducted in previous studies demonstrated the successful performance of BSA and its non-sensitivity toward the several types of optimisation problems. This success of BSA motivated researchers to work on expanding it, e.g., developing its improved versions or employing it for different applications and problem domains. However, there is a lack of literature review on BSA; therefore, reviewing the aforementioned modifications and applications systematically will aid further development of the algorithm. This paper provides a systematic review and meta-analysis that emphasise on reviewing the related studies and recent developments on BSA. Hence, the objectives of this work are two-fold: (i) First, two frameworks for depicting the main extensions and the uses of BSA are proposed. The first framework is a general framework to depict the main extensions of BSA, whereas the second is an operational framework to present the expansion procedures of BSA to guide the researchers who are working on improving it. (ii) Second, the experiments conducted in this study fairly compare the analytical performance of BSA with four other competitive algorithms: differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimisation (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), and firefly (FF) on 16 different hardness scores of the benchmark functions with different initial control parameters such as problem dimensions and search space. The experimental results indicate that BSA is statistically superior than the aforementioned algorithms in solving different cohorts of numerical optimisation problems such as problems with different levels of hardness score, problem dimensions, and search spaces. This study can act as a systematic and meta-analysis guide for the scholars who are working on improving BSA.}

Using bibliometrics, which is suitable for large-scale reviews, this article reviews 1136 documents published in peer-reviewed journals indexed in the Web of Science between 2001 and 2021. Noteworthily, the review sheds light on the performance of research constituents (e.g., most prolific authors, countries, institutions, and journals), as well as the themes and topics underpinning the intellectual structure (i.e., knowledge foundation, knowledge creation) in the field. Specifically, the review reveals that knowledge management for sustainability research has relied on nine foundational clusters (i.e., informed sustainability practice, social network, firm performance, knowledge sharing culture, green innovation, sustainability assessment framework, global warming, knowledge management, and innovative performance) to generate new knowledge across 10 thematic clusters, (i.e., ecological knowledge, green innovation, the Shanghai Hongqiao district effect, the Agroscope Research Master Plan, food security, sustainable supply chain management, business sustainability, knowledge creation, knowledge management, and technology management).

abstract = {Cloud service composition builds new value-added services by combining existing single services. However, because of the exuberant growth of cloud services and the varying quality of service (QoS), discovering required services and creating a service composition with certain quality guarantees becomes a significant technical issue and attracts much concern. Computational intelligence techniques are considered to be effective in solving such problems, and researchers have made substantial efforts in this area. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is not any systematic research about this issue with a particular focus on computing intelligence. Thus, the current study aims to create a panoramic view of QoS-aware cloud service composition from the perspective of computational intelligence. The objectives of this paper are to (1) investigate the relevant studies on this field; (2) make a comprehensive examination of the literature from different aspects: active researchers, research motivations, QoS parameters, algorithms, datasets, optimization strategies and could layers; (3) identify the areas which need further research. For this, a search protocol has been well defined, and 105 articles from 2009 to 2018 were selected. This study classified these articles into three groups, including non-heuristic, heuristic and meta-heuristic, and then examined the research works from several aspects. The results indicate that reducing response time is the most important motivation for researchers, and meta-heuristic algorithms, especially genetic algorithms, are the most widely used computational intelligence techniques. Besides, the most widely used QoS attributes and datasets are also revealed. Additionally, the study points out there are still some research challenges in this area, such as QoS evaluation in a dynamic environment and inter-service correlations. In general, this study classified and compared the existing computational intelligence techniques; analyzed the research status and identified future research directions. It can provide a basis for both researchers and practitioners who are interested in this area. More significantly, in the field of expert and intelligent systems, this study can assist in the design and development of expert and intelligent systems in enterprises, it can efficiently assist enterprises in business decisions and risk reduction.}

ICTs adoption provides new opportunities, as well as discloses novel and unforeseen application scenarios. As a result, the overall health sector is potentially benefited, as the quality of medical services is expected to be enhanced and healthcare costs are reduced, in spite of the increasing demand due to the aging population. Notwithstanding the above, the scientific literature appears to be still quite scattered and fragmented, also due to the interaction of scientific communities with different background, skills, and approaches. A number of specific terms have become of widespread use (e.g., regarding ICTs-based healthcare paradigms as well as at health-related data formats), but without commonly-agreed definitions. While scientific surveys and reviews have also been proposed, none of them aims at providing a holistic view of how today ICTs are able to support healthcare. This is the more and more an issue, as the integrated application of most if not all the main ICTs pillars is the most agreed upon trend, according to the Industry 4.0 paradigm about ongoing and future industrial revolution. In this paper we aim at shedding light on how ICTs and healthcare are related, identifying the most popular ICTs-based healthcare paradigms, together with the main ICTs backing them. Studying more than 300 papers, we survey outcomes of literature analyses and results from research activities carried out in this field. We characterize the main ICTs-based healthcare paradigms stemmed out in recent years fostered by the evolution of ICTs. Dissecting the scientific literature, we also identify the technological pillars underpinning the novel applications fueled by these technological advancements. Guided by the scientific literature, we review a number of application scenarios gaining momentum thanks to the beneficial impact of ICTs. As the evolution of ICTs enables to gather huge and invaluable data from numerous and highly varied sources in easier ways, here we also focus on the shapes that this healthcare-related data may take. This survey provides an up-to-date picture of the novel healthcare applications enabled by the ICTs advancements, with a focus on their specific hottest research challenges. It helps the interested readership (from both technological and medical fields) not to lose orientation in the complex landscapes possibly generated when advanced ICTs are adopted in application scenarios dictated by the critical healthcare domain.}

This research aims to build an effective and automated RPM system based on an information communication technology (ICT) framework that automatically triggers medical alerts, hospital visits, medications, and social support in a timely and precise manner, with specific attention to aging people. The goal of the proposed framework is to construct a safe, flexible, and manageable system containing multi-agent, auto-notice, sensor management, and secure transmission of data to allow an autonomous functioning of RPM.
Methods
The literature between 2002 and 2018 that introduces healthcare platforms with the technology of the Internet of things (IoT) is reviewed and compared in compliance with various technical and functional features. Eleven healthcare-based IoT platforms are compared. Eight of them utilize the Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API), while ten of them have Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), seven of them have device management, and nine of them have security control. In addition, Kepware's KEPServerEX communication platform containing up to 250 communication protocols is included.
Results
The results confirm that the proposed framework reliably operates within the complex healthcare processes, taking into account the equipment management, security management, messaging and diversification of communication protocols. This study uses the concept of IoT 3-tier through which a complete sensor management mechanism is structured. Moreover, secure data connection protects the patient's privacy. Each sensor provides a distinctive notification to construct flawless authority management.
Conclusions
The proposed framework can not only reach the machine-to-machine (M2M) realm, but also provide support in emergency cases.}

Scenario development plays a key role in strategic planning, as the process supports the development of future visions and actions required for their realisation. However, new approaches to scenario development are required to address the limitations of conventional scenario development methods, such as the cognitive barriers of ‘groupthink’, reluctance to consider ‘outside-the-box’ options, handling of complexity, and ad hoc scenario selection and general non-transparency of scenario development processes. This paper describes the development and implementation of a novel method for scenario development and selection in the context of participatory strategic planning for sustainable heating in cities. The method is based on the morphological approach and a number of scenario criteria including transparency, reliability, coverage, completeness, relevance/density, creativity, interpretability, consistency, differentiation and plausibility. It integrates creativity workshops and interdisciplinary stakeholder participation to enhance the ownership and legitimacy of the scenarios. The approach entails the generation of a complete space of scenarios for heating systems and reduction of this space using cross-consistency analysis and project-specific requirements. Iterative development and implementation of the method is illustrated using two participatory backcasting projects focused on strategic planning for providing a comfortable indoor climate for Bila Tserkva, Ukraine, and Niš, Serbia by the year 2030. The results demonstrate that the method helps overcome the limitations of conventional approaches to scenario development and supports rigorous and transparent selection of a scenario set for participatory analysis. The method fostered the elicitation of consensus-based scenarios for more sustainable heating systems in both cities with regard to the quality of indoor comfort, environmental impact, resource efficiency and energy security.}

Despite numerous benefits of IoV and ECDs, the wireless communication for computation offloading increases the risk of privacy leakage, which may consequently lead to tracking, identity tampering and virtual vehicle hijacking. Therefore, it remains a challenge to avoid privacy conflicts for computation offloading to the ECDs in IoV. To address this challenge, an edge computing-enabled computation offloading method, named ECO, with privacy preservation for IoV is proposed in this paper. Technically, the privacy conflicts of the computing tasks in IoV are analyzed in a formalized way. Then, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication-based routing for a vehicle is designed to acquire the routing vehicles from the origin vehicle where the computing task is located at the destination vehicle. NSGA-II (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II) is adopted to realize multi-objective optimization to reduce the execution time and energy consumption of ECDs and prevent privacy conflicts of the computing tasks. Finally, experimental evaluations are conducted to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of ECO.}

abstract = {Federated Identity Management schemes (FIdMs) are of great help for traditional systems as they improve user authentication and privacy. In this paper, we claim that traditional FIdMs are mostly cumbersome and then ill-suited for IoT. As a solution to this problem, we came up with Federated Lightweight Authentication of Things (FLAT), namely a federated identity authentication protocol exclusively tailored to IoT. FLAT replaces weighty protocols and public-key cryptographic primitives used in traditional FIdMs by lighter ones, like symmetric cryptographic primitives and Implicit Certificates. Our results show that FLAT can reduce the data exchange overhead by around 31% when compared to a baseline solution. Also, the FLAT Client, the role played by an IoT device in the protocol, is more efficient than the baseline Client in terms of data exchange, storage, memory, and computation time. Our results indicate that FLAT runs efficiently, even on top of resource-constrained devices like Arduino.}

abstract = {The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has been at the forefront of progressing societal functionality. However, the addition of IoT devices in conventional information technology (IT) infrastructure has raised and prioritized the concern of information security and data privacy. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a framework for providing information to the public about the impact of vulnerabilities and exploits executed on a multitude of devices. While the CVSS addresses a plethora of conditions for vulnerabilities, it does not adequately make end-users aware of the impact data privacy can have on their devices. The primary objective of this research work is to extend the existing CVSS and propose a new model that acknowledges Transparency, Unlinkability, and Intervenability (TUI) to address the data privacy issues of IoT devices when scoring impacts of vulnerabilities. Our research has developed this model to provide a new sufficient score for analyzing the true impact of compromised data privacy. After the development of the new scoring for TUI, our research highlights case studies to emphasize the impact our TUI model will have on the CVSS. We strongly believe that our proposed model benefit both the individual users (consumers of IoT devices) and the industry to portray the possible vulnerabilities from a user standpoint as well as a manufacturer standpoint.}

However, supporting long-term sensing applications is challenging because of their key requirements for continuous access to embedded sensors for gathering raw data, which can deplete the device’s battery in a few hours. This problem is expected to remain in the near future because the improvements on the capacity of batteries are coming at a slower pace than those advances in computing and sensing capabilities. The research community has highlighted the need for power-aware and context-aware sensing techniques deployed at different levels of mobile platforms for making a more efficient use of energy resources. Previous studies have analyzed the optimization of power consumption in mobile devices over different critical axes, like data transmission, computing, and hardware design. However, a comprehensive study focused in the challenges of power-aware smartphone-based sensing and strategies for addressing them has not been produced yet. This survey aims to fill this void with a particular focus on mobility sensing systems (e.g., human activity recognition, location-based services), presenting a comprehensive review of relevant strategies aimed at solving this issue. Also, this survey defines a taxonomy for such solutions, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Finally, most relevant open challenges and trends are discussed for providing insights for future research in the field.}

A first order disruption is a localized change, within a market or industry. A second order disruption has much larger influences, affecting many industries and substantially changing societal norms and institutions. This paper presents an analysis of these types of disruptions and synthesizes the literature on disruptive technologies and Kondratieff's long waves. Previous definitions of disruptive technologies have focused on disruptions to commercial markets and existing firms. That is, on the first order of disruption, where a particular technology is disruptive. The second order disruptions are technological disruptions, where the impacts ripple through society. That is, these technologies disrupt social interactions and relationships, organizational structures, institutions and public policies. Since innovation ecosystems are complex, dynamic, adaptive systems, technological design and development necessarily interact with social trends. Understanding and modelling potential disruptions will require taking a holistic perspective of the socio-technical innovation ecosystem. This paper lays out a conceptual model of first and second order disruptions and identifies the key factors necessary for modelling the process that results in second order disruptions—a process that necessarily occurs at the intersection of several highly-complex interactive systems.}

In particular, we show how fare collection data can be used to identify behavioural differences between passengers: we thus advocate for a personalised approach to delivering transport related information to travellers. To demonstrate the potential for personalisation we compute trip time estimates that more accurately reflect the travel habits of each passenger. We propose a number of algorithms for personalised trip time estimations, and empirically demonstrate that these approaches outperform both a non-personalised baseline computed from the data, as well as published travel times as currently offered by the transport authority. Furthermore, we show how to easily scale the system by pre-clustering travellers. We close by outlining the wide variety of applications and services that may be fuelled by fare collection data.}

A new approach for 3D building surface modeling, based on closed constraints, is proposed. First, a region growth algorithm is applied to fit the input point clouds by a set of candidate planes. Then, additional candidate planes are generated from the initial planes according to a rigid transformation followed by expanding the original primitive set to the candidate model set through generation rules. Furthermore, an energy function is employed to combine the data fitting errors with the structural constraints at the model selection stage. Finally, the 3D building surface model is generated from the candidate set through energy minimization. More precisely speaking, we adopt the surface optimization scheme that enforces the 3D polygonal surfaces of the building to be consistent with a priori geometric structures. Our approach was assessed using multi-source datasets with different densities, noise levels covering diverse and complex structures. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves better accuracy and robustness than those of several state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {Chinese colleges have formulated supporting polices to help poverty-stricken college students to deal with the barriers in their living and learning. The difficulty in fully collecting the required information related to student’s financial status and the imbalanced-data classification problem caused by the small proportion of poverty-stricken students among total students makes it a challenging problem. This problem results in a heavy workload for the college staff to identify poverty-stricken students, determine the amount of corresponding subsidy, and execute the supporting polices in an efficient way. Therefore, this paper attempts to address the above-mentioned challenges by proposing a smart campus system, which makes use of campus big data to identify poverty-stricken students and support the decision-making on the subsidy for them. The proposed system can also alert the counselors to provide psychological support for students in trouble. The major contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, in addition to the features of students’ amount of consumption on campus and its statistical characteristics used in existing researches, this paper proposes new features that describe diversity of consumable commodities, preference of consumption location and price, and characteristics of students’ campus activities. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of dataset imbalance, four imbalanced data processing methods (Subsampling, Resampling, Cost-sensitive learning and SMOTE) have been applied to produce four different experimental datasets, and five classification algorithms (Random Forest, J48, Naïve Bayes, SMO, Logistic regression) have been used to train the classification model on each dataset. The experimental results indicate that the model based on Resampling and Random Forest achieves the best performance in F1-measure of poverty-stricken students, among the combinations of four imbalanced processing methods and five classification algorithms. In addition, a method of quantization of subsidies, and strategies of early warning and counseling for students are also described in this paper. A system was developed based on the above-mentioned methods, which meets the needs of individualized and diversified support for poverty-stricken students. The methods and the proposed system have been put into practice, and it is serving more than 17,000 students. The system has significantly improved the efficiency and quality of student management, and reduced the workload of college staff.}

Coarse segmentation and single level representation carry poorly discriminative information for generating a signature of a target, whilst fine segmentation with a fixed matching fashion is hindered severely by misalignment of corresponding body parts. We address such a dilemma through a multi-level adaptive correspondence scheme. Our approach encodes a pedestrian based on horizontal stripes in multi-level to capture rich visual cues as well as implicit spatial structure. Then dynamic correspondence of stripes within an image pair is conducted. Considering that manually selected weights in the final fusion stage is not advisable, we employ RankSVM to seek a data-driven fusion solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two public datasets and another new dataset built for single shot re-identification. Comparisons with state-of-the-art re-identification methods show the superior performance of our approach.}

It will require a radical change of the Internet data-management paradigm, from the current platform-centric to a human-centric model. In this paper we present a new paradigm for Internet data management that we name Internet of People (IoP) because it embeds human behavior models in its algorithms. To this end, IoP algorithms exploit quantitative models of the humans’ individual and social behavior, from sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, physics. IoP is not a replacement of the current Internet networking infrastructure, but it exploits legacy Internet services as (reliable) primitives to achieve end-to-end connectivity on a global-scale. In this opinion paper, we first discuss the key features of the IoP paradigm along with the underlying research issues and challenges. Then, we present emerging data-management paradigms that are anticipating IoP.}

The advantages range from ease of installation and maintenance to reduced deployment time and infrastructure costs. However, industrial automation has critical requirements regarding network infrastructure, such as reliability and failure tolerance. Therefore, it is imperative to have an adequate placement of sensor and router nodes, to obtain a network with multiple paths, allowing the data to reach management systems within a reasonable time, even in the event of failures. The placement of router nodes has to consider latency, network lifespan, connectivity, and failure tolerance aspects in a possibly hostile environment, with classified areas and obstacles such as silos, tanks and buildings. We present a new approach, called POSIMNET-R, to place IWSN routing nodes in an industrial configuration, which circumvents forbidden areas and obstacles, based on Artificial Immunological Networks. The resulting network offers low failure rates and path redundancy criteria. The results have shown that POSIMNET-R was capable of providing a reliable network with multiple paths and resilience of the used routers equal to 81.50% in the basic case study and 73.66% in the real case scenario.}

This paper proposes a new packets' scheduling strategy for CRIoT. It is a centralized time slotted algorithm that uses discrete permutation particle swarm optimization for scheduling packets among predicted primary network empty time slots. An objective function is formulated to maximize the fairness index among fog nodes, minimize the packets' queuing delay and minimize the number of dropped packetsat each time interval. In order to evaluate the proposed protocol, it is implemented along with another protocol named spectrum auction. Using the fairness index, the average queuing delay and the number of dropped packets as evaluation metrics, simulation results proved that the proposed protocol outperforms the spectrum auction protocol. It also has a lower time and space complexity.}

However, this model often fails to respect the strict requirements of healthcare systems. Wearable medical sensors are very limited in terms of battery lifetime, in addition, the system reliance on a cloud makes it vulnerable to connectivity and latency issues. Compressive sensing (CS) theory has been widely deployed in electrocardiogramme ECG monitoring application to optimize the wearable sensors power consumption. The proposed solution in this paper aims to tackle these limitations by empowering a gateway-centric connected health solution, where the most power consuming tasks are performed locally on a multicore processor. This paper explores the efficiency of real-time CS-based recovery of ECG signals on an IoT-gateway embedded with ARM’s big.little™ multicore for different signal dimension and allocated computational resources. Experimental results show that the gateway is able to reconstruct ECG signals in real-time. Moreover, it demonstrates that using a high number of cores speeds up the execution time and it further optimizes energy consumption. The paper identifies the best configurations of resource allocation that provides the optimal performance. The paper concludes that multicore processors have the computational capacity and energy efficiency to promote gateway-centric solution rather than cloud-centric platforms.}

Korean mothers then upload this information on the boards of online groups called “mom cafes.” Based upon a digital ethnography of 15 “mom cafes,” we examine how Korean mothers understand the travel histories of virus patients and explore the relationships between morality and materiality in the context of infectious disease surveillance. The main findings reveal that mom cafe mothers form moral personhood based on information gathered about artifacts, places, and the mobility of patients. They tie patients' travel histories inextricably to moral identities. Non-maleficence is central to Korean mothers’ morality. This morality appears through the material discourses of artifacts, places, and mobility. A face mask becomes one such hallmark of morality. It is a requisite for moral persons. Those who visit crowded places, such as churches, clubs, and room salons, become immoral because they can be easily infected and spread the virus to their families and communities. To mom cafe mothers, mobile patients, such as clubbers, appear less moral than those who self-quarantine due to the high infection rate of COVID-19. We conclude that morality in this context involves the materiality of artifacts, a sense of place, and the spatial mobility of people.}

Accordingly, many authentication protocol have been proposed to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of the transmitted messages. In this paper, we examine Wu et al.’s protocol as one of the most state-of-the-art protocols and prove that it is susceptible to sensor capture attack, user trace attack, and DoS attack, also it cannot provide forward secrecy. To mitigate these weaknesses, we propose our protocol and analyze that with both formal and informal methods to show that it is secure against various known attacks such as sensor and user trace, sensor capture, offline password guessing, and replay attacks. Finally, we evaluate our protocol in terms of security features and communication and computation costs. The results show that our protocol not only is more secure than other existing protocols but also reduces 62.1% of the computation cost and 30.76% of the communication cost in comparison with the costs of Wu et al.’s protocol.}

Rendezvous point (RP) based MS path design is a common and popular technique used in this regard. However, design of the optimal path is a well-known NP-hard problem. Therefore, an evolutionary approach like multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) can prove to be a very promising and reasonable approach to solve the same. In this paper, we first present a Linear Programming formulation for the stated problem and then, propose an MOPSO-based algorithm to design an energy efficient trajectory for the MS. The algorithm is presented with an efficient particle encoding scheme and derivation of a proficient multi-objective fitness function. We use Pareto dominance in MOPSO for obtaining both local and global best guides for each particle. We carry out rigorous simulation experiments on the proposed algorithm and compare the results with two existing algorithms namely, tree cluster based data gathering algorithm (TCBDGA) and energy aware sink relocation (EASR). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs better than both of them in terms of various performance metrics. The results are also validated through the statistical test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and its least significant difference (LSD) post hoc analysis.}

abstract = {This paper solves the vehicle assignment problem of an operating entity with dispatchable vehicles (e.g., an urban Integrated Energy-Traffic System (IETS) coordinator or an e-hailing company) in the context of energy-traffic coordinated modeling and analysis. Current research on electric vehicle (EV) scheduling and optimization has broadly assumed that human beings are rational decision-makers and obey the scheduling plan. In contrast, we proposed a user-centric dynamic pricing scheme that improves the system performance by incentivizing human participants to follow the expected behavioral patterns from a Cyber-Physical-Human System (CPHS) perspective. The interdisciplinary fields of power systems, traffic systems, and human decision-making were used to study the interactions in the CPHS. The proposed incentive scheme was applied to the urban IETS scenarios based on real-world Global Positioning System (GPS) data of EV taxis, and the results showed that it effectively optimized the integrated system.}

abstract = {Background
In the next 25years, transformative changes, in particular the rapid pace of technological development and data availability, will require environmental epidemiologists to prioritize what should (rather than could) be done to most effectively improve population health.
Objectives
In this essay, we map out key driving forces that will shape environmental epidemiology in the next 25years. We also identify how the field should adapt to best take advantage of coming opportunities and prepare for challenges.
Discussion
Future environmental epidemiologists will face a world shaped by longer lifespans but also larger burdens of chronic health conditions; shifting populations by region and into urban areas; and global environmental change. Rapidly evolving technologies, particularly in sensors and OMICs, will present opportunities for the field. How should it respond? We argue, the field best adapts to a changing world by focusing on healthy aging; evidence gaps, especially in susceptible populations and low-income countries; and by developing approaches to better handle complexity and more formalized analysis.
Conclusions
Environmental epidemiology informing disease prevention will continue to be valuable. However, the field must adapt to remain relevant. In particular, the field must ensure that public health importance drives research questions, while seizing the opportunities presented by new technologies. Environmental epidemiologists of the future will require different, refined skills to work effectively across disciplines, ask the right questions, and implement appropriate study designs in a data-rich world.}

It is expected that this review will contribute to the advancement of the growing area of integrated infrastructure systems. Assessment of the research on integrated infrastructure modeling literature showed that the focus of most modeling efforts is mainly on short term operational purposes and extreme events. Long-term efforts to examine the impacts and assessment of future policies and scenarios are needed. Although ‘integration’ is being used in many studies on civil infrastructure, the level of detail or type of integration is not consistent and in some cases almost trivial.}

In this paper, firstly, we focus on the main performance parameters of parallel computing, and then construct a change rate vector of architecture and a change rate vector of parallel task. In addition, using the historical data generated in the process of extending parallel tasks to make it match machine architectures, we employ the regression prediction method to mine the intrinsic characteristics of and relationships among parallel tasks with different scales. Under the assumption that the parallel machine architecture is upgraded or extended in advance, based on the idea of the equal change rate, some strategies of extension and reconstruction for a DAG task are given, and a set of equations about elastic extension for the parallel task is established. Thus, an equal change rate scalable method is proposed in order to adjust the workload of a parallel task and to optimize the algorithm structure according to the change of the host architecture. Our proposed scalable method can reconstruct a parallel task to better match the new machine system in many aspects after the machine system has been upgraded or extended, for example, the computational tasks in the fields of earth simulation, weather forecasting. Simulation experiments show that our method is effective.}

abstract = {The impressive progress in sensing technology over the last few years has contributed to the proliferation and popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm and to the adoption of Sensor Clouds for provisioning smart ubiquitous services. Also, the massive amount of data generated by sensors and smart objects led to a new kind of services known as Data-as-a-Service (DaaS). The quality of these services is highly dependent on the quality of sensed data (QoD), which is characterized by a number of quality attributes. DaaS provisioning is typically governed by a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between data consumers and DaaS providers. In this work, we propose a game-based approach for DaaS Provisioning, which relies on signaling based model for the negotiation of several QoD attributes between DaaS providers and data consumers. We consider that these entities are adaptive, rational, and able to negotiate the QoD offering even in the case of incomplete information about the other party. We use in the negotiation between the two parties a Q-learning algorithm for the signaling model and a Multi Attributes Decision Making (MADM) model to select the best signal. Moreover, we empirically validate the MADM model using Shannon’s entropy. The results obtained in the case of a multi-stages negotiation scenario show the convergence towards the pooling equilibrium.}

abstract = {Handling data imperfection is a crucial issue in many application domains. This is particularly true when handling imperfect data inputs in applications for Alzheimer’s patients. In this paper we first propose a typology of imperfection for data entered by Alzheimer’s patients or their caregivers in the context of these applications (mainly due to the memory discordance caused by the disease). This topology includes nine direct and three indirect imperfection types. The direct ones are deduced from the data inputs e.g. uncertainty and uselessness. The indirect imperfection types are deduced from the direct ones, e.g. the redundancy. We then propose an approach, called DBE_ALZ, that handles false data entry by estimating the believability of each data input. Based on the proposed typology, the falsity of these data is related to five imperfection types: uncertainty, confusion, typing error, wrong knowledge and inconsistency. DBE_ALZ includes a believability model that defines a set of dimensions and sub-dimensions allowing a qualitative estimation of the believability of a given data input. It is estimated based on its reasonableness and the reliability of its author. Compared to related work, the data input reasonableness is measured not only based on common-sense standard, but also based on a set of personalized assertions. The reliability of the patient is estimated based on the progression of the disease and the state of his memory at the moment of entry. However, the reliability of the caregiver is estimated based on his age and his knowledge about the data input’s field. Based on the believability model, we estimate quantitatively the believability of the data input by defining a set of metrics associated to the proposed dimensions and sub-dimensions. The measurement methods rely on probability and fuzzy set theories to reason about uncertain and imprecise knowledge (Bayesian networks and Mamdani fuzzy inference systems). Three languages are supported: English, French and Arabic. Based on the generated believability degrees, a set of decisive actions are proposed to guarantee the quality of the data inputs e.g., inferring or not based on a given data. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach in the context of the Captain Memo memory prosthesis. Finally, we discuss the encouraging results derived from the evaluation step.}

The resulting diverse communication requirements will demand networking with unprecedented flexibility, not currently provided by the monolithic black-box approach of 4G cellular networks. The research community and an increasing number of standardization bodies and industry coalitions have recognized softwarization, virtualization, and disaggregation of networking functionalities as the key enablers of the needed shift to flexibility. Particularly, software-defined cellular networks are heralded as the prime technology to satisfy the new application-driven traffic requirements and to support the highly time-varying topology and interference dynamics, because of their openness through well-defined interfaces, and programmability, for swift and responsive network optimization. Leading the technological innovation in this direction, several 5G software-based projects and alliances have embraced the open source approach, making new libraries and frameworks available to the wireless community. This race to open source softwarization, however, has led to a deluge of solutions whose interoperability and interactions are often unclear. This article provides the first cohesive and exhaustive compendium of recent open source software and frameworks for 5G cellular networks, with a full stack and end-to-end perspective. We detail their capabilities and functionalities focusing on how their constituting elements fit the 5G ecosystem, and unravel the interactions among the surveyed solutions. Finally, we review hardware and testbeds on which these frameworks can run, and provide a critical perspective on the limitations of the state-of-the-art, as well as feasible directions toward fully open source, programmable 5G networks.}

The implemented methodology has a wide-scoped utility in the field of air pollution; especially in Low-Middle Income Countries where setting up new monitoring stations include financial/logistical/location problems. The generated maps can help in policy formulation and decision making by providing aid in PM2.5 visualisation of spatial and temporal variability. First phase of study involves prediction of concentrations at two sites (reinforcing the need for sustainable development of the city) using concentrations for 2015–2017. In the second phase, pollutant mixing ratios were obtained for four winter months between Nov-2017 to Feb-2018 at 17 monitoring stations. In this phase, predictions were made for 11 supersites (zones of important land-use). The average error of Kriging and IDW (taking both phases) was ∼22 % and 24 %, respectively. The magnitude of change in the daily concentration was relatively negligible and annual trend can be identified.}

However, due to the relatively long distance between remote cloud and end nodes, cloud computing cannot provide effective and direct management for end nodes, which leads to security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel trust evaluation model based on the trust transitivity on a chain assisted by mobile edge nodes, which is used to ensure the reliability of nodes in the Internet of Things and prevent malicious attacks. The mobile edge nodes offer a new solution to solve the above problems with relatively strong computing and storage abilities. Firstly, we design calculation approaches to different trust chains to measure their trust degrees. Secondly, we propose an improved Dijkstra’s algorithm for collecting trust information of sensor nodes by mobile edge nodes. Finally, the experimental results show that our trust model based on mobile edge nodes can evaluate sensor nodes more precisely and enhance the security on the Internet of Things.}

abstract = {Automatic negotiation pricing and differential pricing aim to provide different customers with products/services that adequately meet their requirements at the “right” price. This often takes place with the purchase of expensive products/services and in the business-to-business context. Effective negotiation pricing can help enhance a company's profitability, balance supply and demand, and improve the customer satisfaction. However, determining the “right” price is a rather complex decision-making problem that puzzles pricing managers, as it needs to consider information from many constituents of the purchase channel. To further advance this line of research, this study proposes a systematic and learning approach that consists of three different types of fuzzy systems (FSs) to provide intelligent decision support for negotiation pricing. More specifically, the three FSs include: 1) a standard FS, which is a typical multiple inputs and single output FS that forms a mathematical mapping from the input space to the output space; 2) an SFS-SISOM, which is a linear fuzzy inference model with a single input and a single output module; and 3) a hierarchical FS, which consists of several FSs in a hierarchical manner to perform fuzzy inference. To address the existing problem of a standard FS suffering from the high-dimensional problem with a large number of influential factors, a generalized type of FS (named hierarchical FS), including its mathematical models and suitability for tackling the negotiation pricing problem, is introduced. In particular, a proof-of-concept prototype system that integrates these three FSs is also developed and presented. From a system design perspective, this artifact provides immense potential and flexibility for end users to choose the most suitable model for the given problem. The utility and effectiveness of this proposed system is illustrated and examined by three experimental datasets that vary from dimensionality and data coverage. Moreover, the performances of three different approaches are compared and discussed with respect to some important properties of decision support systems (DSSs).}

Based on the partitioning results, IHCP iteratively updates the hypergraph by a novel guided sampling algorithm, and performs hypergraph partition. After a few iterations, IHCP is able to construct an effective hypergraph to represent the complex relationship between data points and model hypotheses, and obtain good partitioning results for model fitting as well. IHCP is very efficient since it avoids generating a large number of model hypotheses, and it is also very effective due to the excellent ability of the novel iterative strategy. Experimental results on real images show the superiority of the proposed IHCP method over several state-of-the-art model fitting methods.}

abstract = {High-speed, low latency, and heterogeneity features of 5G, as the common denominator of many emerging and classic wireless applications, have put wireless technology back in the spotlight. Continuous connectivity requirement in low-power and wide-reach networks underlines the need for more efficient routing over scarce wireless resources, in multi-hp scenarios. In this regard, Opportunistic Routing (OR), which utilizes the broadcast nature of wireless media to provide transmission cooperation amongst a selected number of overhearing nodes, has become more promising than ever. Crucial to the overall network performance, which nodes to participate and where they stand on the transmission-priority hierarchy, are decided by user-defined OR metrics embedded in OR protocols. Therefore, the task of choosing or designing an appropriate OR metric is a critical one. The numerousness, proprietary notations, and the objective variousness of OR metrics can cause the interested researcher to lose insight and become overwhelmed, making the metric selection or design effort-intensive. While there are not any comprehensive OR metrics surveys in the literature, those who partially address the subject are non-exhaustive and lacking in detail. Furthermore, they offer limited insight regarding related taxonomy and future research recommendations. In this paper, starting with a custom tutorial with a new look to OR and OR metrics, we devise a new framework for OR metric design. Introducing a new taxonomy enables us to take a structured, investigative, and comparative approach to OR metrics, supported by extensive simulations. Exhaustive coverage of OR metrics, formulated in a unified notation, is presented with sufficient details. Self-explanatory, easy-to-grasp, and visual-friendly quick references are provided, which can be used independently from the rest of the paper. Finally, a new insightful framework for future research directions is developed.

abstract = {Adversary models have been integral to the design of provably-secure cryptographic schemes or protocols. However, their use in other computer science research disciplines is relatively limited, particularly in the case of applied security research (e.g., mobile app and vulnerability studies). In this study, we conduct a survey of prominent adversary models used in the seminal field of cryptography, and more recent mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) research. Motivated by the findings from the cryptography survey, we propose a classification scheme for common app-based adversaries used in mobile security research, and classify key papers using the proposed scheme. Finally, we discuss recent work involving adversary models in the contemporary research field of IoT. We contribute recommendations to aid researchers working in applied (IoT) security based upon our findings from the mobile and cryptography literature. The key recommendation is for authors to clearly define adversary goals, assumptions and capabilities.}

The proposed approach detects anomalies based on a hierarchical activity-pattern discovery framework, comprehensively considering both global and local spatio-temporal contexts. The discovery is a coarse-to-fine learning process with unsupervised methods for automatically constructing normal activity patterns at different levels. A unified anomaly energy function is designed based on these discovered activity patterns to identify the abnormal level of an input motion pattern. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the UCSD anomaly-detection datasets and compare the performance with existing work.}

abstract = {Aiming at the problem that the location of the secondary base station affects the interference between the primary and secondary systems directly and the reasonable allocation of channel resources, an Internet of Things (IoT) sensor network resource allocation scheme using an improved chaotic firefly algorithm is proposed. This solution builds a multi-objective optimization model based on interference analysis of the working scenario of the cognitive radio. The goal is to protect the primary user’s normal activity to maximize the throughput of the secondary system and maximize the number of users that can be covered by the secondary base station. Because the multi-objective model is a non-linear convex optimization problem, the paper uses an improved chaotic firefly algorithm to solve it. Chaos algorithm is introduced into the firefly algorithm. By perturbing individuals, the convergence speed is accelerated and the probability of local optimization is reduced. The algorithm can efficiently obtain the optimal solution while reducing the complexity of the problem. The simulation results show that the method proposed in this paper can optimize the performance of the secondary system while guaranteeing the priority of the primary user. And it is superior to several advanced algorithms.}

abstract = {Industry 4.0 (I4.0) defines a new paradigm to produce high-quality products at the low cost by reacting quickly and effectively to changing demands in the highly volatile global markets. In Industry 4.0, the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled Wireless Sensors (WSs) in the manufacturing processes, such as equipment, machining, assembly, material handling, inspection, etc., generates a huge volume of data known as Industrial Big Data (IBD). However, the reliable and efficient gathering and transmission of this big data from the source sensors to the floor inspection system for the real-time monitoring of unexpected changes in the production and quality control processes is the biggest challenge for Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs). This is because of the harsh nature of the indoor industrial environment that causes high noise, signal fading, multipath effects, heat and electromagnetic interference, which reduces the transmission quality and trigger errors in the IWSNs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel cross-layer data gathering approach called CBI4.0 for active monitoring and control of manufacturing processes in the Industry 4.0. The key aim of the proposed CBI4.0 scheme is to exploit the multi-channel and multi-radio architecture of the sensor network to guarantee quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as higher data rates, throughput, and low packet loss, corrupted packets, and latency by dynamically switching between different frequency bands in the Multichannel Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs). By performing several simulation experiments through EstiNet 9.0 simulator, the performance of the proposed CBI4.0 scheme is compared against existing studies in the automobile Industry 4.0. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes and is suitable for effective control and monitoring of various events in the automobile Industry 4.0.}

The current Internet paradigm, which is infrastructure-centric, is not the right one to cope with such emerging scenario with a wider range of applications. This calls for a radically new Internet paradigm, that we name the Internet of People (IoP), where the humans and their personal devices are not seen merely as end users of applications, but become active elements of the Internet. Note that IoP is not a replacement of the current Internet infrastructure, but it exploits legacy Internet services as (reliable) primitives to achieve end-to-end connectivity on a global-scale. In this visionary paper, we first discuss the key features of the IoP paradigm along with the underlying research issues and challenges. Then we present emerging networking and computing paradigms that are anticipating IoP.}

Thus, there is an increasing demand, from both social and healthcare systems, for instruments and strategies to recognize cognitive decline, and possibly distinguish the precursor of serious neurodegeneration from “benign senile forgetfulness” or the temporary consequences of illness or trauma. However, this goal faces both technical and ethical issues. In this article we deal with the following: (i) re-definition of cognitive decline and its relationship with frailty definitions, starting from the recent work of international consensus groups for presymptomatic Alzheimer disease recognition; (ii) ethical problems concerning anonymous and personalized cognitive screening and the need for appropriate counselling; (iii) the need for more sensitive and specific tools to detect and distinguish pathological levels of cognitive decline and delineate the contribution of non-pathological decline to accumulated frailty impacts and (iv) the potential of the language domain and spontaneous speech analyses.}

Indeed, the evolution of the physical systems they control with transducers can be affected by surrounding physical processes over which they have no control and which may potentially hamper the achievement of their purposes. While it is illusory to hope for a comprehensive model of the physical environment at design time to anticipate and remove faults that may occur once these systems are deployed, it becomes necessary to evaluate their degree of effectiveness in vivo. In this paper, the degree of effectiveness is formally defined and generalized in the context of the measure theory. The measure is developed in the context of the Transferable Belief Model (TBM), an elaboration on the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence so as to handle epistemic and aleatory uncertainties respectively pertaining the users' expectations and the natural variability of the physical environment. The TBM is used in conjunction with the Input/Output Hidden Markov Modeling framework we denote by Ev-IOHMM to specify the expected evolution of the physical system controlled by the CPS and the tolerances towards uncertainties. The measure of effectiveness is then obtained from the forward algorithm, leveraging the conflict entailed by the successive combinations of the beliefs obtained from observations of the physical system and the beliefs corresponding to its expected evolution. The proposed approach is applied to autonomous vehicles and shows how the degree of effectiveness can be used for bench-marking their controller relative to the highway code speed limitations and passengers' well-being constraints, both modeled through an Ev-IOHMM.}

abstract = {This article examines the two major international data transfer schemes in existence today – the European Union (EU) model which at present is effectively the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Cross Border Privacy Rules system (CBPR), in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT). While IoT data ostensibly relates to things i.e. products and services, it impacts individuals and their data protection and privacy rights, and raises compliance issues for corporations especially in relation to international data flows. The GDPR regulates the processing of personal data of individuals who are EU data subjects including cross border data transfers. As an EU Regulation, the GDPR applies directly as law to EU member nations. The GDPR also has extensive extraterritorial provisions that apply to processing of personal data outside the EU regardless of place of incorporation and geographical area of operation of the data controller/ processor. There are a number of ways that the GDPR enables lawful international transfer of personal data including schemes that are broadly similar to APEC CBPR. APEC CBPR is the other major regional framework regulating transfer of personal data between APEC member nations. It is essentially a voluntary accountability scheme that initially requires acceptance at country level, followed by independent certification by an accountability agent of the organization wishing to join the scheme. APEC CBPR is viewed by many in the United States of America (US) as preferable to the EU approach because CBPR is considered more conducive to business than its counterpart schemes under the GDPR, and therefore is regarded as the scheme most likely to prevail. While there are broad areas of similarity between the EU and APEC approaches to data protection in the context of cross border data transfer, there are also substantial differences. This paper considers the similarities and major differences, and the overall suitability of the two models for the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) in which large amounts of personal data are processed on an on-going basis from connected devices around the world. This is the first time the APEC and GDPR cross-border data schemes have been compared in this way. The paper concludes with the author expressing a view as to which scheme is likely to set the global standard.}

It is a significant challenge for researchers to accurately determine their relationship for both SAT estimation from LST and LST validation using SAT. Bivariate correlation and regression analyses were performed to investigate the relationships between the LSTs retrieved from Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) images and the synchronous hourly SATs acquired at weather stations in this study. Two scenes of Landsat-5 images, both acquired at approximately 10:42A.M. (local time) in two different seasons, early spring 2008 and mid-fall 2009, respectively, were used to retrieve LSTs from their TIR band images. Both the 10A.M. and 11A.M. hourly SATs (Tmean, Tmax and Tmin) were obtained near-synchronously at the weather stations (approximately 100 values) in Shenzhen, South China. The results show that at the α = 0.05 level, (1) there is no statistically significant correlation between the LST and any of the SAT or height-corrected SAT variables for the two seasons; (2) it is likely that there is no prepositional or lagging effects for the correlation between the LST and any SAT or corrected SAT variable for the two seasons; (3) there is no pronounced linear regression trend between the LSTs and the SAT variables overall during both the spring 2008 and fall 2009 seasons; and (4) there is no distinct topography- (elevation or station height) and urbanization-induced land cover effects on the correlations between the LSTs and the SATs. The results suggest that it is unlikely and unfeasible to derive surface air temperatures directly from Landsat thermal infrared images in this case study due to their uncertain correlations at the α = 0.05 level.}

However, Blockchain Technology is designed to provide other Value Propositions beyond decentralized storage, such as innovative crypto economic and investment models and radical new forms of decentralized participative governance models that could lead to the evolution of new generation of Digital Platforms and multi stakeholder business interactions. In this paper, through a systematic literature review, we present a set of key Blockchain Value Propositions and a discussion on how it can complement to the evolution of Digital Platforms and the Collaborative Economy.

abstract = {Currently, many remote sensing images of the vegetation index being used have disadvantages, because of high cost, long cycles, and low resolution. Thus, it is difficult to extract and analyse vegetation information in the field. A vegetation index based on visible light images from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has the advantages of fast image acquisition and high ground resolution, which is superior to traditional remote sensing. However, the vegetation coverage in arid and semi-arid areas is low, and the soil background has a great impact on the common visible vegetation index. The real-time extraction and analysis of the index vegetation information can easily result in big errors. Therefore, according to the construction principle of the green-red vegetation index (GRVI) and modified green-red vegetation index (MGRVI), a new green-red vegetation index (NGRVI) is proposed in this study. First, the newly constructed index and several published indices are used to extract visible light images and generate greyscale images for each of the visible light vegetation indices. Then, the threshold of vegetation and non-vegetation pixel classification is established according to the method of iterative threshold, and the optimal threshold is used to extract the vegetation information from the greyscale images of each of the visible light vegetation indices. Finally, the accuracy difference in vegetation information extraction between the newly constructed and several published indices is compared. The results show that the precision of vegetation information extraction by NGRVI is higher than that of other visible light band vegetation indices; the kappa coefficient is 0.82, and the classification accuracy reaches near-complete consistency. To verify the accuracy of the NGRVI, one image from the same period was selected, and the vegetation information was extracted using the same method. The NGRVI based on UAV visible light images can accurately extract the vegetation information in arid and semi-arid areas, and the extraction accuracy can reach more than 90%. To summarize, NGRVI can accurately and effectively reflect the vegetation information in arid and semi-arid areas and become an important technical means for retrieving biological and physical parameters using visible light images.}

The incremental and fast nature of data generation in these systems necessitates scalable privacy-preserving mechanisms with high privacy and utility. However, privacy preservation often comes at the expense of data utility. We propose a new data perturbation algorithm, SEAL (Secure and Efficient data perturbation Algorithm utilizing Local differential privacy), based on Chebyshev interpolation and Laplacian noise, which provides a good balance between privacy and utility with high efficiency and scalability. Empirical comparisons with existing privacy-preserving algorithms show that SEAL excels in execution speed, scalability, accuracy, and attack resistance. SEAL provides flexibility in choosing the best possible privacy parameters, such as the amount of added noise, which can be tailored to the domain and dataset.}

Recent studies have demonstrated that such tasks can be efficiently performed following an operative paradigm where cameras transmit to a central controller local image features, rather than pixel-domain images. Furthermore, features from multiple camera views may be efficiently aggregated exploiting the spatial redundancy between overlapping views. In this paper we propose a routing protocol designed for supporting aggregation of image features in a VSN. First, we identify a predictor able to estimate the efficiency of local features aggregation between different cameras in a VSN. The proposed predictor is chosen so as to minimize the prediction error while keeping the network overhead cost low. Then, we harmonically integrate the proposed predictor in the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) in order to support the task of in-network feature aggregation. We propose a RPL objective function that takes into account the predicted aggregation efficiency and build the routes from the camera nodes to a central controller so that either energy consumption or used network bandwidth is minimized. Extensive experimental results confirm that the proposed approach can be used to increase the efficiency of VSNs.}

On the contrary, there has been sufficient amount of labeled information regarding vehicle regions in the domain of aerial images. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting vehicles on highway satellite images, without the time-consuming step of collecting sufficient training data in this domain. Our key idea is to adopt a novel transfer learning technology that transfers vehicle detectors trained in the aerial image domain to the satellite image domain. In doing so, several cutting-edge vehicle detection algorithms can be directly applied. More specifically, our transfer learning scheme is based on a supervised super-resolution algorithm, which learns mutually correlative sparse coefficients between high and low resolution image patches. Then, a linear SVM based detector is trained, the loss function of which is integrated into the sparse coding operation above. Experimental results have shown that the proposed framework can achieve significant improvement over several alternative and state-of-the-art schemes, with high precision and low false alarms.}

abstract = {In modern days, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) are being extensively used in various fields like military, healtcare, security, government sectors, supervision, home delivery agents, etc. They significantly enhance the potential of IoT devices by processing their data. However, issues like efficient trajectory planning, security and privacy protection, task scheduling, a delegation of tasks from one UAV to another in multi-UAV systems, etc., require rigorous research and analysis. In this paper, we consider a multi-UAV multi-IoT network, which is divided into certain hexagonal cells. Each cell consists of some IoT devices and a UAV to process the data those IoT devices collect from the environment. IoT devices in each cell are grouped into clusters so that UAVs hover only above cluster heads and midpoints of cell boundaries to collect and delegate tasks whenever required. Provision of both single and multi-hop task delegation exists in our system. The schedule is formed based on the UAV’s next intended arrival time as computed by cluster heads in the cell using the Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model. Timestamps of visiting midpoints of cell boundaries are fitted between predicted next arrival times of visiting cluster heads. Energy consumption and time of transition from one hovering point to another can be optimized. However, the most energy-efficient solution may not necessarily be the most delay efficient. A multi-objective optimization technique is applied to identify the Pareto-optimal front and select the best possible solution. Simulation results show that compared to other trajectory planning algorithms viz. Dijkstra’s and HEA, our proposed technique saves much more energy (approx 78% over the other two) and time (42% over the other two).}

abstract = {With more record-breaking skyscrapers built in big cities around the world, horizontal urban sprawl no longer dominates the research of urbanization rather than the vertical growth of cities. In such a context, the urban heat island problem cannot be understood by solely studying the impact of the horizontal urban expansion because the 3D structure of the urban landscape could severely alter the natural heat flux transport over the land surface and thus lead to bigger heat island problems. In addition to our current knowledge of impact of 2D landscape changes on urban thermal dynamics, it is crucial to understand the effects of 3D landscape pattern on the thermal environment, in order to maintain a sustainable and eco-friendly urban development. This study investigated the 2D/3D landscape pattern metrics and their association with the land surface temperature (LST) changes in a case study area of Shanghai City using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression model and Sharpley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) interpretation method based on datasets of land cover and digital surface model (DSM). Major findings include, 1) 3D landscape pattern metrics could better describe the undulation and heterogeneity of urban surface and were essential when explaining the variation of LST compared with conventional 2D landscape pattern metrics, 2) Low-rise and high-rise buildings tend to alleviate LST while buildings with medium height heating the surroundings; 3) the cooling effect of vegetation was significantly strong; 4) different urban functional types impact the surface temperature in the way determined by their 3D urban landscape pattern. These findings may help urban planners and landscape designers achieve the goal of minimizing urban heat island using computer models of 3D urban structure.}

Therefore, in this paper, a novel picture fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model is proposed to solve the site selection problem for car sharing stations. To this end, the definition of picture fuzzy sets is adopted to accurately portray the voting information. Then, a concept of knowledge measure is defined for PFNs and an objective method based on knowledge measure is proposed to derive the weight information of criteria. To rank the candidate sites for car sharing stations, an extended MULTIMOORA method based on novel score function and Borda rule is devised. The proposed MCDM model is applied to solve the site selection for car sharing stations in Bejing. Finally, comparative analyses are given to verify the superiority of the proposed MCDM model.}

This paper proposes a novel score-based traffic law-enforcement and network management system (SLEM) that is based on connected vehicles (CV) technology. SLEM assigns a score to each driver which reflects her/his driving performance and compliance with traffic laws. The proposed system adopts a rewarding mechanism that rewards high-performing drivers and penalizes low-performing drivers who fail to obey the laws. The reward mechanism is in the form of a route guidance strategy that restricts low-score drivers from accessing certain roadway sections and time periods that are strategically selected in order to achieve an optimal traffic pattern in the network in which high-score drivers experience less congestion and a higher level of safety. A nationwide survey study was conducted to measure public acceptance of the proposed system. Another survey targeted a focused group of traffic operation and safety professionals. Based on the results of these surveys, a set of logistic regression models were developed to examine the sensitivity of public acceptance to policy and behavioral variables. The results showed that about 65.7 percent of the public and about 60.0 percent of professionals who participated in this study support the real-world implementation of SLEM.}

The intersection of limits to government support with the growing mobility needs of the elderly and of people with disabilities calls for the development of tools that enable us to better prioritise investment in those areas that would deliver the greatest benefits to travellers. In principle and, to a lesser extent, in practice, many trains and buses are already accessible to nearly all users, leaving the stations and interchanges as the single largest and most expensive challenge facing operators trying to improve overall access to the network. Focussing on travel time and interchange differences, we present a method that uses network science and spatio-temporal analysis to rank stations in a way that minimises the divergence between accessible and non-accessible routes. Taking London as case study, we show that 50% of the most frequently followed journeys become 50% longer when wheelchair accessibility becomes a constraint. Prioritising accessibility upgrades using our network approach yields a total travel time that is more than 8 times better than a solution based on random choice, and 30% more effective than a solution that seeks solely to minimise the number of interchanges facing those with mobility constraints. These results highlight the potential for the analysis of ‘smart card’ data to enable network operators to obtain maximum value from their infrastructure investments in support of expanded access to all users.}

This big data not only brings great benefits and opportunities to human beings but also brings many risks and challenges. One major challenge is how to represent and treat higher-order and heterogeneous data from multi-sources. Tensors are emerging as powerful tools for representation and modeling of this data. Tensor decomposition can be used to extract potentially useful information from this data. Thus, it has attracted much attention from the big data community. The main target of this paper is to propose a novel data fusion framework to solve several main challenges of CPSS data applications, including CPSS big data representation, fusion, efficient computing, storage, robustness, and security issues. In this paper, we use many graphics to visualize complex tensor decomposition and transformation processes. The visualization may help the readers better understand tensor and tensor decomposition. It also provides a general guideline and a good starting point for those who are interested in tensor and tensor decomposition. Specifically, we first introduce the most extensively used matrix and tensor decomposition methods. Second, the current popular data fusion methods are reviewed and summarized. Third, we propose a novel tensor-network-conversion-based data fusion approach which can simultaneously analyze multiple matrices and multiple tensors. To better understand this approach, we give a brief review of tensor network. Fourth, based on the proposed approach, a novel CPSS big data fusion framework is proposed in this paper. Meanwhile, we verify it by a concise case study. Finally, some challenges and open problems of the proposed framework are discussed. The discussion also includes some exciting future research directions in the big data fusion field.}

abstract = {In recent years, the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), which represents inseparable relationships between humans and devices, has become a hot research topic in wireless networks. As more heterogeneous devices will be connected, a higher frequency spectrum becomes a requirement. The cognitive radio (CR) technology can improve spectrum utilization in an opportunistic communication manner. However, dynamic spectrum availability and heterogeneous devices complicate routing design in CR-SIoT. Opportunistic routing (OR) can mitigate the drawbacks for routing design of cognitive radio social internet of things, CR-SIoT, by leveraging the broadcast nature of wireless channels; and thereby enhance the network performance. In this work, we propose an energy and trust aware OR in CR-SIoT, which jointly considers energy efficiency, trust and social features. In the proposed scheme, we exploit a new routing metric for selecting forwarding candidates based on optimal stopping theory and use network coding for the data transmission between trusted nodes for multiple types of flows in CR-SIoT. In addition, we propose a game-theoretic approach to allocate the trusted channel for CR-SIoT which is based on expected network gain. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed secure OR protocol performs better than existing routing protocols in CR-SIoT in terms of average energy cost per bit, packet delivery ratio (PDR), network lifetime, average delay, throughput and expected cost of routing.}

Designing policies that are aimed at achieving such radical transitions in the energy system will require ever more in-depth modelling of end-use demand, efficiency and fuel switching, as well as an increasing need for regional, sectoral, and agent disaggregation to capture technological, jurisdictional and policy detail. Building and using these models entails complex trade-offs between the level of detail, the size of the system boundary, and the available computing resources. The availability of data to characterise key energy system sectors and interactions is also a key driver of model structure and parameterisation, and there are many blind spots and design compromises that are caused by data scarcity. We may soon, however, live in a world of data abundance, potentially enabling previously impossible levels of resolution and coverage in energy economy models. But while big data concepts and platforms have already begun to be used in a number of selected energy research applications, their potential to improve or even completely revolutionise energy economy modelling has been almost completely overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we explore the challenges and possibilities of this emerging frontier. We identify critical gaps and opportunities for the field, as well as developing foundational concepts for guiding the future application of big data to energy economy modelling, with reference to the existing literature on decision making under uncertainty, scenario analysis and the philosophy of science.}

Besides, through the Density Estimator (DE), density-based methods such as MeanShift, and QuickShift can find the local density maximums as Modes that are excellent representatives of the clusters. However, concentrating on the modes only may suffer from the over-segmentation problem. On the other hand, most density-based methods cannot satisfy the scenario requiring partitioning the data samples into exactly K clusters. To overcome these issues, QuickDSC: a novel and efficient clustering algorithm that groups the samples through the Quick Density Subgraph Estimation, is proposed in this work. It firstly identifies the high-density-connected samples as the Density Subgraphs (DSs). And then, the importance of DSs is estimated from two aspects: density and geometric weight. The top-K important DSs are selected as the cluster centers and based on which the cluster memberships of remaining samples are determined. QuickDSC incorporates three crucial clustering attributes: (1) the cluster centroids are modes (as in density-based methods); (2) able to efficiently return results by utilizing the underlying density structure (as in hierarchical clustering methods); and (3) it explicitly returns K clusters (e.g., K-Means, K-Modes). In addition, QuickDSC is theoretically and empirically efficient. It is only slightly slower than classical clustering methods such as K-Means and DBSCAN. Experiments on artificial and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, and the clustering quality outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.}

Usually, sensor nodes operate with limited battery capacity. Using conventional batteries, it is not always efficient to design long-lasting sensor networks. Moreover, the replacement of the batteries is too challenging to operate in harsh environmental conditions. Therefore, to overcome, one such technique is to recharge the battery of sensor nodes using an energy harvesting system. On the other hand, some of the existing energy harvesting WSNs still lacking the intelligent strategy for judiciously utilizing both the energy management and harvesting system.

We also summarize their shortcomings and ability to deal with the energy harvesting system. In renewable energy harvesting schemes, we present various energy harvesting mechanisms such as solar, wind and others.

The results showed that cost, interoperability, and scalability are the key FPVs for the diffusion of EC.

To achieve this objective, water consumption was examined at the micro-scale level (census tract) for a better resolution and statistical power. Initially, fifteen predictor variables including sociodemographic factors and buildings characteristics were considered. A preliminary clustering of census tracts followed by a comprehensive multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the average cadastral value (positive correlation) and the number of inhabitant per household (negative correlation) were the most significant predictors. Other significant variables included, for instance, the height of the buildings (positive correlation) and the residential density (negative correlation). In addition, a spatial analysis revealed a gradient of water consumption from higher values in the city centre to lower values at the periphery. These results could be used for urban planning and management purposes by the municipality and stakeholders in order to further lower the water footprint of the city of Seville.}

abstract = {5G technology is called to support the next generation of wireless communications and realize the “Internet of Everything” through its mMTC (massive Machine-Type-Communications) service. The recently standardized 5G-AKA protocol is intended to deal with security and privacy issues detected in earlier generations. Nevertheless, several 5G-AKA shortcomings have been reported, including a possibly excessive computational complexity for many IoT devices. To address these, a promising lightweight 2-pass authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol for 5G mobile communications has recently been proposed by Braeken. Compared to the 5G-AKA protocol, this does not require the use of public key encryption. This paper analyzes the security claims of Braeken’s protocol and shows that it does not provide full unlinkability, but only session unlinkability, and is (still) subject to Linkability of AKA Failure Messages (LFM) attacks. We propose solutions to such problems and prove that symmetric-key based protocols cannot offer higher privacy protection levels without compromising availability. We then describe an enhanced version of this protocol that addresses these vulnerabilities and supports forward secrecy, which is a desirable feature for low-cost IoT devices.}

abstract = {Business leaders and policymakers within service economies are placing greater emphasis on well-being, given the role of workers in such settings. Whilst people’s well-being can lead to economic growth, it can also have the opposite effect if overlooked. Therefore, enhancing subjective well-being (SWB) is pertinent for all organisations for the sustainable development of an economy. While health conditions were previously deemed the most reliable predictors, the availability of data on people’s personal lifestyles now offers a new dimension into well-being for organisations. Using open data available from the national Annual Population Survey in the UK, which measures SWB, this research uncovered that among several independent variables to predict varying levels of people's perceived well-being, long-term health conditions, one's marital status, and age played a key role in SWB. The proposed model provides the key indicators of measuring SWB for organisations using big data.}
