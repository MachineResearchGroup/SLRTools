abstract = {The novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) has become the reason for the world to declare it as a global pandemic, which has already taken many lives from all around the world. This pandemic has become a disaster since the spreading rate from person to person is incredibly high and many techniques have come forth to aid in stopping the infection. Although various types of methods have been put into implementation, the search and suggestions of new approaches to reduce the increasing rate of infection will never come to an end until a vaccine terminates this pandemic. This study focuses on proposing a new framework that is based on Deep Learning algorithms for recognizing the COVID-19 cases, mostly in public places. The algorithms include Background Subtraction for extracting the foreground of thermal images from thermal videos generated by Thermal Cameras through the Thermal Imaging process and the Convolutional Neural Network for detecting people infected with the virus. This automated prototype works in a real-time scenario that helps identify people with the disease and will try to trace it while separating them from having any other contact. This proposal intends to achieve a satisfying growth in determining the real cases of COVID-19 and minimize the spreading rate of this virus to the max, ultimately avoiding more deaths.}

Some of them leverage Data Stream Mining (DSM) techniques applied over sensorial information. Injection attacks can undermine the effectiveness of DSM-based CA by fabricating artificial sensorial readings.The goal of this paper is to study the impact of injection attacks in terms of accuracy and immediacy to illustrate the time the adversary remains unnoticed. Two well-known DSM techniques (K-Nearest Neighbours and Hoeffding Adaptive Trees) and three data sources (location, gyroscope and accelerometer) are considered due to their widespread usage Results show that even if the attacker does not previously know anything about the victim, a significant attack surface arises – 1.35 min are needed, in the best case, to detect the attack on gyroscope and accelerometer and 7.27 min on location data. Moreover, we show that the type of sensor at stake and configuration settings may have a dramatic effect on countering this threat.}

Nevertheless, the proliferation of solar energy poses challenges to power system operations, mostly due to its uncertainty, locational specificity, and variability. The prevalence of smart grids enables artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to mitigate solar integration problems with massive amounts of solar energy data. Different AI subfields (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, ensemble learning, and metaheuristic learning) have brought breakthroughs in solar energy, especially in its grid integration. However, AI research in solar integration is still at the preliminary stage, and is lagging behind the AI mainstream. Aiming to inspire deep AI involvement in the solar energy domain, this paper presents a taxonomical overview of AI applications in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Text mining techniques are first used as an assistive tool to collect, analyze, and categorize a large volume of literature in this field. Then, based on the constructed literature infrastructure, recent advancements in AI applications to solar forecasting, PV array detection, PV system fault detection, design optimization, and maximum power point tracking control problems are comprehensively reviewed. Current challenges and future trends of AI applications in solar integration are also discussed for each application theme.}

Due to the nature of this kind of node, the structure of a FANET is dynamic, changing very often. Since it has applications in military scenarios and other mission-critical systems, an agile and reliable network is essential with robust and efficient routing protocols. Nonetheless, maintaining an acceptable network delay generated by the selection of routes remains a considerable challenge, owing to the nodes’ high mobility. This article addresses this problem by proposing a routing scheme based on an improved Q-Learning algorithm to reduce network delay in scenarios with high-mobility, called Q-FANET. This proposal has its performance evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art methods using the WSNET simulator. The experiments provide evidence that the Q-FANET presents lower delay, a minor increase in packet delivery ratio, and significant lower jitter compared with other reinforcement learning-based routing protocols.}

abstract = {Due to the pervasive diffusion of personal mobile and IoT devices, many “smart environments” (e.g., smart cities and smart factories) will be, among others, generators of huge amounts of data. To provide value-add services in these environments, data will have to be analysed to extract knowledge. Currently, this is typically achieved through centralised cloud-based data analytics services. However, according to many studies, this approach may present significant issues from the standpoint of data ownership, and even wireless network capacity. One possibility to cope with these shortcomings is to move data analytics closer to where data is generated. In this paper we tackle this issue by proposing and analysing a distributed learning framework, whereby data analytics are performed at the edge of the network, i.e., on locations very close to where data is generated. Specifically, in our framework, partial data analytics are performed directly on the nodes that generate the data, or on nodes close by (e.g., some of the data generators can take this role on behalf of subsets of other nodes nearby). Then, nodes exchange partial models and refine them accordingly. Our framework is general enough to host different analytics services. In the specific case analysed in the paper we focus on a learning task, considering two distributed learning algorithms. Using an activity recognition and a pattern recognition task, both on reference datasets, we compare the two learning algorithms between each other and with a central cloud solution (i.e., one that has access to the complete datasets). Our results show that using distributed machine learning techniques, it is possible to drastically reduce the network overhead, while obtaining performance comparable to the cloud solution in terms of learning accuracy. The analysis also shows when each distributed learning approach is preferable, based on the specific distribution of the data on the nodes.}

abstract = {Although the deep learning-based indoor image localization has made significant improvement in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and storage requirement of large indoor scenes, the need for collecting huge labeled training data severely limits its practical application. Recently, the synthetic images rendered from widely available 3D models have shown promising potential to relieve the data collection problem. However, due to the dramatic differences between the synthetic and real images, the localization accuracy of approaches trained on synthetic images is not comparable to the methods trained on real images. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation-based approach to address this issue. Specifically, the proposed approach mainly contains a model consisting of a multi-level constrained pose regression network and a feature-level discriminator network. The discriminator network forces the pose regression network to generate domain-invariant features from real and synthetic images by adversarial learning and thus reduces the performance gaps. In addition, the multi-level constraints further enhance the localization accuracy of pose regression. We perform extensive experiments on open-source rendering images in different settings. The results show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance. The code for the proposed work is available at https://github.com/lqing900205/BIM_domainadaptation.}

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a common event, affecting almost 400,000 individuals annually in North America. Initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and early defibrillation using an automated external defibrillator (AED) are critical for survival, yet many bystanders are reluctant to intervene. Digital technologies, including mobile devices, social media and crowdsourcing may help play a role to improve survival from SCA. In this article we review the current digital tools and strategies available to increase rates of bystander recognition of SCA, prompt immediate activation of Emergency Medical Services (EMS), initiate high quality CPR and to locate, retrieve and operate AEDs. Smartphones can help to both educate and connect bystanders with EMS dispatchers, through text messaging or video-calling, to encourage the initiation of CPR and retrieval of the closest AED. Wearable devices and household smartspeakers could play a future role in continuous vital signs monitoring in individuals at-risk of lethal arrhythmias and send an alert to either chosen contacts or EMS. Machine learning algorithms and mathematical modeling may aid EMS dispatchers with better recognition of SCA as well as policymakers with where to best place AEDs for optimal accessibility. There are challenges with the use of digital tech, including the need for government regulation and issues with data ownership, accessibility and interoperability. Future research will include smart cities, e-linkages, new technologies and using social media for mass education. Together or in combination, these emerging digital technologies may represent the next leap forward in SCA survival.}

Hence, EEG has not been extensively applied to the design of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems. HAR involves classifying the activities of an individual that are captured by sensory technologies. To address this issue, this paper introduces a deep learning-based framework for classifying EEG artifacts (FCEA), based on a person’s physiological activity. The FCEA proposes an approach for designing a processing pipeline involving a Convolutional Neural Network and a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network, in order to classify raw EEG signals based on the EEG artifacts. To demonstrate the performance of the FCEA, a 3-class dataset of EEG activities was created. A consumer-grade EEG wearable device was used to collect the data from two prefrontal EEG channels, from 8 participants whilst speaking loudly, reading printed text and watching a TV program. These activities include jaw-clenching and head and eye movements, that are part of a wide range of daily human activities. Moreover, these activities cannot easily be detected by using the sensory technologies that have commonly been used in HAR. The comparative performance analysis results demonstrate that the 1- and 2-channel models trained by the FCEA outperform competitive state-of-the-art deep-learning models for HAR and raw EEG data. The deep-learning approach proposed by the FCEA improves raw data processing to obtain a better generalization performance.}

Recently, cognitive computing and artificial intelligence techniques offer new opportunities for the revolution of industrial CPSs. Therefore, to achieve security in industrial CPS, AI based intrusion detection system (IDS) can be developed to detect anomalies and prevent their harmful effects. With this motivation, this paper presents a novel cognitive computing based IDS technique to achieve security in industrial CPS. The proposed model involves different stages of operations such as data acquisition, preprocessing, feature selection, classification, and parameter optimization. The proposed model involves preprocessing to discard the noise that exists in the data. Then, the presented model uses binary bacterial foraging optimization (BBFO) based feature selection technique to elect an optimal subset of features. Besides the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model is applied to identify the presence of intrusions in the industrial CPS environment. Finally, Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (NADAM) optimizer is applied for the hyperparameter optimization of the GRU model in such a way that the detection rate can be enhanced. In order to validate the performance of the BBFO-GRU model, a series of experiments were carried out using the data from industrial CPS and the resultant values highlighted the promising performance of the proposed model with an accuracy of 98.45%.}

The design of these dashboards typically consolidates information into a single view for government and industry to efficiently and effectively monitor the performance of urban systems – such as those of energy, built form, transport, culture, performance, innovation and health. Many of these dashboards focus on a one-way flow of data and thus do not cater specifically to the functions of public participation, community engagement and collaboration. With growing concerns in digital democracy, there is an increasing demand for software and tools that maximise human-centred design elements and include such participatory and collaborative features. The current trajectory of their development can be reframed to support this. This review frames a more porous definition of the term, integrating the concept of the urban dashboard among other existing digital urban planning methods and tools. It highlights the potential for further work to integrate with emerging media such as virtual, augmented and mixed realities.

In this scenario, artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to play a major role in the energy market.

The main drivers are the four key techniques used in current AI technologies, including: i) fuzzy logic systems; ii) artificial neural networks; iii) genetic algorithms; and iv) expert systems. In developed countries, the power industry has started using AI to connect with smart meters, smart grids, and the Internet of Things devices. These AI technologies will lead to the improvement of efficiency, energy management, transparency, and the usage of renewable energies. In recent decades/years, new AI technology has brought significant improvements to how power system devices monitor data, communicate with the system, analyze input–output, and display data in unprecedented ways. New applications in the energy system become feasible when these new AI developments are incorporated into the energy industry. But on the contrary, much more investment is needed in global research into AI and data-driven models. In terms of power supply, AI can help utilities provide customers with renewable and affordable electricity from complex sources in a secure manner, while at the same time providing these customers with the opportunity to use their own energy more efficiently.

We selected a busy open area at Murdoch University to generate the datasets using so-called “smart bins”, which are rubbish bins that we enabled to work as access points. The data gathered consists of two different datasets. In the first, four users generated labelled WiFi fingerprints for all available Reference Points using four different smartphones. The second dataset includes 2450865 auto-generated rows received from more than 1000 devices.

Several models have been introduced to conceptualize and calculate the urban energy system, and to demonstrate the variants that calibrate the local energy efficiency. Nevertheless, cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, electrical -and even autonomous- vehicles, smart building systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data etc. are growing within cities and question the identified urban energy efficiency, since they demand enormous amounts of power. In this regard, policy makers are concerned of the emerging technologies’ energy efficiency and their impact on the urban energy system and they attempt to introduce corresponding standards for their development. This article focuses on the impact of AI and big data in city's energy efficiency. More specifically, a literature analysis is performed and returned a taxonomy of existing energy efficiency assessment models under the lens of AI and big data. Moreover, the definition of a unified assessment model for AI and big data energy efficiency is approached.}

The pre-hazard early warning system are crucial to the disaster prevention, and would be an important part of smart city planning. This paper introduced a way to support the pre-hazard identification based on ground water level change fast prediction, which is the key factor for occurrence of the rainstorm-induced hazard. Firstly, the remote monitoring stations supplied by solar power are established, the data about the water content of surface soil and rainfall were real-time collected from different sensors. By introducing the sliding windows of historical data and for prediction, the early warning system are effective in pre-hazard identification as considering the vulnerable environmental factors such as rainfall, surface runoff, temperature, sunshine, vegetations, soil properties and structures. Based on the model analysis on the 4982 time-series samples, taking the sliding window T=7d of historical data and sliding window G=7d for prediction as an example, the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of the predicted result of the model reached 0.0812, with R2 up to 0.9776. Thus, Our study aims to provide a strategic way in quick response for the connection of pre-disaster planning and urban planning, and the improvement of disaster prevention, mitigation capacities, increasing the resilience of mountainous cities and their inhabitants.}

abstract = {Surrogate modeling can play a key role in reducing high computational burdens for large-scale physics-based modeling and uncertainty quantification. With the rapid development of large-scale building stock energy modeling, surrogate modeling has also begun to be widely applied in this field; however, most existing surrogate models lack hourly time resolution for regional-scale modeling, which is essential for understanding building demand profiles and grid impacts. Further, there is generally a lack of necessary data and feature engineering frameworks specific to building modeling for efficiently managing large datasets and complex computations. This paper proposes a modeling framework for large-scale (city-/region-scale), high-resolution, high-fidelity surrogate building stock energy models. Our developed framework consists of six modules: (1) building stock energy modeling (ComStockTM and ResStockTM), (2) data engineering for large simulation data, (3) high performance computing workflow, (4) feature engineering, (5) machine learning model development, and (6) model performance evaluation. Two case studies apply the developed framework in both residential and commercial building stock analysis to demonstrate its computational efficiency and surrogate modeling accuracies. Results show that surrogate models, when efficiently trained using the HPC workflow module, reach a high level of modeling accuracy for two case studies.}

These noisy terms have implicit meanings and form part of the rich semantic context that must be analysed to gain complete insights from social media feeds. This paper proposes an improved framework for pre-processing of social media feeds for better performance. To do this, the use of an integrated knowledge base (ikb) which comprises a local knowledge source (Naijalingo), urban dictionary and internet slang was combined with the adapted Lesk algorithm to facilitate semantic analysis of social media feeds. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach performed better than existing methods when it was tested on three machine learning models, which are support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, and convolutional neural networks. The framework had an accuracy of 94.07% on a standardized dataset, and 99.78% on localised dataset when used to extract sentiments from tweets. The improved performance on the localised dataset reveals the advantage of integrating the use of local knowledge sources into the process of analysing social media feeds particularly in interpreting slangs/acronyms/abbreviations that have contextually rooted meanings.}

Previous works, such as long-term observations by monitoring stations, cannot provide customized data services and in-time emergency response under urgent situations (gas leakage incidents). Therefore, we first review the up-to-date approaches (often machine learning and optimization methods) with respect to urban air quality monitoring and hazardous gas source analysis. To bridge the gap between present solutions and practical requirements, we design a conceptual framework, namely MAsmed (Multi-Agents for sensing, monitoring, estimating and determining), to provide fine-grained concentration maps, customized data services, and on-demand emergency management. In this framework, we leverage the hybrid design of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and mobile crowdsensing (MCS) to sense urban air quality and relevant data (e.g. traffic data, meteorological data, etc.); Using the sensed data, we can create a fine-grained air quality map for the authorities and relevant stakeholders, and provide on-demand source term estimation and source searching methods to estimate, seek, and determine the sources, thereby aiding decision-makers in emergency response (e.g. for evacuation). In this paper, we also identify several potential opportunities for future research.}

The integration of IoT technology in the Smart Grids is a critical way to accelerate the digitization of the power grid and is useful for the efficient performance of the energy grid infrastructure. For efficient real-time data analysis and decision-making, the Internet of Things will incorporate various communication systems seamlessly. To achieve efficient communication between all Internet of Things, devices are expected to use multiple means, including smart sensors, cable and wireless communication. Improved Internet of Things sensor technologies and connectivity could theoretically prevent or minimize the potential to natural disaster transmission lines, improve transmission power capacity and reduce economic losses. A smart grid is a variety of sensors, devices, and data sets that continuously capture high-resolution data equal to individual IoT conditions. A vast amount of data is one of the biggest challenges on the Internet of Things. Edge Computing is trying to process data close to linked sensors to address this problem, where the data is gathered and processed. This paper aims to investigate the edge computing solutions for the smart grid. A comprehensive review of both emerging issues and edge computing in the Smart Grid environment is discussed and explained. There are two primary components to the energy sharing process among Prosumers: information/digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence Scheduling Techniques. Each of them is mentioned in detail to discuss the Prosumer smart Grid. Furthermore, Edge Computing and classifications (cloudlet, Fog computing and Multi-Access) are among the suitable network methods mentioned in this paper.

This results from the combination of the supply chain losses, the rebound effect of demand increases, following efficiency improvements, and the vigorous economic development in South-East Asia. Even under the COVID-19 crisis, China has come again on the path of economic growth. The efficiency improvements in energy generation, supply, use, and waste heat recovery are needed drivers to reduce energy consumption and emissions. This contribution is examining the recent technology developments and research of the key elements in the design and operation of sustainable energy processes, systems, and networks. The interactions among the stages of energy conversion, distribution, storage and final use are meticulously investigated, and the critical features that are associated with breakthrough performance in terms of sustainability have been identified. Identification of highly efficient and sustainable energy materials through a systematic approach, whether serving energy conversion mechanisms, mitigation of harmful emissions and by-products, energy storage is of paramount importance for the design of sustainable energy systems. Advanced design methods focusing on multi-scale modelling covering the aspects from the molecular level to the process level and ultimately to the plant and network-level have been discussed, and the main challenges have been pinpointed. Heat exchange units, as the backbone of any energy integration system, pose a great challenge in achieving highly-performing energy systems. Advanced operation strategies supported by sophisticated optimal decision tools and control schemes enable the efficient operation and the maintenance of sustainability under uncertain and perpetually varying conditions. Energy storage provides the buffer for attenuating the effects of variability, whereas smart city, home management and smart production ensure uninterrupted and optimal energy supply. The contribution is complemented with the recent developments in the current VSI from the PRES′19 Conference.}

The number of passengers in the buses or at the stations is necessary for making an optimal scheduling policy of public buses. We develop a crowd counting algorithm to provide the counting information for a bus dispatch system in a human–machine system. In consideration of the challenges (e.g., pedestrian occlusions, non-uniform crowd distributions, and scale variations) existed in hand-crafted features based crowd counting, a scale-distribution-aware multi-column convolutional neural network (SDA-MCNN) is presented to count crowds by summing up the output (denoted as the density map) of the SDA-MCNN. The SDA-MCNN is robust to scale variations by processing a crowd image with multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) columns and minimizing the per-scale loss. A weighted Euclidean loss is proposed to handle non-uniform crowd distributions. The loss can increase activations in dense regions and restrain activations in backgrounds. A new approach to estimate perspective maps of dense crowds is put forward to offer necessary information for generating density maps with human-shaped kernels. Evaluations on benchmarks are performed with other state-of-the-art counting approaches using deep neural networks. Comparative results verify the accuracy of our counting approach in challenging crowds. Evaluations on the real world BUS data reveal the accuracy of the proposed approach in counting passengers in spite of the complex environment.}

Edge computing is a novel computing paradigm proposed to resolve such a problem. As a promising technology, it extends computing from cloud center to the edge of network. Edge computing has the advantage of low latency to achieve a shorter response time, as well as potential to address the concerns of energy consuming, bandwidth burden and security issue.

Semantic communication goes beyond the common Shannon paradigm of guaranteeing the correct reception of each single transmitted bit, irrespective of the meaning conveyed by the transmitted bits. The idea is that, whenever communication occurs to convey meaning or to accomplish a goal, what really matters is the impact that the received bits have on the interpretation of the meaning intended by the transmitter or on the accomplishment of a common goal. Focusing on semantic and goal-oriented aspects, and possibly combining them, helps to identify the relevant information, i.e. the information strictly necessary to recover the meaning intended by the transmitter or to accomplish a goal. Combining knowledge representation and reasoning tools with machine learning algorithms paves the way to build semantic learning strategies enabling current machine learning algorithms to achieve better interpretation capabilities and contrast adversarial attacks. 6G semantic networks can bring semantic learning mechanisms at the edge of the network and, at the same time, semantic learning can help 6G networks to improve their efficiency and sustainability.}

This vision carries us from compute-based centralized schemes to a more distributed environment offering a vast amount of applications such as smart wearables, smart home, smart mobility, and smart cities. In this paper we discuss applicability of IoT in healthcare and medicine by presenting a holistic architecture of IoT eHealth ecosystem. Healthcare is becoming increasingly difficult to manage due to insufficient and less effective healthcare services to meet the increasing demands of rising aging population with chronic diseases. We propose that this requires a transition from the clinic-centric treatment to patient-centric healthcare where each agent such as hospital, patient, and services are seamlessly connected to each other. This patient-centric IoT eHealth ecosystem needs a multi-layer architecture: (1) device, (2) fog computing and (3) cloud to empower handling of complex data in terms of its variety, speed, and latency. This fog-driven IoT architecture is followed by various case examples of services and applications that are implemented on those layers. Those examples range from mobile health, assisted living, e-medicine, implants, early warning systems, to population monitoring in smart cities. We then finally address the challenges of IoT eHealth such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, device–network–human interfaces, security, and privacy.}

Deep Neural Networks and the swift public embracement of medical wearable have been productively metamorphosed in the recent few years. Deep Neural Network-powered IoT allowed innovative developments for medical society and distinctive probabilities to the medical data analysis in the healthcare industry (Yin, Yang, Zhang, & Oki, 2016). Despite this progress, several issues still required to be handled while concerning the quality of service. The key to flourishing in the shift from client-oriented to patient-oriented medical data analysis for healthcare society is applying deep networks to provide a high level of quality in key attributes such as end-to-end response time, overhead and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a holistic Deep Neural Network-driven IoT smart health care method called, Grey Filter Bayesian Convolution Neural Network (GFB-CNN) based on real-time analytics. In this paper, we propose a holistic AI-driven IoT eHealth architecture based on the Grey Filter Bayesian Convolution Neural Network in which the key quality of service parameters like, time and overhead is reduced with a higher rate of accuracy. The feasibility of the method is investigated using a comprehensive Mobile HEALTH (MHEALTH) dataset. This illustrative example discusses and addresses all important aspects of the proposed method from design suggestions such as corresponding overheads, time, accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By simulation, the performance of GFB-CNN method is compared to the state-of-the-art methods with various synthetically generated scenarios. Results show that with minimal time and overhead incurred for sensing and data collection, our method accurately evaluates medical data analysis for heart signals by efficient differentiation between healthy and unhealthy heart signals.}

In this paper, we propose a novel progressive conditional generative adversarial network (PC-GAN) for 3D object recognition by conditioning the input with progressive learning strategies. PC-GAN is a powerful adversarial model whose generator automatically produces realistic 3D objects with annotations, and the discriminator distinguishes them from the training distribution and recognizes their categories. We train the discriminative classifier simultaneously with the generator to predict the class label by embedding a SoftMax classifier. Progressive learning uses input samples from lower to higher resolutions to increase the generator performance gradually and produce informative objects for a certain class of objects. The key idea of adopting progressing learning is to mitigate overshoots issues of the discriminator and increase variations in the generated objects by learning progressively. This strategy helps the generator to produce more realistic synthetic objects and improve the active classification performance of the discriminator. Our proposed PC-GAN is trained for object classification in a supervised manner and the performance is evaluated on two public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our adversarial PC-GAN outperforms the existing volumetric discriminative classifiers in term of classification accuracy.}

abstract = {To model and forecast flight delays accurately, it is crucial to harness various vehicle trajectory and contextual sensor data on airport tarmac areas. These heterogeneous sensor data, if modelled correctly, can be used to generate a situational awareness map. Existing techniques apply traditional supervised learning methods onto historical data, contextual features and route information among different airports to predict flight delay are inaccurate and only predict arrival delay but not departure delay, which is essential to airlines. In this paper, we propose a vision-based solution to achieve a high forecasting accuracy, applicable to the airport. Our solution leverages a snapshot of the airport situational awareness map, which contains various trajectories of aircraft and contextual features such as weather and airline schedules. We propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture, TrajCNN, which captures both the spatial and temporal information from the situational awareness map. Additionally, we reveal that the situational awareness map of the airport has a vital impact on estimating flight departure delay. Our proposed framework obtained a good result (around 18 min error) for predicting flight departure delay at Los Angeles International Airport.}

abstract = {Sensors in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) sense, process, and transmit information simultaneously. They mainly find applications in agriculture monitoring, environment monitoring, smart city development and defence. These applications demand high-end performance from the WSN. However, the performance of a WSN is highly vulnerable to various types of security threats. Any intrusion may reduce the performance of the WSN and result in fatal problems. Hence, fast intrusion detection and prevention is of great use. This paper aims towards fast detection and prevention of any intrusion using a machine learning approach based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. We have proposed three methods (S-GPR, C-GPR and GPR) based on feature scaling for accurate prediction of k-barrier coverage probability. We have selected the number of nodes, sensing range, Sensor to Intruder Velocity Ratio (SIVR), Mobile to Static Node Ratio (MSNR), angle of the intrusion path, and required k as the potential features. These features are extracted using an analytical approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method III accurately predicts the k-barrier coverage probability and outperforms the other two methods (I and II) with a correlation coefficient (R = 0.85) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.095). Further, the proposed methods achieve a higher accuracy as compared to other benchmark schemes.}

A sequence of windowed samples are extracted from acceleration responses in a novel data pre-processing pipeline, and an LSTM network is developed to classify the signals into multiple classes. Predicted classification of a signal by the LSTM network into one of the damage levels indicates the presence of damage. Furthermore, multiple structural responses obtained from the vibration sensors placed on a structure are provided as input to the LSTM model, and the resulting predicted class probabilities are used to identify the locations with a high probability of damage. The proposed method is validated on the experimental benchmark data of the Qatar University Grandstand Simulator (QUGS) for binary classification, as well as the Z24 bridge benchmark data for multiclass damage classification associated with different levels of pier settlement and the numbers of ruptured tendons. The results show that the proposed LSTM-based method performs on par with the one dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) on the QUGS dataset and outperforms 1D CNN on the Z24 bridge dataset. The novelty of this paper lies in the use of recurrent neural network-based windowed LSTM for multiclass damage identification and localization using vibration response of the structure.}

The IoT revolution is reshaping current healthcare practices by consolidating technological, economic, and social views. Since December 2019, the spreading of COVID-19 across the world has impacted the world’s economy. IoT technology integrated with Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help to address COVID-19. UAVs equipped with IoT devices can collect raw data that demands computing and analysis to make intelligent decision without human intervention. To mitigate the effect of COVID-19, in this paper, we propose an IoT-UAV-based scheme to collect raw data using onboard thermal sensors. The thermal image captured from the thermal camera is used to determine the potential people in the image (of the massive crowd in a city), which may have COVID-19, based on the temperature recorded. An efficient hybrid approach for a face recognition system is proposed to detect the people in the image having high body temperature from infrared images captured in a real-time scenario. Also, a face mask detection scheme is introduced, which detects whether a person has a mask on the face or not. The schemes’ performance evaluation is done using various machine learning and deep learning classifiers. We use the edge computing infrastructure (onboard sensors and actuators) for data processing to reduce the response time for real-time analytics and prediction. The proposed scheme has an average accuracy of  99.5% using various performance evaluation metrics indicating its practical applicability in real-time scenarios.}

The content analysis statistically detected a transition from the cyber-physical system (CPS) to the human-cyber-physical system (HCPS) in smart building research. We therefore proposed an HCPS framework with three dimensions—cyber-physical scale, human needs, and human roles—to summarize current research and discover potential gaps. Under this framework, five HCPS future research directions for occupants-centered smart buildings were proposed: adaptive building envelope, integrated building management system, enhanced building energy management, adaptive thermal comfort, and microgrid adoption.}

abstract = {With the rapid development of deep learning, many deep learning-based approaches have made great achievements in object detection tasks. It is generally known that deep learning is a data-driven approach. Data directly impact the performance of object detectors to some extent. Although existing datasets include common objects in remote sensing images, they still have some scale, category, and image limitations. Therefore, there is a strong requirement for establishing a large-scale object detection benchmark for high-resolution remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark dataset with more than 1 million instances and more than 40,000 images for Fine-grAined object recognItion in high-Resolution remote sensing imagery which is named as FAIR1M. We collected remote sensing images with a resolution of 0.3 m to 0.8 m from different platforms, which are spread across many countries and regions. All objects in the FAIR1M dataset are annotated with respect to 5 categories and 37 subcategories by oriented bounding boxes. Compared with existing detection datasets that are dedicated to object detection, the FAIR1M dataset has 4 particular characteristics: (1) it is much larger than other existing object detection datasets both in terms of the number of instances and the number of images, (2) it provides richer fine-grained category information for objects in remote sensing images, (3) it contains geographic information such as latitude, longitude and resolution attributes, and (4) it provides better image quality due to the use of a careful data cleaning procedure. Based on the FAIR1M dataset, we propose three fine-grained object detection and recognition tasks. Moreover, we evaluate several state-of-the-art approaches to establish baselines for future research. Experimental results indicate that the FAIR1M dataset effectively represents real remote sensing applications and is quite challenging for existing methods. Considering the fine-grained characteristics, we improve the evaluation metric and introduce the idea of hierarchy detection into the algorithms. We believe that the FAIR1M dataset will contribute to the earth observation community via fine-grained object detection in large-scale real-world scenes.

The capability to efficiently hunt abnormalities relating to ransomware activities is crucial in the timely detection of ransomware. In this paper, we present our Deep Ransomware Threat Hunting and Intelligence System (DRTHIS) to distinguish ransomware from goodware and identify their families. Specifically, DRTHIS utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), two deep learning techniques, for classification using the softmax algorithm. We then use 220 Locky, 220 Cerber and 220 TeslaCrypt ransomware samples, and 219 goodware samples, to train DRTHIS. In our evaluations, DRTHIS achieves an F-measure of 99.6% with a true positive rate of 97.2% in the classification of ransomware instances. Additionally, we demonstrate that DRTHIS is capable of detecting previously unseen ransomware samples from new ransomware families in a timely and accurate manner using ransomware from the CryptoWall, TorrentLocker and Sage families. The findings show that 99% of CryptoWall samples, 75% of TorrentLocker samples and 92% of Sage samples are correctly classified.}

This paper presents a review of the vulnerabilities on wireless technologies that gives connectivity to IoT, and the experiences using Software Defined Radio SDR for implementing wireless attacks to IoT technologies are assessed. A systematic literature review was conducted. The types of vulnerabilities and attacks that can affect the wireless technologies that stand the IoT ecosystem and SDR platforms were compared, and recent methods to overcome these attacks were identified. On the IoT reference model, the perception layer was identified as the most vulnerable. Most attacks at this level occur due to hardware limitations, physical device exposure, and heterogeneity of technologies. Future cybersecurity systems based on SDR technologies have notable advantages due to their flexibility and adaptability to new communication technologies and their potential to develop advanced tools. However, the IoT’s cybersecurity challenges are so complex that merging SDR hardware with cognitive and intelligent techniques is highly advisable. Some of these techniques could include deep learning to adapt mitigation systems to rapid technological changes.}

To cope with this challenge, this paper describes and AI-based anomaly detection system for real-time detection of SlowDoS attacks over application-level encrypted traffic. Our system monitors in real-time the network traffic, analyzing, processing and aggregating packets into conversation flows, getting valuable features and statistics that are dynamically analyzed in streaming for AI-based anomaly detection. The distributed AI model running in Apache Spark-streaming, combines clustering analysis for anomaly detection, along with deep learning techniques to increase detection accuracy in those cases where clustering obtains ambiguous probabilities. The proposal has been implemented and validated in a real testbed, showing its feasibility, performance and accuracy for detecting in real-time different kinds of SlowDoS attacks over encrypted traffic. The achieved results are close to the optimal precision value with a success rate 98%, while the false negative rate takes a value below 0.5%.}

The use of visual sensors has played an important role in mobile robotics tasks during the past few years due to the advances in computer vision hardware and algorithms. It is worth remarking the use of AI tools to solve a variety of problems in mobile robotics based on the use of images either as the only source of information or combining them with other sensors such as laser or GPS. The improvement of the autonomy of mobile robots has attracted the attention of the scientific community. A considerable amount of works have been proposed over the past few years, leading to an extensive variety of approaches. Building a robust model of the environment (mapping), estimating the position within the model (localization) and controlling the movement of the robot from one place to another (navigation) are important abilities that any mobile robot must have. Considering this, this review focuses on analyzing these problems; how researchers have addressed them by means of AI tools and visual information; and how these approaches have evolved in recent years. This topic is currently open and a large number of works can be found in the related literature. Therefore, it can be of interest making an analysis of the current state of the topic. From this review, we can conclude that AI has provided robust solutions to some specific tasks in mobile robotics, such as information retrieval from scenes, mapping, localization and exploration. However, it is worth continuing to develop this line of research to find more integral solutions to the navigation problem so that mobile robots can increase their autonomy in large, complex and heterogeneous environments.}

In this paper, we propose deep ad-hoc beamforming, a deep-learning-based multichannel speech enhancement framework based on ad-hoc microphone arrays, to address the problem. It contains three novel components. First, it combines ad-hoc microphone arrays with deep-learning-based multichannel speech enhancement, which reduces the probability of the occurrence of far-field acoustic environments significantly. Second, it groups the microphones around the speech source to a local microphone array by a supervised channel selection framework based on deep neural networks. Third, it develops a simple time synchronization framework to synchronize the channels that have different time delay. Besides the above novelties and advantages, the proposed model is also trained in single-channel fashion, so that it can easily employ new development of speech processing techniques. Its test stage is also flexible in incorporating any number of microphones without retraining or modifying the framework. We have developed many implementations of the proposed framework and conducted an extensive experiment in scenarios where the locations of the speech sources are far-field, random, and blind to the microphones. Results on speech enhancement tasks show that our method outperforms its counterpart that works with linear microphone arrays by a considerable margin in both diffuse noise reverberant environments and point source noise reverberant environments. We have also tested the framework with different handcrafted features. Results show that although good features lead to high performance, they do not affect the conclusion on the effectiveness of the proposed framework.}

abstract = {The adaptation of energy production to demand has been traditionally very important for utilities in order to optimize resource consumption. This is especially true also in microgrids where many intelligent elements have to adapt their behaviour depending on the future generation and consumption conditions. However, traditional forecasting has been performed only for extremely large areas, such as nations and regions. This work aims at presenting a solution for short-term load forecasting (STLF) in microgrids, based on a three-stage architecture which starts with pattern recognition by a self-organizing map (SOM), a clustering of the previous partition via k-means algorithm, and finally demand forecasting for each cluster with a multilayer perceptron. Model validation was performed with data from a microgrid-sized environment provided by the Spanish company Iberdrola.}

Energy management is an integral part of the smart sustainable cities development programme which involves conscious and efficient use of available energy resources towards attaining sustainability and self-reliance on energy systems. Building sector is one of the key sectors that utilize more energy. Therefore, efforts are being made to monitor and manage energy consumption effectively in residential and commercial buildings. In recent years, non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) technique has become a popular and emerging approach to monitor events (on/off) and energy consumption of appliances/electrical utilities in buildings using single energy meter. The information about the energy consumption at the appliance level would help consumers to understand their appliance usage behavior and take necessary steps for reducing energy consumption. In this paper, we present the comprehensive review of state-of-the-art algorithms that have been explored by the researchers towards developing an accurate NILM system for effective energy management. Finally, potential applications of NILM in different domains and its future research directions are discussed.}

Most multi-camera tracking works focus on target re-identification and trajectory association problems to track the target. However, since camera networks can generate enormous amount of video data, inefficient schemes for making re-identification or trajectory association queries can incur prohibitively large computational requirements. In this paper, we address the problem of intelligent scheduling of re-identification queries in a multi-camera tracking setting. To this end, we formulate the target tracking problem in a camera network as an MDP and learn a reinforcement learning based policy that selects a camera for making a re-identification query. The proposed approach to camera selection does not assume the knowledge of the camera network topology but the resulting policy implicitly learns it. We have also shown that such a policy can be learnt directly from data. Using the NLPR MCT and the Duke MTMC multi-camera multi-target tracking benchmarks, we empirically show that the proposed approach substantially reduces the number of frames queried.}

abstract = {Road furniture recognition has become a prevalent issue in the past few years because of its great importance in smart cities and autonomous driving. Previous research has especially focussed on pole-like road furniture, such as traffic signs and lamp posts. Published methods have mainly classified road furniture as individual objects. However, most road furniture consists of a combination of classes, such as a traffic sign mounted on a street light pole. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework to interpret road furniture at a more detailed level. Instead of being interpreted as single objects, mobile laser scanning data of road furniture is decomposed in elements individually labelled as poles, and objects attached to them, such as, street lights, traffic signs and traffic lights. In our framework, we first detect road furniture from unorganised mobile laser scanning point clouds. Then detected road furniture is decomposed into poles and attachments (e.g. traffic signs). In the interpretation stage, we extract a set of features to classify the attachments by utilising a knowledge-driven method and four representative types of machine learning classifiers, which are random forest, support vector machine, Gaussian mixture model and naïve Bayes, to explore the optimal method. The designed features are the unary features of attachments and the spatial relations between poles and their attachments. Two experimental test sites in Enschede dataset and Saunalahti dataset were applied, and Saunalahti dataset was collected in two different epochs. In the experimental results, the random forest classifier outperforms the other methods, and the overall accuracy acquired is higher than 80% in Enschede test site and higher than 90% in both Saunalahti epochs. The designed features play an important role in the interpretation of road furniture. The results of two epochs in the same area prove the high reliability of our framework and demonstrate that our method achieves good transferability with an accuracy over 90% through employing the training data of one epoch to test the data in another epoch.}

These systems attempt to alleviate the increasing information overload that users can experience in the current Big Data era, by providing personalized recommendations of items that they may find relevant. Besides, given the importance of mobile computing, these systems have evolved to consider also the dynamic context of the mobile users (location, time, weather conditions, etc.) to offer them more appropriate suggestions and information while on the move. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey of recent advances towards intelligent mobile Context-Aware Recommender Systems (mobile CARS) from an information management perspective, with an emphasis on mobile computing and AI techniques, along with an analysis of existing research gaps and future research directions. We focus on approaches that go beyond just considering the location of the user and exploit also other context information. In this study, we have identified that deep learning approaches are promising artificial intelligence models for mobile CARS. Additionally, in a near future, we expect a higher prominence of push-based recommendation solutions where at least part of the recommendation engine could be executed in the mobile devices, which could share data and tasks in a distributed way.}

abstract = {The development of green spaces in urban areas is rapidly on the rise as more people are keen to maintain a clean and green atmosphere around where they live and work. Also, the link between the physical world and the internet has been a driving force in enhancing people's quality of life which has resulted in the most recent and rising technologies, collectively referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT). The adoption of vertical gardens (VG) and/or vertical farms (VF) can be beneficial for maintaining a sustainable environment, as well as for expanding food security in an urban context around the world with limited land space. IoT technologies have the potential to be key enablers in the accelerated adoption of VG. In this study, we investigate the critical parameters for automating sustainable vertical gardening systems by using the IoT concept in smart cities towards smart living. This involves collection and review of data from 30 peer-reviewed publications published between 2004 and 2018, including real-world VG implementations. The key criteria considered include: (i) crop/plant type, (ii) VG topology (size), (iii) sensing data, (iv) used hardware (sensors, actuators, etc.), (v) power supplies, (vi) velocity or frequency of data collection, (vii) data storage method, (viii) communication technologies, (ix) data analysis methods/algorithm, (x) other used strategies, and (xi) countries that implemented VGs. The data were subsequently analyzed to obtain a detailed understanding of using IoT in VGs. The results of the analysis revealed that most of the studies used 6-20 tiers (40%) when implementing VGs, and the most popular crop was lettuce (28.6%). The sensors used were commonly connected to AC power and battery (each 44.4%), while only a small proportion of VGs used solar power (11.1%). The majority of IoT sensors used were to measure room temperature (22.5%), light intensity (21.1%), humidity level (14%) and soil nutrition (7%). The frequency of data collection by these sensors was between 1 and 3 minutes (42.8%). The frequently used data transmission technology was Zigbee and Wi-Fi (42.8%) for collecting sensor data from VGs. We also found that, using the server database, remote data management platform and cloud were the most popular data storage methods (each 25%). After data collection, many studies used threshold-based algorithms (50%) for the decision making, and the soil-based (42%) and hydroponic (38%) were the most popular plant cultivation technologies. The use of recycled and reused water (30%), solar power (20%) and controlled indoor environment, without sun or soil (20%) are some of the other essential considerations in VGs. Furthermore, it was found that the most significant focus on automation of VGs incorporating IoT were in USA (41.2%) and China (23.5%). The impact of vertical cultivation walls on human well-being was discussed. In addition to this, eight international patents on VGs have been analyzed to acquire an implementation understanding of autonomous control or using IoT in vertical gardens.}

abstract = {Solar radiation measurements are highly important for achieving energy efficiency in smart buildings as well as solar energy production. They are commonly acquired with pyranometer sensor device. However, due to its high initial and maintenance costs it is not densely deployed in the field. Consequently, it provides only limited coverage as a data source for solar radiation. Hence, theoretical, empirical and/or data-driven models are utilized to estimate solar radiation in areas without pyranometers using only data from meteorological sensor stations, which on the other hand are widely available and obtained from sustainable sensor networks. In this paper, end to end process is described for building hybrid models for solar radiation using Artificial Intelligence (AI), or more specifically Machine Learning (ML) methods, after which a detailed analysis is performed on (1) the accuracy of the models regards to their parameters and input features, (2) the sustainability of the models in the real world, and finally (3) their feasibility in (near) real-time monitoring. The results are expressed with relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) and they show that hybrid models outperform model- and data-driven ones, with artificial neural network giving the best results (RRMSE = 0.0393). Additionally, the models can be enhanced by performing an informed feature selection, where a posteriori selection proves to be better than a priori selection (RRMSE = 0.0371). Further investigation shows that randomly selected input data gives faster model convergence as expected. However, sequential input data can match it if model training starts with autumn or spring data when weather exhibits sufficient variety. When applied on different times scales, all models perform best on 3h scale rather than daily, where random forest (RRMSE = 0.0275) outperforms neural network (RRMSE = 0.0315). However, for (near) real time usage the models perform almost the same as for daily, with RRMSE of 0.0469 for 1min scale with neural network. This demonstrates the feasibility of the hybrid models in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which commonly require at least hourly intervals for solar radiation.}

The study carried out the analysis and classification of big data with the help of position-based routing protocols and the Support Vector Machine algorithms. The said techniques were employed to detect non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions in real time, which ensure the secure transmission of data without the loss or degradation of network performance. The novelty of the work is that it tackles various traffic scenarios (the extent of road congestion can affect the quality of big data transmission) and offers a way to improve big data transfer using the Support Vector Machine technology. The study results show that the proposed approach is effective enough with big data and can be employed to improve the performance of urban VANET networks and data transmission security.

To address these issues, a novel neural network JoKDNet is proposed to jointly learn the keypoint detection and feature description to improve the feasibility and accuracy of point clouds registration. Firstly, a novel keypoint detection module is introduced to automatically learn the score of each sampled point and regard the most significant Top-k sampled points as the detected keypoints. Secondly, an enhanced feature description module is proposed to learn the feature representation of each keypoint by fusing the hierarchical local features and context features. Thirdly, a loss function is designed to make the detected keypoints more distinguishable for matching, which simultaneously maximizes the feature distance between non-corresponding keypoints and minimizes the feature distance of corresponding keypoints. Finally, the distance matrix module and RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) are utilized to determine the correspondences of source and target point clouds for the transformation calculation. Comprehensive experiments show that the JoKDNet performs effectively on five challenging scenes (e.g., park, forest, tunnel, underground excavation, and mountain) from two datasets (WHU-TLS and ETH-TLS) in terms of registration errors, and robustness to varying scenes, with the maximum rotation error less than 0.06° and maximum translation error less than 0.84 m without ICP.}

abstract = {Increasing urbanization, smart cities and other cutting-edge technologies offer the prospect of providing more functions to benefit citizens by relying on the substantial data processing and exchange capabilities now possible. This can generate significant unpredictable and unbalanced data loads for the bearing IoT network to support its application and service demands. We thus propose a wireless routing scheme designed to use the Particle Filter algorithm to empower portable smart devices with intelligent capacities for the radio communication system. This facilitates the offloading of traffic from traditional wireless networks and enables the IoT system to adopt unmanned aerial vehicles, thus also offering further innovation to flying network platforms. The proposed PaFiR routing protocol offers the network more scalability, tolerance and resilience, to achieve the goal of smart relaying. Simulation results that demonstrate the routing algorithm designed offers excellent performance when compared with existing wireless relaying schemes. It provides delivery ratios that are improved by up to 40% without unmanageable increases in latency or overheads.}

abstract = {Facial expression recognition is an active research area for which the research community has presented a number of approaches due to its diverse applicability in different real-world situations such as real-time suspicious activity recognition for smart security, monitoring, marketing, and group sentiment analysis. However, developing a robust application with high accuracy is still a challenging task mainly due to the inherent problems related to human emotions, lack of sufficient data, and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel, cost-effective, and energy-efficient framework designed for suspicious activity recognition based on facial expression analysis for smart security in law-enforcement services. The Raspberry Pi camera captures the video stream and detects faces using the Viola Jones algorithm. The face region is pre-processed using Gabor filter and median filter prior to feature extraction. Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) features are then extracted and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained, which predicts the known emotions (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise). Based on the collective emotions of the faces, we predict the sentiment behind the scene. Using this approach, we predict if a certain situation is hostile and can prevent it prior to its occurrence. The system is tested on three publically available datasets: Cohen Kande (CK+), MMI, and JAFEE. A detailed comparative analysis based on SURF, SIFT, and ORB is also presented. Experimental results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed system in accurate recognition of suspicious activity compared to state-of-the-art methods and validate its superiority for enhancing security in law enforcement services.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.}

abstract = {The neural network-based models have been widely used in traffic prediction. They have improved accuracy and efficiency in traffic flow, speed, passenger flow, and delay. Many variables are considered to predict traffic indicators and good techniques for choosing the most influenced variables to results have been developed. Since the neural network models treat independent variables as continuous variables, there are few studies on the use of categorical variables. In addition, the neural network has been criticized as the internal relationships of hidden layers are generally unknown. This paper investigates neural networks to predict the use of bike-sharing systems in Suzhou, China considering a large amount of categorical data. Two methods here, Entity embedding and one-hot encoding are applied. The comparison experiments verify that the entity embedding method is more efficient than one-hot encoding. Furthermore, the hidden layers are visually analyzed by t-SNE, and the relationships with time, weather, surroundings and other variables for the traffic volume at shared bike sites are discussed. The research results show that: 1. Entity embedding can effectively increase the continuity of categorical variables and therefore, improve the prediction efficiency for the neural network models. 2. The relationship between variables can be identified through visual analysis, and the trained embedding vectors can also be used to supervise clustering.}

However, it retains as an open problem, mainly due to the complex variations in imaging conditions, object intra-class changes, as well as due to its low-resolution. Coming with the rapid advances in deep learning for feature representation, in this paper we investigate the possibility to exploit deep neural features towards robust vehicle detection. In addition, along with the rapid growth in the data volume, new classification methodology is also demanded to explicitly handle the intra-class variations. In this paper, we propose a vehicle detection framework, which combines Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DNN) based feature learning with Exemplar-SVMs (E-SVMS) based, robust instance classifier to achieve robust vehicle detection in satellite images. In particular, we adopt DNN to learn discriminative image features, which has a high learning capacity. In our practice, the leverage of DNN has achieve significant performance boost by comparing to a serial of handcraft designed features. In addition, we adopt E-SVMs based robust classifier to further improve the classification robustness, which can be considered as an instance-specific metric learning scheme. By conducting extensive experiments with comparisons to a serial of state-of-the-art and alternative works, we further show that the combination of both schemes can benefit from each other to jointly improve the detection accuracy and effectiveness.}

IoT-enabled intelligent surveillance devices are the most indispensable part of public safety and security in smart cities. These IoT devices generate a vast amount of surveillance traffic that is practically impossible for humans to continuously monitor and/or analyze. Person re-identification (PRId), which aims to track and recognize a person in a multi-camera scene is an important feature of visual surveillance systems in IoT infrastructures and can utilize the aforementioned traffic. This is where the concept of IoBT, which is a cloud-centric biometric authentication architecture composed of these IoT-enabled devices for the PRId system,  comes into play.

We reveal two sources of imbalance in existing object detection methods. Correspondingly, we propose our methods in terms of the model architecture and optimization target. Different from general object detection benchmarks, the location distribution of objects with different sizes is unbalanced in many practical applications. In addition, the representation information of different categories of objects is unbalanced. In this paper, we propose a location scale equilibrium module to utilize the prior location scale information and generate more balanced feature maps. More appropriate feature maps are selected and merged for different locations. After merging, feature maps become more consistent in terms of representation content, exerting positive effects on the following classification and regression tasks. For the imbalance caused by similar objects, we propose the repulsive loss to strengthen the punishment. Our method will not treat all categories of objects equally since we take the imbalance between them into consideration. With the enhanced supervision, the training will pay more attention to similar objects. Our proposed model is evaluated on the VisDrone benchmark and UAVDT benchmark. Sufficient experiments are conducted. Our model achieves the highest precision on most evaluation metrics, outperforming the other strong models.}

However, these existing techniques are not sufficient to effectively protect data owner privacy, especially in the scenarios that utilize visualizable data (e.g. images, videos) or the applications that require heavy computations for implementation. To address these problems, we propose a new dimension reduction-based method for privacy preservation. Our method generates dimension-reduced data for performing machine learning tasks and prevents a strong adversary from reconstructing the original data. We first introduce a theoretical approach to evaluate dimension reduction-based privacy preserving mechanisms, then propose a non-linear dimension reduction framework motivated by state-of-the-art neural network structures for privacy preservation. We conducted experiments over three different face image datasets (AT&T, YaleB, and CelebA), and the results show that when the number of dimensions is reduced to seven, we can achieve the accuracies of 79%, 80%, and 73% respectively and the reconstructed images are not recognizable to naked human eyes.}

The ever-increasing amount of data produced, along with the emergence of next-generation computationally intensive applications, requires new service delivery models. Such models should capitalize on the Edge Computing (EC) paradigm for supporting the data offloading process, by considering user’s contextual information in the offloading decision along with the infrastructure resource allocation operations, towards meeting the stringent performance specifications. In this article, a two-level Edge Computing architecture is proposed to offer computing resources for the remote execution of an LBS. At the Device layer, an initial offloading decision is performed taking into consideration the estimated position and quality of the wireless connection of each user. At the Edge layer, a resource profiling mechanism maps the incoming workload to EC computing resources under specific performance requirements of the LBS. Dealing with the dynamic workload, a scaling mechanism simultaneously takes the offloading decision and allocates only the necessary resources based on the resource profiles and the estimation of a workload prediction technique. For the evaluation of the proposed architecture, a smart touristic application scenario was realized on a real large-scale 5G testbed, following the principles of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) orchestration. The experimental results indicate the high accuracy of the localization technique, the success of the two-stage offloading decision and the scaling mechanism, while meeting the performance requirements of the LBS.}

In this paper, we present a novel Energy Efficient and Reliable Data Gathering Routing Protocol (ODGRP) for wireless sensor networks (WSNs)-based smart grid applications. The developed scheme employs a software-defined centralized controller and multiple mobile sinks for energy efficient and reliable data gathering from WSNs in the SG. The extensive simulation results conducted through the EstiNet 9.0 show that the designed scheme outperforms existing approaches and achieves its defined goals for event-driven applications in the SG.}

AIoT can generate a large amount of data from the network edge. Due to the concerns of bandwidth and privacy, it is often impractical to move the collected data to the cloud. To address this issue, a collaborative distributed learning has been proposed to let the clients collaboratively train a machine learning model together with their local data in a distributed manner. In this paper, we study the free market incentive mechanism for collaborative distributed learning, where multiple parameter servers (PSs) compete with each other to motivate clients to contribute model training. Specifically, the Stackelberg game with multiple leaders and multiple followers has been designed to analyze the incentive mechanism. Different experiments have been performed to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. In particular, compared with the state-of-the-art under the same budget constraint, the final average utility of the PSs can be increased by at least 94.3%.}

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) comes along with new challenges for experimenting, testing, and operating decentralized socio-technical systems at large-scale. In such systems, autonomous agents interact locally with their users, and remotely with other agents to make intelligent collective choices. Via these interactions they self-regulate the consumption and production of distributed (common) resources, e.g., self-management of traffic flows and power demand in Smart Cities. While such complex systems are often deployed and operated using centralized computing infrastructures, the socio-technical nature of these decentralized systems requires new value-sensitive design paradigms; empowering trust, transparency, and alignment with citizens’ social values, such as privacy preservation, autonomy, and fairness among citizens’ choices. Currently, instruments and tools to study such systems and guide the prototyping process from simulation, to live deployment, and ultimately to a robust operation of a high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) are missing, or not practical in this distributed socio-technical context. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel testbed architecture for decentralized socio-technical systems running on IoT. This new architecture is designed for a seamless reusability of (i) application-independent decentralized services by an IoT application, and (ii) different IoT applications by the same decentralized service. This dual self-integration promises IoT applications that are simpler to prototype, and can interoperate with decentralized services during runtime to self-integrate more complex functionality, e.g., data analytics, distributed artificial intelligence. Additionally, such integration provides stronger validation of IoT applications, and improves resource utilization, as computational resources are shared, thus cutting down deployment and operational costs. Pressure and crash tests during continuous operations of several weeks, with more than 80K network joining and leaving of agents, 2.4M parameter changes, and 100M communicated messages, confirm the robustness and practicality of the testbed architecture. This work promises new pathways for managing the prototyping and deployment complexity of decentralized socio-technical systems running on IoT, whose complexity has so far hindered the adoption of value-sensitive self-management approaches in Smart Cities.}

abstract = {Mobile edge computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to complement the computing and energy resources of mobile devices. In this computing paradigm, mobile devices offload their computing tasks to nearby edge servers, which can potentially reduce their energy consumption and task completion delay. In exchange for processing the computing tasks, edge servers expect to receive a payment that covers their operating costs and allows them to make a profit. Unfortunately, existing works either ignore the payments to the edge servers, or ignore the task processing delay and energy consumption of the mobile devices. To bridge this gap, we propose an auction to allocate edge servers to mobile devices that is executed by a pair of deep neural networks. Our proposed auction maximizes the profit of the edge servers, and satisfies the task processing delay and energy consumption constraints of the mobile devices. The proposed deep neural networks also guarantee that the mobile devices are unable to unfairly affect the results of the auctions. Our extensive simulations show that our proposed auction mechanism increases the profit of the edge servers by at least 50% compared to randomized auctions, and satisfies the task processing delay and energy consumption constraints of mobile devices.}

This paper addresses processing and automatic categorization of micro blogging data; in particular Twitter data, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques together with Random Forest classifier. As processing of twitter messages is a challenging task, we propose an algorithm to automatically preprocess the twitter messages. For this, we collected Twitter messages for sixteen different categories from one geo-location. We used proposed algorithm to prepro- cess the twitter messages and using Random Forest classifier these tweets are automatically categorized into predefined categories. It is shown that Random Forest classifier outperformed Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes classifiers.}

In this study, we focus on an emerging application in social sensing – streaming disaster damage assessment (DDA), which aims to automatically assess the damage severity of affected areas in a disaster event on the fly by leveraging the streaming imagery data about the disaster on social media. In particular, we study a dynamic optimal neural architecture searching (NAS) problem in streaming DDA applications. Our goal is to dynamically determine the optimal neural network architecture that accurately estimates the damage severity for each newly arrived image in the stream by leveraging human intelligence from the crowdsourcing systems. The present study is motivated by the observation that the neural network architectures in current DDA solutions are mainly designed by artificial intelligence (AI) experts, which often leads to non-negligible costs and errors given the dynamic nature of the streaming DDA applications and the lack of real-time annotations of the massive social media data inputs. Two critical technical challenges exist in solving our problem: (i) it is non-trivial to dynamically identify the optimal neural network architecture for each image on the fly without knowing its ground-truth label a priori; (ii) it is challenging to effectively leverage the imperfect crowd intelligence to correctly identify the optimal neural network architecture for each image. To address the above challenges, we developed CD-NAS, a dynamic crowd-AI collaborative NAS framework that carefully explores the human intelligence from crowdsourcing systems to solve the dynamic optimal NAS problem and optimize the performance of streaming DDA applications. The evaluation results from a real-world streaming DDA application show that CD-NAS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art AI and NAS baselines by achieving the highest disaster damage assessment accuracy while maintaining the lowest computational cost.}

Morbidity or serious injury from road traffic collisions is estimated to increase to 265 million people between 2015 and 2030. Current road safety management systems rely heavily on manual data collection, visual inspection and subjective expert judgment for their effectiveness, which is costly, time-consuming, and sometimes ineffective due to under-reporting and the poor quality of the data. A range of innovations offers the potential to provide more comprehensive and effective data collection and analysis to improve road safety. However, there has been no systematic analysis of this evidence base. To this end, this paper provides a systematic review of the state of the art. It identifies that digital technologies - Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine-Learning, Image-Processing, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Smartphone applications, Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), Drones, Social Media, Virtual-reality, Simulator, Radar, Sensor, Big Data – provide useful means for identifying and providing information on road safety factors including road user behaviour, road characteristics and operational environment. Moreover, the results show that digital technologies such as AI, Image processing and IoT have been widely applied to enhance road safety, due to their ability to automatically capture and analyse data while preventing the possibility of human error. However, a key gap in the literature remains their effectiveness in real-world environments. This limits their potential to be utilised by policymakers and practitioners.}

Although, this is an area of increased interest, the information concerning the implementation of data analytics in the context of Industry4.0 is scarcely available in scientific literature. Therefore, this work presents a process data analytics platform built around the concept of industry 4.0. The platform utilizes the state-of-the-art IIoT platforms, ML algorithms and big-data software tools. The platform emphasizes the use of ML methods for process data analytics while leveraging big-data processing tools and taking advantage of the currently available industrial grade cloud computing platforms. The industrial applicability of the platform was demonstrated by the development of soft sensors for use in a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant. In the case study, the work studied data-driven soft sensors to predict syngas heating value and hot flue gas temperature. Among the studied data-driven methods, the neural network-based NARX model demonstrated better performance in the prediction of both syngas heating value and flue gas temperature. The modeling results showed that, in cases where process knowledge about the process phenomena at hand is limited, data-driven soft sensors are useful tools for predictive data analytics.}

Significant advances in technology have been translated into new mobility services for both goods and people. One evident change has been the transformation of traditional vehicle fleets into more open fleets, in the sense that their members can proactively decide whether or not they are part of a certain fleet and whether or not they perform certain services. Fleets of this type make the decision-making process to be highly distributed, and rule out some of the typically centralized decisions. The management and control of this type of open fleets is severely more complex and, for this reason, the availability of simulation tools that allow for their analysis can be very useful. In accordance with this, the main contribution of this work is the development of an agent-based simulation tool specifically designed for the simulation of new urban mobility models. In this way, the tool can simulate any type of fleet in different urban scenarios, including a solution of the Last Mile Delivery problem, which is also included as a proof of concept in this paper.}

A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future.}

AmI creates, by using Artificial Intelligence (AI), an intelligent ecosystem in which computers, sensors, lighting, music, personal devices, and distributed services, work together to improve the user experience through the support of natural and intuitive user interfaces. Nowadays, AmI is used in various contexts, e.g., for building smart homes and smart cities, providing healthcare, and creating an adequate atmosphere in retail and public environments. In this paper, we propose a novel AmI system for gym environments, named Gym Intelligence, able to provide adequate music atmosphere, according to the users’ physical effort during the training. The music is taken from Spotify and is classified according to some music features, as provided by Spotify itself. The system is based on a multi-agent computational intelligence model built on two main components: (i) machine learning methods that forecast appropriate values for the Spotify music features, and (ii) a multi-objective dynamic genetic algorithm that selects a specific Spotify music track, according to such values. Gym Intelligence is built by sensing the ambient with a minimal, low-cost, and non-intrusive set of sensors, and it has been designed considering the outcome of a preliminary analysis in real gyms, involving real users. We have considered well-known regression methods and we have validated them using a collected data (i) about the users’ physical effort, through the sensors, and (ii) about the users’ music preferences, through an Android app that the users have used during the training. Among the regression methods considered, the one that provided the best results is the Random Forest, which predicted Spotify music features with a mean absolute error of 0.02 and a root mean squared error of 0.05. We have implemented Gym Intelligence and deployed it in five real gyms. We have evaluated it conducting several experiments. The experiments show how, with the help of Gym Intelligence, the users’ satisfaction about the provided background music, rose from 3.05 to 4.91 (on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is the maximum score).}

The IoT network is used to communicate and control information among various components composing a critical system. The essential inclination of infrastructure swerves to confront security issues and challenges as network systems are examined to expose cyber-related threats. Additionally, accessing real-time information from the cloud leads to a massive problem of latency. Fog computing is a novel archetype to encompass the cloud to the network edge with practical computation and critical infrastructure. The fog layer makes the device vulnerable to numerous attacks because of rapid access to resources. The practical way of addressing these issues is to detect intrusions effectively and trace the path leading to the attack source. The intent of this paper is to present a security mechanism and assure truthful operation of IoT networks with the intrusion detection system. A network intrusion detection system is proposed based on the conception of the Exact Greedy Boosting ensemble method for device implementation in the fog node because of protecting critical infrastructure from timely and accurate detection of malicious activities. The proposed model explores the traffic flow monitoring in novel IoT Intrusion Dataset 2020(IoTID20) network traffic by identifying and classifying the type of attack based on anomalies from normal behavior. Further, the paper estimates the complete experimentation performance and evaluations with competitive machine learning algorithms.

abstract = {Traffic signs are one of the most important safety elements in a road network. Particularly, road markings provide information about the limits and direction of each road lane, or warn the drivers about potential danger. The optimal condition of road markings contributes to a better road safety. Mobile Laser Scanning technology can be used for infrastructure inspection and specifically for traffic sign detection and inventory. This paper presents a methodology for the detection and semantic characterization of the most common road markings, namely pedestrian crossings and arrows. The 3D point cloud data acquired by a LYNX Mobile Mapper system is filtered in order to isolate reflective points in the road, and each single element is hierarchically classified using Neural Networks. State of the art results are obtained for the extraction and classification of the markings, with F-scores of 94% and 96% respectively. Finally, data from classified markings are exported to a GIS layer and maintenance criteria based on the aforementioned data are proposed.}

abstract = {The recycled aggregate (RA) and waste rubber particles (RPs) can be combined to prepare rubber-modified recycled aggregate concrete (RRAC) effectively contributing to low-carbon sustainability. However, the mechanical characteristics of RRAC must be investigated before the practical application. To this end, this study focused on the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and corresponding peak strain of RRAC with versatile design mixtures (i.e. varying contents of RA and RPs) after exposure to different temperatures ranging from 25 °C (room temperature) to 600 °C. The test results exhibited the negative relationship between UCS and RA replacement ratio, RPs content, and temperature. However, RPs positively affected both the loss of UCS and peak strain when RRAC was exposed to high temperatures. Besides, four machine learning (ML) models were developed based on a relatively comprehensive dataset including 120 groups of experimental results. The beetle antennae search (BAS) algorithm was applied to tune the hyperparameter of ML models. The high correlation coefficients (0.9721 for UCS and 0.9441 for peak strain) were determined in modelling using back propagation neural network (BPNN), presenting its accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, BPNN possessed optimal prediction performance since the lower root mean square error (RMSE) and higher correlation coefficient were obtained compared to the other three ML models (random forest, logistic regression, and multiple linear regression).}

abstract = {Burgeoning growth of tall buildings in urban areas around the world is placing new demands on their performance under winds. This involves selection of the building form that minimizes wind loads and structural topologies that efficiently transfer loads. Current practice is to search for optimal shapes, but this limits buildings with static or fixed form. Aerodynamic shape tailoring that consists of modifying the external form of the building has shown great promise in reducing wind loads and associated structural motions as reflected in the design of Taipei 101 and Burj Khalifa. In these buildings, corner modifications of the cross-section and tapering along the height are introduced. An appealing alternative is to design a building that can adapt its form to the changing complex wind environment in urban areas with clusters of tall buildings, i.e., by implementing a dynamic facade. To leap beyond the static shape optimization, autonomous dynamic morphing of the building shape is advanced in this study, which is implemented through a cyber–physical system that fuses together sensing, computing, actuating, and engineering informatics. This approach will permit a building to intelligently morph its profile to minimize the source of dynamic wind load excitation, and holds the promise of revolutionizing tall buildings from conventional static to dynamic facades by taking advantage of the burgeoning advances in computational design.}

abstract = {The exceptional increase in the mobile data traffic leads to over exploitation of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum making it to become overcrowded. This necessitates relying on novel technology like Visible Light Communication (VLC) which utilizes cost-effective and solid-state illuminating devices like Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). The stunning notability of enabling contemporaneous illumination and communication has driven VLC to become a revolutionary alternative to RF. This survey provides an elaborate analysis of the VLC system model, optical channel environment, modulation techniques, detailed analysis on different variants of optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OOFDM), and other modulation formats like carrier-less amplitude and phase modulation (CAP) and multi-band CAP (m-CAP) which bestows with the most feasible solution for VLC in the perspective of spectral, power and computational efficiency. In addition, multiple access schemes like orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), non orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is also the focus of this survey. Furthermore, the research advancements in enabling organic LEDs (OLEDs) and superluminescent diodes (SLDs) to penetrate the solid state lighting (SSL) industry is also highlighted. This survey provides insights about the programmable test beds facilitating real time application and signifies how VLC can be amalgamated with both the lighting infrastructure and intelligent transportation system (ITS) in smart cities. In addition, certain research challenges to be addressed is also the part of this survey.}
