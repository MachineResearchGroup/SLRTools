ABSTRACT = {Nowadays wireless sensor netwoks (WSN) technology, wireless communications and digital electronics have made it realistic to produce a large scale miniaturized devices integrating sensing, processing and communication capabilities. The focus of this paper is to present an innovative mobile platform for heterogeneous sensor networks, combined with adaptive methods to optimize the communication architecture for novel potential applications in multimedia and entertainment. In fact, in the near future, some of the applications foreseen for WSNs will employ multi-platform systems with a high number of different devices, which may be completely different in nature, size, computational and energy capabilities, etc. Nowadays, in addition, data collection could be performed by UAV platforms which can be a sink for ground sensors layer, acting essentially as a mobile gateway. In order to maximize the system performances and the network lifespan, the authors propose a recently developed hybrid technique based on evolutionary algorithms. The goal of this procedure is to optimize the communication energy consumption in WSN by selecting the optimal multi-hop routing schemes, with a suitable hybridization of different routing criteria. The proposed approach can be potentially extended and applied to ongoing research projects focused on UAV-based sensing with WSN augmentation and real-time processing for immersive media experiences.},

ABSTRACT = {An artificial intelligence system, designed for operations in a real-world environment faces a nearly infinite set of possible performance scenarios. Designers and developers, thus, face the challenge of validating proper performance across both foreseen and unforeseen conditions, particularly when the artificial intelligence is controlling a robot that will be operating in close proximity, or may represent a danger, to humans. While the manual creation of test cases allows limited testing (perhaps ensuring that a set of foreseeable conditions trigger an appropriate response), this may be insufficient to fully characterize and validate safe system performance. An approach to validating the performance of an artificial intelligence system using a simple artificial intelligence test case producer (AITCP) is presented. The AITCP allows the creation and simulation of prospective operating scenarios at a rate far exceeding that possible by human testers. Four scenarios for testing an autonomous navigation control system are presented: single actor in two-dimensional space, multiple actors in two-dimensional space, single actor in three-dimensional space, and multiple actors in three-dimensional space. The utility of using the AITCP is compared to that of human testers in each of these scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {Control of autonomous vehicles for applications such as surveillance, search, and exploration has been a topic of great interest over the past two decades. In particular, there has been a rising interest in control of multiple vehicles for reasons such as increase in system reliability, robustness, and efficiency, with a possible reduction in cost. The exploration problem is NP hard even for a single vehicle/agent, and the use of multiple vehicles brings forth a whole new suite of problems associated with communication and cooperation between vehicles. The persistent surveillance problem differs from exploration since it involves continuous/repeated coverage of the target space, minimizing time between re-visits. The use of aerial vehicles demands consideration of vehicle dynamic and endurance constraints as well. Another aspect of the problem that has been investigated to a lesser extent is the design of the vehicles for particular missions. The intent of this paper is to thoroughly review the persistent surveillance problem, with particular focus on multiple Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), and present some of our own work in this area. We investigate the different aspects of the problem and slightly digress into techniques that have been applied to exploration and coverage, but a comprehensive survey of all the work in multiple vehicle control for search, exploration, and coverage is beyond the scope of this paper.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents a novel methodology for the control management of a swarm of autonomous vehicles. The vehicles, or agents, may have different skills, and be employed for different missions. The methodology is based on the definition of descriptor functions that model the capabilities of the single agent and each task or mission. The swarm motion is controlled by minimizing a suitable norm of the error between agents’ descriptor functions and other descriptor functions which models the entire mission. The validity of the proposed technique is tested via numerical simulation, using different task assignment scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {In the last decade, the differences in the information communication technology (ICT) infrastructures between urban and rural areas have registered a tremendous increase. ICT infrastructures could strongly help rural communities where many operations are time consuming, labor-intensive and expensive due to limited access and large distances to cover. One of the most attractive solutions, which is widely recognized as promising for filling this gap, is the use of drone fleets. In this context, this paper proposes a video monitoring platform as a service (VMPaaS) for wide rural areas not covered by Internet access. The platform is realized with a Software-Defined Network (SDN)/Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)-based flying ad-hoc network (FANET), whose target is providing a flexible and dynamic connectivity backbone, and a set of drones equipped with high-resolution cameras, each transmitting a video stream of a portion of the considered area. After describing the architecture of the proposed platform, service chains to realize the video delivery service are described, and an analytical model is defined to evaluate the computational load of the platform nodes in such a way so as to allow the network orchestrator to decide the backbone drones where running the virtual functions, and the relative resources to be allocated. Numerical analysis is carried out in a case study.},

ABSTRACT = {The aim of this paper is to provide a realistic stochastic trajectory generation method for unmanned aerial vehicles that offers a tool for the emulation of trajectories in typical flight scenarios. Three scenarios are defined in this paper. The trajectories for these scenarios are implemented with quintic B-splines that grant smoothness in the second-order derivatives of Euler angles and accelerations. In order to tune the parameters of the quintic B-spline in the search space, a multi-objective optimization method called particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used. The proposed technique satisfies the constraints imposed by the configuration of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Further particular constraints can be introduced such as: obstacle avoidance, speed limitation, and actuator torque limitations due to the practical feasibility of the trajectories. Finally, the standard rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT*) algorithm, the standard (A*) algorithm and the genetic algorithm (GA) are simulated to make a comparison with the proposed algorithm in terms of execution time and effectiveness in finding the minimum length trajectory.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a backstepping-based formation control of quadrotors with the state transformation technique is proposed. First, the dynamics of a quadrotor is derived by using the Newton–Euler formulation. Next, a backstepping-based formation control for quadrotors using a state transformation technique is presented. In the position control, which is the basis of formation control, it is possible to derive the reference attitude angles employing a state transformation technique without the small angle assumption or the simplified dynamics usually used. Stability analysis based on the Lyapunov theorem shows that the proposed formation controller can provide a quadrotor formation error system that is asymptotically stabilized. Finally, we verify the performance of the proposed formation control method through comparison simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {Clustering is an effective topology control method in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), since it can enhance the network lifetime and scalability. To prolong the network lifetime in clustered WSNs, an efficient cluster head (CH) optimization policy is essential to distribute the energy among sensor nodes. Recently, game theory has been introduced to model clustering. Each sensor node is considered as a rational and selfish player which will play a clustering game with an equilibrium strategy. Then it decides whether to act as the CH according to this strategy for a tradeoff between providing required services and energy conservation. However, how to get the equilibrium strategy while maximizing the payoff of sensor nodes has rarely been addressed to date. In this paper, we present a game theoretic approach for balancing energy consumption in clustered WSNs. With our novel payoff function, realistic sensor behaviors can be captured well. The energy heterogeneity of nodes is considered by incorporating a penalty mechanism in the payoff function, so the nodes with more energy will compete for CHs more actively. We have obtained the Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy of the clustering game through convex optimization. Specifically, each sensor node can achieve its own maximal payoff when it makes the decision according to this strategy. Through plenty of simulations, our proposed game theoretic clustering is proved to have a good energy balancing performance and consequently the network lifetime is greatly enhanced.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a particle swarm tracking algorithm with improved inertia weight based on color features. The weighted color histogram is used as the target feature to reduce the contribution of target edge pixels in the target feature, which makes the algorithm insensitive to the target non-rigid deformation, scale variation, and rotation. Meanwhile, the influence of partial obstruction on the description of target features is reduced. The particle swarm optimization algorithm can complete the multi-peak search, which can cope well with the object occlusion tracking problem. This means that the target is located precisely where the similarity function appears multi-peak. When the particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to the object tracking, the inertia weight adjustment mechanism has some limitations. This paper presents an improved method. The concept of particle maturity is introduced to improve the inertia weight adjustment mechanism, which could adjust the inertia weight in time according to the different states of each particle in each generation. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper tackles the problem of sensing coverage for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with an approach that takes into account the reciprocal between neighboring UAVs to reduce the oscillation of their trajectories. The proposed reciprocal decision approach, which is performed in three steps, is self-organized, distributed and autonomous. First, in contrast to the traditional method modeled and optimized in configuration space, the sensing coverage problem is directly presented as an optimal reciprocal coverage velocity (ORCV) in velocity space that is concise and effective. Second, the ORCV is determined by adjusting the action velocity out of weak coverage velocity relative to neighboring UAVs to demonstrate that the ORCV supports a collision-avoiding assembly. Third, a corresponding random probability method is proposed for determining the optimal velocity in the ORCV. The results from the simulation indicate that the proposed method has a high coverage rate, rapid convergence rate and low deadweight loss. In addition, for up to 103-size UAVs, the proposed method has excellent scalability and collision-avoiding ability.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are increasingly used in cities to provide service tasks that are too dangerous, expensive or difficult for human beings. Drones are also used in cases where a task can be performed more economically and or more efficiently than if done by humans. These include remote sensing tasks where drones can be required to form coalitions by pooling their resources to meet the service requirements at different locations of interest in a city. During such coalition formation, finding the shortest path from a source to a location of interest is key to efficient service delivery. For fixed-wing UAVs, Dubins curves can be applied to find the shortest flight path. When a UAV flies to a location of interest, the angle or orientation of the UAV upon its arrival is often not important. In such a case, a simplified version of the Dubins curve consisting of two instead of three parts can be used. This paper proposes a novel model for UAV coalition and an algorithm derived from basic geometry that generates a path derived from the original Dubins curve for application in remote sensing missions of fixed-wing UAVs. The algorithm is tested by incorporating it into three cooperative coalition formation algorithms. The performance of the model is evaluated by varying the number of types of resources and the sensor ranges of the UAVs to reveal the relevance and practicality of the proposed model.},

ABSTRACT = {Exploring and detecting the causal relations among variables have shown huge practical values in recent years, with numerous opportunities for scientific discovery, and have been commonly seen as the core of data science. Among all possible causal discovery methods, causal discovery based on a constraint approach could recover the causal structures from passive observational data in general cases, and had shown extensive prospects in numerous real world applications. However, when the graph was sufficiently large, it did not work well. To alleviate this problem, an improved causal structure learning algorithm named brain storm optimization (BSO), is presented in this paper, combining K2 with brain storm optimization (K2-BSO). Here BSO is used to search optimal topological order of nodes instead of graph space. This paper assumes that dataset is generated by conforming to a causal diagram in which each variable is generated from its parent based on a causal mechanism. We designed an elaborate distance function for clustering step in BSO according to the mechanism of K2. The graph space therefore was reduced to a smaller topological order space and the order space can be further reduced by an efficient clustering method. The experimental results on various real-world datasets showed our methods outperformed the traditional search and score methods and the state-of-the-art genetic algorithm-based methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Efficient distributed processing is vital for collaborative searching tasks of robotic swarm systems. Typically, those systems are decentralized, and the members have only limited communication and processing capacities. What is illustrated in this paper is a distributed processing paradigm for robotic swarms moving in a line or v-shape formation. The introduced concept is capable of exploits the line and v-shape formations for 2-D filtering and processing algorithms based on a modified multi-dimensional Roesser model. The communication is only between nearest adjacent members with a simple state variable. As an example, we applied a salient region detection algorithm to the proposed framework. The simulation results indicate the designed paradigm can detect salient regions by using a moving line or v-shape formation in a scanning way. The requirement of communication and processing capability in this framework is minimal, making it a good candidate for collaborative exploration of formatted robotic swarms.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a sampling-based approximation for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) task allocation under uncertainty. Our goal is to reduce the amount of calculations and improve the accuracy of the algorithm. For this purpose, Gaussian process regression models are constructed from an uncertainty parameter and task reward sample set, and this training set is iteratively refined by active learning and manifold learning. Firstly, a manifold learning method is used to screen samples, and a sparse graph is constructed to represent the distribution of all samples through a small number of samples. Then, multi-points sampling is introduced into the active learning method to obtain the training set from the sparse graph quickly and efficiently. This proposed hybrid sampling strategy could select a limited number of representative samples to construct the training set. Simulation analyses demonstrate that our sampling-based algorithm can effectively get a high-precision evaluation model of the impact of uncertain parameters on task reward.},

ABSTRACT = {In the Republic of Korea, one of the most widely discussed subjects related to future logistics technology is the drone-based delivery (transportation) system. Much (around 75%) of Korea&rsquo;s territory consists of mountainous areas; however, the costs of installing internet facilities for drone landing sites are very high compared to other countries. Therefore, this paper proposes the power-line communication (PLC) system introduced in the author&rsquo;s previous study as an alternative solution. For the system design, a number of lightning rods are used together with a monitoring system. The system algorithm performs substantial data analysis. Also, as the author found that instantaneous high-voltage currents were a major cause of fire incidents, a three-phase three-wire connection was used for the installation of the lightning rods (Bipolar Conventional Air Terminal). Thus, based on the PLC technology, an artificial intelligence (AI) which avoids lightning strikes at the drone landing site by interworking with a closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring system when a drone flies over the mountain regions is proposed in this paper. The algorithm was implemented with C++ and Unity/C#, whereas the application for the part concerning the integrated sensing was developed with Java Android.},

ABSTRACT = {Compared with a large power grid, a microgrid electric load (MEL) has the characteristics of strong nonlinearity, multiple factors, and large fluctuation, which lead to it being difficult to receive more accurate forecasting performances. To solve the abovementioned characteristics of a MEL time series, the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVR) hybridizing with meta-heuristic algorithms is applied to simulate the nonlinear system of a MEL time series. As it is known that the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) has several embedded drawbacks that lead to problems, this paper applies a quantum computing mechanism (QCM) to empower each fruit fly to possess quantum behavior during the searching processes, i.e., a QFOA algorithm. Eventually, the cat chaotic mapping function is introduced into the QFOA algorithm, namely CQFOA, to implement the chaotic global perturbation strategy to help fruit flies to escape from the local optima while the population&rsquo;s diversity is poor. Finally, a new MEL forecasting method, namely the LS-SVR-CQFOA model, is established by hybridizing the LS-SVR model with CQFOA. The experimental results illustrate that, in three datasets, the proposed LS-SVR-CQFOA model is superior to other alternative models, including BPNN (back-propagation neural networks), LS-SVR-CQPSO (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm), LS-SVR-CQTS (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum tabu search algorithm), LS-SVR-CQGA (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum genetic algorithm), LS-SVR-CQBA (LS-SVR with chaotic quantum bat algorithm), LS-SVR-FOA, and LS-SVR-QFOA models, in terms of forecasting accuracy indexes. In addition, it passes the significance test at a 97.5% confidence level.},

ABSTRACT = {Computational Intelligence (CI) has been addressed as a great challenge in recent years, particularly the aspects of routing, task scheduling, and other high-complexity issues. Especially for the Contact Plan Design (CPD) that schedules contacts in dynamic and resource-constrained networks, a suitable CI algorithm can be exchanged for a high-quality Contact Plan (CP) with the appropriate computational overhead. Previous works on CPD mainly focused on the optimization of satellite network connectivity, but most of them ignored network topology characteristics. In this paper, we study the CPD issue in the spatial node based Internet of Things (IoT), which enables the spatial nodes to deliver data cooperatively via intelligent networking. Specifically, we first introduce a Multi-Layer Space Communication Network (MLSCN) model consisting of satellites, High Altitude Platforms (HAPs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground stations, on which a Time-Evolving Graph (TEG) is used to illustrate the CPD process. Then, according to the characteristics of each layer in the MLSCN, we design the corresponding CPs for the inter-layer contacts and intra-layer contacts. After that, a CI algorithm named as Multidirectional Particle Swarm Optimization (MPSO) is proposed for inter-layer CPD, which utilizes a grid-based initialization strategy to expand the diversity of individuals, in which a quaternary search method and quaternary optimization are introduced to improve efficiency of particle swarms in iterations and to ensure the continuous search ability, respectively. Furthermore, an optimized scheme is implemented for the intra-layer CPD to reduce congestion and improve transmission efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed CPD scheme can realize massive data transmission with high efficiency in the multi-layer spatial node-based IoT.},

ABSTRACT = {In the aerospace field, compact optoelectronic platforms (COPs) are being increasingly equipped on unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). They assist UAS in a range of mission-specific tasks such as disaster relief, crop testing, and firefighting. However, the strict constraint of structure space makes COPs subject to multi-source disturbances. The application of a low-cost and low-precision sensor also affects the system control performance. A composite hierarchical anti-disturbance control (CHADC) scheme with multisensor fusion is explored herein to improve the motion performance of COPs in the presence of internal and external disturbances. Composite disturbance modelling combining the characteristic of wire-wound moment is presented in the inner layer. The adaptive mutation differential evolution algorithm is implemented to identify and optimise the model parameters of the system internal disturbance. Inverse model compensation and finite-time nonlinear disturbance observer are then constructed to compensate for multiple disturbances. A non-singular terminal sliding mode controller is constructed to attenuate disturbance in the outer layer. A stability analysis for both the composite disturbance compensator and the closed-loop system is provided using Lyapunov stability arguments. The phase lag-free low-pass filter is implemented to interfuse multiple sensors with different order information and achieve satisfactory noise suppression without phase lag. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CHADC strategy with a higher-quality signal has an improved performance for multi-source disturbance compensation.},

ABSTRACT = {Helicopters are introduced on the aircraft carrier to perform the tasks which are beyond the capability of fixed-wing aircraft. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft, the landing path of helicopters is not regulated and can be determined autonomously, and the path planning problem for autonomous landing of helicopters on the carrier is studied in this paper. To solve the problem, the returning flight is divided into two phases, that is, approaching the carrier and landing on the flight deck. The feature of each phase is depicted, and the conceptual model is built on this basis to provide a general frame and idea of solving the problem. In the established mathematical model, the path planning problem is formulated into an optimization problem, and the constraints are classified by the characteristics of the helicopter and the task requirements. The goal is to reduce the terminal position error and the impact between the helicopter and the flight deck. To obtain a reasonable landing path, a multiphase path planning algorithm with the pigeon inspired optimization (MPPIO) algorithm is proposed to adapt to the changing environment. Three experiments under different situations, that is, static carrier, only horizontal motion of carrier considered, and 3D motion of carrier considered, are conducted. The results demonstrate that the helicopters can all reach the ideal landing point with the reasonable path in different situations. The small terminal error and relatively vertical motion between the helicopter and the carrier ensure a precise and safe landing.},

Several methodologies have been proposed and reported in the literature for the path planning of mobile robot. Although these methodologies do not guarantee an optimal solution, they have been successfully applied in their works. The purpose of this paper is to review the modeling, optimization criteria and solution algorithms for the path planning of mobile robot. The survey shows GA (genetic algorithm), PSO (particle swarm optimization algorithm), APF (artificial potential field), and ACO (ant colony optimization algorithm) are the most used approaches to solve the path planning of mobile robot. Finally, future research is discussed which could provide reference for the path planning of mobile robot.},

ABSTRACT = {The sector of autonomous driving gains more and more importance for the car makers. A key enabler of such systems is the planning of the path the vehicle should take, but it can be very computationally burdensome finding a good one. Here, new architectures in Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are required, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), because standard processors struggle to provide enough computing power. In this work, we present a novel parallelization of a path planning algorithm. We show how many paths can be reasonably planned under real-time requirements and how they can be rated. As an evaluation platform, an Nvidia Jetson board equipped with a Tegra K1 System-on-Chip (SoC) was used, whose GPU is also employed in the zFAS ECU of the AUDI AG.},

ABSTRACT = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a metaheuristic global optimization paradigm that has gained prominence in the last two decades due to its ease of application in unsupervised, complex multidimensional problems that cannot be solved using traditional deterministic algorithms. The canonical particle swarm optimizer is based on the flocking behavior and social co-operation of birds and fish schools and draws heavily from the evolutionary behavior of these organisms. This paper serves to provide a thorough survey of the PSO algorithm with special emphasis on the development, deployment, and improvements of its most basic as well as some of the very recent state-of-the-art implementations. Concepts and directions on choosing the inertia weight, constriction factor, cognition and social weights and perspectives on convergence, parallelization, elitism, niching and discrete optimization as well as neighborhood topologies are outlined. Hybridization attempts with other evolutionary and swarm paradigms in selected applications are covered and an up-to-date review is put forward for the interested reader.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms is an emerging technology that will significantly expand the application areas and open up new possibilities for UAVs, while also presenting new requirements for the robustness and reliability of the UAV swarming system. However, its complex and dynamic characteristics make it extremely challenging and uncertain to model such a system. In this study, to reach a full understanding of the swarming system, a modeling framework based on complex network theory is presented. First, the scope of work is identified from the point of view of control algorithms considering the dynamics and research novelty of the development of UAV swarming control strategy and three control structures consisting of three interdependent network layers are proposed. Second, three algorithms that systematically build the modeling framework considering all characteristics of the system are also developed. Finally, some network measurements are introduced by adjusting the fundamental ones into the UAV swarming system. The proposed framework is applied to a case study to illustrate the visualization models and estimate the statistical characteristics of the proposed networks with static and dynamic topology analysis. Furthermore, a simple demonstration of the robustness evaluation of the network is also presented. The networks obtained from this framework can be used to further analyze the robustness or reliability of a UAV swarming system in a high-confrontation battlefield environment the effect of cascading failure in ad-hoc network on system.},

ABSTRACT = {In scenarios such as natural disasters and military strikes, it is common for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to form groups to execute reconnaissance and surveillance. To ensure the effectiveness of UAV communications, repeated resource acquisition issues and transmission mechanism designs need to be addressed urgently. Since large-scale UAVs will generate high transmission overhead due to the overlapping resource requirements, in this paper, we propose a resource allocation optimization method based on distributed data content in a Flying Ad-hoc network (FANET). The resource allocation problem with the goal of throughput maximization is constructed as a coalition game framework. Firstly, a data transmission mechanism is designed for UAVs to execute information interaction within the coalitions. Secondly, a novel mechanism of coalition selection based on group-buying is investigated for UAV coalitions to acquire data from the central UAV. The data transmission and coalition selection problem are modeled as coalition graph game and coalition formation game, respectively. Through the design of the utility function, we prove that both games have stable solutions. We also prove the convergence of the proposed approach with coalition order and Pareto order. Based on simulation results, coalition order based coalition selection algorithm (CO-CSA) and Pareto order based coalition selection algorithm (PO-CSA) are proposed to explore the stable coalition partition of system model. CO-CSA and PO-CSA can achieve higher data throughput than the contrast onetime coalition selection algorithm (Onetime-CSA) (at least increased by 34.5% and 16.9%, respectively). Besides, although PO-CSA has relatively lower throughput gain, its convergence times is on average 50.9% less than that of CO-CSA, which means that the algorithm choice is scenario-dependent.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the efficient 3D placement of UAV as an aerial base station in providing wireless coverage for users in a small and large coverage area is investigated. In the case of providing wireless coverage for outdoor and indoor users in a small area, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and K-means with Ternary Search (KTS) algorithms are invoked to find an efficient 3D location of a single UAV with the objective of minimizing its required transmit power. It was observed that a single UAV at the 3D location found using the PSO algorithm requires less transmit power, by a factor of 1/5 compared to that when using the KTS algorithm. In the case of providing wireless coverage for users in three different shapes of a large coverage area, namely square, rectangle and circular regions, the problems of finding an efficient placement of multiple UAVs equipped with a directional antenna are formulated with the objective to maximize the coverage area and coverage density using the Circle Packing Theory (CPT). Then, the UAV efficient altitude placement is formulated with the objective of minimizing its required transmit power. It is observed that the large number of UAVs does not necessarily result in the maximum coverage density. Based on the simulation results, the deployment of 16, 19 and 26 UAVs is capable of providing the maximum coverage density of 78.5%, 82.5% and 80.3% for the case of a square region with the dimensions of 2 km &times; 2 km, a rectangle region with the dimensions of 6 km &times; 1.8 km and a circular region with the radius of 1.125 km, respectively. These observations are obtained when the UAVs are located at the optimum altitude, where the required transmit power for each UAV is reasonably small.},

ABSTRACT = {By forming a specific formation during motion, the robotic swarm is a good candidate for unknown region exploration applications. The members of this kind of system are generally low complexity, which limits the communication and perception capacities of the agents. How to merge to the desired formation under those constraints is essential for performing relevant tasks. In this paper, a limited visual field constrained formation control strategy inspired by flying geese coordinated motion is introduced. Usually, they flock together in a V-shape formations, which is a well-studied phenomenon in biology and bionics. This paper illustrates the proposed methods by taking the research results from the above subjects and mapping them from the swarm engineering point of view. The formation control is achieved by applying a behavior-based formation forming method with the finite state machine while considering anti-collision and obstacle avoidance. Furthermore, a cascade leader&ndash;follower structure is adopted to achieve the large-scale formations. The simulation results from several scenarios indicate the presented method is robust with high scalability and flexibility.},

ABSTRACT = {Building an ad-hoc network in emergency situations can be crucial as a primary tool or even when used prior to subsequent operations. The use of mini and micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is increasing because of the wide range of possibilities they offer. Moreover, they have been proven to bring sustainability to many applications, such as agriculture, deforestation and wildlife conservation, among others. Therefore, creating a UAV network for an unknown environment is an important task and an active research field. In this article, a mobility model for the creation of ad-hoc networks using UAVs will be presented. This model will be based on pheromones for robust navigation. We will focus mainly on developing energy-efficient behavior, which is essential for this type of vehicle. Although there are in the literature several models of mobility for ad-hoc network creation, we find that either they are not adapted to the specific energy requirements of UAVs or the proposed motion models are unrealistic or not sufficiently robust for final implantation. We will present and analyze the operation of a distributed swarm behavior able to create an ad-hoc network. Then, an analytical model of the swarm energy consumption will be proposed. This model will provide a mechanism to effectively predict the energy consumption needed for the deployment of the network prior to its implementation. Determining the use of the mobility behavior is a requirement to establish and maintain a communication channel for the required time. Finally, this analytical model will be experimentally validated and compared to the Random Waypoint (RWP) mobility strategy.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an algorithm for multi-UAV path planning in scenarios with heterogeneous Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) coverage. In these environments, cooperative strategies can be effectively exploited when flying in GNSS-challenging conditions, e.g., natural/urban canyons, while the different UAVs can fly as independent systems in the absence of navigation issues (i.e., open sky conditions). These different flight environments are taken into account at path planning level, obtaining a distributed multi-UAV system that autonomously reconfigures itself based on mission needs. Path planning, formulated as a vehicle routing problem, aims at defining smooth and flyable polynomial trajectories, whose time of flight is estimated to guarantee coexistence of different UAVs at the same challenging area. The algorithm is tested in a simulation environment directly derived from a real-world 3D scenario, for variable number of UAVs and waypoints. Its solution and computational cost are compared with optimal planning methods. Results show that the computational burden is almost unaffected by the number of UAVs, and it is compatible with near real time implementation even for a relatively large number of waypoints. The provided solution takes full advantage from the available flight resources, reducing mission time for a given set of waypoints and for increasing UAV number.},

First, the received signal strength of the communication base station is collected and pre-processed by randomly deploying distributed sensor nodes. Then, the neural network objective function is modified by using the variogram function, and the initial weight coefficient of the neural network is optimized by using the improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. Next, the trained network model is used to interpolate the perceptual blind zone. Finally, the sensor node sampling data and the interpolation estimation result are combined to generate an effective coverage of the 5G mobile communication network signal. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can detect the real situation of 5G mobile communication network signal coverage better than other algorithms, and has certain feasibility and application prospects.},

ABSTRACT = {Data collection is one of the main operations performed in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Even if several interesting approaches on data collection have been proposed during the last decade, it remains a research focus in full swing with a number of important challenges. Indeed, the continuous reduction in sensor size and cost, the variety of sensors available on the market, and the tremendous advances in wireless communication technology have potentially broadened the impact of WSNs. The range of application of WSNs now extends from health to the military field through home automation, environmental monitoring and tracking, as well as other areas of human activity. Moreover, the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in an important amount of heterogeneous data that are produced at an exponential rate. Furthermore, these data are of interest to both industry and in research. This fact makes their collection and analysis imperative for many purposes. In view of the characteristics of these data, we believe that very large-scale and heterogeneous WSNs can be very useful for collecting and processing these Big Data. However, the scaling up of WSNs presents several challenges that are of interest in both network architecture to be proposed, and the design of data-routing protocols. This paper reviews the background and state of the art of Big Data collection in Large-Scale WSNs (LS-WSNs), compares and discusses on challenges of Big Data collection in LS-WSNs, and proposes possible directions for the future.},

ABSTRACT = {Mobile multirobot systems play an increasing role in many disciplines. Their capabilities can be used, e.g., to transport workpieces in industrial applications or to support operational forces in search and rescue scenarios, among many others. Depending on the respective application, the hardware design and accompanying software of mobile robots are of various forms, especially for integrating different sensors and actuators. Concerning this design, robots of one system compared to each other can be classified to exclusively be either homogeneous or heterogeneous, both resulting in different system properties. While homogeneously configured systems are known to be robust against failures through redundancy but are highly specialized for specific use cases, heterogeneously designed systems can be used for a broad range of applications but suffer from their specialization, i.e., they can only hardly compensate for the failure of one specialist. Up to now, there has been no known approach aiming to unify the benefits of both these types of system. In this paper, we present our approach to filling this gap by introducing a reference architecture for mobile robots that defines the interplay of all necessary technologies for achieving this goal. We introduce the class of robot systems implementing this architecture as multipotent systems that bring together the benefits of both system classes, enabling homogeneously designed robots to become heterogeneous specialists at runtime. When many of these robots work together, we call the structure of this cooperation an ensemble. To achieve multipotent ensembles, we also integrate reconfigurable and self-descriptive hardware (i.e., sensors and actuators) in this architecture, which can be freely combined to change the capabilities of robots at runtime. Because typically a high degree of autonomy in such systems is a prerequisite for their practical usage, we also present the integration of necessary mechanisms and algorithms for achieving the systems&rsquo; multipotency. We already achieved the first results with robots implementing our approach of multipotent systems in real-world experiments as well as in a simulation environment, which we present in this paper.},

ABSTRACT = {Path planning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in threatening and adversarial areas is a constrained nonlinear optimal problem which takes a great amount of static and dynamic constraints into account. Quantum-behaved pigeon-inspired optimization (QPIO) has been widely applied to such nonlinear problems. However, conventional QPIO is suffering low global convergence speed and local optimum. In order to solve the above problems, an improved QPIO algorithm, adaptive operator QPIO, is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new initialization process based on logistic mapping method is introduced to generate the initial population of the pigeon-swarm. After that, to improve the performance of the map and compass operation, the factor parameter will be adaptively updated in each iteration, which can balance the ability between global and local search. In the final landmark operation, the gradual decreasing pigeon population-updating strategy is introduced to prevent premature convergence and local optimum. Finally, the demonstration of the proposed algorithm on UAV path planning problem is presented, and the comparison result indicates that the performance of our algorithm is better than that of particle swarm optimization (PSO), pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO), and its variants, in terms of convergence and accuracy.},

ABSTRACT = {Coverage path planning consists of finding the route which covers every point of a certain area of interest. In recent times, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in several application domains involving terrain coverage, such as surveillance, smart farming, photogrammetry, disaster management, civil security, and wildfire tracking, among others. This paper aims to explore and analyze the existing studies in the literature related to the different approaches employed in coverage path planning problems, especially those using UAVs. We address simple geometric flight patterns and more complex grid-based solutions considering full and partial information about the area of interest. The surveyed coverage approaches are classified according to a classical taxonomy, such as no decomposition, exact cellular decomposition, and approximate cellular decomposition. This review also contemplates different shapes of the area of interest, such as rectangular, concave and convex polygons. The performance metrics usually applied to evaluate the success of the coverage missions are also presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, industry and academia are undergoing an evolution in developing the next generation of drone applications. Including the development of autonomous drones that can carry out tasks without the assistance of a human operator. In spite of this, there are still problems left unanswered related to the placement of drone take-off, landing and charging areas. Future policies by governments and aviation agencies are inevitably going to restrict the operational area where drones can take-off and land. Hence, there is a need to develop a system to manage landing and take-off areas for drones. Additionally, we proposed this approach due to the lack of justification for the initial location of drones in current research. Therefore, to provide a foundation for future research, we give a justified reason that allows predetermined location of drones with the use of drone ports. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to optimally place these drone ports to minimize the average distance drones must travel based on a set of potential drone port locations and tasks generated in a given area. Our approach is derived from the Facility Location problem which produces an efficient near optimal solution to place drone ports that reduces the overall drone energy consumption. Secondly, we apply various traveling salesman algorithms to determine the shortest route the drone must travel to visit all the tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Spectral unmixing is a vital procedure in hyperspectral remote sensing image exploitation. The linear mixture model has been widely utilized to unmix hyperspectral images by extracting a set of pure spectral signatures, called endmembers in hyperspectral jargon, and estimating their respective fractional abundances in each pixel of the scene. Many algorithms have been proposed to extract endmembers automatically, which is a critical step in the spectral unmixing chain. In recent years, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm has been developed for endmember extraction from hyperspectral data, which was regarded as a combinatorial optimization problem. Although the ACO for endmember extraction (ACOEE) can acquire accurate endmember results, its high computational complexity has limited its application in the hyperspectral data analysis. The GPUs parallel computing technique can be utilized to improve the computational performance of ACOEE, but the architecture of GPUs determines that the ACOEE should be redesigned to take full advantage of computing resources on GPUs. In this paper, a multiple sub-ant-colony-based parallel design of ACOEE was proposed, in which an innovative mechanism of local pheromone for sub-ant-colonies is utilized to enable ACOEE to be preferably executed on the multi-GPU system. The proposed method can avoid much synchronization among different GPUs to affect the computational performance improvement. The experiments on two real hyperspectral datasets demonstrated that the computational performance of ACOEE significantly benefited from the proposed methods.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on one of the collision avoidance scenarios for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where the UAV needs to avoid collision with the enemy UAV during its flying path to the goal point. Such a type of problem is defined as the enemy avoidance problem in this paper. To deal with this problem, a learning based framework is proposed. Under this framework, the enemy avoidance problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and the maneuver policies for the UAV are learned based on a temporal-difference reinforcement learning method called Sarsa. To handle the enemy avoidance problem in continuous state space, the Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC) function approximation technique is embodied in the proposed framework. Furthermore, a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation environment is established. Simulation results show that the UAV agent can learn a satisfying policy under the proposed framework. Comparing with the random policy and the fixed-rule policy, the learned policy can achieve a far higher possibility in reaching the goal point without colliding with the enemy UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a novel collision avoidance (CA) algorithm for a cooperative fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The method is based on maneuver coordination and planned trajectory prediction. Each aircraft in a conflict generates three available maneuvers and predicts the corresponding planned trajectories. The algorithm coordinates planned trajectories between participants in a conflict, determines which combination of planned trajectories provides the best separation, eventually makes an agreement on the maneuver for collision avoidance and activates the preferred maneuvers when a collision is imminent. The emphasis is placed on providing protection for UAVs, while activating maneuvers late enough to reduce interference, which is necessary for collision avoidance in the formation and clustering of UAVs. The CA has been validated with various simulations to show the advantage of collision avoidance for continuous conflicts in multiple, high-dynamic, high-density and three-dimensional (3D) environments. It eliminates the disadvantage of traditional CA, which has high uncertainty, and takes the performance parameters of different aircraft into consideration and makes full use of the maneuverability of fixed-wing aircraft.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a dynamic two-stage closed search (DTSCS) scheme for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative region search is designed, which satisfies the range constraint (RC) and orientation constraint (OC). The closed trajectory is composed of two coupling stages, the search stage and the return stage. The position and orientation at the end of the search stage are the starting cell and orientation of the return stage. In the first stage, a coevolution pigeon-inspired optimization (CPIO) algorithm based on the cooperation-competition mechanism is proposed for multi-UAV cooperative search. In the return stage, inspired by region searching and trajectory tracking, a search tracking (ST) approach is presented to obtain the lowest-cost path under OC. The simulation results show that: (i)      N p  = 5     is the best prediction time step. (ii) CPIO algorithm performs better than the compared intelligent algorithms in region searching. (iii) ST has high tracking performance than other algorithms. (iv) The DTSCS scheme enables every UAV to make the best use of its fuel to cover more region and return to the airport within the RC, and the average range utilization of UAVs is 97% under the 3OC.},

ABSTRACT = {Today, more and more complex tasks are emerging. To finish these tasks within a reasonable time, using the complex embedded system which has multiple processing units is necessary. Hardware/software partitioning is one of the key technologies in designing complex embedded systems, it is usually taken as an optimization problem and be solved with different optimization methods. Among the optimization methods, swarm intelligent (SI) algorithms are easily applied and have the advantages of strong robustness and excellent global search ability. Due to the high complexity of hardware/software partitioning problems, the SI algorithms are ideal methods to solve the problems. In this paper, a new SI algorithm, called brainstorm optimization (BSO), is applied to hardware/software partitioning. In order to improve the performance of the BSO, we analyzed its optimization process when solving the hardware/software partitioning problem and found the disadvantages in terms of the clustering method and the updating strategy. Then we proposed the improved brainstorm optimization (IBSO) which ameliorated the original clustering method by setting the cluster points and improved the updating strategy by decreasing the number of updated individuals in each iteration. Based on the simulation methods which are usually used to evaluate the performance of the hardware/software partitioning algorithms, we generated eight benchmarks which represent tasks with different scales to test the performance of IBSO, BSO, four original heuristic algorithms and two improved BSO. Simulation results show that the IBSO algorithm can achieve the solutions with the highest quality within the shortest running time among these algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and its subarea of deep learning have drawn the attention of many researchers. At the same time, advances in technologies enable the generation or collection of large amounts of valuable data (e.g., sensor data) from various sources in different applications, such as those for the Internet of Things (IoT), which in turn aims towards the development of smart cities. With the availability of sensor data from various sources, sensor information fusion is in demand for effective integration of big data. In this article, we present an AI-based sensor-information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of transportation data generated and collected from various types of sensors, including remote sensed imagery for the geographic information system (GIS), accelerometers, as well as sensors for the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and global positioning system (GPS). The discovered knowledge and information returned from our system provides analysts with a clearer understanding of trajectories or mobility of citizens, which in turn helps to develop better transportation models to achieve the ultimate goal of smarter cities. Evaluation results show the effectiveness and practicality of our AI-based sensor information fusion system for supporting deep supervised learning of big transportation data.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents an optimisation framework that uses stochastic multi-objective optimisation, combined with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and describes its application to the aerodynamic design of aircraft shapes. The framework uses the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO) algorithm and the obtained results confirm that the proposed technique provides highly optimal solutions in less computational time than other approaches to the same design problem. The main idea was to focus computational effort on worthwhile design solutions rather than exploring and evaluating all possible solutions in the design space. It is shown that the number of valid solutions obtained using ANN-MOPSO compared to MOPSO for 3000 evaluations grew from 529 to 1006 (90% improvement) with a penalty of only 8.3% (11 min) in computational time. It is demonstrated that including an ANN, the ANN-MOPSO with 3000 evaluations produced a larger number of valid solutions than the MOPSO with 5500 evaluations, and in 33% less computational time (64 min). This is taken as confirmation of the potential power of ANNs when applied to this type of design problem.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, an interactive optimisation framework&mdash;a combination of a low fidelity flow solver, Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL), and an interactive Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO)&mdash;is proposed for aerodynamic shape design optimisation of any aerial vehicle platform. This paper demonstrates the benefits of interactive optimisation&mdash;reduction of computational time with high optimality levels. Progress towards the most preferred solutions is made by having the Decision Maker (DM) periodically provide preference information once the MOPSO iterations are underway. By involving the DM within the optimisation process, the search is directed to the region of interest, which accelerates the process. The flexibility and efficiency of undertaking optimisation interactively have been demonstrated by comparing the interactive results with the non-interactive results of an optimum design case obtained using Multi-Objective Tabu Search (MOTS) for the Aegis UAV. The obtained results show the superiority of using an interactive approach for the aerodynamic shape design, compared to posteriori approaches. By carrying out the optimisation using interactive MOPSO it was shown to be possible to obtain similar results to non-interactive MOTS with only half the evaluations. Moreover, much of the usual complexity of post-data-analysis with posteriori approaches is avoided, since the DM is involved in the search process.},

ABSTRACT = {To facilitate connectivity to the internet, the easiest way to establish communication infrastructure in areas affected by natural disaster and in remote locations with intermittent cellular services and/or lack of Wi-Fi coverage is to deploy an end-to-end connection over Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). However, the potentials of MANETs are yet to be fully realized as existing MANETs routing protocols still suffer some major technical drawback in the areas of mobility, link quality, and battery constraint of mobile nodes between the overlay connections. To address these problems, a routing scheme named Mobility, Residual energy and Link quality Aware Multipath (MRLAM) is proposed for routing in MANETs. The proposed scheme makes routing decisions by determining the optimal route with energy efficient nodes to maintain the stability, reliability, and lifetime of the network over a sustained period of time. The MRLAM scheme uses a Q-Learning algorithm for the selection of optimal intermediate nodes based on the available status of energy level, mobility, and link quality parameters, and then provides positive and negative reward values accordingly. The proposed routing scheme reduces energy cost by 33% and 23%, end to end delay by 15% and 10%, packet loss ratio by 30.76% and 24.59%, and convergence time by 16.49% and 11.34% approximately, compared with other well-known routing schemes such as Multipath Optimized Link State Routing protocol (MP-OLSR) and MP-OLSRv2, respectively. Overall, the acquired results indicate that the proposed MRLAM routing scheme significantly improves the overall performance of the network.},

ABSTRACT = {Cooperative behaviors in multi-robot systems emerge as an excellent alternative for collaboration in search and rescue tasks to accelerate the finding survivors process and avoid risking additional lives. Although there are still several challenges to be solved, such as communication between agents, power autonomy, navigation strategies, and detection and classification of survivors, among others. The research work presented by this paper focuses on the navigation of the robot swarm and the consensus of the agents applied to the victims detection. The navigation strategy is based on the application of particle swarm theory, where the robots are the agents of the swarm. The attraction and repulsion forces that are typical in swarm particle systems are used by the multi-robot system to avoid obstacles, keep group compact and navigate to a target location. The victims are detected by each agent separately, however, once the agents agree on the existence of a possible victim, these agents separate from the general swarm by creating a sub-swarm. The sub-swarm agents use a modified rendezvous consensus algorithm to perform a formation control around the possible victims and then carry out a consensus of the information acquired by the sensors with the aim to determine the victim existence. Several experiments were conducted to test navigation, obstacle avoidance, and search for victims. Additionally, different situations were simulated with the consensus algorithm. The results show how swarm theory allows the multi-robot system navigates avoiding obstacles, finding possible victims, and settling down their possible use in search and rescue operations.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a multi-robot persistent coverage of the region of interest is considered, where persistent coverage and cooperative coverage are addressed simultaneously. Previous works have mainly concentrated on the paths that allow for repeated coverage, but ignored the coverage period requirements of each sub-region. In contrast, this paper presents a combinatorial approach for path planning, which aims to cover mission domains with different task periods while guaranteeing both obstacle avoidance and minimizing the number of robots used. The algorithm first deploys the sensors in the region to satisfy coverage requirements with minimum cost. Then it solves the travelling salesman problem to obtain the frame of the closed path. Finally, the approach partitions the closed path into the fewest segments under the coverage period constraints, and it generates the closed route for each robot on the basis of portioned segments of the closed path. Therefore, each robot can circumnavigate one closed route to cover the different task areas completely and persistently. The numerical simulations show that the proposed approach is feasible to implement the cooperative coverage in consideration of obstacles and coverage period constraints, and the number of robots used is also minimized.},

ABSTRACT = {In traditional fault diagnosis strategies, massive and disordered data cannot be utilized effectively. Furthermore, just a single parameter is used for fault diagnosis of a weapons fire control system, which might lead to uncertainty in the results. This paper proposes an information fusion method in which rough set theory (RST) is combined with an improved Dempster&ndash;Shafer (DS) evidence theory to identify various system operation states. First, the feature information of different faults is extracted from the original data, then this information is used as the evidence of the state for a diagnosis object. By introducing RST, the extracted fault information is reduced in terms of the number of attributes, and the basic probability value of the reduced fault information is obtained. Based on an analysis of conflicts in the existing DS evidence theory, an improved conflict evidence synthesis method is proposed, which combines the improved synthesis rule and the conflict evidence weight allocation methods. Then, an intelligent evaluation model for the fire control system operation state is established, which is based on the improved evidence theory and RST. The case of a power supply module in a fire control computer is analyzed. In this case, the state grade of the power supply module is evaluated by the proposed method, and the conclusion verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method in evaluating the operation state of a fire control system.},

ABSTRACT = {With the development of engineering technology, the distributed design-based Branch-Trimming Robot (BTR) has been used to ensure the power supply security of transmission lines. However, it remains difficult to combine distributed BTRs with a wireless sensor network to build an efficient multi-robot system. To achieve this combination, a dynamic network topology control method was proposed, combining the motion characteristics of robots with the structure of a distributed wireless sensor network. In addition, a topology-updating mechanism based on node signal strength was adopted as well. To achieve efficient data transmission for distributed multi-robot systems, the present study focused on the design of a distributed network model and a dynamic network topology control strategy. Several simulation and test scenarios were implemented, and the changes of network performance under different parameters were studied. Furthermore, the real scene-based dynamic topology control method considers the relationship between network performance and antenna layout.},

ABSTRACT = {Crowdsensing has emerged as an efficient and inexpensive way to perform specialized tasks by leveraging external crowds. In some crowdsensing systems, different tasks may have different requirements, and there may be precedence constraints among them, such as the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) crowdsensing systems. Moreover, minimizing the total execution time is a regular target for finishing the crowdsensing tasks with precedence constraints. As far as we know, only a few existing studies consider the precedence constraints among crowdsensing tasks, and none of them can minimize the total execution time simultaneously. To tackle this challenge, an efficient allocation mechanism for tasks with precedence constraints is first proposed, which can minimize the total execution time. Then, a case study is given to show how to fit our mechanism in the UAV crowdsensing system. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed mechanisms have good approximate optimal ratios under different parameter settings and are efficient for the UAV crowdsensing system as well.},

ABSTRACT = {Although an analytical design approach-based digital controller&mdash;which is essentially a deadbeat controller&mdash;shows zero steady-state error and no intersampling oscillations, it takes a finite number of sampling periods to settle down to a steady-state value. This paper describes the application of a derivative-free Nelder&ndash;Mead (N&ndash;M) simplex method to the digital controller for retuning of its coefficients intelligently to ensure improved settling and rise times without disturbing the deadbeat controller characteristics (i.e., no ripples between the sampling periods and no steady-state error). A switching-mode buck regulator working at 1 MHz in continuous conduction mode (CCM) is considered as a plant. Numerical simulation results depict that the N&ndash;M algorithm-based optimized digital controller not only shows improved steady-state and transient performance but also guarantees rigorous robustness against model uncertainty and disturbance as compared to its traditional counterpart, as well as the other optimized digital controller fine-tuned through other derivative-free metaheuristic optimization techniques, such as the genetic algorithm (GA). A system generator-based hardware software co-simulation is also performed to validate the simulation results.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) as an efficient underwater exploration means have been used to perform various marine missions. However, limited by the technologies of underwater acoustic communications and intelligent autonomy, the most current and advanced AUVs only perform a limited number of tasks in the small-scale area and the known underwater environment. Therefore, in this paper, a one path planning model was proposed combining the global path planning and the local path planning for the large-scale complex marine environment. More specifically, the B-spline curve was used to represent the smooth path for the requirement of kinematic constraints of AUVs. After considering the various constraints, such as the energy/time consumption, the turning radius limitation, the marine environment, and the ocean current, the path planning was abstractly modeled as a multi-objective optimization model with the time cost, the curvature cost, the map cost, and the ocean current cost. The swarm hyper-heuristic algorithm (SHH) with the online learning ability was proposed to solve this model with real-time performance and stability. The results showed that the proposed online learning SHH algorithm had obvious advantages in terms of time efficiency, stability, and optimal performance compared with the results of two traditional heuristic algorithms, both particle swarm optimization (PSO) and firefly algorithm (FFA). The time efficiency of the online learning SHH algorithm improved at least 20% compared with PSO and FFA.},

ABSTRACT = {Building extraction is an important way to obtain information in urban planning, land management, and other fields. As remote sensing has various advantages such as large coverage and real-time capability, it becomes an essential approach for building extraction. Among various remote sensing technologies, the capability of providing 3D features makes the LiDAR point cloud become a crucial means for building extraction. However, the LiDAR point cloud has difficulty distinguishing objects with similar heights, in which case texture features are able to extract different objects in a 2D image. In this paper, a building extraction method based on the fusion of point cloud and texture features is proposed, and the texture features are extracted by using an elevation map that expresses the height of each point. The experimental results show that the proposed method obtains better extraction results than that of other texture feature extraction methods and ENVI software in all experimental areas, and the extraction accuracy is always higher than 87%, which is satisfactory for some practical work.},

ABSTRACT = {Multi-sensor fusion for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is an important issue for autonomous navigation of USVs. In this paper, an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for real-time autonomous navigation of a USV in real maritime environment. To overcome the conventional PSO&rsquo;s inherent shortcomings, such as easy occurrence of premature convergence and human experience-determined parameters, and to enhance the precision and algorithm robustness of the solution, this work proposes three optimization strategies: linearly descending inertia weight, adaptively controlled acceleration coefficients, and random grouping inversion. Their respective or combinational effects on the effectiveness of path planning are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations for five TSPLIB instances and application tests for the navigation of a self-developed unmanned surface vehicle on the basis of multi-sensor data. Comparative results show that the adaptively controlled acceleration coefficients play a substantial role in reducing the path length and the linearly descending inertia weight help improve the algorithm robustness. Meanwhile, the random grouping inversion optimizes the capacity of local search and maintains the population diversity by stochastically dividing the single swarm into several subgroups. Moreover, the PSO combined with all three strategies shows the best performance with the shortest trajectory and the superior robustness, although retaining solution precision and avoiding being trapped in local optima require more time consumption. The experimental results of our USV demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method for real-time navigation based on multi-sensor fusion.},

ABSTRACT = {With the emergence of swarm intelligent systems, especially the swarming of aircraft and ground vehicles, cooperation in multiple dimensions has becoming one of the great challenges. How to dynamically schedule the resources within a swarm intelligent system and optimize the execution of tasks are all vital aspects for such systems. Focusing on this topic, in this paper, one new task planning mechanism with multiple constraints is proposed to solve such dynamic programming problems. Concretely, several fundamental models, covering three-level task models and resource-service pool models, are put forward and defined first. Considering the limitations of swarm systems running within complicated cyber-physical space, multi-dimension constraints for tasks scheduling and execution are further modeled and established. On this basis, we mapped this planning problem to an optimization searching problem, and then proposed a Genetic-Algorithm-based mechanism. All these works have been verified with simulated cooperation scenes. Experimental results show that this new mechanism is efficient to solve such resource-related and mission-oriented cooperation problems in complicated environments.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is rapidly growing in popularity. Initially introduced for military purposes, over the past few years, UAVs and related technologies have successfully transitioned to a whole new range of civilian applications such as delivery, logistics, surveillance, entertainment, and so forth. They have opened new possibilities such as allowing operation in otherwise difficult or hazardous areas, for instance. For all applications, one foremost concern is the selection of the paths and trajectories of UAVs, and at the same time, UAVs control comes with many challenges, as they have limited energy, limited load capacity and are vulnerable to difficult weather conditions. Generally, efficiently operating a drone can be mathematically formalized as a path optimization problem under some constraints. This shares some commonalities with similar problems that have been extensively studied in the context of urban vehicles and it is only natural that the recent literature has extended the latter to fit aerial vehicle constraints. The knowledge of such problems, their formulation, the resolution methods proposed—through the variants induced specifically by UAVs features—are of interest for practitioners for any UAV application. Hence, in this study, we propose a review of existing literature devoted to such UAV path optimization problems, focusing specifically on the sub-class of problems that consider the mobility on a macroscopic scale. These are related to the two existing general classic ones—the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Vehicle Routing Problem. We analyze the recent literature that adapted the problems to the UAV context, provide an extensive classification and taxonomy of their problems and their formulation and also give a synthetic overview of the resolution techniques, performance metrics and obtained numerical results.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with acceptable performance are becoming commercially available at an affordable cost. Due to this, the use of drones for real-time data collection is becoming common practice by individual practitioners in the areas of e.g., precision agriculture and civil defense such as fire fighting. At the same time, as UAVs become a house-hold item, a plethora of issues&mdash;which can no longer be ignored and considered niche problems&mdash;are coming of age. These range from legal and ethical questions to technical matters such as how to implement and operate a communication infrastructure to maintain control over deployed devices. With these issues being addressed, approaches that focus on enabling collectives of devices to operate semi-autonomously are also increasing in relevance. In this article we present a nature-inspired algorithm that enables a UAV-swarm to operate as a collective which provides real-time data such as video footage. The collective is able to autonomously adapt to changing resolution requirements for specific locations within the area under surveillance. Our distributed approach significantly reduces the requirements on the communication infrastructure and mitigates the computational cost otherwise incurred. In addition, if the UAVs themselves were to be equipped with even rudimentary data-analysis capabilities, the swarm could react in real-time to the data it generates and self-regulate which locations within its operational area it focuses on. The approach was tested in a swarm of 25 UAVs; we present out preliminary performance evaluation.},

ABSTRACT = {The range of attacks implemented on wireless networks is quite wide. To avoid or reduce the likelihood of an attack, it is necessary to use various defense mechanisms. Existing protection mechanisms are not always suitable for robotic systems and may not fully provide the necessary level of security. Thus, it is necessary to develop new ways of protection, which would be specific to groups of mobile robots. In this study, we propose an analysis of the following cyber parameters: the power consumption and the residual energy, as well as an in-depth traffic analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of the attack and identify abnormal network. We realized an analysis of the behavior of robotic systems under normal conditions and determined that, by their nature, robotic systems have a static and uniform behavior. We developed an experimental stand, and also conducted a theoretical analysis to confirm our assumptions. We found that some indicators of the components of the robotic system change statically; that is, there was a little deviation from the mean. Thus, we identified a set of metrics that allow us to determine how static the operation of the robotic system and its components is. Metrics allow us to evaluate parameters such as power consumption, and incoming/outgoing/redirected/dropped network packets. The results obtained are important for creating an integrated system for detecting anomalies in robotic systems. At the same time, the robotic node can analyze these parameters independently and make calculations that do not greatly affect performance. The main idea of this paper is to define a set of metrics characterizing the static behavior of a robotic system for the further development of an anomaly detection system.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of robots has increased significantly in the recent years; rapidly expending to numerous applications. These sophisticated machines are susceptible to different types of faults that might endanger the robot or its surroundings. These faults must be detected and diagnosed in time to allow continual operation. The field of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) has been studied for many years. This research has given birth to many approaches that are applicable to different types of physical machines. However, the domain of robotics poses unique requirements that challenge traditional FDD approaches. The study of FDD for robotics is relatively new; only few surveys were presented. These surveys have focused on the single robot scenario. To the best of our knowledge, there is no survey that focuses on FDD for Multi-Robot Systems (MRS). In this paper we set out to fill this gap. This paper provides detailed insights to the world of FDD for MRS. We first describe how different attributes of MRS pose different challenges for FDD. With respect to these challenges, we survey different FDD approaches applicable for MRS. We conclude with a description of research opportunities in this field. With these contributions it is the authors&rsquo; intention to provide detailed insights to the world of FDD for MRS.},

ABSTRACT = {Fusarium head blight (FHB), one of the most important diseases of wheat, mainly occurs in the ear. Given that the severity of the disease cannot be accurately identified, the cost of pesticide application increases every year, and the agricultural ecological environment is also polluted. In this study, a neural network (NN) method was proposed based on the red-green-blue (RGB) image to segment wheat ear and disease spot in the field environment, and then to determine the disease grade. Firstly, a segmentation dataset of single wheat ear was constructed to provide a benchmark for the segmentation of the wheat ear. Secondly, a segmentation model of single wheat ear based on the fully convolutional network (FCN) was established to effectively realize the segmentation of the wheat ear in the field environment. An FHB segmentation algorithm was proposed based on a pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN) with K-means clustering of the improved artificial bee colony (IABC) to segment the diseased spot of wheat ear by automatic optimization of PCNN parameters. Finally, the disease grade was calculated using the ratio of the disease spot to the whole wheat ear. The experimental results show that: (1) the accuracy of the segmentation model for single wheat ear constructed in this study is 0.981. The segmentation time is less than 1 s, indicating that the model can quickly and accurately segment wheat ear in the field environment; (2) the segmentation method of the disease spot performed under each evaluation indicator is improved compared with the traditional segmentation methods, and the accuracy is 0.925 in the disease severity identification. These research results can provide important reference value for grading wheat FHB in the field environment, which also can be beneficial for real-time monitoring of other crops&rsquo; diseases under near-Earth remote sensing.},

ABSTRACT = {Pre-stack amplitude variation with offset (AVO) elastic parameter inversion is a nonlinear, multi-solution optimisation problem. The techniques that combine intelligent optimisation algorithms and AVO inversion provide an effective identification method for oil and gas exploration. However, these techniques also have shortcomings in solving nonlinear geophysical inversion problems. The evolutionary optimisation algorithms have recognised disadvantages, such as the tendency of convergence to a local optimum resulting in poor local optimisation performance when dealing with multimodal search problems, decreasing diversity and leading to the prematurity of the population as the number of evolutionary iterations increases. The pre-stack AVO elastic parameter inversion is nonlinear with slow convergence, while the pigeon-inspired optimisation (PIO) algorithm has the advantage of fast convergence and better optimisation characteristics. In this study, based on the characteristics of the pre-stack AVO elastic parameter inversion problem, an improved PIO algorithm (IPIO) is proposed by introducing the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm, an inverse factor, and a Gaussian factor into the PIO algorithm. The experimental comparisons indicate that the proposed IPIO algorithm can achieve better inversion results.},

ABSTRACT = {Following striking developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology, the use of UAVs has been researched in various industrial fields. Furthermore, a number of studies on operating multiple autonomous networking UAVs suggest a potential to use UAVs in large-scale environments. To achieve efficiency of performance in multi-UAV operations, it is essential to consider a variety of factors in UAV network conditions, such as energy efficiency, network overhead, and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that improves the energy efficiency and network throughputs by controlling the topology of the network. Our proposed network topology control scheme functions between the data link layer (L3) and the network layer (L2). Accordingly, it can be considered to be layer 2.5 in the network hierarchy model. In addition, our methodology includes swarm intelligence, meaning that whole topology control can be generated with less cost and effort, and without a centralized controller. Our experimental results confirm the notable performance of our proposed method compared to previous approaches.},

ABSTRACT = {Wireless sensor networks have recently been widely used in several applications and scenarios, especially because they have the ability and flexibility for establishing a scalable and reliable wireless network. Cooperative multi-robotic systems (CMRS) are one example of these applications where establishing a wireless network between robots is essential and paramount to their operation. Further, these robots can utilize their mobility to provide sensing functionality for areas that are not covered by the static sensor. This can be achieved by equipping the robots with specific sensors to sense the area of interest (AoI) and report the sensed data to a remote monitoring center for further processing and decision-making. However, the nodes that form the sensor network have limited energy, and, as such, efficient algorithms in clusters&rsquo; formation, packets&rsquo; routing, and energy and mobility management are paramount. In this paper, a literature survey is presented containing the most related works that have been proposed to solve these challenges utilizing fuzzy logic. Most of the literature work attempted to utilize a de-centralized approach, where certain input parameters such as the residual energy, communication link quality, network congestion status, the nodes&rsquo; distance to the sink node and its location with respect to the other nodes, and the data and their sampling rate are all used as inputs to the fuzzy logic controller. These input parameters are used to determine several performance vital factors such as the cluster formation and its cluster head, best route to the sink node, optimal power management policies in terms of sleep/awake times needed to maximize the network lifetime, nodes&rsquo; mobility management policies to maintain network connectivity, and best route in terms of packet loss and delay.},

ABSTRACT = {Early breast cancer diagnosis is crucial, as it can prevent further complications and save the life of the patient by treating the disease at its most curable stage. In this paper, we propose a new artificial immune system model for associative classification with competitive performance for breast cancer detection. The proposed model has its foundations in the biological immune system; it mimics the detection skills of the immune system to provide correct identification of antigens. The Wilcoxon test was used to identify the statistically significant differences between our proposal and other classification algorithms based on the same bio-inspired model. These statistical tests evidenced the enhanced performance shown by the proposed model by outperforming other immune-based algorithms. The proposed model proved to be competitive with respect to other well-known classification models. In addition, the model benefits from a low computational cost. The success of this model for classification tasks shows that swarm intelligence is useful for this kind of problem, and that it is not limited to optimization tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {In order to protect human lives and infrastructure, as well as to minimize the risk of damage, it is important to predict and respond to natural disasters in advance. However, currently, the standardized disaster response system in South Korea still needs further advancement, and the response phase systems need to be improved to ensure that they are properly equipped to cope with natural disasters. Existing studies on intelligent disaster management systems (IDSSs) in South Korea have focused only on storms, floods, and earthquakes, and they have not used past data. This research proposes a new conceptual framework of an IDSS for disaster management, with particular attention paid to wildfires and cold/heat waves. The IDSS uses big data collected from open application programming interface (API) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to help decision-makers make faster and more accurate decisions. In addition, a simple example of the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect fire in surveillance video has been developed, which can be used for automatic fire detection and provide an appropriate response. The system will also consider connecting to open source intelligence (OSINT) to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and develop more robust security policies than those currently in place to prevent cyber-attacks.},

ABSTRACT = {Pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) is a new type of intelligent algorithm. It is proposed that the algorithm simulates the movement of pigeons going home. In this paper, a new pigeon herding algorithm called compact pigeon-inspired optimization (CPIO) is proposed. The challenging task for multiple algorithms is not only combining operations, but also constraining existing devices. The proposed algorithm aims to solve complex scientific and industrial problems with many data packets, including the use of classical optimization problems and the ability to find optimal solutions in many solution spaces with limited hardware resources. A real-valued prototype vector performs probability and statistical calculations, and then generates optimal candidate solutions for CPIO optimization algorithms. The CPIO algorithm was used to evaluate a variety of continuous multi-model functions and the largest model of hydropower short-term generation. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is a more effective way to produce competitive results in the case of limited memory devices.},

Swarm intelligence (SI) provides the possibility of SI behavior through collaboration in individuals that have limited or no intelligence. Its potential parallelism and distribution characteristics can be used to realize global optimization and solve nonlinear complex problems. This paper reviews representative SI algorithms and summarizes their applications in the IoT. The main focus consists in the analysis of SI-enabled applications to wireless sensor network (WSN) and discussion of related research problems in the WSN. Also, we concluded SI-based applications in other IoT fields, such as SI in UAV-aided wireless network. Finally, possible research prospects and future trends are drawn.},

ABSTRACT = {Planning an optimal path for a mobile robot is a complicated problem as it allows the mobile robots to navigate autonomously by following the safest and shortest path between starting and goal points. The present work deals with the design of intelligent path planning algorithms for a mobile robot in static and dynamic environments based on swarm intelligence optimization. A modification based on the age of the ant is introduced to standard ant colony optimization, called aging-based ant colony optimization (ABACO). The ABACO was implemented in association with grid-based modeling for the static and dynamic environments to solve the path planning problem. The simulations are run in the MATLAB environment to test the validity of the proposed algorithms. Simulations showed that the proposed path planning algorithms result in superior performance by finding the shortest and the most free-collision path under various static and dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed algorithms was proved through comparisons with other traditional path planning algorithms with different static environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Prediction models in mobility and transportation maintenance systems have been dramatically improved by using machine learning methods. This paper proposes novel machine learning models for an intelligent road inspection. The traditional road inspection systems based on the pavement condition index (PCI) are often associated with the critical safety, energy and cost issues. Alternatively, the proposed models utilize surface deflection data from falling weight deflectometer (FWD) tests to predict the PCI. Machine learning methods are the single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks as well as their hybrids, i.e., Levenberg&ndash;Marquardt (MLP-LM), scaled conjugate gradient (MLP-SCG), imperialist competitive (RBF-ICA), and genetic algorithms (RBF-GA). Furthermore, the committee machine intelligent systems (CMIS) method was adopted to combine the results and improve the accuracy of the modeling. The results of the analysis have been verified through using four criteria of average percent relative error (APRE), average absolute percent relative error (AAPRE), root mean square error (RMSE) and standard error (SE). The CMIS model outperforms other models with the promising results of APRE = 2.3303, AAPRE = 11.6768, RMSE = 12.0056 and SD = 0.0210.},

ABSTRACT = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are key elements of Internet of Things (IoT) networks which provide sensing and wireless connectivity. Disaster management in smart cities is classified as a safety-critical application. Thus, it is important to ensure system availability by increasing the lifetime of WSNs. Clustering is one of the routing techniques that benefits energy efficiency in WSNs. This paper provides an evolutionary clustering and routing method which is capable of managing the energy consumption of nodes while considering the characteristics of a disaster area. The proposed method consists of two phases. First, we present a model with improved hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) for cluster head (CH) selection. Second, we design a PSO-based multi-hop routing system with enhanced tree encoding and a modified data packet format. The simulation results for disaster scenarios prove the efficiency of the proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of the overall residual energy, number of live nodes, network coverage, and the packet delivery ratio.},

ABSTRACT = {Constructing a communications topology with fault tolerance and effective coverage plays an important role in wireless sensor networks. This paper is aimed at constructing and maintaining a biconnected topology, while minimizing the movement distance of the nodes and maximizing the coverage of the field of interest. First, it presents a new model with the motion constraint. If the nodes move at distance within the limit value calculated by the model, the topology is always connected, whether the neighbors of nodes are dynamic or static. Secondly, it improves the coverage strategy based on the nearest neighbor rule (NNR) and finds a rule of nodes&rsquo; spreading so that the nodes are distributed evenly and the spacing of the adjacent nodes is controllable. In addition, the nodes move only when necessary according to the added judgment conditions. Consequently, the movement distance is reduced. The simulation results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the Localized Topology Optimized Method (LTOM) proposed by this paper. The connected indicators of the system&rsquo;s topology during implementing LTOM are consistent, and the transformation of topology by LTOM is symmetric. Compared with the other distributed algorithm, NNR, LTOM reduces the movement distance of nodes, improves the connected probability, and maximizes the coverage of the topological structures under the biconnected conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Over the past decades, Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have achieved outstanding performance in military, commercial and civilian applications. UAVs are increasingly appearing in the form of swarms or formations to meet higher mission requirements. Communication plays an important role in UAV swarm control and coordination. The communication architecture defines how information is exchanged between UAVs or between UAVs and the central control center. Routing protocols help provide reliable end-to-end data transmission. Therefore, it is particularly important to design UAV swarm communication architectures and routing protocols with high performance and stability. This review article details four communication architectures including the advantages and disadvantages. Applicable scenarios are also discussed. In addition, a systematic overview and feasibility research of routing protocols are presented in this paper. To spur further research, the open research issues of UAV swarm communication architectures and routing protocols are also investigated.},

ABSTRACT = {As avionics technologies have advanced, it is possible to perform many aerial applications which demand cooperative work with multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Since one of the basic applications is reconnaissance, we focus on efficient cooperative reconnaissance. While random mobility models are useful for multi-UAVs reconnaissance, they suffer from overlapped reconnaissance problem that two or more UAVs reconnoiter a region at the same time. The overlapped reconnaissance also leads to imbalanced reconnaissance in which an area scanned by one UAV may be re-visited soon by the other UAV. Thus, we provide overlap avoidance schemes for the existing reconnaissance mobility models and enhance their performance. Throughout the simulations, we evaluate the effect of applying overlap avoidance in the existing models. The simulation results show that overlapped area is reduced by up to 20 times and 90%-coverage reaching time is improved by up to 19%.},

ABSTRACT = {Remote sensing with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) facilitates photogrammetry for environmental and infrastructural monitoring. Models are created with less computational cost by reducing the number of photos required. Optimal camera locations for reducing the number of photos needed for structure-from-motion (SfM) are determined through eight mathematical set-covering algorithms as constrained by solve time. The algorithms examined are: traditional greedy, reverse greedy, carousel greedy (CG), linear programming, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, genetic, and ant colony optimization. Coverage and solve time are investigated for these algorithms. CG is the best method for choosing optimal camera locations as it balances number of photos required and time required to calculate camera positions as shown through an analysis similar to a Pareto Front. CG obtains a statistically significant 3.2 fewer cameras per modeled area than base greedy algorithm while requiring just one additional order of magnitude of solve time. For comparison, linear programming is capable of fewer cameras than base greedy but takes at least three orders of magnitude longer to solve. A grid independence study serves as a sensitivity analysis of the CG algorithms    &alpha;    (iteration number) and    &beta;    (percentage to be recalculated) parameters that adjust traditional greedy heuristics, and a case study at the Rock Canyon collection dike in Provo, UT, USA, compares the results of all eight algorithms and the uniqueness (in terms of percentage comparisons based on location/angle metadata and qualitative visual comparison) of each selected set. Though this specific study uses SfM, the principles could apply to other instruments such as multi-spectral cameras or aerial LiDAR.},

Aiming at the problem of low maintenance efficiency of space-robot cluster task-planning, this study proposes a cluster-task-planning method based on energy and path optimization. First, by introducing the penalty-function method, the task planning problem of the space-robot cluster under limited energy is analyzed, and the optimal-path model for task planning with comprehensive optimization of revenue and energy consumption are constructed; then, the maintenance task points are clustered to reduce the scale of the problem, thus reducing the difficulty of solving the problem; finally, a modified differential evolution algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of space-robot cluster task-planning, improve the performance of space-robot cluster task-assignment and path planning. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal-path model of space-robot cluster and the modified differential evolution algorithm can effectively solve the task-planning problem of spatial robot clusters.},

ABSTRACT = {In the multi-chiller of the air conditioning system, the optimal chiller loading (OCL) is an important research topic. This research is to find the appropriate partial load ratio (PLR) for each chiller in order to minimize the total energy consumption of the multi-chiller under the system cooling load (CL) requirements. However, this optimization problem has not been well studied. In this paper, in order to solve the OCL problem, we propose an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm (IFOA). A linear generation mechanism is developed to uniformly generate candidate solutions, and a new dynamic search radius method is employed to balance the local and global search ability of IFOA. To empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed IFOA, a number of comparative experiments are conducted on three well-known cases. The experimental results show that IFOA found 14 optimal values (the optimal values among all algorithms) under a total of 17 CLs in three cases, and the ratio of the optimal values found was 82.4%, which was the highest among all algorithms. In addition, the mean value of all objective functions of IFOA is smaller and the standard deviation is equal to or close to 0, which proves that the algorithm has high stability. It can be concluded that IFOA is an ideal method to solve the OCL problem.},

ABSTRACT = {The increasing demands for real-time marine monitoring call for the wide deployment of Marine Monitoring Networks (MMNs). The low-rate underwater communications over a long distance, long propagation delay of underwater acoustic channel, and high deployment costs of marine sensors in a large-scale three-dimensional space bring great challenges in the network deployment and management of MMN. In this paper, we first propose a multitier, hierarchical network architecture of MMN with the support of edge computing (HMMN-EC) to enable efficient monitoring services in a harsh marine environment, taking into consideration the salient features of marine communications. Specifically, HMMN-EC is composed of three subnetworks, i.e., underwater acoustic subnetwork, the sea-surface wireless subnetwork, and the air wireless subnetwork, with a diversity of network nodes with different capabilities. We then jointly investigate the deployment diverse network nodes with various constraints in different subnetworks of HMMN-EC. To this end, we formulate a Multiobjective Optimization (MO) problem to minimize the network deployment cost while achieving the maximal network lifetime, subject to the limited energy of different marine nodes and the complex deployment environment. To solve the formulated problem, we present an Ant-Colony-based Efficient Topology Optimization (AC-ETO) algorithm to find the optimal locations of nodes in different subnetworks of MMN in a large-scale deployment. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm is also analyzed. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out to validate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm compared with some existing solutions.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning has been employed for various mapping and modeling tasks using input variables from different sources of remote sensing data. For feature selection involving high- spatial and spectral dimensionality data, various methods have been developed and incorporated into the machine learning framework to ensure an efficient and optimal computational process. This research aims to assess the accuracy of various feature selection and machine learning methods for estimating forest height using AISA (airborne imaging spectrometer for applications) hyperspectral bands (479 bands) and airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) height metrics (36 metrics), alone and combined. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction using Boruta (BO), principal component analysis (PCA), simulated annealing (SA), and genetic algorithm (GA) in combination with machine learning algorithms such as multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), extra trees (ET), support vector regression (SVR) with radial basis function, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) with trees (XGbtree and XGBdart) and linear (XGBlin) classifiers were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the combinations of BO-XGBdart and BO-SVR delivered the best model performance for estimating tropical forest height by combining lidar and hyperspectral data, with R2 = 0.53 and RMSE = 1.7 m (18.4% of nRMSE and 0.046 m of bias) for BO-XGBdart and R2 = 0.51 and RMSE = 1.8 m (15.8% of nRMSE and &minus;0.244 m of bias) for BO-SVR. Our study also demonstrated the effectiveness of BO for variables selection; it could reduce 95% of the data to select the 29 most important variables from the initial 516 variables from lidar metrics and hyperspectral data.},

The mathematical calculations of this study include the reproduction of EP with PSO. By minimizing the integral of the absolute error (IAE) criterion that is used for estimating the system response as a fitness function, the obtained integrated design of the fusion PSO&ndash;EP algorithm generated and updated the new elite parameters for proposed controller schemes. This progression was used for the complicated non-linear systems of the attitude-control pilot models of a tricopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to demonstrate an improvement on the performance in terms of rapid response, precision, reliability, and stability.},

ABSTRACT = {The complexity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) missions is increasing with the rapid development of UAV technology. Multiple UAVs usually cooperate in the form of teams to improve the efficiency of mission execution. The UAVs are equipped with multiple sensors with complementary functions to adapt to the complex mission constraints. Reasonable task assignment, task scheduling, and UAV trajectory planning are the prerequisites for efficient cooperation of multi-functional heterogeneous UAVs. In this paper, a multi-swarm fruit fly optimization algorithm (MFOA) with dual strategy switching is proposed to solve the multi-functional heterogeneous UAV cooperative mission planning problem with the criterion of simultaneously minimizing the makespan and the total mission time. First, the multi-swarm mechanism is introduced to enhance the global search capability of the fruit fly optimization algorithm. Second, in the smell-based search phase, the local search strategies and large-scale search strategies are designed to drive multiple fruit fly swarms, and the dual strategy switching method is presented. Third, in the vision-based search stage, the greedy selection strategy is adopted. Finally, numerical simulation experiments are designed. The simulation results show that the MFOA algorithm is more effective and stable for solving the multi-functional heterogeneous UAV cooperative mission planning problem compared with other algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Real time crowd analysis represents an active area of research within the computer vision community in general and scene analysis in particular. Over the last 10 years, various methods for crowd management in real time scenario have received immense attention due to large scale applications in people counting, public events management, disaster management, safety monitoring an so on. Although many sophisticated algorithms have been developed to address the task; crowd management in real time conditions is still a challenging problem being completely solved, particularly in wild and unconstrained conditions. In the proposed paper, we present a detailed review of crowd analysis and management, focusing on state-of-the-art methods for both controlled and unconstrained conditions. The paper illustrates both the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art methods. The methods presented comprise the seminal research works on crowd management, and monitoring and then culminating state-of-the-art methods of the newly introduced deep learning methods. Comparison of the previous methods is presented, with a detailed discussion of the direction for future research work. We believe this review article will contribute to various application domains and will also augment the knowledge of the crowd analysis within the research community.},

ABSTRACT = {In the present scenario for the development of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), artificial intelligence plays an important role in path planning and obstacle detection. Due to different environments, it is always a task to achieve the proper moment for achieving the target goal while avoiding obstacles with minimum human interference. To achieve the goal with the avoidance of obstacles, individual optimization techniques with metaheuristic algorithms such as fuzzy, particle swarm optimization (PSO), etc. were implemented in various configurations. However, the optimal solution was not attained. Thus, in order to achieve an optimal solution, a hybrid model was developed by using the firefly algorithm and the fuzzy algorithm, establishing multiple features of the individual controller. The path and time optimization were achieved by a standalone controller and a hybrid firefly&ndash;fuzzy controller in different conditions, whereby the results of the controller were validated by simulation and experimental results, highlighting the advantages of the hybrid controller over the single controller.},

To create an optimal mission plan and take appropriate decisions during the mission, a reliable, accurate and adaptive energy model is of utmost importance. However, most existing approaches either use very generic models or ones that are especially tailored towards a specific UAV. We present a generic energy model that is based on decomposing a robotic system into multiple observable components. The generic model is applied to a swarm of quadcopters and evaluated in multiple flights with different manoeuvres. We additionally use the data from practical experiments to learn and generate a mission-agnostic energy model which can match the typical behaviour of our quadcopters such as hovering; movement in x, y and z directions; landing; communication; and illumination. The learned energy model concurs with the overall energy consumption with an accuracy over 95% compared to the training flights for the indoor use case. An extended model reduces the error to less than 1.4%. Consequently, the proposed model enables an estimation of the energy used in flight and on the ground, which can be easily incorporated in autonomous systems and enhance decision-making with reliable input. The used learning mechanism allows to deploy the approach with minimal effort to new platforms needing only some representative test missions, which was shown using additional outdoor validation flights with a different quadcopter of the same build and the originally trained models. This set-up increased the prediction error of our model to 4.46%.},

ABSTRACT = {This article proposes a holistic localisation framework for underwater robotic swarms to dynamically fuse multiple position estimates of an autonomous underwater vehicle while using fuzzy decision support system. A number of underwater localisation methods have been proposed in the literature for wireless sensor networks. The proposed navigation framework harnesses the established localisation methods in order to provide navigation aids in the absence of acoustic exteroceptive sensors navigation aid (i.e., ultra-short base line) and it can be extended to accommodate newly developed localisation methods by expanding the fuzzy rule base. Simplicity, flexibility, and scalability are the main three advantages that are inherent in the proposed localisation framework when compared to other traditional and commonly adopted underwater localisation methods, such as the Extended Kalman Filter. A physics-based simulation platform that considers environment&rsquo;s hydrodynamics, industrial grade inertial measurement unit, and underwater acoustic communications characteristics is implemented in order to validate the proposed localisation framework on a swarm size of 150 autonomous underwater vehicles. The proposed fuzzy-based localisation algorithm improves the entire swarm mean localisation error and standard deviation by 16.53% and 35.17%, respectively, when compared to the Extended Kalman Filter based localisation with round-robin scheduling.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper considers the evolution of processes applied in agriculture for field operations developed from non-organized handmade activities into very specialized and organized production processes. A set of new approaches based on the application of metaheuristic optimization methods and smart automatization known as Agriculture 4.0 has enabled a rapid increase in in-field operations&rsquo; productivity and offered unprecedented economic benefits. The aim of this paper is to review modern approaches to agriculture machinery movement optimization with applications in sugarcane production.

ABSTRACT = {Because of low accuracy and density of crop point clouds obtained by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-borne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanning system of UAV, an integrated navigation and positioning optimization method based on the grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and a point cloud density enhancement method were proposed. Firstly, a global positioning system (GPS)/inertial navigation system (INS) integrated navigation and positioning information fusion method based on a Kalman filter was constructed. Then, the GOA was employed to find the optimal solution by iterating the system noise variance matrix Q and measurement noise variance matrix R of Kalman filter. By feeding the optimal solution into the Kalman filter, the error variances of longitude were reduced to 0.00046 from 0.0091, and the error variances of latitude were reduced to 0.00034 from 0.0047. Based on the integrated navigation, an UAV-borne LiDAR scanning system was built for obtaining the crop point. During offline processing, the crop point cloud was filtered and transformed into WGS-84, the density clustering algorithm improved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was employed to the clustering segment. After the clustering segment, the pre-trained Point Cloud Up-Sampling Network (PU-net) was used for density enhancement of point cloud data and to carry out three-dimensional reconstruction. The features of the crop point cloud were kept under the processing of reconstruction model; meanwhile, the density of the crop point cloud was quadrupled.},

ABSTRACT = {Predictably, future urban airspaces will be crowded with autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offering different services to the population. One of the main challenges in this new scenario is the design of collision-free navigation algorithms to avoid conflicts between flying UAVs. The most appropriate collision avoidance strategies for this scenario are non-centralized ones that are dynamically executed (in real time). Existing collision avoidance methods usually entail a high computational cost. In this work, we present Bounding Box Collision Avoidance (BBCA) algorithm, a simplified velocity obstacle-based technique that achieves a balance between efficiency and cost. The performance of the proposal is analyzed in detail in different airspace configurations. Simulation results show that the method is able to avoid all the conflicts in two UAV scenarios and most of them in multi-UAV ones. At the same time, we have found that the penalty of using the BBCA collision avoidance technique on the flying time and the distance covered by the UAVs involved in the conflict is reasonably acceptable. Therefore, we consider that BBCA may be an excellent candidate for the design of collision-free navigation algorithms for UAVs.},

ABSTRACT = {It is difficult for swarm robots to allocate tasks efficiently by self-organization in a dynamic unknown environment. The computational cost of swarm robots will be significantly increased for large-scale tasks, and the unbalanced task allocation of robots will also lead to a decrease in system efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic task allocation method of swarm robots based on optimal mass transport theory. The problem of large-scale tasks is solved by grouping swarm robots to complete regional tasks. The task reallocation mechanism realizes the balanced task allocation of individual robots. This paper solves the symmetric assignment between robot and task and between the robot groups and the regional tasks. Our simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can make the swarm robots self-organize to allocate large-scale dynamic tasks effectively. The tasks can also be balanced allocated to each robot in the swarm of robots.},

ABSTRACT = {Vehicular fog computing is attractive for sharing computing resources and data for safety and infortainment of self-driving cars. Recently, the V2X communication technology using mm-Wave frequency spectrum accelerates such future mobile computing with large bandwidth and beam-forming using a directional antenna. Although the beam-forming technique requires a complicate procedure for beam alignment, it can reduce mutual interference by spatial diversity. From the beam-forming scheduling, the vehicular fog can improve network performance, which is limited by data locations. Beams toward a vehicle for the same content should be scheduled in the time domain. Instead, we propose to replicate the content to multiple vehicles nearby to diversify beam directions. However, it is a challenge for vehicles to cache the content because the content caching costs not only limited local storage, but data transmission for other vehicles. For this, we adopt evolutionary game theory in which vehicles learn an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) from repeated games and maximize social utility. In this paper, we contribute to modeling a road segmentation for the mm-Wave V2X communication in order to derive connectivity probability with distributed content caches for the vehicular fog, and centralized and distributed algorithms for the evolutionary content cache game. From experiments, we confirm that content cache can improve V2X connectivity and the proposed evolution algorithm leads vehicles to choose the ESS for the content cache in the vehicular fog.},

ABSTRACT = {Herein, we present a methodology and framework for exploiting certain interdisciplinary studies that can particularly benefit from integration. In this paper, rigorous derivation of control theory and statistical analysis of simulation results are organically unified for testifying and optimizing the emergence of order in aerial swarming scenarios under free boundary conditions. Each Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is regulated by a simplified mathematical model, based on which a distributed flocking protocol is proposed as a feasible solution for aerial swarms. On condition that the initial interaction network is connected, the LaSalle&ndash;Krasovskii invariance principle is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the above algorithm. However, most existing results on flocking are far from being engineering applications. A basic challenge is how to present a low-cost energy and time saving solution on account of the limited flight capability of these UAVs and real-time operational requirements. As is well known, energy consumption can be reduced if unnecessary interactions among individuals are eliminated. Therefore, another contribution of this paper is to propose a precise optimization of an existing flocking algorithm for UAVs with respect to interaction requirements. Energy and time measurements, as well as scalability effects, are assessed in terms of statistical significance and strength. The results indicate that the flocking control protocol adopting the minimal interaction is the most promising swarm.},

ABSTRACT = {The challenge concerning the optimal allocation of tasks across multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) has significantly spurred research interest due to its contribution to the success of various fleet missions. This challenge becomes more complex in time-constrained missions, particularly if they are conducted in hostile environments, such as search and rescue (SAR) missions. In this study, a novel fish-inspired algorithm for multi-UAV missions (FIAM) for task allocation is proposed, which was inspired by the adaptive schooling and foraging behaviors of fish. FIAM shows that UAVs in an SAR mission can be similarly programmed to aggregate in groups to swiftly survey disaster areas and rescue-discovered survivors. FIAM&rsquo;s performance was compared with three long-standing multi-UAV task allocation (MUTA) paradigms, namely, opportunistic task allocation scheme (OTA), auction-based scheme, and ant-colony optimization (ACO). Furthermore, the proposed algorithm was also compared with the recently proposed locust-inspired algorithm for MUTA problem (LIAM). The experimental results demonstrated FIAM&rsquo;s abilities to maintain a steady running time and a decreasing mean rescue time with a substantially increasing percentage of rescued survivors. For instance, FIAM successfully rescued 100% of the survivors with merely 16 UAVs, for scenarios of no more than eight survivors, whereas LIAM, Auction, ACO and OTA rescued a maximum of 75%, 50%, 35% and 35%, respectively, for the same scenarios. This superiority of FIAM performance was maintained under a different fleet size and number of survivors, demonstrating the approach&rsquo;s flexibility and scalability.},

ABSTRACT = {The use of robotic systems in organic farming has taken on a leading role in recent years; the Sureveg CORE Organic Cofund ERA-Net project seeks to evaluate the benefits of strip-cropping to produce organic vegetables. This includes, among other objectives, the development of a robotic tool that facilitates the automation of the fertilisation process, allowing the individual treatment (at the plant level). In organic production, the slower nutrient release of the used fertilisers poses additional difficulties, as a tardy detection of deficiencies can no longer be corrected. To improve the detection, as well as counter the additional labour stemming from the strip-cropping configuration, an integrated robotic tool is proposed to detect individual crop deficiencies and react on a single-crop basis. For the development of this proof-of-concept, one of the main objectives of this work is implementing a robust localisation method within the vegetative environment based on point clouds, through the generation of general point cloud maps (G-PC) and local point cloud maps (L-PC) of a crop row. The plants&rsquo; geometric characteristics were extracted from the G-PC as a framework in which the robot&rsquo;s positioning is defined. Through the processing of real-time lidar data, the L-PC is then defined and compared to the predefined reference system previously deduced. Both subsystems are integrated with ROS (Robot Operating System), alongside motion planning, and an inverse kinematics CCD (Cyclic Coordinate Descent) solver, among others. Tests were performed using a simulated environment of the crop row developed in Gazebo, followed by actual measurements in a strip-cropping field. During real-time data-acquisition, the localisation error is reduced from 13 mm to 11 mm within the first 120 cm of measurement. The encountered real-time geometric characteristics were found to coincide with those in the G-PC to an extend of 98.6%.},

ABSTRACT = {Community detection is a hot research direction of network science, which is of great importance to complex system analysis. Therefore, many community detection methods have been developed. Among them, evolutionary computation based ones with a single-objective function are promising in either benchmark or real data sets. However, they also encounter resolution limit problem in several scenarios. In this paper, a Multi-Objective Pigeon-Inspired Optimization (MOPIO) method is proposed for community detection with Negative Ratio Association (NRA) and Ratio Cut (RC) as its objective functions. In MOPIO, the genetic operator is used to redefine the representation and updating of pigeons. In each iteration, NRA and RC are calculated for each pigeon, and Pareto sorting scheme is utilized to judge non-dominated solutions for later crossover. A crossover strategy based on global and personal bests is designed, in which a compensation coefficient is developed to stably complete the work transition between the map and compass operator, and the landmark operator. When termination criteria were met, a leader selection strategy is employed to determine the final result from the optimal solution set. Comparison experiments of MOPIO, with MOPSO, MOGA-Net, Meme-Net and FN, are performed on real-world networks, and results indicate that MOPIO has better performance in terms of Normalized Mutual information and Adjusted Rand Index.},

ABSTRACT = {Stochastic Configuration Network (SCN) has a powerful capability for regression and classification analysis. Traditionally, it is quite challenging to correctly determine an appropriate architecture for a neural network so that the trained model can achieve excellent performance for both learning and generalization. Compared with the known randomized learning algorithms for single hidden layer feed-forward neural networks, such as Randomized Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks and Random Vector Functional-link (RVFL), the SCN randomly assigns the input weights and biases of the hidden nodes in a supervisory mechanism. Since the parameters in the hidden layers are randomly generated in uniform distribution, hypothetically, there is optimal randomness. Heavy-tailed distribution has shown optimal randomness in an unknown environment for finding some targets. Therefore, in this research, the authors used heavy-tailed distributions to randomly initialize weights and biases to see if the new SCN models can achieve better performance than the original SCN. Heavy-tailed distributions, such as L&eacute;vy distribution, Cauchy distribution, and Weibull distribution, have been used. Since some mixed distributions show heavy-tailed properties, the mixed Gaussian and Laplace distributions were also studied in this research work. Experimental results showed improved performance for SCN with heavy-tailed distributions. For the regression model, SCN-L&eacute;vy, SCN-Mixture, SCN-Cauchy, and SCN-Weibull used less hidden nodes to achieve similar performance with SCN. For the classification model, SCN-Mixture, SCN-L&eacute;vy, and SCN-Cauchy have higher test accuracy of 91.5%, 91.7% and 92.4%, respectively. Both are higher than the test accuracy of the original SCN.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a family of indistinguishability operators, that we have called Yager Possibilitic Response Functions (YPRFs for short), as an appropriate tool for allocating tasks to a collective of agents. In order to select the best agent to carry out each task, we have used the so-called response threshold method, where each agent decides the next task to perform following a probabilistic Markov process and, in addition, involves a response function which models how appropriate the task is for the agent. In previous works, we developed a new response threshold method which incorporates the use of indistinguishability operators as response functions and possibility theory instead of probability, for task allocation from a very general perspective without taking into account the specific characteristics of the agents except their limitations to carry out a task. Such an allocation is modelled by means of possibilistic, instead of probabilisitic, Markov chains. We show that possibilistic Markov chains outperform its probabilistic counterparts for the aforementioned propose. All the indistinguishability operators considered in previous papers were not able to take into account the agents&rsquo; restrictions for moving from a task to another one, or equivalently to carry out a task instead of another one. In order to avoid this handicap, we introduce a new kind of response functions, YPRFs, which are modelled by means of indistinguishability operators obtained via Yager t-norms. This new type of response functions drops to zero when an agent, due to its limitations, is not able to execute a task and, therefore, is able to model a generic multi-agent system with restrictions. The performed simulation, under Matlab, allows us to compare the results obtained using the new YPRFs with those obtained applying celebrated response functions also generated via indistinguishability operators (that we call Original Possibilitic Response Functions, OPRFs for short). Moreover, the results confirm that the YPRFs are able to take into account agent&rsquo;s restrictions while the OPRFs are not able. Finally, in the light of the experimental results, we can confirm that those systems modelled.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper demonstrates a route selection mechanism on a testbed with heterogeneous device-to-device (D2D) wireless communication for a 5G network scenario. The source node receives information about the primary users’ (PUs’) (or licensed users’) activities and available routes from the macrocell base station (or a central controller) and makes a decision to select a multihop route to the destination node. The source node from small cells can either choose: (a) a route with direct communication with the macrocell base station to improve the route performance; or (b) a route with D2D communication among nodes in the small cells to offload traffic from the macrocell to improve spectrum efficiency. The selected D2D route has the least PUs’ activities. The route selection mechanism is investigated on our testbed that helps to improve the accuracy of network performance measurement. In traditional testbeds, each node (e.g., Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) that serves as the front-end communication block) is connected to a single processing unit (e.g., a personal computer) via a switch using cables. In our testbed, each USRP node is connected to a separate processing unit, i.e., raspberry Pi3 B+ (or RP3), which offers three main advantages: (a) control messages and data packets are exchanged via the wireless medium; (b) separate processing units make decisions in a distributed and heterogeneous manner; and (c) the nodes are placed further apart from one another. Therefore, in the investigation of our route selection scheme, the response delay of control message exchange and the packet loss caused by the operating environment (e.g., ambient noise) are implied in our end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio measurement. Our results show an increase of end-to-end delay and a decrease of packet delivery ratio due to the transmission of control messages and data packets in the wireless medium in the presence of the dynamic PUs’ activities. Furthermore, D2D communication can offload 25% to 75% traffic from macrocell base station to small cells.},

On a trail, ants use cooperative perception through chemotaxis to maintain a constant average velocity irrespective of their density, thereby avoiding traffic jams. Using model simulations and approximate mathematical representations, we analyzed various aspects of the communication system and their effects on cooperative perception in ant traffic. Based on the analysis, insights about the cooperative perception of ants which facilitate decentralized self-organization is presented. We also present values of communication-parameters in ant traffic, where the system conveys traffic conditions to individual ants, which ants use to self-organize and avoid traffic-jams. The mathematical analysis also verifies our findings and provides a better understanding of various model parameters leading to model improvements.},

ABSTRACT = {Aerial Robot Arms (ARAs) enable aerial drones to interact and influence objects in various environments. Traditional ARA controllers need the availability of a high-precision model to avoid high control chattering. Furthermore, in practical applications of aerial object manipulation, the payloads that ARAs can handle vary, depending on the nature of the task. The high uncertainties due to modeling errors and an unknown payload are inversely proportional to the stability of ARAs. To address the issue of stability, a new adaptive robust controller, based on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, is proposed. A three-tier approach is also followed. Firstly, a detailed new model for the ARA is derived using the Lagrange–d’Alembert principle. Secondly, an adaptive robust controller, based on a sliding mode, is designed to manipulate the problem of uncertainties, including modeling errors. Last, a higher stability controller, based on the RBF neural network, is implemented with the adaptive robust controller to stabilize the ARAs, avoiding modeling errors and unknown payload issues. The novelty of the proposed design is that it takes into account high nonlinearities, coupling control loops, high modeling errors, and disturbances due to payloads and environmental conditions. The model was evaluated by the simulation of a case study that includes the two proposed controllers and ARA trajectory tracking. The simulation results show the validation and notability of the presented control algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {We describe and analyze the Local Charged Particle Swarm Optimization (LCPSO) algorithm, that we designed to solve the problem of tracking a moving target releasing scalar information in a constrained environment using a swarm of agents. This method is inspired by flocking algorithms and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for function optimization. Four parameters drive LCPSO—the number of agents; the inertia weight; the attraction/repulsion weight; and the inter-agent distance. Using APF (Artificial Potential Field), we provide a mathematical analysis of the LCPSO algorithm under some simplifying assumptions. First, the swarm will aggregate and attain a stable formation, whatever the initial conditions. Second, the swarm moves thanks to an attractor in the swarm, which serves as a guide for the other agents to head for the target. By focusing on a simple application of target tracking with communication constraints, we then remove those assumptions one by one. We show the algorithm is resilient to constraints on the communication range and the behavior of the target. Results on simulation confirm our theoretical analysis. This provides useful guidelines to understand and control the LCPSO algorithm as a function of swarm characteristics as well as the nature of the target.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital twin (DT) plays a pivotal role in the vision of Industry 4.0. The idea is that the real product and its virtual counterpart are twins that travel a parallel journey from design and development to production and service life. The intelligence that comes from DTs’ operational data supports the interactions between the DTs to pave the way for the cyber-physical integration of smart manufacturing. This paper presents a conceptual framework for digital twins collaboration to provide an auto-detection of erratic operational data by utilizing operational data intelligence in the manufacturing systems. The proposed framework provide an interaction mechanism to understand the DT status, interact with other DTs, learn from each other DTs, and share common semantic knowledge. In addition, it can detect the anomalies and understand the overall picture and conditions of the operational environments. Furthermore, the proposed framework is described in the workflow model, which breaks down into four phases: information extraction, change detection, synchronization, and notification. A use case of Energy 4.0 fault diagnosis for wind turbines is described to present the use of the proposed framework and DTs collaboration to identify and diagnose the potential failure, e.g., malfunctioning nodes within the energy industry.},

ABSTRACT = {The study of multi-agent systems such as drone swarms has been intensified due to their cooperative behavior. Nonetheless, automating the control of a swarm is challenging as each drone operates under fluctuating wireless, networking and environment constraints. To tackle these challenges, we consider drone swarms as Networked Control Systems (NCS), where the control of the overall system is done enclosed within a wireless communication network. This is based on a tight interconnection between the networking and computational systems, aiming to efficiently support the basic control functionality, namely data collection and exchanging, decision-making, and the distribution of actuation commands. Based on a literature analysis, we do not find revision papers about design of drone swarms as NCS. In this review, we introduce an overview of how to develop self-organized drone swarms as NCS via the integration of a networking system and a computational system. In this sense, we describe the properties of the proposed components of a drone swarm as an NCS in terms of networking and computational systems. We also analyze their integration to increase the performance of a drone swarm. Finally, we identify a potential design choice, and a set of open research challenges for the integration of network and computing in a drone swarm as an NCS.},

ABSTRACT = {The openness of the environment brings great challenges to the swarm robotic system to cover the task area quickly and effectively. In this paper, a coverage method based on gradient and grouping (GGC) is proposed. What is novel about our proposed solution is that it is suitable for extremely simple robots that lack computing or storage power. Through the change of the robot gradient, the swarm robot system with very simple functions can effectively self-organize to cover the unknown task area. By grouping the swarm robots, each group can cover the task area in parallel, which greatly improves the coverage speed. We verified our proposed method through experimental simulation and found that the gradient and grouping-based method in this paper was superior to other methods in terms of coverage, coverage completion time, and other aspects. Simultaneously, the robustness of the proposed method is analyzed and admirable experimental results are obtained. Because the applicable robot is very simple, the method in this paper can be applied to the submillimeter swarm robot system, which will lay the foundation for micro medicine.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a novel online learning-based fault detection designed for underwater robotic thruster health monitoring. In the fault detection algorithm, we build a mathematical model between the control variable and the propeller speed by fitting collected online work status data to the model. To improve the accuracy of online modeling, a multi-center PSO algorithm with memory ability is utilized to optimize the modeling parameters. Additionally, a model online update mechanism is designed to accommodate the model to the change of thruster work status and sea environment. During the operation, propeller speed of the underwater robot is predicted through the online learning-based model, and the model residuals are used for thruster health monitoring. To avoid false alarm, an adaptive fault detection strategy is established based on model online update mechanism. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated using different underwater robotics, through a sea trial data simulation, a pool test fault detection experiment and a sea trial fault detection experiment. Compared with fixed model-based method, speed prediction MAE of the online learning model is at least 37.9% lower than that of the fixed model. The online learning-based method show no misdiagnosis in experiments, while the fixed model-based method is misdiagnosed. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and robustness.},

ABSTRACT = {Owing to automation trends, research on wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has become prevalent. In addition to static sinks, ground and aerial mobile sinks have become popular for data gathering because of the implementation of WSNs in hard-to-reach or infrastructure-less areas. Consequently, several data-gathering mechanisms in WSNs have been investigated, and the sink type plays a major role in energy consumption and other quality of service parameters, such as packet delivery ratio, delay, and throughput. However, the data-gathering schemes based on different sink types in WSNs have not been investigated previously. This paper reviews such data-gathering frameworks based on three different types of sinks (i.e., static, ground mobile, and aerial mobile sinks), analyzing the data-gathering frameworks both qualitatively and quantitatively. First, we examine the frameworks by discussing their working principles, advantages, and limitations, followed by a qualitative comparative study based on their main ideas, optimization criteria, and performance evaluation parameters. Next, we present a simulation-based quantitative comparison of three representative data-gathering schemes, one from each category. Simulation results are shown in terms of energy efficiency, number of dead nodes, number of exchanged control packets, and packet drop ratio. Finally, lessons learned from the investigation and recommendations made are summarized.},

ABSTRACT = {In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), a UAV is employed as a mobile sink to gather data from sensor nodes. Incorporating UAV helps prolong the network lifetime and avoid the energy-hole problem faced by sensor networks. In emergency applications, timely data collection from sensor nodes and transferal of the data to the base station (BS) is a prime requisite. The timely and safe path of UAV is one of the fundamental premises for effective UWSN operations. It is essential and challenging to identify a suitable path in an environment comprising various obstacles and to ensure that the path can efficiently reach the target point. This paper proposes a hybrid path planning (HPP) algorithm for efficient data collection by assuring the shortest collision-free path for UAV in emergency environments. In the proposed HPP scheme, the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) algorithm is used to design the shortest trajectory map and the optimized artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm to improve different path constraints in a three-dimensional environment. Our simulation results show that the proposed HPP outperforms the PRM and conventional ABC schemes significantly in terms of flight time, energy consumption, convergence time, and flight path.},

ABSTRACT = {The Internet of Things (IoT) enables the interrelation of physical things and devices that can be accessed through the internet and it simply forms a single integrated network of various things. An IoT-facilitated smart city scenario spans several sectors, such as industrial applications, public transportation, smart grid, emergency services, health care, etc. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Proficient Data Collection Approach (IPDCA) to deliver public data in a large-scale smart city set-up. IPDCA utilizes public vehicles as the mobile data collectors (D-collectors) that read (or collect) data from multiple Access Points (APs) and send them back to the central Base Station (BS). Moreover, IPDCA adopts a modified Bat algorithm for path finding of D-collectors, where we extend the Bat algorithm to solve our discrete optimization problem. Besides, for selecting D-collectors in smart city settings, we use a multi-objective fitness function that considers the count, travelled distance, and storage of D-collectors to ensure optimal use of resources. Efficiency of the proposed mechanism is proved through simulations.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an optimization algorithm named Random Explosion Algorithm (REA). The fundamental idea of this algorithm is based on a simple concept of the explosion of an object. This object is commonly known as a particle: when exploded, it will randomly disperse fragments around the particle within the explosion radius. The fragment that will be considered as a search agent will fill the local space and search that particular region for the best fitness solution. The proposed algorithm was tested on 23 benchmark test functions, and the results are validated by a comparative study with eight well-known algorithms, which are Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), Moth Flame Optimizer (MFO), Firefly Algorithm (FA), and Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA). After that, the algorithm was implemented and analyzed for a quadrotor control application. Similarly, a comparative study with the other algorithms stated was done. The findings reveal that the REA can yield very competitive results. It also shows that the convergence analysis has proved that the REA can converge more quickly toward the global optimum than the other metaheuristic algorithms. For the control application result, the REA controller can better track the desired reference input with shorter rise time and settling time, lower percentage overshoot, and minimal steady-state error and root mean square error (RMSE).},

ABSTRACT = {Swarm robotics is an emerging field that can offer efficient solutions to real-world problems with minimal cost. Despite recent developments in the field, however, it is still not sufficiently mature, and challenges clearly remain. The dynamic deadline problem is neglected in the literature, and thus, time-sensitive foraging tasks are still an open research problem. This paper proposes a novel approach—ED_Foraging—that allows simple robots with limited sensing and communication abilities to perform complex foraging tasks that are dynamic and time constrained. A new mathematical model is developed in this paper to utilize epidemiological modeling and predict the dynamics of resource deadlines. Moreover, an improved dynamic task allocation (DTA) method is proposed to assign robots to the most critical region, where a deadline is represented by a state and time. The main goal is to reduce the number of expired resources and collect them as quickly as possible by giving priority to those that are more likely to expire if not collected. The deadlines are unknown and change dynamically. Thus, the robots continuously collect local information throughout their journeys and allocate themselves dynamically to the predicted hotspots. In the experiments, the proposed approach is adapted to four DTA methods and tested with different setups using simulated foot-bot robots. The flexibility, scalability, and robustness of this approach are measured in terms of the foraging and expiration rates. The empirical results support the hypothesis that epidemiological modeling can be utilized to handle foraging tasks that are constrained by dynamic deadlines. It is also confirmed that the proposed DTA method improves the results, which were found to be flexible, scalable, and robust to changes in the number of robots and the map size.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, the time-varying formation tracking problem of the general linear multi-agent system is discussed. A distributed formation tracking protocol based on Riccati inequalities with adaptive coupling weights among the follower agents and the leader agent is designed for a leader-following multi-agent system under fixed and switching topologies. The formation configuration involved in this paper is expressed as a bounded piecewise continuously differentiable vector function. The follower agents will achieve the desired formation tracking trajectory of the leader. In traditional static protocols, the coupling weights depend on the communication topology and is a constant. However, in this paper, the coupling weights are updated by the state errors among the neighboring agents. Moreover, the stability analysis of the MAS under switching topology is presented, and proves that the followers also could achieve pre-specified time-varying formation, if the communication graph is jointly connected. Two numerical simulations indicate the capabilities of the algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Visible light communications (VLC) is gaining interest as one of the enablers of short-distance, high-data-rate applications, in future beyond 5G networks. Moreover, non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA)-enabled schemes have recently emerged as a promising multiple-access scheme for these networks that would allow realization of the target spectral efficiency and user fairness requirements. The integration of NOMA in the widely adopted orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based VLC networks would require an optimal resource allocation for the pair or the cluster of users sharing the same subcarrier(s). In this paper, the max-min rate of a multi-cell indoor centralized VLC network is maximized through optimizing user pairing, subcarrier allocation, and power allocation. The joint complex optimization problem is tackled using a low-complexity solution. At first, the user pairing is assumed to follow the divide-and-next-largest-difference user-pairing algorithm (D-NLUPA) that can ensure fairness among the different clusters. Then, subcarrier allocation and power allocation are solved iteratively through both the Simulated Annealing (SA) meta-heuristic algorithm and the bisection method. The obtained results quantify the achievable max-min user rates for the different relevant variants of NOMA-enabled schemes and shed new light on both the performance and design of multi-user multi-carrier NOMA-enabled centralized VLC networks.},

ABSTRACT = {This study proposes a collective motion and self-organization control of a swarm of 10 UAVs, which are divided into two clusters of five agents each. A cluster is a group of UAVs in a dedicated area and multiple clusters make a swarm. This paper designs the 3D model of the whole environment by applying graph theory. To address the aforesaid issues, this paper designs a hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm by merging the particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the multi-agent system (MAS). First, PSO only provides the best agents of a cluster. Afterward, MAS helps to assign the best agent as the leader of the nth cluster. Moreover, the leader can find the optimal path for each cluster. Initially, each cluster contains agents at random positions. Later, the clusters form a formation by implementing PSO with the MAS model. This helps in coordinating the agents inside the nth cluster. However, when two clusters combine and make a swarm in a dynamic environment, MAS alone is not able to fill the communication gap of n clusters. This study does it by applying the Vicsek-based MAS connectivity and synchronization model along with dynamic leader selection ability. Moreover, this research uses a B-spline curve based on simple waypoint defined graph theory to create the flying formations of each cluster and the swarm. Lastly, this article compares the designed algorithm with the NSGA-II model to show that the proposed model has better convergence and durability, both in the individual clusters and inside the greater swarm.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the parameter optimisation of the flight control system of a singlerotor medium-scale rotorcraft. The six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) nonlinear mathematical model of the rotorcraft is developed. This model is then used to develop proportional–integral–derivative (PID)-based controllers. Since the majority of PID controllers installed in industry are poorly tuned, this paper presents a comparison of the optimised tuning of the flight controller parameters using particle swarm optimisation (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimisation (ACO) and cuckoo search (CS) optimisation algorithms. The aim is to find the best PID parameters that minimise the specified objective function. Two trim conditions are investigated, i.e., hover and 10 m/s forward flight. The four algorithms performed better than manual tuning of the PID controllers. It was found, through numerical simulation, that the ACO algorithm converges the fastest and finds the best gains for the selected objective function in hover trim conditions. However, for 10 m/s forward flight trim, the GA algorithm was found to be the best. Both the tuned flight controllers managed to reject a gust wind of up to 5 m/s in the lateral axis in hover and in forward flight.},

This study aims to develop and compare four hybrid models using two well-known machine learning models, support vector regression (SVR) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), as well as two meta-heuristic models, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and simulated annealing (SA) to map wildland fires in Jerash Province, Jordan. For modeling, 109 fire locations were used along with 14 relevant factors, including elevation, slope, aspect, land use, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, soil texture, topographic wetness index (TWI), distance to drainage, and population density, as the variables affecting the fire occurrence. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. The findings indicated that SVR-based hybrid models yielded a higher AUROC value (0.965 and 0.949) than the ANFIS-based hybrid models (0.904 and 0.894, respectively).

To discuss the architecture of autonomous systems in the future, this paper reviews the developing progress of architectures from automation systems to autonomous systems. Firstly, the autonomy and autonomous systems in different fields are summarized. The article classifies and summarizes the architecture of typical automated systems and infer three suggestions for building an autonomous system architecture: extensibility, evolvability, and collaborability. Accordingly, this paper builds an autonomous waterborne transportation system, and the architecture is composed of the object layer, cyberspace layer, cognition layer, and application layer, the proposed suggestions made in the construction of the architecture are reflected in the inter-relationships at all layers. Through the cooperation of four layers, the autonomous waterborne transportation system can autonomously complete the system functions, such as system control and transportation service. In the end, the characteristics of autonomous systems are concluded, from which the future primary research directions and the challenges of autonomous systems are provided.},

ABSTRACT = {An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can greatly reduce manpower in the agricultural plant protection such as watering, sowing, and pesticide spraying. It is essential to develop a Decision-making Support System (DSS) for UAVs to help them choose the correct action in states according to the policy. In an unknown environment, the method of formulating rules for UAVs to help them choose actions is not applicable, and it is a feasible solution to obtain the optimal policy through reinforcement learning. However, experiments show that the existing reinforcement learning algorithms cannot get the optimal policy for a UAV in the agricultural plant protection environment. In this work we propose an improved Q-learning algorithm based on similar state matching, and we prove theoretically that there has a greater probability for UAV choosing the optimal action according to the policy learned by the algorithm we proposed than the classic Q-learning algorithm in the agricultural plant protection environment. This proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on datasets that are evenly distributed based on real UAV parameters and real farm information. The performance evaluation of the algorithm is discussed in detail. Experimental results show that the algorithm we proposed can efficiently learn the optimal policy for UAVs in the agricultural plant protection environment.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents a framework for planning a drone swarm mission in a hostile environment. Elements of the planning framework are discussed in detail, including methods of planning routes for drone swarms using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and methods of detecting potentially dangerous objects using EO/IR camera images and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Methods of detecting objects in the field are used in the mission planning process to re-plan the swarm’s flight paths. The route planning model is discussed using the example of drone formations managed by one UAV that communicates through another UAV with the ground control station (GCS). This article presents practical examples of using algorithms for detecting dangerous objects for re-planning of swarm routes. A novelty in the work is the development of these algorithms in such a way that they can be implemented on mobile computers used by UAVs and integrated with MILP tasks. The methods of detection and classification of objects in real time by UAVs equipped with SAR and EO/IR are presented. Different sensors require different methods to detect objects. In the case of infrared or optoelectronic sensors, a convolutional neural network is used. For SAR images, a rule-based system is applied. The experimental results confirm that the stream of images can be analyzed in real-time.},

ABSTRACT = {The issue of energy balancing in Wireless Sensor Networks is a pivotal one, crucial in their deployment. This problem can be subdivided in three areas: (i) energy conservation techniques, usually implying minimizing the cost of communication at the nodes since it is known that the radio is the biggest consumer of the available energy; (ii) energy-harvesting techniques, converting energy from not full-time available environmental sources and usually storing it; and (iii) energy transfer techniques, sharing energy resources from one node (either specialized or not) to another one. In this article, we survey the main contributions in these three areas and identify the main trending topics in recent research. A discussion and some future directions are also included.},

ABSTRACT = {As a typical cyber-physical system, networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received much attention in recent years. Emerging communication technologies and high-performance control methods enable networked UAVs to operate as aerial sensor networks to collect more complete and consistent information with significantly improved mobility and flexibility than traditional sensing platforms. One of the main applications of networked UAVs is surveillance and monitoring, which constitute essential components of a well-functioning public safety system and many industrial applications. Although the existing literature on surveillance and monitoring UAVs is extensive, a comprehensive survey on this topic is lacking. This article classifies publications on networked UAVs for surveillance and monitoring using the targets of interest and analyzes several typical problems on this topic, including the control, navigation, and deployment optimization of UAVs. The related research gaps and future directions are also presented.},

ABSTRACT = {Controlling the water quality of water supplies has always been a critical challenge, and water resource monitoring has become a need in recent years. Manual monitoring is not recommended in the case of large water surfaces for a variety of reasons, including expense and time consumption. In the last few years, researchers have proposed the use of autonomous vehicles for monitoring tasks. Fleets or swarms of vehicles can be deployed to conduct water resource explorations by using path planning techniques to guide the movements of each vehicle. The main idea of this work is the development of a monitoring system for Ypacarai Lake, where a fleet of autonomous surface vehicles will be guided by an improved particle swarm optimization based on the Gaussian process as a surrogate model. The purpose of using the surrogate model is to model water quality parameter behavior and to guide the movements of the vehicles toward areas where samples have not yet been collected; these areas are considered areas with high uncertainty or unexplored areas and areas with high contamination levels of the lake. The results show that the proposed approach, namely the enhanced GP-based PSO, balances appropriately the exploration and exploitation of the surface of Ypacarai Lake. In addition, the proposed approach has been compared with other techniques like the original particle swarm optimization and the particle swarm optimization with Gaussian process uncertainty component in a simulated Ypacarai Lake environment. The obtained results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed enhanced GP-based PSO in terms of mean square error with respect to the other techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {There is an important significance for human health in predicting atmospheric concentration precisely. However, due to the complexity and influence of contingency, atmospheric concentration prediction is a challenging topic. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid learning method to make point and interval predictions of PM2.5 concentration simultaneously. Firstly, we optimize Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) by opposition-based learning, fitness-based learning, and Lévy flight. The experiments show that the improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (FOSSA) outperforms SSA-based algorithms. In addition, the improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (FOSSA) is employed to optimize the initial weights of probabilistic forecasting model with autoregressive recurrent network (DeepAR). Then, the FOSSA–DeepAR learning method is utilized to achieve the point prediction and interval prediction of PM2.5 concentration in Beijing, China. The performance of FOSSA–DeepAR is compared with other hybrid models and a single DeepAR model. Furthermore, hourly data of PM2.5 and O3 concentration in Taian of China, O3 concentration in Beijing, China are used to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed FOSSA–DeepAR learning method. Finally, the empirical results illustrate that the proposed FOSSA–DeepAR learning model can achieve more efficient and accurate predictions in both interval and point prediction.},

ABSTRACT = {Flying safely in complex urban environments is a challenge for unmanned aerial vehicles because path planning in urban environments with many narrow passages and few dynamic flight obstacles is difficult. The path planning problem is decomposed into global path planning and local path adjustment in this paper. First, a branch-selected rapidly-exploring random tree (BS-RRT) algorithm is proposed to solve the global path planning problem in environments with narrow passages. A cyclic pruning algorithm is proposed to shorten the length of the planned path. Second, the GM(1,1) model is improved with optimized background value named RMGM(1,1) to predict the flight path of dynamic obstacles. Herein, the local path adjustment is made by analyzing the prediction results. BS-RRT demonstrated a faster convergence speed and higher stability in narrow passage environments when compared with RRT, RRT-Connect, P-RRT, 1-0 Bg-RRT, and RRT*. In addition, the path planned by BS-RRT through the use of the cyclic pruning algorithm was the shortest. The prediction error of RMGM(1,1) was compared with those of ECGM(1,1), PCGM(1,1), GM(1,1), MGM(1,1), and GDF. The trajectory predicted by RMGM(1,1) was closer to the actual trajectory. Finally, we use the two methods to realize path planning in urban environments.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown their superiority in military and civilian missions. In the face of complex tasks, many UAVs are usually needed to cooperate with each other. Therefore, multi-UAV cooperative target search has attracted more and more scholars’ attention. At present, there are many bionic algorithms for solving the cooperative search problem of multi-UAVs, including particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and differential evolution (DE). Pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm proposed in recent years. It has great advantages over other algorithms in convergence, robustness, and accuracy, and has few parameters to be adjusted. Aiming at the shortcomings of the standard pigeon colony algorithm, such as poor population diversity, slow convergence speed, and the ease of falling into local optimum, we have proposed chaotic disturbance pigeon-inspired optimization (CDPIO) algorithm. The improved tent chaotic map was used to initialize the population and increase the diversity of the population. The disturbance factor is introduced in the iterative update stage of the algorithm to generate new individuals, replace the individuals with poor performance, and carry out disturbance to increase the optimization accuracy. Benchmark functions and UAV target search model were used to test the algorithm performance. The results show that the CDPIO had faster convergence speed, better optimization precision, better robustness, and better performance than PIO.},

ABSTRACT = {Brain-storm optimization (BSO), which is a population-based optimization algorithm, exhibits a poor search performance, premature convergence, and a high probability of falling into local optima. To address these problems, we developed the adaptive mechanism-based BSO (ABSO) algorithm based on the chaotic local search in this study. The adjustment of the search space using the local search method based on an adaptive self-scaling mechanism balances the global search and local development performance of the ABSO algorithm, effectively preventing the algorithm from falling into local optima and improving its convergence accuracy. To verify the stability and effectiveness of the proposed ABSO algorithm, the performance was tested using 29 benchmark test functions, and the mean and standard deviation were compared with those of five other optimization algorithms. The results showed that ABSO outperforms the other algorithms in terms of stability and convergence accuracy. In addition, the performance of ABSO was further verified through a nonparametric statistical test.},

ABSTRACT = {Inaccurate electricity load forecasting can lead to the power sector gaining asymmetric information in the supply and demand relationship. This asymmetric information can lead to incorrect production or generation plans for the power sector. In order to improve the accuracy of load forecasting, a combined power load forecasting model based on machine learning algorithms, swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, and data pre-processing is proposed. Firstly, the original signal is pre-processed by the VMD–singular spectrum analysis data pre-processing method. Secondly, the noise-reduced signals are predicted using the Elman prediction model optimized by the sparrow search algorithm, the ELM prediction model optimized by the chaotic adaptive whale algorithm (CAWOA-ELM), and the LSSVM prediction model optimized by the chaotic sparrow search algorithm based on elite opposition-based learning (EOBL-CSSA-LSSVM) for electricity load data, respectively. Finally, the weighting coefficients of the three prediction models are calculated using the simulated annealing algorithm and weighted to obtain the prediction results. Comparative simulation experiments show that the VMD–singular spectrum analysis method and two improved intelligent optimization algorithms proposed in this paper can effectively improve the prediction accuracy. Additionally, the combined forecasting model proposed in this paper has extremely high forecasting accuracy, which can help the power sector to develop a reasonable production plan and power generation plans.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a single-copter localization system as a first step towards a scalable multihop drone swarm localization system. The drone was equipped with ultrawideband (UWB) transceiver modules, which can be used for communication, as well as distance measurement. The location of the drone was detected based on fixed anchor points using a single type of UWB transceiver. Our aim is to create a swarm localization system that enables drones to switch their role between an active swarm member and an anchor node to enhance the localization of the whole swarm. To this end, this paper presents our current baseline localization system and its performance regarding single-drone localization with fixed anchors and its integration into our current modular quadcopters, which was designed to be easily extendable to a swarm localization system. The distance between each drone and the anchors was measured periodically, and a specially tailored gradient descent algorithm was used to solve the resulting nonlinear optimization problem. Additional copter and wireless-specific adaptations were performed to enhance the robustness. The system was tested with a Vicon system as a position reference and showed a high precision of 0.2 m with an update rate of &lt;10 Hz. Additionally, the system was integrated into the FINken copters of the SwarmLab and evaluated in multiple outdoor scenarios. These scenarios showed the generic usability of the approach, even though no accurate precision measurement was possible.},

ABSTRACT = {Fifth-generation (5G) communication technology is intended to offer higher data rates, outstanding user exposure, lower power consumption, and extremely short latency. Such cellular networks will implement a diverse multi-layer model comprising device-to-device networks, macro-cells, and different categories of small cells to assist customers with desired quality-of-service (QoS). This multi-layer model affects several studies that confront utilizing interference management and resource allocation in 5G networks. With the growing need for cellular service and the limited resources to provide it, capably handling network traffic and operation has become a problem of resource distribution. One of the utmost serious problems is to alleviate the jamming in the network in support of having a better QoS. However, although a limited number of review papers have been written on resource distribution, no review papers have been written specifically on 5G resource allocation. Hence, this article analyzes the issue of resource allocation by classifying the various resource allocation schemes in 5G that have been reported in the literature and assessing their ability to enhance service quality. This survey bases its discussion on the metrics that are used to evaluate network performance. After consideration of the current evidence on resource allocation methods in 5G, the review hopes to empower scholars by suggesting future research areas on which to focus.},

ABSTRACT = {To ensure the continuity of electric power generation for photovoltaic systems, condition monitoring frameworks are subject to major enhancements. The continuous uniform delivery of electric power depends entirely on a well-designed condition maintenance program. A just-in-time task to deal with several naturally occurring faults can be correctly undertaken via the cooperation of effective detection, diagnosis, and prognostic analyses. Therefore, the present review first outlines different failure modes to which all photovoltaic systems are subjected, in addition to the essential integrated detection methods and technologies. Then, data-driven paradigms, and their contribution to solving this prediction problem, are also explored. Accordingly, this review primarily investigates the different learning architectures used (i.e., ordinary, hybrid, and ensemble) in relation to their learning frameworks (i.e., traditional and deep learning). It also discusses the extension of machine learning to knowledge-driven approaches, including generative models such as adversarial networks and transfer learning. Finally, this review provides insights into different works to highlight various operating conditions and different numbers and types of failures, and provides links to some publicly available datasets in the field. The clear organization of the abundant information on this subject may result in rigorous guidelines for the trends adopted in the future.},

The OSCAR data set is used to determine the marine currents and the differential evolution genetic filter is used to optimize the sweep direction of the lawnmower coverage and get the sweep angle for the maximum probability of containment. The position of the target is determined by a particle filter, where the particles are moved by the ocean currents and the final probabilistic distribution is obtained by fitting the particle positions to a Gaussian probability distribution. The differential evolution algorithm is then used to optimize the sweep direction that covers the highest probability of containment cells before the less probable ones. The algorithm is tested with a variety of parameters of the differential evolution algorithm and compared to other popular optimization algorithms.},

Part 3 presents the combined application of multisource data for road extraction. Evidently, different data acquisition techniques have unique advantages, and the combination of multiple sources can improve the accuracy of road extraction.

ABSTRACT = {This paper introduces a genetic algorithm (GA) and a beam tracing algorithm incorporated within a dual parallel computing framework to optimize urban aerial laser scanning (ALS) missions to maximize vertical façade data capture, as needed for many three-dimensional reconstruction and modeling workflows. The optimization employs a low-density point cloud from the site of interest as a spatial representation of the urban scene. The GA is suitable for LiDAR flight path optimization due to its capability of handling open-ended problems that have many solutions. However, GAs require evaluating a very large number of candidates. The use of an initial point cloud allows realistic modeling of the urban environment in the optimization at the cost of high data input volumes. To cope with the computational and data demands, a dual parallel computing framework was devised. The parallel computing framework consists of two layers of parallelization. In the upper layer, multiple evaluators work in parallel and in conjunction with a main multi-threading GA optimizer to perform GA operations and evaluate the flight paths. In the lower layer, to evaluate assigned flight paths, each evaluator distributes its data and computation to multiple executors, which can reside on multiple physical nodes of a distributed-memory computing cluster. In addition to parallelism, the data partitioning on the lower layer allows out-of-core computation. Namely, data partitions are efficiently transferred between disks and memory so that only relevant subsets of data are kept in the main memory. The objective of the proposed method is threefold: (1) search for flight paths that yield the highest numbers of vertical points, (2) create a means to explicitly consider the detailed spatial configuration of urban environments, and (3) assure that the proposed optimization strategy is fast and can scale to large problem sizes. Multiple experiments were conducted and demonstrated the success of the proposed method. Converged results were achieved after dozens of generations within two hours. Two flight paths identified by the GA as the most and the least optimal candidates were deployed in real flight missions. The optimal flight path captured 16% more vertical points than the least optimal one, slightly higher than the 13% predicted. Both layers of parallelization were efficient: 13.1/16 for the lower layer and 3.2/4 for the upper layer. The two complementary layers of parallelization allowed flexible and efficient use of distributed computing resources to reduce the runtime. The scalability of the proposed approach was successfully demonstrated up to a data size of 460 million points. The optimization results were realistic and aligned well with the test flight results.},

ABSTRACT = {There are generally many redundant and irrelevant features in high-dimensional datasets, which leads to the decline of classification performance and the extension of execution time. To tackle this problem, feature selection techniques are used to screen out redundant and irrelevant features. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a popular meta-heuristic algorithm with high exploration and low exploitation capacities. To balance between both capacities of the ABC algorithm, a novel ABC framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the solutions are first updated by the process of employing bees to retain the original exploration ability, so that the algorithm can explore the solution space extensively. Then, the solutions are modified by the updating mechanism of an algorithm with strong exploitation ability in the onlooker bee phase. Finally, we remove the scout bee phase from the framework, which can not only reduce the exploration ability but also speed up the algorithm. In order to verify our idea, the operators of the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) are introduced into the framework to enhance the exploitation capability of onlooker bees, named BABCGWO and BABCWOA, respectively. It has been found that these two algorithms are superior to four state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms using 12 high-dimensional datasets, in terms of the classification error rate, size of feature subset and execution speed.},

ABSTRACT = {A key challenge in human–swarm interaction is to design a usable interface that allows the human operators to monitor and control a scalable swarm. In our study, we restrict the interactions to only one-to-one communications in local neighborhoods between UAV-UAV and operator-UAV. This type of proximal interactions will decrease the cognitive complexity of the human–swarm interaction to O(1). In this paper, a user study with 100 participants provides evidence that visualizing a swarm as a heat map is more effective in addressing usability and acceptance in human–swarm interaction. We designed an interactive interface based on the users’ preference and proposed a controlling mechanism that allows a human operator to control a large swarm of UAVs. We evaluated the proposed interaction interface with a complementary user study. Our testbed and results establish a benchmark to study human–swarm interaction where a scalable swarm can be managed by a single operator.},

ABSTRACT = {Advances in robotic motion and computer vision have contributed to the increased use of automated and unmanned vehicles in complex and dynamic environments for various applications. Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have attracted a lot of attention from scientists to consolidate the wide use of USVs in maritime transportation. However, most of the traditional path planning approaches include single-objective approaches that mainly find the shortest path. Dynamic and complex environments impose the need for multi-objective path planning where an optimal path should be found to satisfy contradicting objective terms. To this end, a swarm intelligence graph-based pathfinding algorithm (SIGPA) has been proposed in the recent literature. This study aims to enhance the performance of SIGPA algorithm by integrating fuzzy logic in order to cope with the multiple objectives and generate quality solutions. A comparative evaluation is conducted among SIGPA and the two most popular fuzzy inference systems, Mamdani (SIGPAF-M) and Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (SIGPAF-TSK). The results showed that depending on the needs of the application, each methodology can contribute respectively. SIGPA remains a reliable approach for real-time applications due to low computational effort; SIGPAF-M generates better paths; and SIGPAF-TSK reaches a better trade-off among solution quality and computation time.},

ABSTRACT = {In view of the demand of location awareness in a special complex environment, for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multi base-station semi-passive positioning system, the hybrid positioning solutions and optimized site layout in the positioning system can effectively improve the positioning accuracy for a specific region. In this paper, the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) formula of a time difference of arrival (TDOA) and angles of arrival (AOA) hybrid location algorithm is deduced. Mayfly optimization algorithm (MOA) which is a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm is introduced, and a method to find the optimal station of the UAV airborne multiple base station’s semi-passive positioning system using MOA is proposed. The simulation and analysis of the optimization of the different number of base stations, compared with other station layout methods, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. MOA is less likely to fall into local optimum, and the error of regional target positioning is reduced. By simulating the deployment of four base stations and five base stations in various situations, MOA can achieve a better deployment effect. The dynamic station configuration capability of the multi-station semi-passive positioning system has been improved with the UAV.},

ABSTRACT = {UAV trajectory planning is one of the research focuses in artificial intelligence and UAV technology. The asymmetric information, however, will lead to the uncertainty of the UAV trajectory planning; the probability theory as the most commonly used method to solve the trajectory planning problem in uncertain environment will lead to unrealistic conclusions under the condition of lacking samples, while the uncertainty theory based on uncertain measures is an efficient method to solve such problems. Firstly, the uncertainties in trajectory planning are sufficiently considered in this paper; the fuel consumption, concealment and threat degree with uncertain variables are taken as the objective functions; the constraints are analyzed according to the maneuverability; and the uncertain multi-objective trajectory planning (UMOTP) model is established. After that, this paper takes both the long-term benefits and its stability into account, and then, the expected-value and standard-deviation efficient trajectory model is established. What is more, this paper solves the Pareto front of the trajectory planning, satisfying various preferences, which avoids the defects of the trajectory obtained by traditional model only applicable to a certain specific situation. In order to obtain a better solution set, this paper proposes an improved backbones particle swarm optimization algorithm based on PSO and NSGA-II, which overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional algorithm such as premature convergence and poor robustness, and the efficiency of the algorithm is tested. Finally, the algorithm is applied to the UMOTP problem; then, the optimal trajectory set is obtained, and the effectiveness and reliability of the model is verified.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we propose a secure blockchain-aware framework for distributed data management and monitoring. Indeed, images-based data are captured through drones and transmitted to the fog nodes. The main objective here is to enable process and schedule, to investigate individual captured entity (records) and to analyze changes in the blockchain storage with a secure hash-encrypted (SH-256) consortium peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The proposed blockchain mechanism is also investigated for analyzing the fog-cloud-based stored information, which is referred to as smart contracts. These contracts are designed and deployed to automate the overall distributed monitoring system. They include the registration of UAVs (drones), the day-to-day dynamic captured drone-based images, and the update transactions in the immutable storage for future investigations. The simulation results show the merit of our framework. Indeed, through extensive experiments, the developed system provides good performances regarding monitoring and management tasks.},

ABSTRACT = {Networks and graphs offer a suitable and powerful framework for studying the spread of infection in human and animal populations. In the case of a heterogeneous population, the social contact network has a pivotal role in the analysis of directly transmitted infectious diseases. The literature presents several works where network-based models encompass realistic features (such as contacts networks or host&ndash;pathogen biological data), but analytical results are nonetheless scarce. As a significant example, in this paper, we develop a multi-group version of the epidemiological SEIR population-based model. Each group can represent a social subpopulation with the same habits or a group of geographically localized people. We consider also heterogeneity in the weighting of contacts between two groups. As a simple application, we propose a simple control algorithm in which we optimize the connection weights in order to minimize the combination between an economic cost and a social cost. Some numerical simulations are also provided.},

A total of 171 accurate responses were received from the respondents. Ten hypotheses were developed and statistically verified using regression and correlation analytical techniques. The results reveal that the quality of customer services and awareness of IFIs had a direct and positive relationship with customer loyalty, which in turn was mediated by customer satisfaction. Perceptions about IFIs had a direct positive relation with customer satisfaction. However, the relation of perceptions and quality of service with customer loyalty and satisfaction in financial institutions through technology integration was found to be insignificant, even in the presence of customer satisfaction as a mediator.},

ABSTRACT = {Most current studies on multi-agent evolution based on deep learning take a cooperative equilibrium strategy, while interactive self-learning is not always considered. An interactive self-learning game and evolution method based on non-cooperative equilibrium (ISGE-NCE) is proposed to take the benefits of both game theory and interactive learning for multi-agent confrontation evolution. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is designed combining with multi-agent interactive self-learning, and the non-cooperative equilibrium strategy is well adopted within the framework of interactive self-learning, aiming for high evolution efficiency and interest. For assessment, three typical multi-agent confrontation experiments are designed and conducted. The results show that, first, in terms of training speed, the ISGE-NCE produces a training convergence rate of at least 46.3% higher than that of the method without considering interactive self-learning. Second, the evolution rate of the interference and detection agents reaches 60% and 80%, respectively, after training by using our method. In the three different experiment scenarios, compared with the DDPG, our ISGE-NCE method improves the multi-agent evolution effectiveness by 43.4%, 50%, and 20%, respectively, with low training costs. The performances demonstrate the significant superiority of our ISGE-NCE method in swarm intelligence.},

ABSTRACT = {The wide use of cooperative missions using multiple unmanned platforms has made relative distance information an essential factor for cooperative positioning and formation control. Reducing the range error effectively in real time has become the main technical challenge. We present a new method to deal with ranging errors based on the distance increment (DI). The DI calculated by dead reckoning is used to smooth the DI obtained by the cooperative positioning, and the smoothed DI is then used to detect and estimate the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) error as well as to smooth the observed values containing random noise in the filtering process. Simulation and experimental results show that the relative accuracy of NLOS estimation is 8.17%, with the maximum random error reduced by 40.27%. The algorithm weakens the influence of NLOS and random errors on the measurement distance, thus improving the relative distance precision and enhancing the stability and reliability of cooperative positioning.},

ABSTRACT = {Linear approximate segmentation and data compression of moving target spatio-temporal trajectory can reduce data storage pressure and improve the efficiency of target motion pattern mining. High quality segmentation and compression need to accurately select and store as few points as possible that can reflect the characteristics of the original trajectory, while the existing methods still have room for improvement in segmentation accuracy, reduction of compression rate and simplification of algorithm parameter setting. A trajectory segmentation and compression algorithm based on particle swarm optimization is proposed. First, the trajectory segmentation problem is transformed into a global intelligent optimization problem of segmented feature points, which makes the selection of segmented points more accurate; then, a particle update strategy combining neighborhood adjustment and random jump is established to improve the efficiency of segmentation and compression. Through experiments on a real data set and a maneuvering target simulation trajectory set, the results show that compared with the existing typical methods, this method has advantages in segmentation accuracy and compression rate.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) is utilized in the attitude control of a quadrotor aircraft to address the problem of attitude destabilization in flight control caused by parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. Considering the difficulty of optimizing the parameter of ADRC, a fractional-order fuzzy particle swarm optimization (FOFPSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters of ADRC for quadrotor aircraft. Simultaneously, the simulation experiment is designed, which compares with the optimized performance of traditional particle swarm optimization (PSO), fuzzy article swarm optimization (FPSO) and adaptive genetic algorithm-particle swarm optimization (AGA-PSO). In addition, the turbulent wind field model is established to verify the disturbance rejection performance of the controller. Finally, the designed controller is deployed to the actual hardware platform by using the model-based design method. The results show that the controller has a small overshoot and stronger disturbance rejection ability after the parameters are optimized by the proposed algorithm.},

ABSTRACT = {This study is concerned with developing a robust tracking control system that merges the optimal control theory with fractional-order-based control and the heuristic optimization algorithms into a single framework for the non-minimum phase pitch angle dynamics of Boeing 747 aircraft. The main control objective is to deal with the non-minimum phase nature of the aircraft pitching-up action, which is used to increase the altitude. The fractional-order integral controller (FIC) is implemented in the control loop as a pre-compensator to compensate for the non-minimum phase effect. Then, the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is introduced as an optimal feedback controller to this augmented model ensuring the minimum phase to create an efficient, robust, and stable closed-loop control system. The control problem is formulated in a single objective optimization framework and solved for an optimal feedback gain together with pre-compensator parameters according to an error index and heuristic optimization constraints. The fractional-order integral pre-compensator is replaced by a fractional-order derivative pre-compensator in the proposed structure for comparison in terms of handling the non-minimum phase limitations, the magnitude of gain, phase-margin, and time-response specifications. To further verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the LQR-FIC controller is compared with the pole placement controller as a full-state feedback controller that has been successfully applied to control aircraft dynamics in terms of time and frequency domains. The performance, robustness, and internal stability characteristics of the proposed control strategy are validated by simulation studies carried out for flight conditions of fault-free, 50%, and 80% losses of actuator effectiveness.},

Furthermore, an experimental evaluation of the proposed scheme using the industrial three-bar truss design problem is presented. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid scheme outperformed the baseline algorithms (mean rank for the hybrid BA-KH algorithm is 1.279 vs. 1.958 for KH and 2.763 for BA).},

ABSTRACT = {This paper represents how typical advanced engineering design can be structured using a set of parameters and objective functions corresponding to the nature of the problem. The set of parameters can be in different types, including integer, real, cyclic, combinatorial, interval, etc. Similarly, the objective function can be presented in various types including integer (discrete), float, and interval. The simulated annealing with crystallization heuristic can deal with all these combinations of parameters and objective functions when the crystallization heuristic presents a sensibility for real parameters. Herein, simulated annealing with the crystallization heuristic is enhanced by combining Bates and Gaussian distributions and by incorporating feedback strategies to emphasize exploration or refinement, or a combination of the two. The problems that are studied include solving an electrical impedance tomography problem with float parameters and a partially evaluated objective function represented by an interval requiring the solution of 32 sparse linear systems defined by the finite element method, as well as an airplane design problem with several parameters and constraints used to reduce the explored domain. The combination of the proposed feedback strategies and simulated annealing with the crystallization heuristic is compared with existing simulated annealing algorithms and their benchmark results are shown. The enhanced simulated annealing approach proposed herein showed better results for the majority of the studied cases.},

ABSTRACT = {With the widespread application of machine learning methods, the continuous improvement of forecast accuracy has become an important task, which is especially crucial for landslide displacement predictions. This study aimed to propose a novel prediction model to improve accuracy in landslide prediction, based on the combination of multiple new algorithms. The proposed new method includes three parts: data preparation, multi-swarm intelligence (MSI) optimization, and displacement prediction. In the data preparation, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) is adopted to separate the trend and periodic displacements from the observed cumulative landslide displacement. The frequency component and residual component of reconstructed inducing factors that related to landslide movements are also extracted by the CEEMD and t-test, and then picked out with edit distance on real sequence (EDR) as input variables for the support vector regression (SVR) model. MSI optimization algorithms are used to optimize the SVR model in the MSI optimization; thus, six predictions models can be obtained that can be used in the displacement prediction part. Finally, the trend and periodic displacements are predicted by six optimized SVR models, respectively. The trend displacement and periodic displacement with the highest prediction accuracy are added and regarded as the final prediction result. The case study of the Shiliushubao landslide shows that the prediction results match the observed data well with an improvement in the aspect of average relative error, which indicates that the proposed model can predict landslide displacements with high precision, even when the displacements are characterized by stepped curves that under the influence of multiple time-varying factors.},

ABSTRACT = {Everyday there are more disasters that require Humanitarian Supply Chain (HSC) attention; generally these problems are difficult to solve in reasonable computational time and metaheuristics (MHs) are the indicated solution algorithms. To our knowledge, there has not been a review article on MHs applied to HSC. In this work, 78 articles were extracted from 2016 publications using systematic literature review methodology and were analyzed to answer two research questions: (1) How are the HSC problems that have been solved from Metaheuristics classified? (2) What is the gap found to accomplish future research in Metaheuristics in HSC? After classifying them into deterministic (52.56%) and non-deterministic (47.44%) problems; post-disaster (51.28%), pre-disaster (14.10%) and integrated (34.62%); facility location (41.03%), distribution (71.79%), inventory (11.54%) and mass evacuation (10.26%); single (46.15%) and multiple objective functions (53.85%), single (76.92%) and multiple (23.07%) period; and the type of Metaheuristic: Metaphor (71.79%) with genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization as the most used; and non-metaphor based (28.20%), in which search algorithms are mostly used; it is concluded that, to consider the uncertainty of the real context, future research should be done in non-deterministic and multi-period problems that integrate pre- and post-disaster stages, that increasingly include problems such as inventory and mass evacuation and in which new multi-objective MHs are tested.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we designed a beacon-based hybrid routing protocol to adapt to the new forms of intelligent warfare, accelerate the application of unmanned vehicles in the military field, and solve the problems such as high maintenance cost, path failure, and repeated routing pathfinding in large-scale unmanned vehicle network communications for new battlefields. This protocol used the periodic broadcast pulses initiated by the beacon nodes to provide synchronization and routing to the network and established a spanning tree through which the nodes communicated with each other. An NS3 platform was used to build a dynamic simulation environment of service data to evaluate the network performance. The results showed that when it was used in a range of 5 ~ 35 communication links, the beacon-based routing protocol&rsquo;s PDR was approximately 10% higher than that of AODV routing protocol. At 5 ~ 50 communication links, the result was approximately 20% higher than the DSDV routing protocol. The routing load was not related to the number of nodes and communication link data and the protocol had better performance than traditional AODV and DSDV routing protocol, which reduced the cost of the routing protocol and effectively improved the stability and reliability of the network. The protocol we designed is more suitable for the scenarios of large-scale unmanned vehicle network communication in the future AI battlefield.},

ABSTRACT = {The effectiveness of the Wolf Pack Algorithm (WPA) in high-dimensional discrete optimization problems has been verified in previous studies; however, it usually takes too long to obtain the best solution. This paper proposes the Multi-Population Parallel Wolf Pack Algorithm (MPPWPA), in which the size of the wolf population is reduced by dividing the population into multiple sub-populations that optimize independently at the same time. Using the approximate average division method, the population is divided into multiple equal mass sub-populations whose better individuals constitute an elite sub-population. Through the elite-mass population distribution, those better individuals are optimized twice by the elite sub-population and mass sub-populations, which can accelerate the convergence. In order to maintain the population diversity, population pretreatment is proposed. The sub-populations migrate according to a constant migration probability and the migration of sub-populations are equivalent to the re-division of the confluent population. Finally, the proposed algorithm is carried out in a synchronous parallel system. Through the simulation experiments on the task assignment of the UAV swarm in three scenarios whose dimensions of solution space are 8, 30 and 150, the MPPWPA is verified as being effective in improving the optimization performance.},

ABSTRACT = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) support humans in performing an increasingly varied number of tasks. UAVs need to be remotely operated by a human pilot in many cases. Therefore, pilots require repetitive training to master the UAV movements. Nevertheless, training with an actual UAV involves high costs and risks. Fortunately, simulators are alternatives to face these difficulties. However, existing simulators lack realism, do not present flight information intuitively, and sometimes do not allow natural interaction with the human operator. This work addresses these issues through a framework for building realistic virtual simulators for the human operation of UAVs. First, the UAV is modeled in detail to perform a dynamic simulation in this framework. Then, the information of the above simulation is utilized to manipulate the elements in a virtual 3D operation environment developed in Unity 3D. Therefore, the interaction with the human operator is introduced with a proposed teleoperation algorithm and an input device. Finally, a meta-heuristic optimization procedure provides realism to the simulation. In this procedure, the flight information obtained from an actual UAV is used to optimize the parameters of the teleoperation algorithm. The quadrotor is adopted as the study case to show the proposal&rsquo;s effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {Expert systems are a form of highly understandable artificial intelligence that allow humans to trace the decision-making processes that are used. While they are typically software implemented and use an iterative algorithm for rule-fact network processing, this is not the only possible implementation approach. This paper implements and evaluates the use of hardware-based expert systems. It shows that they work accurately and can be developed to parallel software implementations. It also compares the processing speed of software and hardware-based expert systems, showing that hardware-based systems typically operate two orders of magnitude faster than the software ones. The potential applications that hardware-based expert systems can be used for and the capabilities that they can provide are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Accurate power load forecasting has an important impact on power systems. In order to improve the load forecasting accuracy, a new load forecasting model, VMD&ndash;CISSA&ndash;LSSVM, is proposed. The model combines the variational modal decomposition (VMD) data preprocessing method, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model. A multi-strategy improved chaotic sparrow search algorithm (CISSA) is proposed to address the shortcomings of the SSA algorithm, which is prone to local optima and a slow convergence. The initial population is generated using an improved tent chaotic mapping to enhance the quality of the initial individuals and population diversity. Second, a random following strategy is used to optimize the position update process of the followers in the sparrow search algorithm, balancing the local exploitation performance and global search capability of the algorithm. Finally, the Levy flight strategy is used to expand the search range and local search capability. The results of the benchmark test function show that the CISSA algorithm has a better search accuracy and convergence performance. The volatility of the original load sequence is reduced by using VMD. The optimal parameters of the LSSVM are optimized by the CISSA. The simulation test results demonstrate that the VMD&ndash;CISSA&ndash;LSSVM model has the highest prediction accuracy and stabler prediction results.},

ABSTRACT = {In this study, a set of different search strategies for locating submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) are investigated. This set includes pre-defined path planning (PPP), adapted random walk (RW), particle swarm optimisation (PSO), inertia Levy-flight (ILF), self-organising-migration-algorithm (SOMA), and bumblebee search algorithm (BB). The influences of self-localisation and communication errors and limited travel distance of the autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) on the performance of the proposed algorithms are investigated. This study shows that the proposed search strategies could not outperform the classic search heuristic based on full coverage path planning if all AUVs followed the same search strategy. In this study, the influence of self-localisation and communication errors was investigated. The simulations showed that, based on the median error of the search runs, the performance of SOMA was in the same order of magnitude regardless the strength of the localisation error. Furthermore, it was shown that the performance of BB was highly affected by increasing localisation errors. From the simulations, it was revealed that all the algorithms, except for PSO and SOMA, were unaffected by disturbed communications. Here, the best performance was shown by PPP, followed by BB, SOMA, ILF, PSO, and RW. Furthermore, the influence of the limited travel distances of the AUVs on the search performance was evaluated. It was shown that all the algorithms, except for PSO, were affected by the shorter maximum travel distances of the AUVs. The performance of PPP increased with increasing maximum travel distances. However, for maximum travel distances &gt; 1800 m the median error appeared constant. The effect of shorter travel distances on SOMA was smaller than on PPP. For maximum travel distances &lt; 1200 m, SOMA outperformed all other strategies. In addition, it can be observed that only BB showed better performances for shorter travel distances than for longer ones. On the other hand, with different search strategies for each AUV, the search performance of the whole swarm can be improved by incorporating population-based search strategies such as PSO and SOMA within the PPP scheme. The best performance was achieved for the combination of two AUVs following PPP, while the third AUV utilised PSO. The best fitness of this combination was 15.9. This fitness was 26.4% better than the performance of PPP, which was 20.4 on average. In addition, a novel mechanism for dynamically selecting a search strategy for an AUV is proposed. This mechanism is based on fuzzy logic. This dynamic approach is able to perform at least as well as PPP and SOMA for different travel distances of AUVs. However, due to the better adaptation to the current situation, the overall performance, calculated based on the fitness achieved for different maximum travel distances, the proposed dynamic search strategy selection performed 32.8% better than PPP and 34.0% better than SOMA.},

ABSTRACT = {Chemical industrial parks, which act as critical infrastructures in many cities, need to be responsive to chemical gas leakage accidents. Once a chemical gas leakage accident occurs, risks of poisoning, fire, and explosion will follow. In order to meet the primary emergency response demands in chemical gas leakage accidents, source tracking technology of chemical gas leakage has been proposed and evolved. This paper proposes a novel method, Outlier Mutation Optimization (OMO) algorithm, aimed to quickly and accurately track the source of chemical gas leakage. The OMO algorithm introduces a random walk exploration mode and, based on Swarm Intelligence (SI), increases the probability of individual mutation. Compared with other optimization algorithms, the OMO algorithm has the advantages of a wider exploration range and more convergence modes. In the algorithm test session, a series of chemical gas leakage accident application examples with random parameters are first assumed based on the Gaussian plume model; next, the qualitative experiments and analysis of the OMO algorithm are conducted, based on the application example. The test results show that the OMO algorithm with default parameters has superior comprehensive performance, including the extremely high average calculation accuracy: the optimal value, which represents the error between the final objective function value obtained by the optimization algorithm and the ideal value, reaches 2.464e-15 when the number of sensors is 16; 2.356e-13 when the number of sensors is 9; and 5.694e-23 when the number of sensors is 4. There is a satisfactory calculation time: 12.743 s/50 times when the number of sensors is 16; 10.304 s/50 times when the number of sensors is 9; and 8.644 s/50 times when the number of sensors is 4. The analysis of the OMO algorithm&rsquo;s characteristic parameters proves the flexibility and robustness of this method. In addition, compared with other algorithms, the OMO algorithm can obtain an excellent leakage source tracing result in the application examples of 16, 9 and 4 sensors, and the accuracy exceeds the direct search algorithm, evolutionary algorithm, and other swarm intelligence algorithms.},

ABSTRACT = {Bird damage to fruit crops causes significant monetary losses to farmers annually. The application of traditional bird repelling methods such as bird cannons and tree netting become inefficient in the long run, requiring high maintenance and reducing mobility. Due to their versatility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can be beneficial to solve this problem. However, due to their low battery capacity that equals low flight duration, it is necessary to evolve path planning optimization. A novel path planning optimization algorithm of UAVs based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented in this paper. This path planning optimization algorithm aims to manage the drone&rsquo;s distance and flight time, applying optimization and randomness techniques to overcome the disadvantages of the traditional systems. The proposed algorithm&rsquo;s performance was tested in three study cases: two of them in simulation to test the variation of each parameter and one in the field to test the influence on battery management and height influence. All cases were tested in the three possible situations: same incidence rate, different rates, and different rates with no bird damage to fruit crops. The field tests were also essential to understand the algorithm&rsquo;s behavior of the path planning algorithm in the UAV, showing that there is less efficiency with fewer points of interest, but this does not correlate with the flight time. In addition, there is no association between the maximum horizontal speed and the flight time, which means that the function to calculate the total distance for path planning needs to be adjusted. Thus, the proposed algorithm presents promising results with an outstanding reduced average error in the total distance for the path planning obtained and low execution time, being suited for this and other applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Here, we developed a method for detecting cyber security attacks aimed at spoofing the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Most methods for detecting UAV anomalies indicative of an attack use machine learning or other such methods that compare normal behavior with abnormal behavior. Such approaches require large amounts of data and significant &ldquo;training&rdquo; time to prepare and implement the system. Instead, we consider a new approach based on other mathematical methods for detecting UAV anomalies without the need to first collect a large amount of data and describe normal behavior patterns. Doing so can simplify the process of creating an anomaly detection system, which can further facilitate easier implementation of intrusion detection systems in UAVs. This article presents issues related to ensuring the information security of UAVs. Development of the GPS spoofing detection method for UAVs is then described, based on a preliminary study that made it possible to form a mathematical apparatus for solving the problem. We then explain the necessary analysis of parameters and methods of data normalization, and the analysis of the Kullback&mdash;Leibler divergence measure needed to detect anomalies in UAV systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The paper presents a new security aspect for a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET)-based IoT model using the concept of artificial intelligence. The Black Hole Attack (BHA) is considered one of the most affecting threats in the MANET in which the attacker node drops the entire data traffic and hence degrades the network performance. Therefore, it necessitates the designing of an algorithm that can protect the network from the BHA node. This article introduces Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), a new updated routing protocol that combines the advantages of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The combination of the SVM with ANN is the novelty of the proposed model that helps to identify the attackers within the discovered route using the AODV routing mechanism. Here, the model is trained using ANN but the selection of training data is performed using the ABC fitness function followed by SVM. The role of ABC is to provide a better route for data transmission between the source and the destination node. The optimized route, suggested by ABC, is then passed to the SVM model along with the node&rsquo;s properties. Based on those properties ANN decides whether the node is a normal or an attacker node. The simulation analysis performed in MATLAB shows that the proposed work exhibits an improvement in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), throughput, and delay. To validate the system efficiency, a comparative analysis is performed against the existing approaches such as Decision Tree and Random Forest that indicate that the utilization of the SVM with ANN is a beneficial step regarding the detection of BHA attackers in the MANET-based IoT networks.},

Combined with the path-planning method based on PCSI (parametric cubic-spline interpolation), an improved LOS (light of sight) method is proposed to design the controller and guide the robot to move along the desired path. The evaluation of the energy efficiency of robot locomotion is discussed. In particular, a pigeon-inspired optimization algorithm improved by quantum rules (QPIO) is proposed for dynamically selecting the gait parameters that maximize energy efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed controller enables the robot to accurately follow the curved path and that the QPIO algorithm is effective in improving robot energy efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {Antenna arrays have become an essential part of most wireless communications systems. In this paper, the unwanted sidelobes in the symmetric linear array power pattern are reduced efficiently by utilizing a faster simultaneous sidelobes processing algorithm, which generates nulling sub-beams that are adapted to control and maintain steep convergence toward lower sidelobe levels. The proposed algorithm is performed using adaptive damping and heuristic factors which result in learning curve perturbations during the first few loops of the reduction process and is followed by a very steep convergence profile towards deep sidelobe levels. The numerical results show that, using the proposed adaptive sidelobes simultaneous reduction algorithm, a maximum sidelobe level of &minus;50 dB can be achieved after only 10 iteration loops (especially for very large antenna arrays formed by 256 elements, wherein the processing time is reduced to approximately 25% of that required by the conventional fixed damping factor case). On the other hand, the generated array weights can be applied to practical linear antenna arrays under mutual coupling effects, which have shown very similar results to the radiation pattern of the isotropic antenna elements with very deep sidelobe levels and the same beamwidth.},

ABSTRACT = {In system science, a swarm possesses certain characteristics which the isolated parts and the sum do not have. In order to explore emergence mechanism of a large&ndash;scale electromagnetic agents (EAs), a neighborhood selection (NS) strategy&ndash;based electromagnetic agent cellular automata (EA&ndash;CA) model is proposed in this paper. The model describes the process of agent state transition, in which a neighbor with the smallest state difference in each sector area is selected for state transition. Meanwhile, the evolution rules of the traditional CA are improved, and performance of different evolution strategies are compared. An application scenario in which the emergence of multi&ndash;jammers suppresses the radar radiation source is designed to demonstrate the effect of the EA&ndash;CA model. Experimental results show that the convergence speed of NS strategy is better than those of the traditional CA evolution rules, and the system achieves effective jamming with the target after emergence. It verifies the effectiveness and prospects of the proposed model in the application of electronic countermeasures (ECM).},

ABSTRACT = {Ensemble learning of swarm intelligence evolutionary algorithm of artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the core research directions in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). As a representative member of swarm intelligence evolutionary algorithm, shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) has the advantages of simple structure, easy implementation, short operation time, and strong global optimization ability. However, SFLA is susceptible to fall into local optimas in the face of complex and multi-dimensional symmetric function optimization, which leads to the decline of convergence accuracy. This paper proposes an improved shuffled frog leaping algorithm of threshold oscillation based on simulated annealing (SA-TO-SFLA). In this algorithm, the threshold oscillation strategy and simulated annealing strategy are introduced into the SFLA, which makes the local search behavior more diversified and the ability to escape from the local optimas stronger. By using multi-dimensional symmetric function such as drop-wave function, Schaffer function N.2, Rastrigin function, and Griewank function, two groups (i: SFLA, SA-SFLA, TO-SFLA, and SA-TO-SFLA; ii: SFLA, ISFLA, MSFLA, DSFLA, and SA-TO-SFLA) of comparative experiments are designed to analyze the convergence accuracy and convergence time. The results show that the threshold oscillation strategy has strong robustness. Moreover, compared with SFLA, the convergence accuracy of SA-TO-SFLA algorithm is significantly improved, and the median of convergence time is greatly reduced as a whole. The convergence accuracy of SFLA algorithm on these four test functions are 90%, 100%, 78%, and 92.5%, respectively, and the median of convergence time is 63.67 s, 59.71 s, 12.93 s, and 8.74 s, respectively; The convergence accuracy of SA-TO-SFLA algorithm on these four test functions is 99%, 100%, 100%, and 97.5%, respectively, and the median of convergence time is 48.64 s, 32.07 s, 24.06 s, and 3.04 s, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, interest in mission autonomy related to Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles(UCAVs) for performing highly dangerous Air-to-Surface Missions(ASMs) has been increasing. Regarding autonomous mission planners, studies currently being conducted in this field have been mainly focused on creating a path from a macroscopic 2D environment to a dense target area or proposing a route for intercepting a target. For further improvement, this paper treats a mission planning algorithm on an ASM which can plan the path to the target dense area in consideration of threats spread in a 3D terrain environment while planning the shortest path to intercept multiple targets. To do so, ASMs are considered three sequential mission elements: ingress, intercept, and egress. The ingress and egress elements require a terrain flight path to penetrate deep into the enemy territory. Thus, the proposed terrain flight path planner generates a nap-of-the-earth path to avoid detection by enemy radar while avoiding enemy air defense threats. In the intercept element, the shortest intercept path planner based on the Dubins path concept combined with nonlinear programming is developed to minimize exposure time for survivability. Finally, the integrated ASM planner is applied to several mission scenarios and validated by simulations using a rotorcraft model.},

In this paper, we particularly focus on the motion control of the barking drones. To this end, a computationally efficient sliding mode based control algorithm is developed, which navigates the drones to track the moving boundary of the animals&rsquo; footprint and enables the drones to avoid collisions with others. Extensive computer simulations, where the dynamics of the animals follow Reynolds&rsquo; rules, show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
