The current study investigated the transfer of writing skills between genres by analyzing participants’ recount, information report, and persuasive writing samples at four time points: at the beginning of the academic year, immediately before genre-focused instruction, at the end of 9 weeks of instruction in a genre, and 9 weeks after the conclusion of instruction in a genre. Results from the study demonstrate that DHH students transfer genre-specific writing skills between genres.}

The role of question type is explored by comparing argument with adjunct questions and subject with object questions. Overall, production was found significantly more impaired than comprehension. The agrammatic participants had better performance on argument than on adjunct questions, while no dissociation was observed between subject and object questions. The overall difficulty with wh-questions indicates that the agrammatic participants had a deficit in syntactic movement or in handling CP, a finding which is compatible with other cross-linguistic results. Although this finding could be accounted for by existing hypotheses, an alternative account is proposed, according to which wh-questions are difficult to process because they are associated with LF-interpretable features, which increase their processing load. Finally, the preponderance of argument over adjunct questions reinforces the (double) dissociation between these two question types reported in the literature, while the lack of a dissociation between the subject- and the object-questions suggests that both question types involve syntactic movement to CP.}

abstract = {Objective
To study neurocognitive functions and behavior in children with a history of fetal growth restriction (FGR) with brain sparing. We hypothesized that children with FGR would have poorer outcomes on these domains.
Study design
Subjects were 12-year-old children with a history of FGR born to mothers with severe early-onset hypertensive pregnancy disorders (n = 96) compared with a normal functioning full term comparison group with a birth weight ≥2500 g (n = 32). Outcome measures were neurocognitive outcomes (ie, intelligence quotient, executive function, attention) and behavior.
Results
For the FGR group, the mean ratio of the pulsatility index for the umbilical artery/middle cerebral artery (UC-ratio = severity of brain sparing) was 1.42 ± 0.69. The mean gestational age was 31-6/7  ± 2-2/7 weeks. The mean birth weight was 1341  ± 454 g, and the mean birth weight ratio 0.68 ± 0.12. Neurocognitive outcomes were comparable between groups. Parents of children with FGR reported more social problems (mean T-score 56.6 ± 7.7; comparison 52.3 ± 4.3, P < .001, effect size = 1, 95% CI 0.52-1.46) and attention problems (mean T-score 57.3 ± 6.9; comparison 53.6 ± 4.2, P = .004, effect size = 0.88, 95% CI 0.42-1.33). UC-ratio was not associated with any of the outcomes, but low parental education and lower birth weight ratio were.
Conclusions
In this prospective follow-up study of 12-year-old children with a history of FGR and confirmed brain sparing, neurocognitive functions were comparable with the comparison group, but parent-reported social and attention problem scores were increased.}

In particular, such disruptions have been repeatedly observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. However, it remains unclear whether these deficits are language-specific and whether they are equally dissociable from other reported disturbances –viz., processing of object semantics. To address these issues, we administered linguistic, semantic, and executive function (EFs) tasks to two groups of non-demented PD patients, with and without mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI and PD-nMCI, respectively). We compared these two groups with each other and with matched samples of healthy controls. Our results showed that PD patients exhibited linguistic and semantic deficits even in the absence of MCI. However, not all domains were equally related to EFs and MCI across samples. Whereas EFs predicted disturbances of syntax and object semantics in both PD-nMCI and PD-MCI, they had no impact on action-verb and action-semantic impairments in either group. Critically, patients showed disruptions of action-verb production and action semantics in the absence of MCI and without any executive influence, suggesting a sui generis deficit present since early stages of the disease. These findings indicate that varied language domains are differentially related to the BG, contradicting popular approaches to neurolinguistics.}

Language mapping with high-gamma modulation (HGM) has compared well with electrical cortical stimulation mapping (ESM). However, there is limited prospective data about its functional validity. We compared changes in neuropsychological evaluation (NPE) performed before and 1-year after epilepsy surgery, between patients with/without resection of cortical sites showing HGM during a visual naming task.
Methods
Pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients underwent pre-surgical language localization with ESM and HGM using a visual naming task. Surgical decisions were based solely on ESM results. NPE difference scores were compared between patients with/without resection of HGM naming sites using principal component (PC) analysis. Follow-up NPE scores were modeled with resection group as main effect and respective pre-surgical score as a covariate, using analysis of covariance.
Results
Seventeen native English speakers (12 females), aged 6.5–20.2 years, were included. One year after epilepsy surgery, first PC score increased by (mean ± standard deviation) 14.4 ± 16.5 points in patients without resection, whereas it decreased by 7.6 ± 24.6 points in those with resection of HGM naming sites (p = 0.040). This PC score represented verbal comprehension, working memory, perceptual reasoning (Wechsler subscales); Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement; and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Subsequent analysis showed significant difference in working memory score between patients with/without resection of HGM naming sites (−15.2 points, 95% confidence limits −29.7 to −0.7, p = 0.041).
Conclusion
We highlight the functional consequences of resecting HGM language sites, and suggest that NPE of DRE patients should include comprehensive assessment of multiple linguistic and cognitive domains besides naming ability.}

Behavioral reaction time (RT) and electrophysiological responsiveness to visually displayed words and non-language images were measured in persons who differed in how much experience they had in reading English. The electrophysiological response was the recognition potential (RP). Behavioral RT and the latency of the RP to English words were both expected to depend upon how much English reading experience a person had. The short latency of the RP was expected to free it from the influence of non-perceptual factors that affect RT, such as speed/accuracy tradeoff. This expectation yielded the prediction that the behavioral and electrophysiological results would differ in a specific way. Long-time readers of English were expected to show shorter RP latency to English words than less experienced (China-educated) readers of English but no RP latency difference for non-language images, with which neither group had greater experience. In contrast, due to speed accuracy tradeoff, the China-educated subjects were expected to show longer RT for both the words and the non-language images. The prediction was confirmed. The amount of language experience that a person had showed a stronger relationship to RP latency than it did to RT. This helped to validate the use of the RP as a tool for investigating perception and demonstrated definite advantages that it has for studying acquired perceptual processes in humans.}

Sentence repetition abilities of 12 people with dementia, using an adapted error classification schema, were analyzed, along with digit span abilities, a measure frequently used to assess working memory capacity, to explore error patterns and correlations. Participants with semantic variant PPA showed the greatest performance on sentence repetition and digit span in comparison to the logopenic variant PPA and Alzheimer’s disease participants. Sentence repetition errors were characterized by middle omissions for semantic variant PPA, ending omissions and phonological errors for logopenic variant PPA, and ending omissions and unrelated word substitutions for Alzheimer’s disease.

Findings are discussed in relation to working memory capacity theories, specifically, the dual-component model.}

However, little is known about this relationship with predictive sentence processing in children or adults. We explore this question by comparing the degree to which an upcoming sentential theme is anticipated by combining information from a prior agent and action. 48 children, aged of 3 to 10, and 48 college-aged adults’ eye-movements were recorded as they heard a sentence (e.g., The pirate hides the treasure) in which the object referred to one of four images that included an agent-related, action-related and unrelated distractor image. Pictures were rotated so that, across all versions of the study, each picture appeared in all conditions, yielding a completely balanced within-subjects design. Adults and children quickly made use of combinatory information available at the action to generate anticipatory looks to the target object. Speed of anticipatory fixations did not vary with age. When controlling for age, individuals with higher vocabularies were faster to look to the target than those with lower vocabulary scores. Together, these results support and extend current views of incremental processing in which adults and children make use of linguistic information to continuously update their mental representation of ongoing language.}

Yet little is known about developmental changes in the processing of talker information. On one account, children have not yet learned to separate speech sound variability from talker-varying cues in speech, making them more sensitive than adults to talker variation. A different account is that children are less developed than adults at recognizing speech sounds and at recognizing talkers, and development involves protracted tuning of both recognition systems. The current research presented preschoolers and adults (N=180) with voices linked to two distinct cartoon characters. After exposure, participants heard each talker and selected which character was speaking. Consistent with the protracted tuning hypothesis, children were much less accurate than adults when talkers were matched on age, gender, and dialect (Experiments 1–3), even when prosody differed (Experiment 5). Children were highly accurate when voices differed in gender (Experiment 2) or age (mother vs. daughter; Experiment 6), suggesting that greater acoustic dissimilarity facilitated encoding. Implications for speech sound processing are discussed, as are the roles of language knowledge and the nature of talker perceptual space in talker encoding.}

Large variability in individual spoken language outcomes remains a persistent finding in the group of children with cochlear implants (CIs), particularly in their grammatical development.
Aims
In the present study, we examined the extent of delay in lexical and morphosyntactic spoken language levels of children with CIs as compared to those of a normative sample of age-matched children with normal hearing. Furthermore, the predictive value of auditory and verbal memory factors in the spoken language performance of implanted children was analyzed.
Methods & procedures
Thirty-nine profoundly deaf children with CIs were assessed using a test battery including measures of lexical, grammatical, auditory and verbal memory tests. Furthermore, child-related demographic characteristics were taken into account.
Outcomes & results
The majority of the children with CIs did not reach age-equivalent lexical and morphosyntactic language skills. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that lexical spoken language performance in children with CIs was best predicted by age at testing, phoneme perception, and auditory word closure. The morphosyntactic language outcomes of the CI group were best predicted by lexicon, auditory word closure, and auditory memory for words.
Conclusions
Qualitatively good speech perception skills appear to be crucial for lexical and grammatical development in children with CIs. Furthermore, strongly developed vocabulary skills and verbal memory abilities predict morphosyntactic language skills.}

Studies are not as conclusive regarding the localization of the underlying neural substrate for language in sequential language learners. Lateralization of the neural substrate for first and second language depends on a number of factors including proficiency and early experience with each language. Similar to humans learning speech, songbirds learn their vocalizations from a conspecific tutor early in development. Here, we show mirrored patterns of lateralization in the avian analog of the mammalian auditory cortex (the caudomedial nidopallium [NCM]) in sequentially tutored zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata​) in response to their first tutor song, learned early in development, and their second tutor song, learned later in development. The greater the retention of song from their first tutor, the more right-dominant the birds were when exposed to that song; the more birds learned from their second tutor, the more left-dominant they were when exposed to that song. Thus, the avian auditory cortex may preserve lateralized neuronal traces of old and new tutor song memories, which are dependent on proficiency of song learning. There is striking resemblance in humans: early-formed language representations are maintained in the brain even if exposure to that language is discontinued. The switching of hemispheric dominance related to the acquisition of early auditory memories and subsequent encoding of more recent memories may be an evolutionary adaptation in vocal learners necessary for the behavioral flexibility to acquire novel vocalizations, such as a second language.}

Diminished expression (DE) is a core sub-domain of negative symptoms construct in schizophrenia. There is limited, yet inconsistent data regarding DE and its associations with cognition, particularly in the early illness course. This study aimed to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships of DE with cognitive functions in first-episode schizophrenia utilizing a prospective design.
Method
Ninety-three Hong Kong Chinese aged 18 to 55years presenting with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were studied. Severity of DE was measured as sum of individual item scores indicative of affect flattening and alogia. Symptom evaluation was conducted at intake, after clinical stabilization of first psychotic episode, at 12, 24 and 36months. Cognitive functions were evaluated at clinical stabilization, 12, 24 and 36months.
Results
DE was significantly correlated with various cognitive functions in successive follow-up assessments. Regression analyses adjusting confounding effects of sex, pre-morbid adjustment, duration of untreated psychosis and chlorpromazine equivalents showed that DE was associated with performance on verbal fluency at 12 (p<0.01) and 24months (p<0.05), visual reproduction at 24 (p<0.05) and 36months (p<0.01), logical memory at 36months (p<0.05) and Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting test at 24 (p<0.05) and 36months (p<0.05). Neither cross-lagged associations between DE and cognition nor significant correlations between changes in these two domains over three years were observed.
Conclusions
DE and cognitive functions were correlated concurrently but no longitudinal associations between these two domains could be demonstrated. Our findings indicated that DE and cognitive impairment represented relatively independent domains of the illness with potentially distinctive therapeutic implications.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
Transdiagnostic mechanisms of change (txMOC) specific to cognitive behaviour therapy are poorly understood. Salkovskis (1996) proposed one such mechanism in terms of the shift towards an alternative, less negative view of their problems or cognitive flexibility. This hypothesis has been described as involving a shift in beliefs, from “theory A″ to “theory B”. The objective of this research was to evaluate this hypothesis.
Methods
Effectiveness of a novel txCBT and temporal changes in process and symptom measures were evaluated using a non-concurrent multiple baseline design and Tau-U calculations with thirteen participants (five with obsessive-compulsive disorder, two with panic disorder with agoraphobia and six with major depressive disorder). As a secondary analysis authors calculated Kendall's – Tau correlation between process and symptom measures, performed the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess treatment modules effect on negative thought and calculated Reliable change index (RCI).
Results
The txCBT was clearly effective for eight participants. The results varied dependent on the stimuli evaluated as negative or threatening. Level and trend of the ratings of belief in theory A followed the level and trend of symptom measures to a greater extent than the (inverse) level and trend of belief in theory B.
Limitations
Only thirteen participants were recruited and evaluated.
Conclusions
The results are consistent with the view that effective treatment may involve a txMOC characterized by the ability to shift from a relatively fixed negative view of their experience to a less negative psychologically focused alternative.}

abstract = {Two brain regions with established roles in reading are the posterior middle temporal gyrus and the posterior fusiform gyrus (FG). Lesion studies have also suggested that the region located between them, the posterior inferior temporal gyrus (pITG), plays a central role in word recognition. However, these lesion results could reflect disconnection effects since neuroimaging studies have not reported consistent lexicality effects in pITG. Here we tested whether these reported pITG lesion effects are due to disconnection effects or not using parallel Event-related Potentials (ERP)/functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. We predicted that the Recognition Potential (RP), a left-lateralized ERP negativity that peaks at about 200–250 msec, might be the electrophysiological correlate of pITG activity and that conditions that evoke the RP (perceptual degradation) might therefore also evoke pITG activity. In Experiment 1, twenty-three participants performed a lexical decision task (temporally flanked by supraliminal masks) while having high-density 129-channel ERP data collected. In Experiment 2, a separate group of fifteen participants underwent the same task while having fMRI data collected in a 3T scanner. Examination of the ERP data suggested that a canonical RP effect was produced. The strongest corresponding effect in the fMRI data was in the vicinity of the pITG. In addition, results indicated stimulus-dependent functional connectivity between pITG and a region of the posterior FG near the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) during word compared to nonword processing. These results provide convergent spatiotemporal evidence that the pITG contributes to early lexical access through interaction with the VWFA.}

abstract = {Background
Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) provides language maps in brain tumor patients. Yet, corresponding data on the visualization of language-related subcortical pathways is lacking. Therefore, this study evaluates the feasibility of nTMS-based diffusion tensor imaging fiber tracking (DTI FT) for subcortical language pathways by a fractional anisotropy (FA) protocol.
New method
DTI FT was performed in 37 patients suffering from left-sided perisylvian brain lesions based on nTMS data exclusively, using the FA-based protocol originally established for the corticospinal tract (CST) by Frey et al. (2012): minimum fiber length was 110mm and the highest individual FA value leading to visualization of white matter tracts was determined as the FA threshold (FAT). Then, deterministic DTI FT using an FA value of 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of the individual FAT (with 25% as an additional setting to the original protocol) was performed.
Results
Our approach visualized 9 language-related subcortical white matter pathways. By using 100% FAT, the mean percentage of visualized tracts was 13.5%, whereas DTI FT performed with 75%, 50%, and 25% FAT detected 30.6%, 61.3%, and 93.7% of language-related fiber tracts, respectively.
Comparison with existing methods
nTMS language mapping alone is not able to visualize subcortical language-related pathways.
Conclusions
This study shows that nTMS language maps are feasible for DTI FT of language-related pathways within the scope of a FAT-based protocol. Although this approach is novel and might be helpful during scientific neuroimaging and tumor resection, intraoperative validation is needed to go beyond the level of feasibility.}

Las tumoraciones cerebrales que se encuentran cerca o en áreas elocuentes siguen siendo un importante reto neuroquirúrgico. Existe consenso en la literatura respecto a que la realización de este tipo de cirugías con monitorización neurofisiológica nos permite conseguir resecciones mayores con una mayor seguridad y menor presencia de focalidades neurológicas permanentes. Sin embargo, la forma de realizar este tipo de monitorización, la definición exacta de área elocuente, la forma de realizar la cirugía con el paciente despierto o dormido es objetivo de un gran debate a nivel científico. Miembros del Grupo de Trabajo de Neurooncología (GTNO) de la Sociedad Española de Neurocirugía (SENEC) y miembros de la Sociedad Española de Neurofisiología Clínica (SENFC) han elaborado un documento de consenso con el objetivo de exponer las diferentes opciones de monitorización neurofisiológica que tenemos a día de hoy, tanto en el paciente despierto como en el dormido, para obtener mejores resecciones quirúrgicas preservando la función neurológica del paciente y se ha realizado una exhaustiva revisión bibliográfica.}

In the nonparametric model, it is assumed that schools aim to maximize educational attainments of students under a budget constraint. The results suggest that innovations are positively related to efficiency. We find that profiling, pedagogic, process and education chain innovations are significantly related to school efficiency, whereas innovations in the professionalization of teachers are insignificantly related to school efficiency. Furthermore, the number of locations per school and the number of schools per governing body are negatively and significantly related to school efficiency. School type and region significantly influence school efficiency, whereas share of disadvantaged students, degree of urbanization and student/teacher ratio do not have significant influence.}

Three major themes emerged: (a) perceived lack of readiness for transition, (b) fear of change and anxiety about entering the adult health care system, and (c) burgeoning personal responsibility that comes with age. Participants also offered suggestions to improve the transition experience, including starting the process early with specific guidelines. All patients and family caregivers wanted early knowledge about transition; these individuals could be an important resource to find potential solutions to guide the transition process. Clinical outcomes must be assessed in patients undergoing transition to determine the effect on management of medical disease, and protocols must be developed.}

Depressive disorders are common and disabling among perinatal women. The rates are high in ethnic minority groups. The causes are not known in British Pakistani women. The aim of this study was to estimate the rates, correlates and maintaining factors of perinatal depression in a Pakistani sample in UK. The design used was a cross-sectional two phase population based survey with a prospective cohort study.
Methods
All women in 3rd trimester attending antenatal clinic were screened with the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS). Women scoring 12 or more on EPDS and a random sample of low scorers were interviewed using the Schedules for Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) and the Life Events and Difficulties schedule (LEDS). Social support was assessed with the Multidimensional Scale for Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). They were reassessed 6months after the delivery using the same measures.
Results
The weighted prevalence of depression was 16.8%. Depressed mothers had more marked non health difficulties (housing, financial and marital). They had less social support and were socially isolated. Marked social isolation and marked non-health related difficulties were independent predictors of depression. Analyses of all the possible risk factors, comparing 26 persistent depressed with 27 depression resolved group showed significant differences in the MSPSS subscales between the two groups.
Limitations
The study lacked inter-rater reliability testing between the individuals carrying out diagnostic interviews. The study sample did not accurately represent the general population and information about the origins of depression in this group of mothers was limited.
Conclusion
Depression in British Pakistani mothers is associated with social isolation, poor social support and severe and persistent social difficulties. The findings will have implications in planning suitable services for this group.}

The results indicated that T1 morphological awareness contributed to T4 reading comprehension through T2 character recognition and T3 reading fluency, while the chain mediation effect of T2 vocabulary knowledge and T3 reading fluency was not significant. These findings suggest that morphological awareness significantly predicted reading comprehension via character recognition and reading fluency longitudinally.

The primary purpose of this study was to examine complex nonverbal response inhibition and stopping impulsivity in children who do (CWS) and do not stutter (CWNS).
Method
A total of 30 CWS and 30 CWNS between the ages of 3;1 and 6;0 (years; months) performed the Peg-Tapping Task (PTT; Diamond & Taylor, 1996; Luria, 1966), in which children were required to tap a dowel once when an examiner taps twice and vice versa. The main dependent variables were the number of practice trials, response accuracy, response latency for accurate responses, and the number of extra taps (i.e., tapping more than two times).
Results
The CWS were less accurate and slower on the PTT than the CWNS, with no differences in the number of practice trials. Furthermore, the CWS, especially boys, produced more extra taps than the CWNS.
Conclusions
Findings revealed that preschool CWS have weaknesses in complex response inhibition and stopping impulsivity in the nonverbal domain compared to CWNS. Taken together, these findings along with those of previous studies indicate that CWS may have weaknesses in inhibition and impulsivity in the nonverbal domain as well as the verbal domain, suggesting a domain-general weakness.}

The goal of this review is to challenge this view, that is, to move to a hodotopical approach to lesion mapping, on the basis of new insights provided by intraoperative electrostimulation mapping investigations in patients who underwent awake surgery for cerebral tumors. These original data reported in the last decade break with the traditional dogma of a modular and fixed organization of the central nervous system, by switching to the concepts of cerebral connectivity and plasticity – i.e., a brain organization based on dynamic interrelationships between parallel distributed networks. According to this revisited model, “frontal symptoms” can be generated by tumor or electrostimulation not only of the frontal lobes, but also of cortical and subcortical (white matter pathways/deep gray nuclei) structures outside the frontal lobes: especially, stimulation of the superior longitudinal fascicle may elicit speech production disorders, syntactic disturbances, involuntary language switching or phonemic paraphasia (arcuate fascicle), stimulation of the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle can generate semantic paraphasia or deficit of cross-modal judgment, stimulation of the subcallosal fasciculus may elicit transcortical motor aphasia, while stimulation of the striatum induces preservations. On the other hand, it is also possible to perform extensive right or left frontal lobectomy in patients who continue to have a normal familial, social and professional life, without “frontal syndrome”. Therefore, this provocative approach may open the door to a renewal in the modeling of brain processing as well as in its clinical applications, especially in the fields of cerebral surgery and functional rehabilitation. These findings illustrate well the need to reinforce links between cognitive neuroscience and clinical neurology/neurosurgery.}

Comparisons were made at two levels: general English and academic English. Data were acquired from 454 second- and third-year English L2 university students in Ghana, West Africa. Using two different mediation analyses, the study produced significant evidence for a two-mediator model at both levels. Morphological awareness is modelled as affecting academic achievement through four different pathways: indirectly through vocabulary, indirectly through reading comprehension, indirectly through vocabulary and reading comprehension sequentially, and directly. This shows that knowledge of morphology both directly and indirectly influences academic achievement at tertiary level in English L2 contexts.}

Since the 1980s, that assumption has been buttressed by numerous studies that detected declines in false memory between early childhood and young adulthood under controlled conditions. Fuzzy-trace theory predicted reversals of this standard developmental pattern in circumstances that are directly relevant to testimony because they involve using the gist of experience to remember events. That prediction has been investigated during the past decade, and a large number of experiments have been published in which false memories have indeed been found to increase between early childhood and young adulthood. Further, experimentation has tied age increases in false memory to improvements in children’s memory for semantic gist. According to current scientific evidence, the principle that children’s testimony is necessarily more infected with false memories than adults’ and that, other things being equal, juries should regard adults’ testimony as necessarily more faithful to actual events is untenable.}

The study included 156 participants with DSM-IV diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in the maintenance phase of treatment. Therapeutic alliance, recovery orientation, self-stigma, insight, adult attachment style, and depression were assessed by self-report. Symptoms were rated by interviewers. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that more recovery orientation, less self-stigma, and more insight independently were associated with a better quality of the therapeutic alliance. Clinical symptoms, adult attachment style, age, and the duration of treatment by current therapist were unrelated to the quality of the therapeutic alliance. Low recovery orientation and increased self-stigma might undermine the therapeutic alliance in schizophrenia beyond the detrimental effect of poor insight. Therefore in clinical settings, besides enhancing insight, recovery orientation, and self-stigma should be addressed.}

The present study explored the types and sociodemographic correlates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among PWE in Oman among attendees of a neurological unit at a tertiary care center. Data on the types of CAM were gathered from telephone interviews. The relevant demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were obtained from electronic medical records. Of the total of 101 participants, 73.3% were CAM users. The majority of these participants have not disclosed their CAM use to their allopathic health-care providers. The most common types of CAM reported were those falling under the ‘mind–body’ type (incantations and fumigation) and biologically based (herbal concoctions) or a combination of them. Compared to non-CAM users, a significant and greater proportion of CAM users attributed the etiology of their illness to nonbiomedical factors such as ‘evil eyes’ (P=0.04). The multivariate logistic regression model indicated that the use of CAM was highly associated with age of <30years (OR=3.09; 95% CI: 1.10, 5.46), unemployment (OR=2.04; 95% CI: 1.15, 6.39), having basic school education (OR=2.21; 95% CI: 0.83, 5.18), low family income (OR=1.52; 95% CI: 0.91, 2.11), and the presence of hypersalivation (OR=2.20; 95% CI: 1.01, 4.39). Further studies are needed to harmonize these two healing practices. On the whole, this study indicates that among attendees of tertiary care utilization, CAM is common among PWE in Oman. The most utilized type of CAM falls under the umbrella of mind–body practice.}

Families of 52 4-to-6 year-old children were randomly assigned to a 9-week, interactive, family-based intervention or no-contact control group. Children completed pre- and post-assessments of verbal and nonverbal cognition (n = 52), structural magnetic resonance imaging (n = 45), and home auditory recordings of language exposure (n = 39). Families who completed the intervention exhibited greater increases in adult-child conversational turns, and changes in turn-taking mediated intervention effects on language and executive functioning measures. Collapsing across groups, turn-taking changes were also positively correlated with cortical thickening in left inferior frontal and supramarginal gyri, the latter of which mediated relationships between changes in turn-taking and children’s language development. This is the first study of longitudinal neuroplasticity in response to changes in children’s language environments, and findings suggest that conversational turns support language development through cortical growth in language and social processing regions. This has implications for early interventions to enhance children’s language environments to support neurocognitive development.}

In this context, we report on a 51-year-old, right-handed male subject with a history of resolved developmental stuttering who presented with sudden onset stutter speech and left hemiparesis following an episode of right frontal stroke. The speech and language evaluation revealed apparently dysfluent speech. Unlike the people with neurogenic stuttering, our subject revealed clinical features suggestive of developmental stuttering. Combining our observations with the evidences from the previous neuroimaging studies of developmental stuttering as well as clinical studies of both neurogenic and (post-stroke) reappeared stuttering, we support the hypothesis on the compensatory role of the right frontal lobe in developmental stuttering. In addition to this, we extend the currently known neural substrates of stuttering to a novel area – the right frontal parafalcine region.}

abstract = {Rational & Objective
A key aspect of smooth transition to dialysis is the timely creation of a permanent access. Despite early referral to kidney care, initiation onto dialysis is still suboptimal for many patients, which has clinical and cost implications. This study aimed to explore perspectives of various stakeholders on barriers to timely access creation.
Study Design
Qualitative study.
Setting & Participants
Semi-structured interviews with 96 participants (response rate, 67%), including patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (n = 30), new hemodialysis patients with (n = 18) and without (n = 20) permanent access (arteriovenous fistula), family members (n = 19), and kidney health care providers (n = 9).
Analytical Approach
Thematic analysis.
Results
Patients reported differential levels of behavioral activation toward access creation: avoidance/denial, wait and see, or active intention. 6 core themes were identified: (1) lack of symptoms, (2) dialysis fears and practical concerns (exaggerated fear, pain, cost, lifestyle disruptions, work-related concerns, burdening their families), (3) evaluating value against costs/risks of access creation (benefits, threat of operation, viability, prompt for early initiation), (4) preference for alternatives, (5) social influences (hearsay, family involvement, experiences of others), and (6) health care provider interactions (mistrust, interpersonal tension, lack of clarity in information). Themes were common to all groups, whereas nuanced perspectives of family members and health care providers were noted in some subthemes.
Limitations
Response bias.
Conclusions
Individual, interpersonal, and psychosocial factors compromise dialysis preparation and contribute to suboptimal dialysis initiation. Our findings support the need for interventions to improve patient and family engagement and address emotional concerns and misperceptions about preparing for dialysis.}

The increasing importance of the dynamics of arbitrarily applicable relational responding (AARR), with regards to rules, has come to be of particular interest within Relational Frame Theory (RFT). One feature of AARR that previous research has suggested may differentially impact persistent rule-following is level of derivation. However, no published research to date has systematically explored this suggestion. Across two experiments, the impact of levels of derivation was examined on persistent rule-following at two stages of relational development: mutual entailment (Exp. 1) and combinatorial entailment (Exp. 2). A Training IRAP was used to establish a mutually entailed relational network in Experiment 1 and a combinatorially entailed network in Experiment 2, and to train these networks to different levels of derivation. This was followed by a contingency switching Match-to-Sample (MTS) task to assess rule persistence. Results from both experiments were generally consistent with the suggestion that lower levels of derivation produce more persistent rule-following. Unexpectedly, however, the findings from Experiment 1 also indicated that persistence was moderated by the type of novel word employed. Variations in results across both experiments and their implications for future research are discussed.}

We present a series of 12 neurosurgical cases with awake language mapping of the cortex near the left FAT. Tasks for language mapping included the commonly used action picture naming, and sentence completion, tapping more specifically into spontaneous speech. A task dissociation was found in 10 participants: while being stimulated on specific sites, they were able to name a picture but could not complete a sentence. Overlaying of these sites on preoperative white-matter tract reconstructions revealed that in each individual case they were located on cortical terminations of the FAT. This corroborates the language functional specificity of the left FAT as a tract underlying fluent spontaneous speech.}

abstract = {Objective
To examine the patterns of family dynamics that are most associated with the mental health of traumatic brain injury (TBI) caregivers from Mexico. It was hypothesized that healthier family dynamics would be associated with better caregiver mental health.
Design
A cross-sectional study of self-reported data collected from TBI caregivers through the Mexican National Institute of Rehabilitation in Mexico City, Mexico, the premier public medical facility in Mexico that provides rehabilitation services to patients with various disabilities.
Setting
One public outpatient medical and rehabilitation facility.
Participants
Sixty-eight caregivers of individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI from Mexico City, Mexico, were related to an individual with TBI who was ≥3 months after injury, a primary caregiver for ≥3 months, familiar with the patient's history, and without neurologic or psychiatric conditions. The average (standard deviation) age of caregivers was 50.94 ± 12.85 years), and 82% were women.
Methods
The caregivers completed Spanish versions of instruments that assessed their own mental health and family dynamics.
Main Outcome Measurements
Outcomes assessed included family dynamics (Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale—Fourth Edition; Family Communication Scale; Family Satisfaction Scale; Family Assessment Device—General Functioning; and Relationship-Focused Coping Scale), and caregiver mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Zarit Burden Interview, and Satisfaction with Life Scale).
Results
Results of canonical correlation analyses suggested that caregiver mental health and family dynamics were positively related, with a large effect size. Caregivers with high family satisfaction and cohesion tended to have a low burden and high satisfaction with life. In addition, caregiver depression and burden were positively related to each other and were both inversely related to caregiver satisfaction with life.
Conclusions
TBI caregiver interventions in Latino populations would likely benefit from including programming or techniques to improve family dynamics, especially family cohesion, given the strong potentially reciprocal influence of these dynamics on caregiver mental health.}

Intraoperative direct electrical stimulation (DES) is increasingly used in patients operated on for tumours in critical language areas. Although a positive impact of DES on postoperative linguistic outcome is generally advocated, the literature is only scantily documented with information about the linguistic methods applied in awake surgery. This article critically reviews the neurolinguistic procedures currently used in awake studies.
Methods
Based on an extensive review of the literature, an overview is given of the language mapping techniques applied in brain tumour surgery. Studies investigating linguistic testing and outcome in awake surgery were analysed. Information about the timing of the assessment(s), the linguistic tasks, the linguistic stimuli and the indication for awake surgery was also discussed.
Results
Intraoperative DES remains the ‘gold standard’ for language mapping, but pre- and postoperative non-invasive mapping methods are important adjuncts. In the pre- and postoperative phase, standardised linguistic test batteries are generally used to assess language function. In the intraoperative phase, only naming and number counting are commonly applied. Most often no detailed information about the linguistic stimuli is provided and no standardised protocols measuring different linguistic levels have been described.
Conclusions
Awake surgery with DES is a useful tool for preserving linguistic functions in patients undergoing surgery in critical brain regions. However, no studies exist that apply a well-balanced and standardised linguistic protocol to reliably identify the critical language zones. The availability of a standardised linguistic protocol might substantially increase intraoperative comfort and might improve outcome and quality of life.}

All subtests presented an increase in difficulty as the number of to-be-remembered items raised, and showed high Cronbach's α values. Regarding validity, all subtests had medium to high and significant correlations among them, and with two external measures of working memory (Picture Span and Word Order) and an executive function task (Tower of London); correlations with Block Design were low and non-significant.

This is crucial, particularly in studies of spoken word recognition, where the displayed images are usually seen as just a part of the measure and are not of fundamental interest. Many variants of the VWP allow participants to sample the visual scene before a trial begins. However, this could bias their interpretations of the later speech or even lead to abnormal processing strategies (e.g., comparing the input to only preactivated working memory representations). Prior work has focused only on whether preview duration changes fixation patterns. However, preview could affect a number of processes, such as visual search, that would not challenge the interpretation of the VWP. The present study uses a series of targeted manipulations of the preview period to ask if preview alters looking behavior during a trial, and why. Results show that evidence of incremental processing and phonological competition seen in the VWP are not dependent on preview, and are not enhanced by manipulations that directly encourage phonological prenaming. Moreover, some forms of preview can eliminate nuisance variance deriving from object recognition and visual search demands in order to produce a more sensitive measure of linguistic processing. These results deepen our understanding of how the visual scene interacts with language processing to drive fixations patterns in the VWP, and reinforce the value of the VWP as a tool for measuring real-time language processing.

In particular, on the basis of recent Italian studies and our databank, we observe that : 1) school measures should be used for deriving IQ indices only in cases where contextual variables are not crucial: there is evidence that partialling out the role of contextual variables may lead to reduction or even elimination of PISA differences; in particular, schooling effects are shown through different sets of data obtained for younger grades; 2) in the case of South Italy, the PISA data may have exaggerated the differences, since data obtained with tasks similar to the PISA tasks (MT-advanced) show smaller differences; 3) national official data, obtained by INVALSI (2009a) on large numbers of primary school children, support these conclusions, suggesting that schooling may have a critical role; 4) purer measures of IQ obtained during the standardisation of Raven's Progressive Coloured Matrices also show no significant differences in IQ between children from South and North Italy.}

Consistent with the critical period hypothesis, group differences revealed that while native speakers elicited a biphasic N400-P600 in response to ungrammatical sentences, L2 learners as a group only elicited an N400. However, individual data modeling using a Random Forests approach revealed that language exposure and proficiency are the most reliable predictors in explaining ERP responses, with N400 and P600 effects becoming larger as exposure to French as well as proficiency increased, as predicted by the convergence hypothesis.}

abstract = {Objective
The Internet has become a platform to express individual moods/feelings of daily life, where authors share their thoughts in web blogs, micro-blogs, forums, bulletin board systems or other media. In this work, we investigate text-mining technology to analyze and predict the depression tendency of web posts.
Methods
In this paper, we defined depression factors, which include negative events, negative emotions, symptoms, and negative thoughts from web posts. We proposed an enhanced event extraction (E3) method to automatically extract negative event terms. In addition, we also proposed an event-driven depression tendency warning (EDDTW) model to predict the depression tendency of web bloggers or post authors by analyzing their posted articles.
Results
We compare the performance among the proposed EDDTW model, negative emotion evaluation (NEE) model, and the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-based depression tendency evaluation method. The EDDTW model obtains the best recall rate and F-measure at 0.668 and 0.624, respectively, while the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-based method achieves the best precision rate of 0.666. The main reason is that our enhanced event extraction method can increase recall rate by enlarging the negative event lexicon at the expense of precision. Our EDDTW model can also be used to track the change or trend of depression tendency for each post author. The depression tendency trend can help doctors to diagnose and even track depression of web post authors more efficiently.
Conclusions
This paper presents an E3 method to automatically extract negative event terms in web posts. We also proposed a new EDDTW model to predict the depression tendency of web posts and possibly help bloggers or post authors to early detect major depressive disorder.}

Recent advances in in-vivo foetal neuroimaging have contributed to a finely detailed picture of the anatomo-functional hallmarks that define the prenatal neurodevelopment of auditory and language-related networks. Here, we first outline available evidence for the prenatal development of auditory and language-related brain structures and of their anatomical connections. Second, we focus on functional connectivity data showing the emergence of auditory and primordial language networks in the foetal brain. Third, we recapitulate functional neuroimaging studies assessing the prenatal readiness for sound processing, as a crucial prerequisite for the foetus to experientially respond to spoken language. In conclusion, we suggest that the state of the art has reached sufficient maturity to directly assess the neural mechanisms underlying the prenatal readiness for speech processing and to evaluate whether foetal neuromarkers can predict the postnatal development of language acquisition abilities and disabilities.}

Performance of patients with left MTLE and that of patients with FLE were equally poor across language measures. Performance of patients with right MTLE was intact. Depression and anxiety differentially moderated performance. Anxiety was associated with better performance in patients with FLE on classically temporal lobe-mediated tasks (Boston Naming Test). Depression was associated with worse language performance on measures for which impaired performance was traditionally intrinsic to the underlying epileptogenic lesion (word fluency in FLE). Emotional distress influences language performance. Adequate treatment of mood should be considered when managing pharmacoresistant epilepsy.}

The difference can be predicted by taking into account the length of the words, with longer words in non-fiction than in fiction. The estimates are lower than the numbers often cited in scientific and popular writings. The reasons for the overestimates are reviewed. The average oral reading rate (based on 77 studies and 5965 participants) is 183 wpm. Reading rates are lower for children, old adults, and readers with English as second language. The reading rates are in line with maximum listening speed and do not require the assumption of reading-specific language processing. Within each group/task there are reliable individual differences, which are not yet fully understood. For silent reading of English non-fiction most adults fall in the range of 175–300 wpm; for fiction the range is 200–320 wpm. Reading rates in other languages can be predicted reasonably well by taking into account the number of words these languages require to convey the same message as in English.}

Nevertheless, it cannot be completely ruled out that the BG may be involved in language in some domain-specific manner. The present study aimed to investigate one type of cognitive control—sequencing, a function that has long been connected with the BG—and to test whether the BG could be specifically implicated in language. Participants were required to rearrange materials sequentially based on linguistic (syntactic or conceptual) or non-linguistic (order switching) rules, or to repeat a previously ordered sequence as a control task. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed a strongly active left-lateralized corticostriatal network, encompassing the anterior striatum, dorsolaterial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and presupplementary motor area, while the participants were sequencing materials using linguistic vs. non-linguistic rules. This functional network has an anatomical basis and is strikingly similar to the well-known associative loop implicated in sensorimotor sequence learning. We concluded that the anterior striatum has extended its original sequencing role and worked in concert with frontal cortical regions to subserve the function of linguistic sequencing in a domain-specific manner.}

Linguistic function is one of vulnerable aspects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) which may have destructive effects on patients' communicative activities and daily life, years following trauma. This paper attempts to answer the controversy whether surgery affects increase and decrease of linguistic impairment or not.
Materials and methods
Two hundred forty-one TBI patients aged 18–65 with abnormal CT findings and at least 20 minute post-trauma amnesia (PTA), who were conscious at discharge, participated in this study. Based on operative intervention, the samples were divided into two groups: operative and nonoperative. Cognitive and aphasic deficits were inspected formally and pragmatic disorder was informally appraised at discharge.
Results
The groups had no significant differences in aphasia incidence and language pragmatic impairment, though they were significantly distinctive in aphasia subcategories and cognitive deficit after trauma. Fluent aphasia was more common in both groups alike. In aphasia subcategories, however, transcortical sensory aphasia (TSA) in operative and anomia in nonoperative group were the most prevalent. Several variables appeared strikingly related to higher aphasia in operative groups as follows: moderate to severe injury, 18–35 and over 50years of age, more than 1week PTA, intracranial surgery of multiple lesions in left or bilateral hemisphere fronto-temporal cortex plus post-trauma cognitive and pragmatic impairments, and diffuse axonal injuries.
Discussion
Almost certainly, meaningful drop of cognitive function post surgery roots back in significant loss of initial consciousness level. Related factors to postoperative aphasia suggest taking policies through surgery intervention. Discerning the indispensable contributions of neurosurgeons, neurolinguists, and neuroscientists, results inspire more clinical future studies.}

In this study, we prospectively followed up 93 patients aged 18–55 years presented with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder for 3 years with an aim to identify early clinical and cognitive predictors of vocational outcome. Pre-morbid adjustment, baseline symptomatology and cognitive functions, and employment outcome were assessed. Result indicated that approximately half of the patients (53.8%) were engaged in full-time work at intake and at 3 years. Pre-morbid adjustment, baseline occupational status and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) performance were found to predict vocational outcome. Analysis on a subgroup of patients who were unemployed at intake showed that subjects who remained unemployed over 3 years had poorer WCST performance and more severe positive symptoms at baseline than those having job attainment during follow-up. Our results thus confirmed predictive value of pre-morbid functioning and baseline occupational status on vocational outcome. In addition, our findings suggested that executive function might be a critical cognitive determinant of employment outcome in the early course of schizophrenia.}

The participants were 125 preschoolers (aged 3;0–6;1). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found that two factors, respectively loading language and drawing measures, were correlated, also controlling for age. Regression analyses indicated that working memory and inhibition tasks predicted language, and inhibition tasks predicted drawing, above and beyond age. Structural equation modeling supported a model, according to which indirect influence of working memory and direct influence of executive functions fully accounted for the correlation between drawing and language. This suggests that the intertwining of language and drawing development in preschoolers depends on the development of domain-general components of the cognitive system.}

Recent neurophysiological research on word form acquisition in adults indicates that novel words can be acquired within minutes of repetitive exposure to them, regardless of the individual's focused attention on the speech input. Although it is well-known that children surpass adults in language acquisition, the developmental aspects of such rapid and automatic neural acquisition mechanisms remain unexplored. To address this open question, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to scrutinise brain dynamics elicited by spoken words and word-like sounds in healthy monolingual (Danish) children throughout a 20-min repetitive passive exposure session. We found rapid neural dynamics manifested as an enhancement of early (~100ms) brain activity over the short exposure session, with distinct spatiotemporal patterns for different novel sounds. For novel Danish word forms, signs of such enhancement were seen in the left temporal regions only, suggesting reliance on pre-existing language circuits for acquisition of novel word forms with native phonology. In contrast, exposure both to novel word forms with non-native phonology and to novel non-speech sounds led to activity enhancement in both left and right hemispheres, suggesting that more wide-spread cortical networks contribute to the build-up of memory traces for non-native and non-speech sounds. Similar studies in adults have previously reported more sluggish (~15–25min, as opposed to 4min in the present study) or non-existent neural dynamics for non-native sound acquisition, which might be indicative of a higher degree of plasticity in the children's brain. Overall, the results indicate a rapid and highly plastic mechanism for a dynamic build-up of memory traces for novel acoustic information in the children's brain that operates automatically and recruits bilateral temporal cortical circuits.}

abstract = {Purpose
This study examined grammatical production impairments in primary progressive aphasia (PPA), as measured by structured tests and narrative samples. We aimed to quantify the strength of the relationship between grammatical measures across tasks, and identify factors that condition it. Three grammatical domains were investigated: overall sentence production, verb morphology, and verb-argument structure.
Methods
77 participants with PPA (34 PPA-G, 16 PPA-L, 15 PPA-S and 12 other) completed a battery of grammatical tests and a narrative language sample was obtained. Accuracy scores were computed for the language tests and the narrative samples were analyzed for both accuracy of selected narrative variables as well as grammatical diversity across the three grammatical domains. Principal components analysis (PCA) and multiple regression were used to examine cross-task relationships for all measures.
Results
As expected on the basis of classification criteria, accuracy scores were lower for the PPA-G group as compared to the PPA-L and PPA-S participants for overall sentence production and verb morphology, but not argument structure. Grammatical accuracy in narratives strongly predicted overall language test performance in PPA-G, whereas grammatical diversity in narratives did so in PPA-L, and no significant correspondence between narrative and language test performance was found for PPA-S. For individuals with severe grammatical impairments only, error distribution for both morphology and argument structure was strongly associated in structured tasks and narratives.
Conclusions
Grammatical production in narrative language predicts accuracy elicited with structured language tests in PPA. However, unique narrative production patterns distinguish PPA by subtype: accuracy for PPA-G, and grammatical diversity for PPA-L. The impairment in PPA-G is likely to reflect a core impairment in grammar whereas that of PPA-L may be closely tied to the word retrieval and verbal working memory deficits that characterize this variant. This underscores the theoretical distinction between PPA-L and PPA-G, as well as the importance of including grammatical diversity measures in analyses of language production, especially for patients who do not display frank agrammatism. Further, the results suggest that measures of domain-specific language deficits (i.e., verb morphology vs. argument structure) are robust across tasks only in individuals with severe grammatical impairments.}

The FLACC, COMFORT-Behavior Scale, and PASPI had very good psychometric qualities when administered in Chinese children; the Asian Version of Oucher Scale and POCIS showed acceptable to good psychometric qualities; and the NFCS had unacceptable psychometric qualities. Further psychometric testing of these observational measures and self-report pain scales in particular are needed among Chinese children of various age groups and in different pain situations.}

However, it is not clear whether native language experience shapes the neural mechanisms of addressed and assembled phonologies. To address this question, we trained native Chinese and native English speakers to read the same artificial language (based on Korean Hangul) either through addressed (i.e., whole-word mapping) or assembled (i.e., grapheme-to-phoneme mapping) phonology. We found that, for both native Chinese and native English speakers, addressed phonology relied on the regions in the ventral pathway, whereas assembled phonology depended on the regions in the dorsal pathway. More importantly, we found that the neural mechanisms of addressed and assembled phonologies were shaped by native language experience. Specifically, one key region for addressed phonology (i.e., the left middle temporal gyrus) showed greater activation for addressed phonology in native Chinese speakers, while one key region for assembled phonology (i.e., the left supramarginal gyrus) showed more activation for assembled phonology in native English speakers. These results provide direct neuroimaging evidence for the effect of native language experience on the neural mechanisms of phonological access in a new language and support the assimilation–accommodation hypothesis.}

Based on a systematic literature review, twelve main salient beliefs influencing the intention to consider Web Accessibility were identified. Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior, a theoretical model integrating these main salient beliefs was compiled and a questionnaire to test the model developed. A total of 342 web practitioners in various professional roles answered the questionnaire in an online study. Path analysis revealed that intention to consider Web Accessibility is stronger when users actively promote their needs, when web practitioners see Web Accessibility as part of their professional role, and when the consideration of Web Accessibility is perceived as beneficial for the quality of a product. Hence, it is recommended to involve users with a variety of abilities in the development process, to emphasize the responsibility and specialist role of web practitioners, and to actively promote Web Accessibility as a quality feature of a product.}

Overall, respondents felt they were lacking in knowledge of the nature of prosody, experience with clients who have prosodic impairments, and knowledge of assessment and treatment methods for prosody. Recommendations include increasing training opportunities, encouraging collaboration between researchers and SLPs with expertise in prosody, and the development of a clinically feasible prosody assessment.}

Studies of MeHg exposure and negative health outcomes have shown conflicting results and it has been suggested that co-exposure to other contaminants and/or nutrients in fish may confound the effect of MeHg. Our objective was to examine the association between prenatal exposure to MeHg and language and communication development at three years, adjusting for intake of fish, n−3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n−3 LCPUFAs) and co-exposure to dioxins and dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs). We used data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) collected between 2002 and 2008. The study sample consisted of 46,750 mother-child pairs. MeHg exposure was calculated from reported fish intake during pregnancy by a FFQ in mid-pregnancy. Children's language and communication skills were measured by maternal report on the Dale and Bishop grammar rating and the Ages and Stages communication scale (ASQ). We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regressions. Median MeHg exposure was 1.3μg/day, corresponding to 0.14μg/kgbw/week. An exposure level above the 90th percentile (>2.6μg/day, >0.29μg/kgbw/week) was defined as the high MeHg exposure. Results indicated an association between high MeHg exposure and unintelligible speech with an adjusted OR 2.22 (1.31, 3.72). High MeHg exposure was also associated with weaker communication skills adjusted OR 1.33 (1.03, 1.70). Additional adjustment for fish intake strengthened the associations, while adjusting for PCBs and n−3 LCPUFA from diet or from supplements had minor impact. In conclusion, significant associations were found between prenatal MeHg exposure above the 90th percentile and delayed language and communication skills in a generally low exposed population.}

Pronouns have an important place in daily communication which speakers and listeners rely heavily on for. Aphasia literature has evidenced that pronoun processing is impaired in people with aphasia (PWA), although explanations underpinning pronoun impairments are mixed. To address this, through a systematic literature review, we identified 42 studies which examined pronoun processing (both production and comprehension) in 474 PWA across 16 different languages. An initial meta-analysis was conducted on the overall data with all PWA and pronoun conditions with an outcome measure indicating whether or not pronoun processing is individually impaired in PWA. Further meta-analytic models were built to compare certain conditions of particular interest (e.g. reflexives vs object pronouns, object vs subject wh-pronouns) in an attempt to further disentangle the explanations behind their difficulty in use. Outputs from our meta-analysis suggest that: (i) a form of pronoun impairment is consistently present in aphasia regardless of aphasia type, fluency or language spoken; (ii) pronoun variables show selectivity in their impairment, for instance, reflexives are better preserved over object pronouns, and the subject-advantage in who-pronouns is language-selective; and (iii) other important linguistic variables that largely predict pronoun impairments include aspects like argument position of subject/object phrases, case marking, cliticization, and the presence of relative clause constructions. These outputs are discussed in relation to neurolinguistic hypotheses that predict pronoun impairments in aphasia.}

We orthogonally manipulated the number of orthographic and phonological neighbors of words using the Levenshtein Distance metric (OLD20 and PLD20, respectively). The results showed opposite effects of phonological neighborhood density (PND) as a function of orthographic neighborhood density (OND). Larger N400 amplitudes were elicited by words with high PND compared with low PND when OND was high, and smaller N400 amplitudes were observed with high PND compared with low PND words when OND was low. We interpret these findings using the notion of cross-code consistency, according to which the compatibility of orthographic and phonological representations activated by a given word influences the process of recognizing that word. Words with similar numbers of orthographic and phonological neighbors have more consistent spellings and pronunciations across the neighborhood, and generate larger N400 amplitudes.}

Language difficulties are highly prevalent in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as in their younger siblings (high-risk (HR) sibs). Children with ASD show substantial heterogeneity in difficulties with different language components, but it remains unknown whether this variability is also present in HR-sibs.
Method
Receptive (RL) and expressive language (EL) were evaluated in siblings of typically developing children (low-risk (LR) sibs, N = 33) and HR-sibs (N = 30) at 36 months, using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), the Dutch version of the Reynell Developmental Language Scales – 2nd edition (RDLS-2) and spontaneous language analysis (SL). Next, composite scores for receptive and expressive phonology, grammar, semantics and pragmatics were formed. Group comparisons were performed and delays in the different language components were explored.
Results
HR-sibs scored significantly lower than LR-sibs on all standardized measures of RL. For EL, significantly lower scores were only found using the MSEL and not using the RDLS-2 nor using SL. HR-sibs scored significantly lower than LR-sibs for receptive and expressive semantics and receptive grammar. HR-sibs with characteristics of ASD presented with less language difficulties than HR-sibs without characteristics of ASD. The majority of HR-sibs showed a delay in one or more language components but these were not consistently detected by the different measures.
Conclusions
Language delays are highly prevalent in HR-sibs and their representation resembles the language profile of children with ASD. Evaluation of language at the level of phonology, grammar, semantics and pragmatics will detect considerably more children experiencing delayed language than holistic approaches.}

abstract = {Introduction
Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) represents a crucial population for identifying prevention strategies that might modify disease course for cognitively unimpaired individuals at high imminent risk for developing symptoms due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), that is, who have “preclinical” AD. Crenezumab is an antiamyloid monoclonal antibody that binds monomeric and aggregated forms of amyloid β, with highest affinity for oligomers; it is in development for early stages of sporadic AD and for ADAD.
Methods
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study of the efficacy of crenezumab versus placebo in asymptomatic PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers from family kindreds with ADAD in Colombia. Participants were randomized to receive either crenezumab or placebo for 260 weeks. The study was designed to enroll a planned total of 300 participants, including 200 preclinical mutation carriers (approximately 100 treatment, 100 placebo) and an additional control group of mutation noncarriers from the same family kindreds included to mask mutation carrier status (100 placebo only). The primary outcome is change in the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative ADAD Composite Cognitive Test Score from baseline to week 260. Secondary outcomes include time to progression to mild cognitive impairment due to AD or dementia due to AD; changes in dementia severity, memory, and overall neurocognitive functioning; and changes in amyloid–positron emission tomography, fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging volumes, and cerebrospinal fluid levels of β amyloid, tau, and p-tau. Safety and tolerability are assessed.
Results
Two hundred fifty-two participants were enrolled between December 2013 and February 2017.
Discussion
We describe the first large-scale, potentially label-enabling clinical trial of a preclinical treatment for ADAD. Results from this trial will inform on the efficacy of crenezumab for delaying onset of, slowing decline in, or preventing cognitive impairment in individuals with preclinical ADAD and will foster an improved understanding of AD biomarkers and their relationship to clinical outcomes.}

In this study, we translated all MABC-2 items and validated them with respect to content, construct and criteria validity. The validation process involved 13 experts in Motor Development and a total of 844 children (3–13 years old) from two different states in Brazil. A cross-cultural translation method yielded a Brazilian–Portuguese version of the battery. The expert panel confirmed language clarity and pertinence of the items. High intra- and inter-rater reliability and internal consistency for the MABC-2 was established for Brazilian children. A discriminant analysis confirmed the MABC-2 power (.80) to differentiate children with DCD and those at risk for DCD from typically developing children. Predictive validity was observed for the impairment scores and a percentile main effect was found in the repeated measures ANOVA (ICC: .93 and .73, respectively). Although our data are not representative of the entire country, this study is the first to confirm that the original standardized scores established for the MABC-2 are valid in Brazilian children.}

Questions remain as to whether this paradigm reflects normal reading processes however. We used a novel continuous-performance neuroimaging paradigm to address this question. In separate scanning runs, subjects either read alone, read while searching for a target letter, or searched non-words continuously. Functional connectivity analysis recovered the full extent of brain areas identified for reading in a localizer scan, with no differences between reading alone and the dual task condition. Differences were found, however, between both reading conditions and the nonword search condition. These results demonstrate that in skilled readers brain activation associated with reading is unaffected by a concurrent letter-search task. They further demonstrate the utility of a naturalistic, continuous-performance paradigm for studying the neural basis of language processing.}

We examined event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in native English or Spanish speakers while they read grammatical sentences describing animations involving manner and path components of motion that did or did not violate language-specific patterns of expression. ERPs demonstrated different expectancies between speakers: Spanish speakers showed higher expectancies for motion verbs to encode path and English speakers showed higher expectancies for motion verbs to encode manner followed by a secondary path expression. Interestingly, grammatical but infrequent motion expressions (manner verbs in Spanish, path verbs and secondary manner expressions in English) elicited semantic P600 rather than the expected N400 effects—with or without post-N400 positivities—that are typically associated with semantic processing. Overall, our findings provide the first empirical evidence for the effect of crosslinguistic variation in processing motion event descriptions at the neural level.}

abstract = {Automatic second language (L2) speech fluency assessment has been one of the ultimate goals of several projects aiming at designing Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) tools for L2 learners. Usually, three challenges must be tackled in order to solve the issues at stake: 1) Defining fluency from a threefold interdisciplinary perspective (acoustic and perceptual phonetics, computer science, L2 education); 2) Using a cost-effective algorithm; 3) Testing the procedure with actual learners’ data. Despite rapid technical developments in the field of automatic speech processing, the tools which are actually available for learners are still scarce, and most of them rely on automatic speech recognition (ASR). Moreover, most research on the topic is focusing on English as the target L2. Therefore, in this article, we address the following research questions: (a) is it possible to use a non-ASR-based low-level signal segmentation algorithm to predict human expert assessment of phonetic fluency in beginner Japanese learners of French in a text-reading task during the first stages of their learning? (b) if the answer to (a) is positive, then what are the best predictors of phonetic fluency among a set of available measures (see below for more details)? (c) is it possible to use this algorithm to monitor the evolution of phonetic fluency (and of its associated predictors) in these learners in a longitudinal study? As a first step, a corpus of French sentences read aloud by 12 Japanese learners of different proficiency levels in French was used to design a prediction system. The read-aloud speech data was perceptually annotated by three human experts on four dimensions: overall speech fluency, speech rate, regularity of speech rate, speech fluidity (i.e. smoothness of transitions between phones). Inter-rater agreement and reliability were high for all dimensions, and the average human ratings were compared with the scores provided by our prediction system. The results show strong correlations between human and automatic scores of speech rate and regularity of speech rate, and a weak correlation for speech fluidity. Automatic scores were finally combined together through a multiple linear regression model in order to predict overall speech fluency. The best model led to a correlation coefficient of .92 between automatic and human ratings, with a root-mean-square error of .38. In the second step of this study, a corpus of identical sentences read aloud four times over two years by 12 Japanese learners of French (after 4, 7, 12, and 19 months of French courses in Japan) was fed to the automatic system. The results show regular progress in overall speech fluency, which fits with the regular progress the Japanese learners under scrutiny were expected to make through their academic program in French at their university in Japan every semester. Our study suggests a positive answer to our first and third research questions, with speech rate as the best predictor to answer our second research question. In a pedagogical perspective, it seems that such a simple algorithm could be integrated in a CAPT tool to monitor learners’ progress in phonetic fluency in reading-aloud tasks.}

Methods
One hundred and eighty one Chinese outpatients diagnosed with psychotic disorders were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Sociodemographic data and responses to questionnaires measuring self-efficacy, decisional balance, processes of change, and stages of change on physical activity habit were collected.
Results
Ninety three subjects (51.4%) had the intention to engage in regular physical activity within the next six months. Significant differences were found in self-efficacy, pros of decisional balance and processes of change across the stages of change. Moreover, overall classification accuracy was 60.8% across the stages of change.
Conclusions
This study supports self-efficacy, pros of decisional balance and processes of change as useful factors in understanding physical activity behavior among patients with psychosis. Future promotions of regular physical activity can focus on improving self-efficacy, emphasizing on the benefits of regular physical activity and facilitating cognitive and behavior strategies from processes of change.}

The current study takes a novel approach to investigating neural body representations in infants by recording somatosensory mismatch negativity (sMMN) responses elicited by tactile stimulation of different body locations. Recent research in adults has suggested that sMMN amplitude may be influenced by the relative distance between representations of the stimulated body parts in somatosensory cortex. The current study uses a similar paradigm to explore whether the sMMN can be elicited in infants, and to test whether the infant sMMN response is sensitive to the somatotopic organization of somatosensory cortex. Participants were healthy infants (n = 31) aged 6 and 7 months. The protocol leveraged a discontinuity in cortical somatotopic organization, whereby the representations of the neck and the face are separated by representations of the arms, the hands and the shoulder. In a double-deviant oddball protocol, stimulation of the hand (100 trials, 10% probability) and neck (100 trials, 10% probability) was interspersed among repeated stimulation of the face (800 trials, 80% probability). Waveforms showed evidence of an infant sMMN response that was significantly larger for the face/neck contrast than for the face/hand contrast. These results suggest that, for certain combinations of body parts, early pre-attentive tactile discrimination in infants may be influenced by distance between the corresponding cortical representations. The results provide the first evidence that the sMMN can be elicited in infants, and pave the way for further applications of the sMMN in studying body representations in preverbal infants.}

Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic multisystem disorder with various medical, cognitive, behavioral and psychiatric problems. PWS is caused by the lack of expression of paternal genes on chromosome 15q2-q13 due to a deletion (70–75%), uniparental disomy (25–30%) or imprinting center defect (<5%). The common PWS behavioral and psychiatric characteristics are very typical in all ethnicities and were reported worldwide. Still, each individual has a specific profile of these common traits and the severity of his or her symptoms varies over time. Behavioral problems are the most important factor affecting the quality of life of both the individuals and their families. There is a need for a standardized tool to assess the specific behavioral profile of each individual and its present severity, in order to enable physicians to tailor the specific treatment needed and assist in a more accurate clinical follow up. To the best of our knowledge no such a tool has been standardized and published. We developed, based on the literature (mainly Forster and Gourash's paradigm) and our clinical experience, a 37 item disease specific questionnaire, the “PWS Behavioral Questionnaire” (PWSBQ) for assessing behavior in PWS patients. The purpose of the present study was to validate this tool in the entire adolescent and adult PWS population in Israel.
Methods
The PWSBQ focuses on five major domains—abnormal emotional regulation, food-seeking related behavior, lack of flexibility, oppositional behavior and interpersonal problems and lastly body related behaviors. Caregivers of all Hebrew speaking individuals with PWS over the age of 12years attending the Israeli national multidisciplinary PWS clinic were recruited. Of the 54 eligible individuals, 53 participated. They were interviewed with the PWSBQ and in addition filled the “Hyperphagia Questionnaire” and the “Child Behavioral Checklist” (CBCL). After verifying the questionnaire's content validity, all items on the PWSBQ were analyzed for internal reliability by calculating Cronbach's α. Criterion validity was evaluated by correlation testing with regard to the Hyperphagia Questionnaire and CBCL. In order to assess the questionnaire's interpretability, the correlation between the PWSBQ and the “Clinical Global Impression” (CGI) scores was evaluated.
Results
The PWSBQ total score was positively correlated with both the CBCL total score and the CGI score (0.662 and 0.549, p<0.001 respectively). Of the five domains, four had acceptable internal reliability (excluding the body related behaviors domain, which was thus removed from the total score). Criterion validity was established for the four domains remaining in the statistical analysis (abnormal emotional regulation, food seeking related behavior, lack of flexibility and oppositional behavior and interpersonal problems).
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the PWSBQ is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of current behavioral problems among individuals with PWS. Although further research is needed in order to verify PWSBQ's ability to identify changes in the behavioral status of a given individual, it can now be used both in research and in a clinical setting, enabling the physician to plan the most suitable treatment based on the current behavioral status.}

Both a chronological age-matched control group and a younger group of pre-school aged hearing children were compared to a group of deaf children born to hearing parents. A hearing native signer enacted each of the tasks, which were pre-recorded in video clips in English (SSE), British Sign Language (BSL) and spoken English, in order to consider all communication preferences of the deaf children. Results revealed no differences in performance between the deaf and the young hearing children. However, despite the inclusion of ToM tasks based on their preferred mode of communication, the deaf children performed significantly worse at the unexpected-content and second-order belief task compared with their age-matched controls. These findings imply a delay rather than a deficit in ToM in deaf children that could be attributed to limited opportunities to converse and overhear conversations about mental states.

Objetivo
Validación clínica de la versión en castellano del Mississippi Aphasia Screening Test (MASTsp) como batería de cribado de alteraciones lenguaje en pacientes que han sufrido un ictus.
Material y métodos
Un total de 29 pacientes que habían sufrido un ictus y presentaban un cuadro afásico tras una lesión hemisférica izquierda fueron evaluados con el MASTsp, el test de Boston para el diagnóstico de la afasia y el test de las fichas, al inicio y tras 6s meses de rehabilitación. Doce de los pacientes afásicos fueron evaluados por dos logopedas expertos para comprobar la fiabilidad interobservador. Este mismo grupo (n = 12) fue evaluado en dos ocasiones en la misma semana para comprobar la fiabilidad test-retest. Como grupo control se seleccionó una muestra pareada de sujetos no afásicos con lesión vascular en el hemisferio derecho (n = 29) y un grupo de sujetos sanos (n = 60) estratificado por edad y nivel educativo.
Resultados
El MASTsp mostró una adecuada validez convergente y fiabilidad (interobservador y test-retest), siendo parcialmente sensible a detectar cambios a lo largo del tiempo. Se sugiere un punto de corte diagnóstico < 90 en la puntuación total de la prueba.
Conclusiones
El MASTsp es una medida válida para la detección y el seguimiento de los problemas de lenguaje en pacientes con ictus.
Objective
Clinical validation of the Spanish version of the Mississippi Aphasia Screening Test (MASTsp) as a screening test for language disorders in patients who have suffered a stroke.
Material and methods
A total of 29 patients who had suffered a stroke and had aphasia after a left hemispheric lesion were evaluated with the MASTsp, the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination and the Token Test at baseline and after six months of rehabilitation. Two expert speech-therapists evaluated twelve aphasic patients to determine the inter-observer reliability. This sample was assessed twice in the same week to analyse the reproducibility of the test (test-retest reliability). Aphasic patients were compared with a matched sample of non-aphasic patients with vascular lesions in the right hemisphere (n =29) and a group of healthy subjects (n=60) stratified by age and educational level.
Results
The MASTsp showed a good convergent validity, interobserver validity, test-retest reliability and a moderate sensitivity to detect changes over time. A diagnostic cut-off <90 on the MASTsp total test score is proposed.
Conclusions
The MASTsp is a valid tool for the detection and monitoring of language problems in patients with stroke.}

To this end, we presented a mismatch negativity (MMN) experiment during EEG recordings as part of a longitudinal developmental study: 38 monolingual (Swiss-) German speaking children (7.5 years) were tested shortly before they started to learn English at school and followed up one year later. Moreover, 22 (Swiss-) German adults were recorded. Instead of the originally found positive mismatch response in children, an MMN emerged when applying a high-pass filter of 3Hz. The overlap of a slow-wave positivity with the MMN indicates that two concurrent mismatch processes were elicited in children. The children’s MMN in response to the non-native speech contrast was smaller compared to the native speech contrast irrespective of foreign language learning, suggesting that no additional neural resources were committed to processing the foreign language speech sound after one year of classroom-based learning.}

abstract = {Background
Self-stigma represents a major barrier to recovery in people with psychotic disorders but is understudied in early illness stage. Longitudinal investigation of prediction for self-stigma is scarce and none is conducted in early psychosis. We aimed to prospectively examine baseline predictors of self-stigma in early psychosis patients in the context of a 3-year follow-up of a randomized-controlled trial (RCT) comparing 1-year extension of early intervention (EI) with step-down psychiatric care for first-episode psychosis (FEP).
Method
One hundred sixty Chinese patients were recruited from a specialized EI program for FEP in Hong Kong after they had completed this 2-year EI service, and underwent a 12-month RCT. Participants were followed up and reassessed 3years after inclusion to the trial. Comprehensive evaluation encompassing clinical, functional, subjective quality of life and treatment-related variables were conducted. Data analysis was based on 136 participants who completed self-stigma assessment at 3-year follow-up.
Results
Fifty patients (36.8%) had moderate to high levels of self-stigma at 3-year follow-up. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that female gender, prior psychiatric hospitalization, longer duration of untreated psychosis and greater positive symptom severity at study intake independently predicted self-stigma at the end of 3-year study period.
Conclusion
Our results of more than one-third of early psychosis patients experienced significant self-stigma underscore the clinical needs for early identification and intervention of self-stigmatization in the initial years of psychotic illness. Further research is warranted to clarify prediction profile and longitudinal course of self-stigma in the early illness phase.}

We related quantitative metrics of fiber pathway microstructure in these pathways to early literacy measures of phonological awareness and decoding. We found that diffusion properties of the AF, ILF, and VOF not only show age-related differences, but also are predictive of early literacy skills after controlling for the effects of age, general white matter development, sex, IQ, and phonological skill. Perhaps most novel, we provide evidence supporting the involvement of the recently re-identified VOF in early literacy, and further, we provide evidence that a bilateral network of fiber pathways supports early literacy development.}

The results showed that fluency development for real words, pseudowords and texts continues beyond the primary grades, and that the degree of improvement was similar across educational tracks. Word reading fluency and change in word reading fluency predicted text reading fluency development. No additional effect was found for pseudoword reading fluency.

The spatial bias in bisecting either Arabic numeral strings or number words was related to the habitual reading direction of the participant. There was no difference in spatial bias or for frequency of spatial bias based on numerical magnitude for either condition.

Behaviours and decisions of an individual are largely directed by his/her personality. Identification of such a personality trait can be performed based on an individual’s handwriting features. Handwriting may be unique for each person and a person’s nature, behaviour, and certain psychological aspects can be inferred based on it. It is introduced as the field of graphology, also called graphoanalysis, to analyze personality based on handwriting. We perceived that many researchers have worked on personality and/or behaviour identification based on handwriting, however, most of them were limited to a few numbers of features. According to graphology, there is a vast range of features of handwriting strokes which carry psychological characteristics of the writer. In this survey, we present links between handwriting and personality psychology and examine different mechanisms for features extraction to predict a writer’s personality. Psychologically supported handwriting features help to understand personality traits. The paper relates these features and encourages the use of computer-based graphology for personality prediction. It also discusses applications of graphology in various fields.}

Whether phonological working memory is supported by fronto-parietal brain regions associated with short-term memory storage or perisylvian brain structures implicated in speech perception and production is unclear, perhaps due to variability in stimuli, task demands, and individuals. We used fMRI to assess neurophysiological responses while individuals performed two tasks with closely matched stimuli but divergent task demands—nonword repetition and nonword discrimination—at two levels of phonological working memory load. Using analyses designed to address intersubject variability, we found significant neural responses to the critical contrast of high vs. low phonological working memory load in both tasks in a set of regions closely resembling those involved in speech perception and production. Moreover, within those regions, the voxel-wise patterns of load-related activation were highly correlated between the two tasks. These results suggest that brain regions in the temporal and frontal lobes encapsulate the core neurocomputational components of phonological working memory; an architecture that becomes increasingly evident as neural responses are examined in successively finer-grained detail in individual participants.}

abstract = {Purpose
Scant research has investigated whether health promotion interventions have sustained effects in increasing physical activity and healthful diet among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa, which is experiencing an epidemiological transition from infectious diseases to noncommunicable diseases as leading causes of mortality. We examined whether an intervention increased adherence to 5-a-day diet and physical activity guidelines during a 54-month postintervention period among South African adolescents and whether its effects weakened at long-term (42 and 54 months postintervention) compared with short-term (3, 6, and 12 months postintervention) follow-up.
Methods
We randomized 18 randomly selected schools serving grade 6 learners (mean age = 12.6) in a township and a semirural area in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, to one of the two 12-hour interventions: health promotion, targeting healthful diet and physical activity; attention-matched control, targeting sexual risk behaviors. We tested the intervention's effects on adherence to 5-a-day diet and physical activity guidelines using generalized estimating equations logistic regression models adjusting for baseline behavior and clustering within schools.
Results
Health promotion intervention participants had higher odds of meeting 5-a-day diet and physical activity guidelines than control participants. The effect on 5-a-day diet did not weaken at long-term compared with short-term follow-up, but the effect on physical activity guidelines was weaker at long-term follow-up, mainly because of a reduced effect on muscle-strengthening physical activity. The intervention also increased health promotion attitude and intention and health knowledge and reduced binge drinking compared with the control group.
Conclusions
A 12-hour intervention in grade 6 shows promise in increasing self-reported adherence to healthful diet and physical activity guidelines during a 4.5-year postintervention period among South African adolescents.}

As inflexibility in appraisal has been associated with psychosis and major depressive disorder (MDD), this study examined the efficacy of a 4-session MCT on delusions, depression, and belief flexibility, in two clinical groups (Psychosis and Depression).
Methods
This study adopted a single-blind randomised controlled design, with patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (and delusions) and patients with MDD being randomised, respectively, into the MCT condition or a treatment-as-usual (TAU) condition. The MCT intervention consisted of specific modules targeting belief flexibility. Participants were assessed before and after treatment, and at 1- and 6-month follow-ups.
Results
Among the 113 participants, 27 patients with psychosis and 29 patients with MDD attended MCT. There were significant improvements in psychotic symptoms, especially delusions, for the Psychosis group, and in depressive symptoms for the MDD group. Symptom improvements following MCT were of large effect sizes, were significantly greater than TAU, and persisted at 6-month. Belief flexibility also improved in both groups, although changes were smaller in size and were not significantly greater than TAU.
Limitations
An active control condition was not included.
Conclusions
This study demonstrated large and stable symptom reductions in delusions and depression, and smaller (yet stable) improvement in belief flexibility across groups, following a 4-session MCT, carrying implications for transdiagnostic process-based interventions and their mechanisms of change.}

abstract = {The study examined school adjustment among 119 internationally adopted children in Norway. School adjustment included two main dimensions; school motivation and relationship in school. In the first part of the study, school adjustment was assessed by teachers among adopted and non-adopted children in first and third grade. In the second part, school adjustment assessed by mothers and teachers of adopted children were compared. The findings documented a significant decrease in school motivation from first to third grade among adopted children but not among non-adopted. Among non-adopted children there was a significant decrease in hyperactive behaviour which was not the case for adopted children. Although there were some differences in mothers’ and teachers’ assessments of adopted children, there was a significant decrease in their assessments of school motivation. The same decrease was not found for relationship in school. Hyperactive behaviour and language skills interfere with school motivation both in mothers’ and teachers’ assessments. Adopted children with less hyperactive behavior and a good command of the Norwegian language, had better school motivation. These outcomes could indicate that internationally adopted children meet greater academic challenges at higher grade levels in school due to their language difficulties and hyperactive behavior.}

abstract = {From recent findings provided by brain stimulation mapping during picture naming, we re-examine the neural basis of language. We studied structural–functional relationships by correlating the types of language disturbances generated by stimulation in awake patients, mimicking a transient virtual lesion both at cortical and subcortical levels (white matter and deep grey nuclei), with the anatomical location of the stimulation probe. We propose a hodotopical (delocalized) and dynamic model of language processing, which challenges the traditional modular and serial view. According to this model, following the visual input, the language network is organized in parallel, segregated (even if interconnected) large-scale cortico-subcortical sub-networks underlying semantic, phonological and syntactic processing. Our model offers several advantages (i) it explains double dissociations during stimulation (comprehension versus naming disorders, semantic versus phonemic paraphasias, syntactic versus naming disturbances, plurimodal judgment versus naming disorders); (ii) it takes into account the cortical and subcortical anatomic constraints; (iii) it explains the possible recovery of aphasia following a lesion within the “classical” language areas; (iv) it establishes links with a model executive functions.}

abstract = {Infants show robust ability to track transitional probabilities within language and can use this information to extract words from continuous speech. The degree to which infants remember these words across a delay is unknown. Given well-established benefits of sleep on long-term memory retention in adults, we examine whether sleep similarly facilitates memory in 6.5month olds. Infants listened to an artificial language for 7minutes, followed by a period of sleep or wakefulness. After a time-matched delay for sleep and wakefulness dyads, we measured retention using the head-turn-preference procedure. Infants who slept retained memory for the extracted words that was prone to interference during the test. Infants who remained awake showed no retention. Within the nap group, retention correlated with three electrophysiological measures (1) absolute theta across the brain, (2) absolute alpha across the brain, and (3) greater fronto-central slow wave activity (SWA).}

To explore the impact of pictorial image and teach back educational strategies on knowledge, adherence to medication and diet among patients with type 2 diabetes and low health literacy in Saqqez, Iran.
Methods
In this randomized controlled trial, 127 patients with type 2 diabetes who had low health literacy were randomly allocated into three arms of the study (pictorial image, teach back, and control groups). The two intervention groups received education within three weekly sessions, each lasting 20min. The level of functional health literacy in adults (TOFHLA), diabetes knowledge, and adherence to medication and diet were measured and compared in the three groups before and six weeks after the interventions. We used intention to treat analysis. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Paired t test.
Results
Mean scores of knowledge, adherence to medication and diet revealed significant differences between two intervention groups and control group (P<0/001) six weeks after intervention.
Conclusions
Both educational strategies increased knowledge, as well as adherence to medications and diet among patients with type 2 diabetes and low health literacy. Both educational strategies seem to be effective for patients with low health literacy and are recommended to be used according to patients’ conditions.}

abstract = {The use of co-verbal gestures is common in human communication and has been reported to assist word retrieval and to facilitate verbal interactions. This study systematically investigated the impact of aphasia severity, integrity of semantic processing, and hemiplegia on the use of co-verbal gestures, with reference to gesture forms and functions, by 131 normal speakers, 48 individuals with aphasia and their controls. All participants were native Cantonese speakers. It was found that the severity of aphasia and verbal-semantic impairment was associated with significantly more co-verbal gestures. However, there was no relationship between right-sided hemiplegia and gesture employment. Moreover, significantly more gestures were employed by the speakers with aphasia, but about 10% of them did not gesture. Among those who used gestures, content-carrying gestures, including iconic, metaphoric, deictic gestures, and emblems, served the function of enhancing language content and providing information additional to the language content. As for the non-content carrying gestures, beats were used primarily for reinforcing speech prosody or guiding speech flow, while non-identifiable gestures were associated with assisting lexical retrieval or with no specific functions. The above findings would enhance our understanding of the use of various forms of co-verbal gestures in aphasic discourse production and their functions. Speech-language pathologists may also refer to the current annotation system and the results to guide clinical evaluation and remediation of gestures in aphasia. Learning outcomes: None.}
