abstract = {The role of motivation and extramural English exposure in explaining individual differences in young English language learners’ (YELLs’) English performance is unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that different types of extramural English exposure predict YELLs’ (Dutch, N = 262, 10 years old, grade 4) oral and written English receptive vocabulary knowledge, and that motivational factors act as mediators. A distinction was made between YELLs learning English only informally through extramural English exposure and YELLs learning English also formally at school. A path analysis showed that the total impact of familial extramural English exposure and extramural English exposure through entertaining media was greater for the YELLs learning English informally, compared to YELLs learning English also formally. While the sources of extramural English exposure were directly predictive of performance with regard to both oral and written English receptive vocabulary tests for YELLs’ learning English informally, linguistic self-confidence fully mediated these relationships for YELLs learning English formally. Our findings call for further development of theoretical frameworks explaining the relationship between YELLs’ motivation and exposure.}

abstract = {Recordings of event-related brain potentials (ERPs) provide a rich source of information about the cognitive systems supporting real-time language use. However, the interpretation of ERPs can be complicated by individual differences that aren't reflected in traditional analyses or visualizations. This is problematic, as failure to recognize important and systematic individual differences has in some cases led to inappropriate interpretations of ERP effects, with neurocognitive models of language comprehension sometimes being built on these inappropriate interpretations. In this chapter we review work, largely from our lab, on individual differences in ERP studies of language comprehension and discuss the promise of work on individual differences, as well as the challenges. In some cases individual differences in ERPs manifest themselves quantitatively (i.e., systematic differences in effect amplitudes), but in other more complex cases, qualitatively (i.e., different types of effects in different individuals). We will describe work on individual differences in morphosyntactic and semantic processing in both native and nonnative language processing, as well as multi-modal communication and higher-order pragmatic inferencing. In this last vein we will describe some nascent work done in our lab using unsupervised machine learning algorithms to better understand underlying patterns of qualitative individual differences in the processing of scalar implicatures. We conclude by laying out some challenges and suggestions for future work.}

In this study, two groups of English-speaking learners were exposed to Norwegian sentences over the course of three fMRI scans. One group was provided with input in which transitional probabilities predicted the presence of target words in the sentences. This group quickly learned to identify the target words and fMRI data revealed an extensive and highly dynamic learning network. These results were markedly different from activation seen for a second group of participants. This group was provided with highly similar input that was modified so that word learning based on syllable co-occurrences was not possible. These participants showed a much more restricted network. The results demonstrate that the nature of the input strongly influenced the nature of the network that learners employ to learn the properties of words in a natural language.}

Brain metabolism was concomitantly obtained from each participant using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging. Two main patterns of impairment were identified: difficulties in nonwords reading with preservation of exception words in agrammatic and logopenic aphasia, and the inverse pattern in semantic dementia. Left frontal and left parietotemporal regions were associated to nonwords reading, while the anterior temporal lobe was related to reading of exception words. These results support the usefulness of examining reading abilities in the differential diagnosis of PPA variants, and suggest potential types of words that could be used in Spanish to assess these patients.}

Antecedentes y objetivo
Los marcadores sintácticos para identificar a niños con Trastorno Específico de Lenguaje (TEL) en español han sido descritos en varios estudios. Un área sensible para estos niños ha sido la morfología verbal compleja, como lo es el subjuntivo. Este estudio muestra frecuencias de uso del subjuntivo en niños con y sin TEL. El estudio distingue seis contextos en los que se requiere el uso de subjuntivo: cuando el verbo de la oración principal expresa deseo, mandato indirecto, duda, cuando se trata de una oración evaluativa con cópula así como con cláusulas temporales y de finalidad.
Materiales y métodos
Se estudió a 15niños con TEL y a 15niños con desarrollo típico entre los 5;0 y los 6;11años del centro de México. La producción del subjuntivo se hizo mediante un instrumento creado para el estudio en el que los niños completaron oraciones con formas verbales del subjuntivo e indicativo de diferentes tipos de oraciones a partir de una serie de imágenes.
Resultados
Los resultados mostraron una diferencia significativa en el uso de subjuntivo entre los niños con trastorno y los niños con desarrollo típico. Además, no todas las estructuras que requieren el uso de subjuntivo generan su uso con la misma frecuencia: los usos con predicados de duda y comandos indirectos resultan menos frecuentes que los usos adverbiales y volitivos.
Background and objective
Syntactic markers in Spanish to identify children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) have been described in several studies. Complex verbal morphology, such as the subjunctive, has been a sensitive area for these children. This study shows frequencies of subjunctive use in children with and without SLI. The study distinguishes six contexts in which the use of the subjunctive is required: when the verb in the main sentence expresses desire, indirect command, doubt, when it is an evaluative sentence with a copula and with time and purpose clauses.
Materials and methods
We studied 15children with SLI and 15children with typical development aged between 5;0 and 6;11 from central Mexico. The subjunctive was produced through an instrument created for the study in which the children completed sentences with verbal forms of the subjunctive and indicative from different types of sentences from a series of images.
Results
The results showed a significant difference in subjunctive use between the children with impairment and the typically developed children. In addition, not all the structures that required the use of the subjunctive resulted in its being used with the same frequency: use with predicates of doubt and indirect commands was less frequent than adverbial and volitive use.}

We used event-related potential (ERP) methodology and neuropsychological testing to monitor the neurocognitive basis of phonological awareness in typically developing children. We measured 5–6-year-old children's (N=70) phoneme processing, word completion and perceptual reasoning skills and compared their test results to their brain responses to phonemic changes, separately for each test. We found that children performing better in Phoneme processing test showed larger mismatch negativity (MMN) responses than children scoring lower in the same test. In contrast, no correspondence between test scores and brain responses was found for Auditory closure. Thus, the results suggest that automatic auditory change detection is linked to phoneme awareness in preschool children.}

To demonstrate that tense, a discourse-sensitive construction, is problematic for Spanish-speaking children with SLI, 42 monolingual Spanish-speaking children, 21 with SLI and 21 age-matched typically-developing children, were recorded for 20–35min sessions of narrative speech, in Mexico City. The children's ages ranged from 58 to 76 months. Utterances were coded for compliance with obligatory context, defined as whether or not they agreed with plausibly associated subjects in the grammatical context. Our results show that children with SLI produced significantly more errors in verb finiteness, taking into account obligatory context, than did their typically-developing counterparts. We conclude that the type and frequency of finiteness errors produced by the children with SLI indicate that these children do indeed pass through an Extended Optional Infinitive (EOI) Stage. Our measure of obligatory context enables the identification of a bare stem, non-finite verb form, previously unidentified in spontaneous speech studies of Spanish-speaking children with SLI. Consequences of these findings for 3 prominent theories of SLI are discussed.}

His dysgraphia resulted from impairment in the graphemic buffer, but unlike previously studied patients, most of his errors related to the position of letters rather than to letter identity: 80% of his errors were letter position errors in writing, and only 7% of his errors were letter omissions, substitutions, and additions. Letter position errors were the main error type across tasks (writing to dictation and written naming), across output modalities (writing and typing), and across stimuli, e.g., migratable words (words in which letter migration forms another word), irregular words, and nonwords. Letter position errors occurred mainly in the middle letters of a word. AE's writing showed a significant length effect, and no lexicality, migratability, or frequency effects. His letter position deficit was manifested selectively in writing; he made no letter position errors in reading, demonstrating the dissociability of letter position encoding in reading and writing. These data support the existence of a letter order function in the graphemic buffer that is separate from the function responsible for activating letter identities.}

abstract = {Two types of verbal fluency tasks (letter fluency task; LFT, category fluency task; CFT) have been widely used to assess cognitive function in people with psychiatric diseases including schizophrenia. The task demand of the LFT is considered to vary across languages, as the cognitive process largely relies on sound and writing systems. Specifically, a sound unit for a letter (s) and a manner of association between them are assumed to be related with the performance. In the current study, three analyses have been conducted to examine this issue, using Japanese, Turkish, and English-speaking patients with schizophrenia. It was hypothesized that severity of letter fluency impairment would be in the order of Japanese, Turkish, and English speaking patients according to the inflexibility of a word search. First, performance on the LFT and the CFT was compared among Japanese (N=40), Turkish (N=30), and the US (N=31) patients (Analysis 1). A significant difference was found between the US and other two groups only in the LFT. Second, verbal fluency performance was compared between Japanese and Turkish patients by contrasting the degree of disassociations from normal controls (Japanese: N=20, Turkish: N=30) (Analysis 2). In Japanese patients, performance on the LFT was more severely impaired compared to that on the CFT while the opposite trend was found in the Turkish counterpart, suggesting that letter fluency performance was more degraded in Japanese patients. Finally, Analysis 3 was conducted to examine the relative order of letter fluency impairment among Japanese, Turkish and English-speaking patients. Disassociation in English users with schizophrenia was estimated based on previous meta-analytic reviews. The effect size (ES) for the letter fluency deficit was the largest in the Japanese sample, while the other two groups share similar ESs. The results from the three analyses partially supported the hypothesis for the severity of the letter fluency impairment in patients with schizophrenia. The language-dependency of letter fluency impairment was thought to be explained by the theoretical model built on unique properties of sound and writing systems. The considerations presented here would provide useful information for optimizing the portability of cognitive tasks across languages.}

The groups performed equally well on the semantic task, but hearing readers performed better on the phonological task. Semantic processing engaged similar left frontotemporal language circuits in deaf and hearing readers. However, phonological processing elicited increased neural activity in deaf, relative to hearing readers, in the left precentral gyrus, suggesting greater reliance on articulatory phonological codes, and in bilateral parietal cortex, suggesting increased phonological processing effort. Deaf readers also showed stronger anterior–posterior functional segregation between semantic and phonological processes in left inferior prefrontal cortex. Finally, weaker phonological decoding ability did not alter activation in the visual word form area for deaf readers.}

Child narrative retells were collected both in the fall and spring. Following coding procedures of the original English protocol, narratives were transcribed and scored according to 27 features within five categories: sentence structure, phrase structure, modifiers, nouns, and verbs. Nine additional features appropriate to Spanish were included in the analysis. Analysis of construct, concurrent, and predictive validity supported the utility of both long and short versions of the Spanish adaptation. Several differences between the original English version and Spanish adaption emerged. In particular, the inclusion of features related to number-gender agreement and regular imperfect verb tense benefited the tool. Spanish-speaking participants produced more tier-two verbs than tier-two nouns. In conclusion, the tool holds promise as an efficient way to monitor Spanish-speaking preschoolers’ progress in language development in a narrative context.}

Two versions of a continuous performance test were administered to 37 deaf children born to Deaf parents and 60 hearing children, all aged 6–13 years. A vigilance task was used to measure sustained attention over the course of several minutes, and a distractibility test provided a measure of the ability to ignore task irrelevant information – selective attention. Both tasks provided assessments of cognitive control through analysis of commission errors. The deaf and hearing children did not differ on measures of sustained attention. However, younger deaf children were more distracted by task-irrelevant information in their peripheral visual field, and deaf children produced a higher number of commission errors in the selective attention task. It is argued that this is not likely to be an effect of audition on cognitive processing, but may rather reflect difficulty in endogenous control of reallocated visual attention resources stemming from early profound deafness.}

Antecedentes y objetivo
Cada vez hay más investigaciones que tratan de encontrar posibles identificadores tempranos de las dificultades del lenguaje. El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar los antecedentes familiares de trastornos del lenguaje u otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, los factores sociodemográficos y otros indicadores de desarrollo a partir de informes parentales en niños con y sin diagnóstico de trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje. Además, se analizó el grado de acuerdo entre la percepción de dificultades lingüísticas reportadas por las familias (madres/padres) y el nivel obtenido en la evaluación estructurada.
Método
Participaron 23 niños y niñas con trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje y otros 23 con desarrollo típico, de entre 5 y 9 años, bilingües del catalán y español, emparejados por edad y sexo. Se utilizó la prueba CELF-4 para realizar la evaluación y el diagnóstico y test estandarizados para medir el nivel intelectual y el vocabulario expresivo y receptivo. Se administró un cuestionario parental para medir las variables: antecedentes familiares, factores sociodemográficos, indicadores de desarrollo y percepción de las dificultades lingüísticas de sus hijos.
Resultados
Se observó un mayor porcentaje de antecedentes familiares en el grupo con trastorno del desarrollo del lenguaje que en el grupo con desarrollo típico. Se encontró una relación entre el nivel económico y el hecho de presentar TDL, un efecto significativo de grupo para el nivel económico en relación con el vocabulario receptivo y una correlación significativa entre primeras palabras con el vocabulario expresivo y receptivo posterior. Se encontró acuerdo entre el informe parental y la evaluación estructurada, aunque solo en las dificultades más notorias.
Conclusiones
Diferentes variables sociodemográficas y la edad de adquisición de las primeras palabras están relacionadas con el nivel de desarrollo del vocabulario posterior.
Background and aim
There is a growing body of research seeking to find early identifiers of language difficulties. The aim of this study was to analyze family history of language disorders or other neurodevelopmental disorders, sociodemographic factors and other indicators of development from parental reports in order to distinguish between children with and without developmental language disorder. In addition, the degree of agreement between the perception of language difficulties reported by parents and the children's assessment scores was compared.
Method
23 Catalan-Spanish bilingual children with developmental language disorder and 23 typical development children, matched by age and sex from 5 to 9 years of age took part in the study. CELF-4 was used to perform the language assessment and diagnosis, as well as other standardized tests to measure non-verbal intellectual level and expressive and receptive vocabulary. A questionnaire was administered to parents to measure the following variables: family history of language and other difficulties, sociodemographic factors, developmental indicators and their own perception of their children's language difficulties.
Results
A higher percentage of family history of language and other difficulties was observed in the developmental language disorder group compared to the typical development group. The economic level and the presence of DLD were significantly related, and we also found an effect of group on the economic level and on receptive vocabulary. A significant correlation was also found between the first words and later receptive vocabulary. Parental perception of their children's language difficulties and the results of the standardized language evaluation were also correlated, although only in the most evident difficulties.
Conclusions
Different sociodemographic variables and the age of acquisition of first words are related to the development of subsequent vocabulary.}

abstract = {Reading and writing are cultural inventions that have become vital skills to master in modern society. Unfortunately, writing systems are not equally learnable and many individuals struggle to become proficient readers. Languages and their writing systems often have co-varying characteristics, due to both psycholinguistic and socio-cultural forces. This makes it difficult to determine the source of cross-linguistic differences in reading and writing. Nonetheless, it is important to make progress on this issue: a more precise understanding of the factors that affect reading disparities should improve reading instruction theory and practice, and the diagnosis and treatment of reading disorders. In this review, we consider the value of artificial orthographies as a tool for unpacking the factors that create cognitive and neural differences in reading acquisition and skill. We do so by focusing on one dimension that differs among writing systems: grain size. Grain size, or the unit of spoken language that is mapped onto a visual graph, is thought to affect learning, but its impact is still not well understood. We review relevant literature about cross-linguistic writing system differences, the benefits of using artificial orthographies as a research tool, and our recent work with an artificial alphasyllabic writing system for English. We conclude that artificial orthographies can be used to elucidate cross-linguistic principles that affect reading and writing.}

abstract = {Non-linguistic components of metaphor understanding, emotions and mental images, have recently received attention within neurolinguistics and cognitive pragmatics, suggesting a role in differential representation and processing of language: metaphors are considered richer in affective connotations than their lexical or sentential non-emotional counterparts and images may be used in the recovery of propositional meaning. Assuming that the above characteristics of metaphors can trigger inferential processing, we explored the impact of their modulation on metaphor understanding in a second language (L2). We thus manipulated the nature of prime sentences in relation to the original target metaphors (e.g. Obama presided over a topic of discussion of epochal proportions) and created less emotional literal paraphrases (synonymous; historic proportions) which we compared against emotionally loaded counterparts (implicatures; amazing proportions), and examined the performance of seventy-four Greek-English bilinguals on a reading comprehension and a meaning-matching task. The results showed that both experimental conditions elicited fewer errors in comparison to the control condition but did not differ between them in accuracy or in reaction time (RT). We discuss these findings in view of the role of emotions and mental imagery in the understanding of metaphorical meaning, especially in the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL).}

However, whether the same or different brain regions are involved in learning to read a foreign language is largely unexplored. To investigate (1) neural correlates of literacy acquisition of Chinese in adults whose learning of this logographic language was relatively late, and (2) to examine which cognitive factors might be predictors of literacy acquisition that would modulate the computation demands on reading-related brain regions, native and non-native Chinese readers were recruited to participate in pronunciation and color verification tasks using Chinese pseudo-phonograms in fMRI while their sensitivity to extracting systematic regularity in nonverbal materials, as well as their IQ and working memory, was measured in a visual statistical learning (VSL) task. The results indicated that native participants activated a left lateralized reading network that is consistent with previous research on orthography-to-phonology conversion (OPC) of Chinese, while a similar but extensive network that also includes regions in the right hemisphere was engaged in the non-natives. Within this network, left inferior frontal sites were found to be crucial to the mapping of Chinese pseudo characters to potential sounds especially in non-natives. More important, only the VSL scores of native and non-native participants, but not their general cognitive abilities, were negatively correlated with the brain activities in the left inferior parietal and left inferior frontal regions, respectively, suggesting that the fundamental capacity of SL supports literacy acquisition through modulating computation demands on the brain regions associated with OPC processing, which is critical to Chinese character recognition.}

Previous studies found that people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) perform well on pragmatic inference tests that require the use of the linguistic scale <some, all>. The present study extends previous research by testing two types of implicature: scalar implicatures, based on lexical scales, and ad-hoc implicatures, based on contextual scales.
Methods
We tested 26 children with ASD aged 4–10 years (mean age 7.1) and 26 typically developing (TD) children – matched on chronological age and with a similar performance in non-verbal IQ and vocabulary – by means of a picture selection task for scalar and ad-hoc implicatures. We also investigated the effect of children’s scores in standardized tests measuring non-verbal intelligence, lexical, and morphosyntactic abilities and Theory-of-Mind skills on their performance in the implicature tasks.
Results
Although more than half of the children with ASD performed above chance on both kinds of implicatures, their performance as a group was significantly lower than the performance of their TD peers. General cognitive abilities were found to affect the performance of children with ASD on both kinds of implicatures, and Theory-of-Mind reasoning skills were found to be linked to their performance on scalar, but not ad-hoc implicatures.
Conclusions
We show that children with ASD have difficulty with both kinds of implicatures. These findings may have implications for explanatory theories of pragmatics as well as for clinical work with children with ASD.}

abstract = {For many years, researchers have sought to understand whether and when stroke survivors with acquired language impairment (aphasia) will recover. There is broad agreement that lesion location information should play some role in these predictions, but still no consensus on the best or right way to encode that information. Here, we address the emerging emphasis on the structural connectome in this work – specifically the claim that disrupted white matter connectivity conveys important, unique prognostic information for stroke survivors with aphasia. Our sample included 818 stroke patients extracted from the PLORAS database, which associates structural MRI from stroke patients with language assessment scores from the Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT) and basic demographic. Patients were excluded when their lesions were too diffuse or small (<1 cm3) to be detected by the Automatic Lesion Identification toolbox, which we used to encode patients' lesions as binary lesion images in standard space. Lesions were encoded using the 116 regions defined by the Automatic Anatomical Labelling atlas. We examined prognostic models driven by both “lesion load” in these regions (i.e. the proportion of each region destroyed by each patient's lesion), and by the disconnection of the white matter connections between them which was calculated via the Network Modification toolbox. Using these data, we build a series of prognostic models to predict first one (“naming”), and then all of the language scores defined by the CAT. We found no consistent evidence that connectivity disruption data in these models improved our ability to predict any language score. This may be because the connectivity disruption variables are strongly correlated with the lesion load variables: correlations which we measure both between pairs of variables in their original form, and between principal components of both datasets. Our conclusion is that, while both types of structural brain data do convey useful, prognostic information in this domain, they also appear to convey largely the same variance. We conclude that connectivity disruption variables do not help us to predict patients' language skills more accurately than lesion location (load) data alone.}

Here, we focus on two aspects of the bias that have received relatively little attention in the literature: Development and experience. A successful theory of ME will need to provide an account for why the strength of the effect changes with the age of the child. We provide a quantitative description of the change in the strength of the bias across development, and investigate the role that linguistic experience plays in this developmental change. We first summarize the current body of empirical findings via a meta-analysis, and then present two experiments that examine the relationship between a child's amount of linguistic experience and the strength of the ME bias. We conclude that the strength of the bias varies dramatically across development and that linguistic experience is likely one causal factor contributing to this change. In the General Discussion, we describe how existing theories of ME can account for our findings, and highlight the value of computational modeling for future theorizing.}

However, we do not know whether this language divergence can be demonstrated in second langauge learners, how learner's metalinguistic ability would modulate the langauge divergence, or whether learning method would interact with the language divergence. In this study, we attempted to answer these questions by comparing brain activations of Chinese and Spanish word reading in native English-speaking adults who learned Chinese and Spanish over a 2 week period under three learning conditions: phonological, handwriting, and passive viewing. We found that mapping orthography to phonology in Chinese had greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) than in Spanish, suggesting greater invovlement of the lexical pathway in opaque langauges. In contrast, Spanish words evoked greater activation in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) than English, suggesting greater invovlement of the sublexical pathway for transparant languages. Furthermore, brain-behavior correlation analyses found that higher phonological awareness and rapid naming were associated with greater activation in the bilateral IFG for Chinese and in the bilateral STG for Spanish, suggesting greater language divergence in participants with higher meta-linguistic awareness. Finally, a significant interaction between the language and learning condition was found in the left STG and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), with greater activation in handwriting learning than viewing learning in the left STG only for Spanish, and greater activation in handwriting learning than phonological learning in the left MFG only for Chinese. These findings suggest that handwriting facilitates assembled phonology in Spanish and addressed phonology in Chinese. In summary, our study suggests different mechanisms in learning different L2s, providing important insights into neural plasticity and important implications in second language education.}

To determine the aims, participants, and outcomes of training communication partners of Chinese-speaking persons with aphasia (PWA).
Data Sources
Sixty search terms related to communication partner training (CPT) in Chinese characters were searched in 8 electronic databases (published 1991-2020).
Study Selection
Journal articles written in Chinese that primarily target the Chinese audience and university theses were selected for review. Studies involving CPT and training to enable communication partner to deliver language tasks were included, but reports without PWA or direct training of communication partners were excluded. A final corpus of 37 articles, representing publications of group studies, case studies, qualitative studies, and opinion articles, were selected for full review.
Data Extraction
For all articles, 2 reviewers independently reviewed abstracts, excluding those without PWA or those that did not involve training of communication partners. One reviewer extracted descriptive data of participants with aphasia, communication partners, intervention details of the intervention (purpose, amount, setting, description), outcome measures, results, and clinical guidelines. A second reviewer performed accuracy verifications.
Data Synthesis
Quality of reviewed articles were classified using the American Academy of Neurology levels of evidence. The current review suggested an evidence base of low to medium quality supporting 2 intervention groups: (1) training partners to deliver therapy tasks and (2) training to improve communication between PWA and their communication partners. There was a higher proportion of persons with acute and subacute aphasia involved in these investigations, suggesting evidence on treatment efficacy of CPT in the acute stage.
Conclusions
Additional high-quality research with a better methodological quality, for example, randomized controlled trials or experimental design, are required to strengthen the current evidence of CPT. This systematic review suggests that the inclusion of studies published in languages other than English may influence the findings of mainstream reviews relating to aphasia.}

In two structural priming experiments, 13 aphasic and 13 age-matched control speakers repeated visually- and auditorily-presented prime sentences, and then used visually-presented word arrays to produce dative sentences. Experiment 1 examined whether agrammatic speakers form structural and thematic representations during sentence production, whereas Experiment 2 tested the lasting effects of structural priming in lags of two and four sentences. Results of Experiment 1 showed that, like unimpaired speakers, the aphasic speakers evinced intact structural priming effects, suggesting that they are able to generate such representations. Unimpaired speakers also showed reliable thematic priming effects in all conditions; agrammatic speakers did so as well in most experimental conditions, suggesting that access to thematic representations may be intact. Results of Experiment 2 showed structural priming effects of comparable magnitude for aphasic and unimpaired speakers. In addition, both groups showed lasting structural priming effects in both lag conditions, consistent with implicit learning accounts. In both experiments, aphasic speakers with more severe language impairments exhibited larger priming effects, consistent with the “inverse preference” prediction of implicit learning accounts. The findings indicate that agrammatic speakers are sensitive to structural priming across levels of representation and that such effects are lasting, suggesting that structural priming may be beneficial for the treatment of sentence production deficits in agrammatism.}

Choosing an appropriate expression requires the speaker to continuously keep track of the salience of referents in the discourse. Because this is cognitively challenging, children are expected to have problems creating referential cohesion. Yet, research has also shown that young children are sensitive to discourse factors in choosing referring expressions. To shed more light on how and when children learn to use referential expressions to create a cohesive discourse, we analyzed oral narratives by monolingual Swedish-speaking children aged 4;0–6;10, elicited with the Multilingual Assessment Instrument for Narratives (MAIN). We hypothesized that children would base their choice of referring expressions to a large extent on discourse factors for which no detailed mental model of the discourse is required, such as animacy. Our results show that the children indeed relied heavily on animacy as a cue for pronominalization. At the same time, they were sensitive to fine-grained levels of local discourse salience. We propose that, like adults, children use a combination of global and local discourse factors for choosing referring expressions, but that the relative weights of these factors may vary with cognitive capacity.}

Studies have shown that many children with early language difficulties also have delays in social-emotional competencies as well as social-emotional and behavioral problems. It is unclear if these conditions are causally related, if they share a common underlying etiology, or if there are bidirectional effects. Studies investigating these associations have mostly involved children who are already using words to communicate, but it is important to know whether delays in preverbal communication and language development have any effects on these associations. The aim of the present study was to examine associations between preverbal communication and early verbal skills in infancy and subsequent social-emotional competencies and ensuing social-emotional and behavioral problems in early toddlerhood. The role of background factors known to influence early language development was also examined.
Methods
The sample consisted of 395 children (51.6% boys) from the Finnish Steps Study cohort. Language was assessed at age 13 months (+ 1 month) with the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory for Infants (CDI-I), and the social-emotional domain was assessed at age < 17 months with the Brief Infant–Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA).
Results
Infants with lower preverbal gestural communication and receptive language skills had a higher risk of delays in social-emotional competencies in toddlerhood than children with better communication skills, but not of elevated social-emotional and behavioral problems.
Conclusions
The results indicate that lower early communication skills can predict delays in the development of social-emotional competencies, which has been found to be a risk factor for later development of social-emotional and behavioral problems. It is important to monitor early communication skills to provide guidance to parents in supporting early pragmatic communication and language development in infancy, if needed.}

abstract = {Background
Our goal was to assess for the first time early vocalizations as precursors to speech in audio-video recordings of infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).
Methods
We randomly selected 40 infants with TSC from the TSC Autism Center of Excellence Research Network dataset. Using human observers, we analyzed 74 audio-video recordings within a flexible software-based coding environment. During the recordings, infants were engaged in developmental testing. We determined syllables per minute (volubility), the number of consonant-vowel combinations, such as ‘ba’ (canonical babbling), and the canonical babbling ratio (canonical syllables/total syllables) and compared the data with two groups of typically developing (TD) infants. One comparison group's data had come from a laboratory setting, while the other's had come from all-day Language Environment Analysis recordings at home.
Results
Compared with TD infants in laboratory and all-day Language Environment Analysis recordings, entry into the canonical babbling stage was delayed in the majority of infants with TSC, and the canonical babbling ratio was low (TD mean = 0.346, SE = 0.19; TSC mean = 0.117, SE = 0.023). Volubility level in infants with TSC was less than half that of TD infants (TD mean = 9.82, SE = 5.78; TSC mean = 3.99, SE = 2.16).
Conclusions
Entry into the canonical stage and other precursors of speech development were delayed in infants with TSC and may signal poor language and developmental outcomes. Future studies are planned to assess prediction of language and developmental outcomes using these measures in a larger sample and in more precisely comparable recording circumstances.}

Toddlers were significantly less likely to be late talkers if they engaged in informal play opportunities (P = .013), were read to or shown picture books daily (P < .001), or cared for primarily in child care centers (P = .001).
Conclusions
Both biological and environmental factors were associated with the development of late talking. Biological factors placed toddlers at risk for late talking, and facets of the environment played a protective role. Enveloping infants and toddlers in language-rich milieus that promote opportunities for playing, reading, and sharing books daily may decrease risk for delayed early vocabulary.}

In pediatric epilepsy, where seizures co-occur with the development of critical brain networks, age of onset matters: The earlier in life seizures begin, the worse the disruption in network establishment, resulting in academic hardship and social isolation. Yet, little is known about the processes by which epileptic activity disrupts developing human brain networks. Here we take a synthetic perspective—reviewing a range of research spanning studies on molecular and oscillatory processes to those on the development of large-scale functional networks—in support of a novel model of how such networks can be disrupted by epilepsy. We seek to bridge the gap between research on molecular processes, on the development of human brain circuitry, and on clinical outcomes to propose a model of how epileptic activity disrupts brain development.}

abstract = {Simmons-Mackie N, Raymer A, Armstrong E, Holland A, Cherney LR. Communication partner training in aphasia: a systematic review.
Objectives
To describe the effects of communication partner training on persons with aphasia and their communication partners. Specifically the systematic review addressed 3 clinical questions regarding the impact of partner training on language, communication activity and participation, psychosocial adjustment, and quality of life for adults with aphasia and their communication partners.
Data Sources
Twenty-three terms were used to search 12 electronic databases (eg, PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, PsychArticles, CSA Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts, Social Sciences Citation Index [Web of Science], SUMSearch, TRIP, EMBASE, REHABDATA, National Library for Health, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and the journal “Aphasiology.” References from all relevant articles were hand-searched.
Study Selection
Two reviewers independently applied inclusion criteria to select potential relevant articles from the titles and abstracts of references retrieved by the literature search. The full text of the remaining articles was reviewed by a 5-member panel, resulting in a corpus of 31 studies that met the final inclusion criteria.
Data Extraction
Two independent reviewers extracted the descriptive data related to the participants, the intervention, the outcome measures, and the results.
Data Synthesis
The 5-member review team by consensus classified the studies using the American Academy of Neurology system for classification of evidence (2004).
Conclusions
Evidence shows that communication partner training is effective in improving communication activities and/or participation of the communication partner and is probably effective in improving communication activities and/or participation of persons with chronic aphasia when they are interacting with trained communication partners. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations related to the impact of partner training on persons with acute aphasia or the impact of training on language impairment, psychosocial adjustment, or quality of life for either the person with aphasia or the communication partner.}

The modularity indices of different frequency bands were highly correlated with one another. An exploratory factor analysis, performed to extract a general modularity index, explained 77.1% of the total variance. The modularity index was positively associated with Chinese word reading, Chinese phonological awareness, Chinese morphological awareness, and Chinese reading comprehension but was not significantly correlated with English word reading or English morphological awareness.

abstract = {Understanding language neurobiology in early childhood is essential for characterizing the developmental structural and functional changes that lead to the mature adult language network. In the last two decades, the field of language neurodevelopment has received increasing attention, particularly given the rapid advances in the implementation of neuroimaging techniques and analytic approaches that allow detailed investigations into the developing brain across a variety of cognitive domains. These methodological and analytical advances hold the promise of developing early markers of language outcomes that allow diagnosis and clinical interventions at the earliest stages of development. Here, we argue that findings in language neurobiology need to be integrated within an approach that captures the dynamic nature and inherent variability that characterizes the developing brain and the interplay between behavior and (structural and functional) neural patterns. Accordingly, we describe a framework for understanding language neurobiology in early development, which minimally requires an explicit characterization of the following core domains: i) computations underlying language learning mechanisms, ii) developmental patterns of change across neural and behavioral measures, iii) environmental variables that reinforce language learning (e.g., the social context), and iv) brain maturational constraints for optimal neural plasticity, which determine the infant's sensitivity to learning from the environment. We discuss each of these domains in the context of recent behavioral and neuroimaging findings and consider the need for quantitatively modeling two main sources of variation: individual differences or trait-like patterns of variation and within-subject differences or state-like patterns of variation. The goal is to enable models that allow prediction of language outcomes from neural measures that take into account these two types of variation. Finally, we examine how future methodological approaches would benefit from the inclusion of more ecologically valid paradigms that complement and allow generalization of traditional controlled laboratory methods.}

We approached this question by investigating sentence processing in advanced second language (L2) users with different native language (L1) backgrounds. Using a visual world eye tracking paradigm, we investigated to what extent L1 and L2 participants showed anticipatory eye movements to objects while listening to Dutch placement event descriptions. L2 groups differed in the degree of similarity between Dutch and their L1 with respect to placement verb semantics: German, like Dutch, specifies object position in placement verbs (put.STAND vs. put.LIE), whereas English and French typically leave position underspecified (put). Results showed that German L2 listeners, like native Dutch listeners, anticipate objects that match the verbally encoded position immediately upon encountering the verb. French/English L2 participants, however, did not show any prediction effects, despite proper understanding of Dutch placement verbs. Our findings suggest that prior experience with a specific semantic contrast in one’s L1 facilitates prediction in L2, and hence adds to the evidence that linguistic experience modulates predictive sentence processing.}

Tract-based spatial statistics and tractography revealed relationships between Phonological Processing and diffusion parameters in bilateral ventral white matter pathways and the corpus callosum. Phonological Processing was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy and negatively correlated with mean diffusivity. The relationships observed in left ventral pathways are consistent with studies in older children, and demonstrate that structural markers for language performance are apparent as young as 3 years of age. Our findings in right hemisphere areas that are not as commonly found in adult studies suggest that young children rely on a widespread network for language processing that becomes more specialized with age.}

Background/Objective
The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the School Function Assessment (SFA) for primary school students with cerebral palsy (CP) in Guangzhou, China.
Methods
Ninety-three students with CP were recruited by convenience sampling from a special school. The Chinese version of the SFA was administered and an exploratory factor analysis with direct oblique rotation was used to extract the factor structure underlying the Activity Performance scales of the SFA. An intraclass correlation one-way random single measure was performed to study external reliability. Cronbach's alpha was used to study internal consistency.
Results
The findings showed that the Chinese version of the SFA had high internal consistency with test–retest reliability [ICC (1, k) = 0.49–0.97].
Conclusion
This study has established the applicability of the SFA for both clinical and research purposes in the Chinese population, and presented evidence of satisfactory psychometric properties in use with primary school students with CP in special schools.}

We investigated the role of linguistic factors in sentence bisection, in patients with and without neglect, and control participants. The effects of information in the right-sided part of the sentence (Experiment #1), and of lexical and syntactic violations (Experiment #2) were assessed. Neglect patients showed an overall rightward bias, larger than those of patients without neglect and controls. The neglect patients’ bias was modulated by stimulus type, decreasing from lines, to letter strings and to all types of sentences. In sum, in visuo-manual sentence bisection a basic linguistic mechanism, such as sentence readability, brings about a more leftward appreciation of the stimulus, reducing the neglect patients’ rightward bias.}

A total of 59 studies were identified with a total amount of 339 effect sizes, involving 6786 preschool and kindergarten students. A multilevel approach was followed to estimate the average effect size and to examine the moderation of effects. On average, a small positive effect size of 0.28 with 95% CI (0.21, 0.35), was evidenced across treatments and across outcome measures. Large variation in effect sizes was observed between studies and especially between comparisons within studies. If the intervention was part of an integrated learning system in the classroom, the effects were better. The present analysis also shows the importance of methodological rigor of study designs being used in that effect sizes were higher in cases of absence of randomization and comparisons with classroom teaching as usual instead of an active control group.}

Test–retest reliability was examined in a random subsample of 30 children at a five-week interval. The clinical discrimination of the D-N CAS was also examined by comparing children with and without ADHD (18 children in each group) and by comparing children with and without Chinese reading disabilities (18 children in each group). The current Chinese sample demonstrated a four-factor solution for cognitive performance among children with normal development: Planning, Attention, Simultaneous processing and Successive processing (χ2(48)=91.90, p=.000; χ2/df=1.92, RMSEA=.050, GFI=.966, CFI=.954). Moreover, all subtests of the battery demonstrated acceptable test–retest reliability (r=.72–.90, p<.01) at a five-week interval among the subjects of the small subsample. Children with ADHD performed significantly worse than normal children on the Attention factor (p<.001) and the Planning factor (p<.05) of the D-N CAS, and children with Chinese reading disabilities performed significantly worse than normal children on the Simultaneous processing factor (p<.01), the Successive processing factor (p<.001) and the Planning factor (p<.05) of the D-N CAS. These findings suggested that the current four-factor structure of the D-N CAS was similar to the original factor structure of the test. The latent factor of the D-N CAS was fairly stable across the cultures. Moreover, the D-N CAS can distinguish between children with ADHD or Chinese reading disabilities and normally developed children.}

The “shape bias,” or the tendency to generalize a novel label to novel objects of the same shape, is a reliable and robust behavioral finding and has been shown to predict future vocabulary growth and possible language disorders. Despite the robustness of the phenomenon, the way in which the shape bias is defined and tested has varied across studies and laboratories. The current review argues that differences in performance that come from even seemingly minor changes to the participants or task can offer critical insight to underlying mechanisms, and that working to incorporate data from multiple labs is an important way to reveal how task variation and a child’s individual pathway creates behavior—a key issue for understanding developmental phenomena.}

Our results revealed a stronger FC between the VWFA and the inferior occipital cortex (IOC) but a weaker FC between the VWFA and the posterior central gyrus (PostCG) in the sighted people compared to the people with low vision. The region-of-interest-based analyses showed that the FC between the VWFA and PostCG in low-vision individuals who learned Braille was stronger relative to those who did not learn Braille, and that the FC between the VWFA and IOC was correlated with the onset age of Braille learning. These results suggest that the VWFA in people with low vision has a functional reorganization between visual and tactile processing, which was modulated by the experience of Braille reading.}

Our findings indicated that students' English word decoding development primarily depended on Dutch word decoding fluency. The development of their French decoding skills was mainly dependent on their Dutch pseudoword decoding fluency, and in the higher educational track also on their L2 word decoding ability. It is concluded that there is evidence of linguistic interdependencies in the development of word decoding in the native language and the subsequent development of word decoding in the foreign language.

abstract = {In alphabetic language systems, converging evidence indicates that developmental dyslexia represents a disorder of phonological processing both behaviorally and neurobiologically. However, it is still unknown whether, impaired phonological processing remains the core deficit of impaired English reading in individuals with English as their second language and how it is represented in the neural cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study investigated the neural responses to letter rhyming judgment (phonological task) and letter same/different judgment (orthographic task) in Chinese school children with English and Chinese reading impairment compared to typically developing children. Whole brain analyses with multiple comparison correction revealed reduced activation within the left lingual/calcarine gyrus during orthographic processing in children with reading impairment compared to typical readers. An independent region of interest analysis showed reduced activation in occipitotemporal regions during orthographic processing, and reduced activation in parietotemporal regions during phonological processing, consistent with previous studies in English native speakers. These results suggest that similar neural deficits are involved for impaired phonological processing in English as both the first and the second language acquired. These findings pose implications for reading remediation, educational curriculum design, and educational policy for second language learners.}

In this paper, we examine the age at which L1 vowel categories influence the acquisition of L2 vowels. We tested a child population with a very narrow range of age of first exposure, controlling for the use of L1 vs. L2, and various naturally produced contrasts that are not allophonic in the L1 of the children. An oddity discrimination task provided evidence that children who are native speakers of Turkish and began learning German as an L2 in kindergarten categorized difficult German contrasts differently from age-matched native speakers. Their vowel productions of these same contrasts (un-cued object naming) were mostly target-like.}

abstract = {Introduction and objectives
This study compares data collection approaches in the assessment of grammatical development in Spanish-speaking children. Specifically, we compared error rates produced in data collected using samples from spontaneous language versus elicited production, using both broad (overall) and narrow measures (errors with noun phrases).
Methods and participants
Monolingual-Spanish-speaking five-year-olds (n=55) were divided into typical language development (TL) and at-risk (Risk) according to a preexisting test, Tamiz de Problemas del Lenguaje. All children completed an elicited production and a narrative task.
Results
Children in the TL group outperform children in the Risk group in all measures used in this study. Statistically significant differences were found between children at Risk and TL children in both spontaneous and elicited language measures, although the effect size of the elicited language measures was considerably higher. Elicited and spontaneous tasks are more likely to produce results that are in accord than in disaccord. However, when results are in disaccord, the results almost always show low performance in elicited language but high performance in spontaneous language. Elicitation methods do not seem to have an impact on the type of error produced for neither narrow nor broad measures.
Resumen
Introducción y objetivos
Este estudio compara los enfoques de recolección de datos para la evaluación del desarrollo gramatical en niños que hablan español. Específicamente, comparamos las tasas de error producidas usando muestras de lenguaje espontáneo versus la producción elicitada, usando medidas generales (todos los errores) y específicas (errores con frases nominales).
Métodos y participantes
Los niños monolingües de cinco años de habla hispana (n=55) se dividieron en dos grupos: desarrollo del lenguaje típico o a riesgo de desórdenes del lenguaje, para lo cual se usó el Tamiz de Problemas del Lenguaje. Todos los niños completaron una producción del lenguaje elicitada y una tarea narrativa.
Resultados
Los niños del grupo típico superan a los niños del grupo a riesgo en todas las medidas utilizadas en este estudio. Se encontraron diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre los niños a riesgo y los niños típicos en las medidas de lenguaje espontáneo y elicitado, aunque el tamaño del efecto de las medidas de lenguaje elicitado fue considerablemente mayor. El lenguaje elicitado y espontáneo producen mas resultados que están de acuerdo que en desacuerdo; sin embargo, cuando los resultados están en desacuerdo, casi siempre muestran un bajo rendimiento en el lenguaje elicitado pero un alto rendimiento en el lenguaje espontáneo. Los métodos de obtención no parecen tener un impacto en el tipo de error producido ni para medidas específicas ni amplias.}

Subjects were 83 preschool children in six public preschool classrooms with low-income eligibility thresholds, including 30 DLLs. Children were screened for alphabet knowledge and randomly assigned to small groups and to one of four conditions: experimental letter names or letter sounds only, experimental letter names + sounds (LN + LS), or typical LN + LS. Research assistants provided nine weeks of instruction in each treatment, in 10-min sessions, four days/week. Irrespective of language status, children in the four groups made significant growth from pretest to posttest on measures of alphabet learning. The single-focus letter name or letter sound conditions led to significantly greater growth on taught alphabet content. The experimental LN + LS condition led to greater growth in taught letter names and sounds content compared to the typical LN + LS condition. Pretest vocabulary and alphabet knowledge did not moderate growth, and only limited evidence of differential response to instruction among DLLs was found. Paired associate and articulation referencing learning processes were related to alphabetic growth. Engagement during learning was high in all four treatments. Findings support the benefits of explicit alphabet instruction that enlists cognitive learning processes required for alphabet learning.}

Firstly, the series of pictures and the preferred speed of presentation were assessed for their applicability in children of different ages and abilities. Secondly, these series were used with rnTMS preoperatively in five children with epilepsy. Naming errors induced by the stimulation comprised no response, delayed response, semantic error, phonological error, and self-correction. Language laterality was compared with the results of a dichotic listening test and with neuropsychological tests with respect to general laterality, and general language abilities were considered with respect to the results of stimulation. One participant had below normal general language abilities, two had below-normal rapid naming, and three had slow and indistinct articulation. Laterality was only clear in two of the participants. All children required breaks of various durations during the process, and individual adjustments of the interpicture interval and other stimulation parameters were also made. We conclude that, after adjustment, rnTMS combined with an object-naming task can be useful for preoperative language mapping in children.}

A sibling comparison approach was used, providing a robust test for the association between SDP and reading related outcomes in school-aged children. Results suggested within-family (i.e., potentially causal) associations between SDP and reading and language/comprehension factor scores, as well as between SDP and specific reading-related skills, including reading accuracy and receptive language, with increased exposure to SDP associated with decreased performance. SDP was not associated with spelling, reading rate, or receptive vocabulary. Initial within-family associations between SDP and word-letter identification, phonetic/decoding skills, and reading comprehension were fully attenuated following partial control for genetic and environmental confounding of the associations. These findings indicate that exposure to SDP is associated with poorer performance on some, but not all skills assessed.}

The aim of this study was to identify whether different patterns of errors exist in irregular past-tense verbs in children who stutter (CWS) and children who do not stutter (CWNS).
Method
Spontaneous language samples of thirty-one age- and gender-matched pairs of children (total N=62) between the ages of 24 months and 59 months were analyzed.
Results
Results indicated that children who do and do not stutter over-regularize irregular past-tense verbs (i.e., saying runned for ran) with comparable frequency. However, two nonsignificant trends which suggest possible intra-group differences were noted. First, irregular past tense verbs represented a greater portion of total verbs for CWS than for CWNS. Second, CWS appeared to double-mark (i.e., say ranned for ran) more often than CWNS. Results are discussed in light of theories about the acquisition of the irregular past-tense and about differences in language skills between CWS and CWNS. Educational objectives: After reading this article, the reader will be able to: (a) summarize previous findings about connections between stuttering and language in CWS and CWNS; (b) describe similarities and differences between irregular past-tense verb use and errors in CWS and CWNS; (c) discuss possible connections between the declarative–procedural model and stuttering.}

Some behavioral and functional neuroimaging investigations of healthy participants suggest that calculation requires language resources. However, there are also reports of individuals with severe aphasic language impairment who retain calculation ability. One possibility in resolving these discordant findings is that the neural basis of calculation has undergone significant reorganization in aphasic calculators. Using fMRI, we examined brain activations associated with exact addition and subtraction in two patients with severe agrammatic aphasia and retained calculation ability. Behavior and brain activations during two-digit addition and subtraction were compared to those of a group of 11 healthy, age-matched controls. Behavioral results confirmed that both patients retained calculation ability. Imaging findings revealed individual differences in processing, but also a similar activation pattern across patients and controls in bilateral parietal cortices. Patients differed from controls in small areas of increased activation in peri-lesional regions, a shift from left fronto-temporal activation to the contralateral region, and increased activations in bilateral superior parietal regions. Our results suggest that bilateral parietal cortex represents the core of the calculation network and, while healthy controls may recruit language resources to support calculation, these mechanisms are not mandatory in adult cognition.}

The study compared parental ratings of children's language abilities at 3-years of age with observations of children's language performance by Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs).
Method
Children (n=85) around 3-years of age were recruited from a child development clinic. Detailed speech and language assessments were completed during a one-hour semi-structured clinician-child interactive session. Language assessment was carried out using a criterion-referenced checklist and the language sections of the Bayley Scale for Infant Development- 3rd Edition (BSID-III). All parents rated their children's language skills using seven statements related to reception and expression domains of language on a 7-point rating scale. The language status of the child (typical language vs delay) determined by the parental report was matched with the language status as per the child's performance during the SLP assessment.
Results and discussion
Mean parental ratings of children assessed as having language delay by an SLP were significantly lower than children with typical language. Total parental rating score correlated highly with overall language scores on BSID-III; the highest correlation was observed for ratings of statements related to expressive language skills focusing on formation of sentences. Parental report of below normal performance on any one of the seven statements demonstrated acceptable sensitivity (0.95) and a high negative predictive value (0.98) with the child's performance as the gold standard.
Conclusion
Parental ratings of language skills correlated with child's performance at 3-years of age with a higher agreement for identifying children with delays. Parental reports can be useful to red-flag children for further assessment and continued monitoring of language development in busy developmental clinics and preschools, especially in the context of low-resource settings.}

A three by two between-subject design was conducted. Three classes of English-majored college students in central Taiwan were conveniently sampled and participated in the training. From each class, eight learners of low oral reading fluency and another eight of high oral reading fluency were chosen for data analysis. Learners in Class 1 enhanced their oral reading fluency with an audio player, Class 2 with a system-paced ASAS, and Class 3 with a learner-paced ASAS. Pretest and posttest were conducted before and after the training. During the 8-week training period, each student was required to read half of an article by repeating after the model speaker for thirty minutes each week. Two-way ANOVA simple main effect was conducted to analyze the data. Four conclusions were made. First, the training either with an audio player or with an ASAS enhanced learners’ WCPM more than their MFS scores. Second, students of low oral reading fluency benefited more by practicing with the ASAS. Third, training either with an audio player or an ASAS didn’t seem to help learners of high oral reading fluency much. Fourth, learners’ enhancement of WCPM came mainly from the improvement of reading speed rather than accuracy rate.}

The analysis reveals key PoS-grams shared in CE and CL introductions, e.g., those associated with the step “purposive announcement”, as well as the discipline-specific ones such as the PoS-gram for structure-outlining only found in CE introductions. Compared to various forms of multi-word sequences like n-grams, the PoS-gram has the unique strength of grouping phraseologies with similar or identical structure and discursive functions and yet either recurrent or varying lexical choices under the co-selected grammatical categories. The advantage enriches analyses and helps yield pedagogically useful findings, in that patterning and variability is revealed not only in the overall function, structure and composition of PoS-grams but in such aspects of their recurrent or diversified tokens. This study illustrates the innovative application of corpus-based PoS-gram procedure to academic genres, which may inspire a promising new line of inquiry and the current genre pedagogy.}

We hypothesized that individual differences in auditory processing may account for some variability in second language learning. We tested this hypothesis by examining psychoacoustic thresholds, auditory-motor temporal integration, and auditory neural encoding in adult native Polish speakers living in the UK. We found that precise English vowel perception and accurate English grammatical judgment were linked to lower psychoacoustic thresholds, better auditory-motor integration, and more consistent frequency-following responses to sound. Psychoacoustic thresholds and neural sound encoding explained independent variance in vowel perception, suggesting that they are dissociable indexes of sound processing. These results suggest that individual differences in second language acquisition success stem at least in part from domain-general difficulties with auditory perception, and that auditory training could help facilitate language learning in some individuals with specific auditory impairments.}

A cross-sectional design was employed to study 60 post-TBI hospitalized adults aged 18–65 years. Post-traumatic (PT) linguistic disorder and cognitive deficit after TBI were respectively diagnosed using the Persian Aphasia Test (PAT) and Persian version of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at discharge. Primary post-resuscitation consciousness level was determined using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Paracilinical data was obtained by CT scan technique. Multiple logistic regression analysis illustrated that brain injury severity was the first powerful significant predictor of PT linguistic disorder after TBI and frontotemporal lesion was the second. It was also revealed that cognitive function score was significantly correlated with score of each language skill except repetition. Subsequences of TBI are more commonly language dysfunctions that demand cognitive flexibility. Moderate, severe and fronto-temporal lesion can increase the risk of processing deficit in linguistic macrostructure production and comprehension. The dissociation risk of cortical and subcortical pathways related to cognitive-linguistic processing due to intracranial lesions can augment possibility of lexical-semantic processing deficit in acute phase which probably contributes to later cognitive-communication disorder.}

Phonological awareness is also considered a primarily metalinguistic skill not affected by the individual's L2 language proficiency, or by L1-L2 linguistic distance. The current paper takes a different perspective on L2 phonological awareness. It argues that L2 phonological awareness is affected by L2 language-specific factors, and that these factors may be as equally implicated in phonological awareness in L2 as the metalinguistic insight that words may be broken down into phonological units – often considered the hallmark of the phonological awareness construct. In support of this claim, we discuss two types of evidence. The first concerns significant differences between phonological awareness in L1 and L2, as well as a significant correlation between L2 oral language proficiency and phonological awareness in L2. The second concerns linguistic distance and the effect on L2 phonological awareness of phonological differences between L1 and L2. Both pieces of evidence are used to promote the argument that it is important to view phonological awareness in L2 as a two-dimensional construct encompassing a metalinguistic component, which may be metalinguistic in nature and language-independent, and a linguistic component which is language-specific and reflects phonological representations in L2.}

abstract = {Although characterized primarily as a language disorder, mounting evidence indicates episodic amnesia in Logopenic Progressive Aphasia (LPA). Whether such memory disturbances extend to information encoded pre-disease onset remains unclear. To address this question, we examined autobiographical memory in 10 LPA patients, contrasted with 18 typical amnestic Alzheimer's disease and 16 healthy Control participants. A validated assessment, the Autobiographical Interview, was employed to explore autobiographical memory performance across the lifespan under free and probed recall conditions. Relative to Controls, LPA patients showed global impairments across all time periods for free recall, scoring at the same level as disease-matched cases of Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, these retrieval deficits persisted in LPA, even when structured probing was provided, and could not be explained by overall level of language disruption or amount of information generated during autobiographical narration. Autobiographical memory impairments in LPA related to gray matter intensity decrease in predominantly posterior parietal brain regions implicated in memory retrieval. Together, our results suggest that episodic memory disturbances may be an under-appreciated clinical feature of LPA.}

This study aimed to identify white matter pathways that, when damaged, predicted reading deficits in children. Based on the dual-route model of word reading, we predicted that integrity of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus would be related to performance in sight word identification while integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus would be related to performance in phonemic decoding. Reading fluency and comprehension were hypothesized to relate to the superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and cingulum bundle. The connectivity of white matter pathways was used to predict reading deficits in children aged 6 to 16years with traumatic brain injury (n=29) and those with orthopedic injury (n=27) using tract-based spatial statistics. Results showed that children with traumatic brain injury and reduced microstructural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus demonstrated reduced word-reading ability on sight word and phonemic decoding tasks. Additionally, children with traumatic brain injury and microstructural changes involving the cingulum bundle demonstrated reduced reading fluency. Results support the association of a dorsal pathway via the superior longitudinal fasciculus with both sight word reading and phonemic decoding. No association was identified between the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and sight word reading or phonemic decoding. Reading fluency was associated with the integrity of the cingulum bundle. These findings support dissociable pathways predicting word reading and fluency using Diffusion Tensor Imaging and provide additional information for developing models of acquired reading deficits by specifying areas of brain damage which may predict reading deficits following recovery from the acute phase of TBI.}

abstract = {Purpose
Visual-world eyetracking is increasingly used to investigate online language processing in normal and language impaired listeners. Tracking changes in eye movements over time also may be useful for indexing language recovery in those with language impairments. Therefore, it is critical to determine the test-retest reliability of results obtained using this method.
Methods
Unimpaired young adults and people with aphasia took part in two eyetracking sessions spaced about one week apart. In each session, participants completed a sentence-picture matching task in which they listened to active and passive sentences (e.g., The [N1+Aux woman was] [V visiting/visited] [NP/PP2 (by) the man]) and selected between two pictures with reversed thematic roles. We used intraclass correlations (ICCs) to examine the test-retest reliability of response measures (accuracy, reaction time (RT)) and online eye movements (i.e., the likelihood of fixating the target picture in each region of the sentence) in each participant group.
Results
In the unimpaired adults, accuracy was at ceiling (thus ICCs were not computed), with moderate ICCs for RT (i.e., 0.4–0.58) for passive sentences and low (<0.4) for actives. In individuals with aphasia, test-retest reliability was strong (0.59 < ICC < 0.75) for accuracy and excellent (>0.75) for RT for both sentence types. Similarly, for the unimpaired listeners, reliability of eye movements was moderate for passive sentences (NP/PP2 region) and low in all regions for active sentences. But, for the aphasic participant group, eye movement reliability was excellent for passive sentences (in the first second after sentence end) and strong for active sentences (V and NP/PP2 regions).
Conclusion
Results indicated moderate-to-low reliability for unimpaired listeners; however, reliable eye movement patterns were detected for processes specific to passive sentences (e.g., thematic reanalysis). In contrast, individuals with aphasia exhibited strong and stable performance across sentence types in response measures and online eye movements. These findings indicate that visual-world eyetracking provides a reliable measure of online sentence comprehension in aphasia, and thus may be useful for investigating sentence processing changes over time.}

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 105, 16083–16088) reported a correlation between event-related potential (ERP) responses to native and non-native vowels in a group of early and highly-skilled bilinguals. In the present study, we compared the brain morphology of two groups of bilinguals who were equally proficient in their second language but differed in their perception of both native and non-native vowels. A whole brain, voxel-based morphometry analysis (VBM) revealed larger white matter volume in the right insulo/fronto-opercular region in individuals who exhibited poorer perceptual discrimination of native and non-native vowels. As the volume of the left Heschl’s gyri has previously been shown to correlate with the ability to perceive foreign phonemic contrasts (between consonants), we also measured the white and grey matter volumes of Heschl’s gyri in our subjects. We did not observe any significant relation between these volumes and vowel discrimination capabilities. This result allows the identification of anatomical brain differences related to individual differences in vowel perception. The present results add to the relatively unexplored area of the relationship between brain structure and language function in adult healthy population.}

The first neurophysiological evidence of speech normalization is observed in P2 (130–250 ms), which is functionally related to phonetic and phonological processes. Furthermore, the normalization process was found to ease lexical retrieval, as indexed by smaller N400 (350–470 ms) after larger P2. A cross-language vowel perception task was carried out to further specify whether normalization was processed in the phonetic and/or phonological stage(s). It was found that both phonetic and phonological cues in the speech context contributed to vowel normalization. The results suggest that vowel normalization in the speech context can be observed in the P2 time window and largely overlaps with phonetic and phonological processes.}

Families were randomly assigned to receive the home-based parenting intervention or standard pediatric primary care. The observed number of infant total (i.e., token) and different (i.e., type) utterances spoken during an observation of an infant-led play and a parent-report measure of infant externalizing behavior problems were examined at pre- and post-intervention and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Infants receiving the intervention demonstrated a significantly higher number of observed different and total utterances at the 6-month follow-up compared to infants in standard care. Furthermore, there was an indirect effect of the intervention on infant language production, such that the intervention led to decreases in infant externalizing behavior problems from pre- to post-intervention, which, in turn, led to increases in infant different utterances at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups and total utterances at the 6-month follow-up. Results provide initial evidence for the effect of this brief and home-based intervention on infant language production, including the indirect effect of the intervention on infant language through improvements in infant behavior, highlighting the importance of targeting behavior problems in early intervention.}

Two elementary students (ages 7;6 and 8;4) completed a set of four vocabulary tasks and received two 30-minute mediations in ASL. Each session consisted of several scripted activities focusing on the use of categorization. Both had experienced difficulties in providing categorically related responses in one of the vocabulary tasks used previously. Results showed that the two students exhibited notable differences with regards to their learning pace, information uptake, and effort required by the mediator. Furthermore, we observed signs of a shift in strategic behavior by the lower performing student during the second mediation. Results suggest that the use of dynamic assessment procedures in a vocabulary context was helpful in understanding children's strategies as related to learning potential. These results are discussed in terms of deaf children's cognitive modifiability with implications for planning instruction and how MLE can be used with a population that uses ASL. Learning outcomes: The reader will (1) recognize the challenges in appropriate language assessment of deaf signing children; (2) recall the three areas explored to investigate whether a dynamic assessment approach is sensitive to differences in deaf signing children's language learning profiles (3) discuss how dynamic assessment procedures can make deaf signing children's individual language learning differences visible.}

The aim of this four-wave longitudinal study was to determine to what extent L2 vocabulary acquired through the particular school context of early L2 immersion education is linked to the same cognitive abilities. A total of 61 French-speaking 5-year-old kindergartners who had just been enrolled in English immersion classes were administered a battery of tasks assessing these three phonological processing abilities and three attentional/executive skills. Their English vocabulary knowledge was measured 1, 2, and 3 school years later. Multiple regression analyses showed that, among the assessed phonological processing abilities, phonological STM and speech perception, but not phonological awareness, appeared to underlie L2 vocabulary acquisition in this context of an early L2 immersion school program, at least during the first steps of acquisition. Similarly, among the assessed attentional/executive skills, auditory attention and flexibility, but not response inhibition, appeared to be involved during the first steps of L2 vocabulary acquisition in such an immersion school context.}

Specific patterns of functional asymmetry between the left and right hemisphere can also be demonstrated.

abstract = {Background
One in 10 US adults of childbearing age has limited English proficiency (LEP). Parental LEP is associated with worse health outcomes among healthy children. The relationship of parental LEP to health outcomes for children with special health care needs (CSHCN) has not been systematically reviewed.
Objective
To conduct a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature examining relationships between parental LEP and health outcomes for CSHCN.
Data Sources
PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Social Science Abstracts, bibliographies of included studies. Key search term categories: language, child, special health care needs, and health outcomes.
Eligibility Criteria
US studies published between 1964 and 2012 were included if: 1) subjects were CSHCN; 2) studies included some measure of parental LEP; 3) at least 1 outcome measure of child health status, access, utilization, costs, or quality; and 4) primary or secondary data analysis.
Methods
Three trained reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Two separate reviewers appraised studies for methodological rigor and quality.
Results
From 2765 titles and abstracts, 31 studies met eligibility criteria. Five studies assessed child health status, 12 assessed access, 8 assessed utilization, 2 assessed costs, and 14 assessed quality. Nearly all (29 of 31) studies used only parent- or child-reported outcome measures, rather than objective measures. LEP parents were substantially more likely than English-proficient parents to report that their CSHCN were uninsured and had no usual source of care or medical home. LEP parents were also less likely to report family-centered care and satisfaction with care. Disparities persisted for children with LEP parents after adjustment for ethnicity and socioeconomic status.
Conclusions and Implications
Parental LEP is independently associated with worse health care access and quality for CSHCN. Health care providers should recognize LEP as an independent risk factor for poor health outcomes among CSHCN. Emerging models of chronic disease care should integrate and evaluate interventions that target access and quality disparities for LEP families.}

abstract = {Predictors of reading comprehension among children with SLI have been rarely studied in Spanish. Even more sparse are longitudinal studies inspecting the evolution of their reading abilities. The aim of the present study is to inspect how decoding, production of grammatical/ungrammatical sentences, production of simple/complex sentences, and vocabulary (measured with two instruments) predict reading comprehension among Spanish-speaking monolingual school-age children with SLI in two grades: 2nd grade and 4th grade. Forty-eight children were recruited for this study, evenly grouped in two conditions: SLI and Typical. Groups were balanced by gender with no differences in months of age. All children were assessed twice: when in 2nd grade and when in 4th grade. Several multiple regression analyses were conducted. Findings revealed differences in terms of which particular predictors significantly impacted reading comprehension in each group. Vocabulary and syntax complexity are the most consistent predictors of reading performance. Decoding predicted reading comprehension performance only in the observed early stage (2nd grade), becoming non-significant over time. Grammaticality was found to have no impact on reading comprehension in both groups. Reported results suggest that vocabulary and complex syntax solidly predict reading comprehension, while decoding and grammaticality play a minor or even negligible role. Thus, interventions designed to improve reading comprehension among children with SLI might benefit from targeting these two particular dimensions of language.}

Participants performed tasks that measured switching, inhibition, and working memory. Early-English program pupils had greater knowledge of English vocabulary and more balanced Dutch–English lexicons. In both groups, lexical balance, a ratio measure obtained by dividing vocabulary scores in English by those in Dutch, was related to switching but not to inhibition or working memory performance. These results show that for children who are learning an L2 in an instructional setting, and for whom managing two languages is not yet an automatized process, language balance may be more important than L2 proficiency in influencing the relation between childhood bilingualism and switching abilities.}

Some studies suggest that lexical recognition is impaired in people with schizophrenia, psychopathy and/or antisocial personality disorders, but not affective disorders. We examined the extent to which various traits dimensionally linked to one or more of these disorders are associated with lexical recognition performance in the general population.
Methods
Seventy-eight healthy English-speaking participants completed self-report measures of schizotypy, psychopathy, impulsivity, depression, anxiety and stress. All participants were assessed on a one-choice variant of a lexical decision task (LDT).
Results
Meanness and Boldness traits of psychopathy (Triarchic Psychopathy Measure), and positive schizotypy (Unusual Experiences, Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences) were associated with poor word-nonword accuracy, and predicted a significant amount of unique variance (Meanness, 12%; Boldness, 4.8%; Positive Schizotypy, 4.4%; total 21%) in performance. Higher motor impulsivity predicted 30% of the variance in low-frequency words recognition accuracy, but only in non-native English speakers. Affective traits were not associated with LDT performance.
Conclusion
Psychopathic traits show stronger negative associations with lexical recognition performance than schizotypal traits, and impulsivity may differently influence lexical decision performance in native and non-native speakers. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings, especially the influence of language familiarity in the impulsivity-performance relationship, and to clarify the influence of corresponding symptom dimensions in lexical recognition abilities, taking language familiarity, migration status, and comorbidity into account, in people with schizophrenia, psychopathy, and/or antisocial personality disorders.}

abstract = {Attempting to understand children's figurative language acquisition/development has been an ongoing effort for decades from a variety of approaches and on a range of figures. Goals have differed from Psychology through ally disciplines to Linguistics, with analyses targeting co-development through disorders to general processes in acquisition. Psychology has typically turned to skills and abilities paralleling figurative language development (e.g., multi- and meta-representation). Linguistics has generally grappled with whether holistic or piecemeal approaches are best—the latter involving different explanations for different figures (e.g., standard pragmatic model and early conceptual metaphor theory, versus relevance theory). Mixtures of both disciplines have also been involved, as have approaches interested mainly in phenomena accompanying figurative language development/acquisition (e.g., reading, disorders, education), but including figurative abilities as measures in their research. The outcome of these efforts is a vast, complex set of partially interlocking literatures with much variability involving figures treated, processes involved, deficits or disorders measured and motivations for exploration. The set of cognitive/linguistic processes seen to underlie figurative abilities have also not changed drastically across this research era, nor have many of the empirical tools of assessment. Two alternative approaches are offered to potentially revitalize the headway in our endeavor to understand figurative language acquisition/development—one based on embodied simulations and another on pragmatic effects.}

Further, as in other investigations with the BigCAT (Vanryckeghem & Brutten, 2019), this self-report test revealed a statistically significant group mean difference between AWS and AWNS, suggesting the presence of a negative attitude towards communication in Kannada-speaking AWS. Further, individuals with severe stuttering had a significantly higher level of speech-associated negative attitude compared to those with mild stuttering. Age does not seem to influence the AWS’ speech-associated belief system. Both of these findings augment the existing scant literature on exploring the association between stuttering severity and age on the cognitive dimension of stuttering. The outcomes establish the BigCAT-K as an effective tool in the assessment and subsequent management of stuttering.}

abstract = {Objectives
The Intelligibility in Context Scale (ICS) is a parent-report scale, world-wide translated and widely validated, by which parents can rate their child's functional speech intelligibility according to seven different communicative partners. The study aimed to report and discuss the normative data of the Italian version of ICS (ICS–I) in Italian-speaking preschool children, and to investigate whether the age influences the ICS-I scores (construct validity). Socio-economic status (SES) of the family were investigated and compared to parents' ratings on child's speech intelligibility.
Methods
A cross-sectional observational study was conducted. Italian-speaking children aged 3–6 years (n = 355; mean age = 56.06 months; SD = 9.8 months), without major developmental impairment, were recruited in kindergartens throughout a convenience sampling. Parents completed a self-report form on their family SES (educational level and employment status of fathers and mothers). Children were independently rated by their mothers (ICS-Im) and fathers (ICS-If).
Results
Results show that ICS normative data for the Italian preschool population (ICS-Im = 4.52; SD = 0.46; ICS-If = 4.47; SD = 0.49) are consistent with previous evidence found in other languages, suggesting that ICS could be a potential cross-linguistic tool to assess functional intelligibility. A statistically significant (p < 0.001) improvement in ICS-I score was found with increase of age (construct validity). No evidence of association (p > 0.05) with ICS-I was found for SES family.
Conclusion
The study provides normative data of the functional intelligibility assessed by a subjective parental scale. As for other previous international studies, ICS-I normative data suggest that a preschool child without major impairment shows a high degree of speech intelligibility, even if minimal differences of intelligibility are reported for different communicative partners. The current findings support clinicians and researchers in implementing ICS-I in typical and also in atypical population with different SES background and promoting its application as a potential outcome measure in children with Speech Sound Disorders.}

Young, typically developing children are early speakers before the age of 2years, the initial period of communication and language development. When this development is not happening because of disabilities or delays, it is possible to use computer-aided tools in order to help people to palliate or overcome such limitations, at least partially. For example, an Augmentative and Alternative Communication system must manage a vocabulary made up of several hundred concepts, usually without knowledge of the language at a semantic and pragmatic level. Such knowledge would make possible, for example, the implementation of new strategies for word prediction based on meaning, a very precise natural language generation or semantic parsing of the messages so that it would not allow the composition of meaningless messages. We present Simple Upper Ontology, SUpO, a semantic grammar which is made up of detailed knowledge of facts of the everyday life of simple words. In order to build SUpO we developed a procedure designed to give syntactic detail to part of FrameNet, a well-known ontology which encodes knowledge about usages of language at the semantic level. The result of this procedure is a multilingual semantic grammar which has been implemented by using Grammatical Framework. Finally, we propose some examples of tools where the use of SUpO would be suitable.}

Using an ERP measure with an implicit one-back repetition detection task, we investigated the neural basis of visual specialization for print in Chinese and English among eleven 7-to-8-year-old Hong Kong children, who were learning to read Chinese and English in parallel, though showing lower skills in English. N1 print tuning was found for both Chinese and English words, but was bilateral for Chinese and right-lateralized for English. In addition, the specialization effect of print started as early as in the time window of the P1, with a reduced P1 for Chinese and English words as compared to the visually matched control stimuli. These findings suggest that Chinese readers in 2nd grade show clear visual specialization for both Chinese and English print and that right-lateralized N1 specialization may be driven by less reading experience in English rather than by writing-specific effects induced by Chinese.}

The onset of the primes was manipulated to disentangle the contributions of orthography and phonology (i.e. O+P+: kite – KUNST, ‘art’; O+P−: knee – KUNST; O−P+: crime – KUNST; O−P−: mine – KUNST). Phonological but not orthographic overlap facilitated RTs. However, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) revealed both orthographic and phonological priming starting 125ms after target presentation.

Across studies there is great variability in reported rates of stuttering recovery. This study examined the impact that different definitions of recovery had on calculation of recovery rates and factors associated with recovery within the same sample of children.
Method
Speech samples and parents and child reports of their experiences of stuttering were collected from 38 children who stuttered aged 2–5 years of age (Occassion-1) and again at 9–13 years of age (Occassion-2). Four different criteria for recovery that were developed representing variations in criteria reported in previous research were applied to data from these children.
Results
. The majority of the participants (82%) showed very little disfluent speech (<1% syllables stuttered) at Occasion 2. Recovery rate varied greatly depending on the criteria used, ranging from 13.2%–94.7%. Definitions ordered from least to greatest recovery that were (a) parent and clinician report no stuttering and no stuttering observed (13.2 %); (b) ≤1% syllables stuttered; severity rated at ≤1; parent, clinician, and child report recovery (55.3 %); (c) ≤1% syllables stuttered; severity rated at ≤1; parent and clinician report recovery (71.1 %); (d) <3.0 % syllables stuttered (94.7 %). Five participants were considered recovered and two were considered persistent stutters across all criteria. Different factors were associated with recovery from stuttering depending on the criterion used.
Conclusion
The concept of recovery from stuttering is complex and estimations of recovery rate are likely to be greatly affected by differences in definitions and measurement across studies. This has a flow-on effect in determining the factors associated with recovery from stuttering.}

abstract = {Aim
To establish incidence, phenotype, long-term functional outcome, and early EEG predictors of delirium after cardiac arrest.
Methods
This is an ad hoc analysis of a prospective cohort study on outcome prediction of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Patients with recovery of consciousness, who survived until hospital discharge, were subdivided in groups with and without delirium based on psychiatric consultation. Delirium phenotype and medical treatment were retrieved from patient files. All other data were prospectively collected. We used univariate analyses of baseline and early EEG characteristics for identification of possible delirium predictors. Association of delirium with neurological recovery at six months was analyzed with multinomial logistic regression analysis.
Results
Of 233 patients, 141 survived until hospital discharge, of whom 47 (33%) were diagnosed with delirium. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between patients with and without delirium. All delirious patients were treated with relatively high dosages of psychopharmaceuticals, mostly haloperidol and benzodiazepine agonists. Prevalent characteristics were disturbed cognition, perception and psychomotor functioning (98%). Half of the patients had language disorders or shouting. Delirium was associated with longer ICU and hospital admission, and more frequent discharge to rehabilitation centre or nursing home. There was a trend towards poorer neurological recovery. EEG measurements within 12 h after cardiac arrest could predict delirium with 91% specificity and 40% sensitivity.
Discussion
Delirium is common after cardiac arrest, and probably leads to longer hospitalization and poorer outcome. Optimal treatment is unclear. Early EEG holds potential to identify patients at risk.}

abstract = {The theory of mutualism posits that general cognitive ability emerges, at least in part, due to positive reciprocal interaction between distinct cognitive abilities during development. In other words, cognitive abilities at a given developmental time point govern the rate of growth in other cognitive abilities. Moreover, this emerging field of work finds that the strength as well as the nature of these interactions differs during developmental time: In other words, there are sensitive periods when small individual differences may have especially pronounced, long-lasting consequences for cognitive development. Here, I review the literature on mutualistic effects, and show how it can shed new light on sensitive periods. I do so by considering sensitive periods as periods where interactions between (cognitive) domains differ in strength and/or in kind.}

abstract = {The present research, investigated whether the domain of lexicon could undergo first language attrition after the first language has been fully acquired, when learning of second language takes place in adulthood in a migrant context. This study mainly aimed to focus on the attrition of the first language (Persian) among adults in an L2 environment. The study focused on a diverse population of Iranian immigrants of Canada. Altogether, 51 participants participated in this study. The instruments adopted involved a Picture Naming Task, and the AMTB questionnaire modified by (Gardner, 1985). The initial results indicate that bilinguals had no difficulty in managing lexical naming tasks.}

abstract = {Butterfly glioma (BG) is a rare glioma subtype defined by contiguous extension of the tumor into both hemispheres through the corpus callosum. The impairment of higher cognitive functions in BG patients is a well-known condition encountered in the clinical practice. Given the peculiar anatomical features and clinical repercussions of butterfly gliomas, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the role of structured neurocognitive evaluation in this patient population. A systematic search of the literature (Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane databases) was conducted following PRISMA guidelines to identify English language studies reporting on clinical evaluation, treatment strategies and outcomes in BG patients. Screening and extraction were conducted in duplicate. Results were analyzed qualitatively. 493 unique references yielded 49 full-text papers for review; 19 studies were included in the final analysis reporting on 181 patients. A descriptive approach was used in the majority of cases to report on patients' cognitive status, where memory loss, confusion and non-specific cognitive impairment were the most frequently reported issues (67–69% of cases). Three studies conducted specific neurocognitive evaluations: one series reported on the post-operative incidence of abulia/akinesis and its resolution, two case reports applied a complete battery of neuro-psychological tests assessing attention, executive functions and memory skills. This review highlights a gap between the wide availability of validated neuropsychological tests and their utilization in the management of BG patients, according to the literature. Additional data from multi-institutional studies are needed to evaluate the actual implementation of these tests in the daily clinical practice.}
