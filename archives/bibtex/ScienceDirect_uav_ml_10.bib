abstract = {Accurate registration of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds and images is a prerequisite for integrating the spectral and geometrical information collected by low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Most registration approaches take the directly georeferenced LiDAR point cloud as a rigid body, based on the assumption that the high-precision positioning and orientation system (POS) in the LiDAR system provides sufficient precision, and that the POS errors are negligible. However, due to the large errors of the low-precision POSs commonly used in the low-cost UAV LiDAR systems (ULSs), dramatic deformation may exist in the directly georeferenced ULS point cloud, resulting in non-rigid transformation between the images and the deformed ULS point cloud. As a result, registration may fail when using a rigid transformation between the images and the directly georeferenced LiDAR point clouds. To address this problem, we proposed NRLI-UAV, which is a non-rigid registration method for registration of sequential raw laser scans and images collected by low-cost UAV systems. NRLI-UAV is a two-step registration method that exploits trajectory correction and discrepancy minimization between the depths derived from structure from motion (SfM) and the raw laser scans to achieve LiDAR point cloud quality improvement. Firstly, the coarse registration procedure utilizes global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU)-aided SfM to obtain accurate image orientation and corrects the errors of the low-precision POS. Secondly, the fine registration procedure transforms the original 2D-3D registration to 3D-3D registration. This is performed by setting the oriented images as the reference, and iteratively minimizing the discrepancy between the depth maps derived from SfM and the raw laser scans, resulting in accurate registration between the images and the LiDAR point clouds. In addition, an improved LiDAR point cloud is generated in the mapping frame. Experiments were conducted with data collected by a low-cost UAV system in three challenging scenes to evaluate NRLI-UAV. The final registration errors of the images and the LiDAR point cloud are less than one pixel in image space and less than 0.13 m in object space. The LiDAR point cloud quality was also evaluated by plane fitting, and the results show that the LiDAR point cloud quality is improved by 8.8 times from 0.45 m (root-mean-square error [RMSE] of plane fitting) to 0.05 m (RMSE of plane fitting) using NRLI-UAV, demonstrating a high level of automation, robustness, and accuracy.}

The contributions of CGLA are three folds: (1) CGLA is designed for path planning based on cooperation of multiple UAVs. Technically, CGLA exploits a new defined individual cost matrix, which leads to an efficient path planning algorithm for multiple UAVs. (2) The convergence of the proposed algorithm for calculating the cost matrix is proven theoretically, and the optimal path in terms of path length and risk measure from a starting point to a target point can be calculated in polynomial time. (3) In CGLA, the proposed individual weight matrix can be efficiently calculated and adaptively updated based on the geometric distance and risk information shared among UAVs. Finally, risk evaluation is introduced first time in this paper for UAV navigation and extensive computer simulation results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of CGLA for safe navigation of multiple UAVs.}

abstract = {Accurate detection of heavy metal stress on the growth status of plants is of great concern for agricultural production and management, food security, and ecological environment. A proximal hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system covered the visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) region of 400–1000 nm coupled with machine learning methods were employed to discriminate the tobacco plants stressed by different concentration of heavy metal Hg. After acquiring hyperspectral images of tobacco plants stressed by heavy metal Hg with concentration solutions of 0 mg·L−1 (non-stressed groups), 1, 3, and 5 mg·L−1 (3 stressed groups), regions of interest (ROIs) of canopy in tobacco plants were identified for spectra processing. Meanwhile, tobacco plant's appearance and microstructure of mesophyll tissue in tobacco leaves were analyzed. After that, clustering effects of the non-stressed and stressed groups were revealed by score plots and score images calculated by principal component analysis (PCA). Then, loadings of PCA and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm were employed to pick effective wavelengths (EWs) for discriminating non-stressed and stressed samples. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) were utilized to estimate the stressed tobacco plants status with different concentrations Hg solutions. The performances of those models were evaluated using confusion matrixes (CMes) and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Results demonstrated that PLS-DA models failed to offer relatively good result, and this algorithm was abandoned to classify the stressed and non-stressed groups of tobacco plants. Compared to LS-SVM model based on full spectra (FS-LS-SVM), the LS-SVM model established EWs selected by CARS (CARS-LS-SVM) carried 13 variables provided an accuracy of 100%, which was promising to achieve the qualitative discrimination of the non-stressed and stressed tobacco plants. Meanwhile, for revealing the discrepancy between 3 stressed groups of tobacco plants, the other FS-LS-SVM, PCA-LS-SVM, and CARS-LS-SVM models were setup and offered relatively low accuracies of 55.56%, 51.11% and 66.67%, respectively. Performance of those 3 LS-SVM discriminative models was also poorly performing to differentiate 3 stressed groups of tobacco plants, which might be caused by low concentration of heavy metal and similar canopy (especially in fresh leaves) of plant. The achievements of the research indicated that HSI coupled with machine learning methods had a powerful potential to discriminate tobacco plant stressed by heavy metal Hg.}

Subsequently, we also address the resulting problem of sensing and processing resource-intensive data aerially within the Edge swarm in the fastest and most efficient manner possible. The heterogeneous nature of the Edge swarm results in under-utilization of the available computation resources due to unequal data generation within its members. To address this, we propose a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra-Edge processing offload scheme to mitigate the problem of heavy processing in some of the swarm members. We do this by distributing the data to be processed to all the swarm members. Real-life hardware tuned simulation of a large UAV swarm shows that by increasing the number of UAVs in the swarm, our scheme achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays for intensive processing tasks. Additionally, in comparison to regular star and mesh topologies, our scheme achieves an increase in collective available network processing speeds by 100% for only 25% of the number of UAVs in a star topology.}

This study was conducted to (1) develop protocol to predict maize streak virus (MSV) and grain yield using UAV-derived multispectral data; and (2) identify the suitable predictor variables and ideal phenological stages for MSV and grain yield prediction. Twenty-five maize varieties were evaluated under artificial MSV inoculation. Manual scoring and multispectral imaging measurements were performed at mid-vegetative, flowering and mid-grain filling stages. UAV-derived data were acquired in the multispectral bands of Green (0.53–0.57 μm), Red (0.64–0.68 μm), Red-edge (0.73–0.74 μm) and Near-Infrared (0.77–0.81 μm). Eight vegetation indices were determined: NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), NDVIred-edge, GNDVI (green normalized difference vegetation index), SR (simple ratio), CIgreen (green chlorophyll index), CIred-edge (red-edge chlorophyll index), SAVI (soil-adjusted vegetation index) and OSAVI (optimized SAVI). Finally, predictions of MSV and grain yield were performed with 36 models using multiple regression, decision trees and linear regression. Frequently selected variables for MSV prediction were Green band at vegetative (61.5%), Red band at vegetative (68.4%) and flowering (80.4%), and GNDVI at mid-vegetative (88.7%). The best MSV predictors were GNDVI (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.85), CIgreen (r = 0.83; RMSE = 0.86) and Red band (r = 0.77; RMSE = 0.99) measured at mid-vegetative stage. Six out of 36 models were selected as ideal for predicting maize grain yield: RF-REF-NIRF (r = 0.69; RMSE = 0.65); NDVIREG-GNDVIG (r = 0.74; RMSE = 0.56); RV-NIRV (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.37); and the tree with the largest correlations are RV-NIRV-RF (r = 0.86; RMSE = 0.32); GNDVIV-OSAVIV (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.36); GV-RV-NIRV (r = 0.84; RMSE = 0.35); the last two of which were at mid-vegetative stage. We conclude that UAV-based multispectral remote sensing is a reliable tool for phenotyping MSV disease and grain yield prediction, and mid-vegetative appear to be the most ideal phenological stage for MSV and grain yield prediction.}

Remote sensing technologies have driven the development of grassland AGB estimation from labor-intensive to highly-efficient. However, optical image-based remote sensing methods are fraught with uncertainty issues due to the saturation effects. In this study, we evaluated the capability of the emerging terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technique in estimating grassland AGB in the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China. Seven variables (i.e., canopy cover, canopy volume, mean height, maximum height, minimum height, range of height, and standard deviation of height) were extracted from the TLS data of 30 plots across the northern agro-pastoral ecotone of China, and were used to build regression models with field measured AGB using four regression methods, which are simple regression (SR) model, stepwise multiple regression (SMR) model, random forest (RF) model and artificial neural network (ANN) model. The results demonstrate that TLS is a feasible technique for extracting grassland structural parameters. Mean grass height and canopy cover obtained from TLS data have good correspondence with field measurements (R2 > 0.7, p-values < 0.001). Among the four regression models, the SMR model yields the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 48.89 g/m2), followed by the RF model (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 68.72 g/m2), the SR model (R2 = 0.80, RMSE = 86.4 g/m2), and the ANN model (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 101.40 g/m2). Minimum grass height and canopy coverage are the two most important variables influencing the prediction accuracy of the SMR model, and the prediction accuracy of the SMR model increases with the increase of point density. The results of this study can provide guidance for choosing the optimal model and data collection method for estimating degraded grassland AGB using TLS in agro-pastoral ecotone.}

This kind of system is a hybrid aerial vehicle that combines advantages of rotary-wing aircraft, like hovering flight and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), and those of fixed-wing aircraft, as improved forward flight. Although the VTOL and cruise flight regimes present different dynamic behaviors, in this work a unified, highly coupled, nonlinear model is developed to cope with the considered tilt-rotor UAV full flight envelope, that is, the axial flight, hovering, transition/cruise and turning flight. The modeling is performed via Euler–Lagrange formulation considering the tilt-rotor UAV as a multi-body system and taking into account aerodynamic effects and the dynamics of the tilting servomotors. Accordingly, in order to comply with the trajectory tracking requirements and improve the tilt-rotor UAV forward flight, this paper presents a novel robust adaptive mixing controller which is formulated to deal with linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems dependent on not known a priori large parameters but measured or estimated online, and also to provide robustness against unknown disturbances. Additionally, a rigorous closed-loop stability analysis is performed. The controller performance is validated with numerical experiments conducted using a high fidelity simulator developed on Gazebo and Robot Operating System (ROS) platforms.}

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight data estimation and prediction are critical for flight attitude tracking, safe operation and system health management (SHM). However, it is usually difficult to establish exact physical models for complex systems in many cases, which brings more challenges for model based filtering approaches. Moreover, due to non-linearity, uncertainty, and noise involved in flight data, using a single data-driven method is always incapable for fitting a complete flight track. To address the issues above, this paper proposes a hybrid approach of Gaussian Process-Unscented Kalman Filter (GP-UKF) based on Flight Mode Recognition (FMR) for UAV. The proposed method combines two ideas: (1) The UAV flight data are divided into different segments by FMR mechanism for improving the adaptability of estimation and prediction model. (2) According to different flight modes, GP recursive models are learned from flight data and utilized as the state transition equation in each Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), and then GP-UKFs are constructed to realize higher estimation accuracy and uncertainty presentation. Experiments based on real UAV flight data verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework and indicate the potential for real applications.}

This paper presents the development and experimental implementation of a novel two-time scale controller for the hover control of a Rotary wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (RUAV). Flapping and servo dynamics, important from a practical point of view, are included in the RUAV model. The two-time scale controller takes advantage of the ‘decoupling’ of the translational and rotation dynamics of the rigid body, resulting in a two-level hierarchical control scheme. The inner loop (attitude control) tracks the attitude commands generated by the outer loop controller and sets the main rotor thrust vector, while the outer loop (position control) tracks the reference position. Hover flight experimental results are presented in this paper using the proposed two-time scale controller.}

In the considered model, we assume that channel state information (CSI) is not known at the receivers (users), thus, to obtain CSI responses, we use two type pilot insertions (i.e., block type and comb type). According to the received pilot responses and data signal, the proposed DL-based detector (DLD) can detect symbols at all users without requiring any additional operations (e.g., channel estimation, interference canceler, etc.). Then, we evaluate the error performance of the proposed DLD in Monte Carlo simulations and compare the results with the benchmark (i.e., successive interference canceler-based detector (SICD) with perfect CSI at the receiver). It is revealed that the proposed DLD outperforms the SICD significantly even if the perfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR) is available for the SICD and is not for the DLD. Moreover, the proposed DLD provides a flexible detection, where all users can detect their symbols once the offline training is completed in case either equal to or less than the number of the users used for training are allocated. Based on the extensive simulations, we also reveal that the proposed DLD outperforms the SICD with perfect CSIR when less users are allocated in the testing than the offline training. This proves the flexibility of the proposed DLD and enables grant-free access. Lastly, we also present BER performances of DLD for different fading channel conditions where the pre-trained DLD with Rayleigh fading channel is used as online joint channel estimation and detection algorithm without re-training. We demonstrate that the DLD still outperforms conventional SICD and this reveals the robustness of the DLD against to fading conditions. Thus, the DLD could be used in any fading conditions without re-training and this is quite promising for practical implementations.}

Hence, moving all of these data to cloud datacenters would be impossible and would lead to more bandwidth usage, latency, cost, and energy consumption. In such cases, the fog layer would be the best place for data processing. In the fog layer, the computing equipment dedicates parts of its limited resources to process the IoT application tasks. Therefore, efficient utilization of computing resources is of great importance and requires an optimal and intelligent strategy for task scheduling. In this paper, we have focused on the task scheduling of fog-based IoT applications with the aim of minimizing long-term service delay and computation cost under the resource and deadline constraints. To address this problem, we have used the reinforcement learning approach and have proposed a Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL)-based scheduling algorithm using the target network and experience replay techniques. The evaluation results reveal that our proposed algorithm outperforms some baseline algorithms in terms of service delay, computation cost, energy consumption and task accomplishment and also handles the Single Point of Failure (SPoF) and load balancing challenges.}

How to get the accurate regions of Ulva prolifera in the very high-resolution images remains a lot of challenges. Due to the limitation of GPU memory, the popular pixel-level image segmentation methods cannot deal with the raw resolution images(Up to 6000*4000). In this paper, we propose a novel framework to get the Ulva prolifera regions, which incorporates both superpixel segmentation and CNN classification and can deal with raw resolution images. We first process the raw images with superpixel algorithm to generate local multi-scale patches. And then a binary classification CNN model can be trained with the labeled patches. With the result of superpixel segmentation and the classification of CNN model, a more detailed segmentation of Ulva prolifera can be obtained. Two datasets UlvaDB-1 and UlvaDB-2 are also proposed in this paper. The experiment results show that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with the recent pixel-level segmentation and instance-aware semantic segmentation methods.}

Integration of remotely sensed data and machine learning algorithms offers cost-and time-effective approach for spatial prediction of soil properties and crop yield compared to conventional approaches. The objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate the role of remotely sensed images; (ii) compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms; and (iii) identify the importance of remotely sensed image-derived variables, in spatial prediction of soil properties and corn yield. This study integrated field based data on five soil properties (i.e., soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and pH) and yield monitor based corn yield data with multispectral aerial images and topographic data, both collected in 2013, from seven fields at the Molly Caren Farm near London, Ohio. Digital elevation model data, at a resolution of 1 m, was used to derive topographic properties of the fields. Multispectral images collected at bare-soil conditions, at a resolution 0.30 m, were used to derive soil and vegetation indices. Models developed for prediction of soil properties and corn yield using linear regression (LM) and five machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest (RF); Neural Network (NN); Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial and linear kernel functions; Gradient Boosting Model (GBM); and Cubist (CU)) were evaluated in terms of coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Machine learning algorithms were found to outperform LM algorithm for most of the times with a higher R2 and lower RMSE. Based on models for seven fields, on average, NN provided the highest accuracy for SOM (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.44) and CEC (R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.35); SVM for K (R2 = 0.21, RMSE = 0.49) and Mg (R2 = 0.22, RMSE = 4.57); and GBM for pH (R2 = 0.15, RMSE = 0.62). For corn yield, RF consistently outperformed other models and provided higher accuracy (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.97). Soil and vegetation indices based on bare-soil imagery played a more significant role in demonstrating in-field variability of corn yield and soil properties than topographic variables. The accuracy of the models developed for prediction of soil properties and corn yield observed in this study suggested that the approach of integrating remotely sensed data and machine learning algorithms are promising for mapping soil properties and corn yield at a local scale, which can be useful in locating areas of potential concerns and implementing site-specific farming practices.}

However, it is very difficult to detection objects from aerial images. The reason is that the scale of objects in the aerial images captured by UAVs varies greatly and needs to meet certain real-time performance in detection. To deal with these challenges, we proposed a lightweight model named DSYolov3. We made the following improvements to the Yolov3 model: 1) multiple scale-aware decision discrimination network to detect objects in different scales, 2) a multi-scale fusion-based channel attention model to exploit the channel-wise information complementation, 3) a sparsity-based channel pruning to compress the model. Extensive experimental evaluation has demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. By the proposed approach, we could not only achieve better performance than most existing detectors but also ensure the models practicable on the UAVs.}

Three standard deep learning methods of training a crack classifier using 1) a shallow convolutional neural network built from scratch, 2) the output features of the VGG16 network architecture previously trained on the general ImageNet dataset, and 3) the fine-tuned top layer of VGG16 are investigated. Data augmentation is used to reduce overfitting caused by the limited and imbalanced training dataset. The image dataset includes both fatigue test photographs and actual inspection photographs captured under uncontrolled distance, lighting, angle, and blurriness conditions. Data augmentation increased the accuracy index by 5%, 2%, and 5%, respectively, for the three methods. The fine-tuning methods achieved the best precision and recall scores and the best robustness. Slightly fine-tuning a well-trained fully connected layer together with the top convolutional layer of the VGG16 model in combination with data augmentation achieved the best performance for crack detection in gusset plate joints of steel bridges. Transfer learning methods using the output features of VGG16 achieved both improved accuracy and robustness and, therefore, are recommended for training a crack classifier.}

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can rapidly survey newly planted forest areas using high resolution imagery. Automated image processing techniques can cost-effectively examine large quantities of data. Correctly combined, such technologies can efficiently create accurate maps of seedling locations, which offers the prospect of management practices for forestry and ecology operations that involve less fieldwork. This paper presents a technique based on unsupervised machine learning for detecting healthy young pinus caribaea (Caribbean pine) and pinus radiata (Monterey pine) seedlings. The locations of individual trees requiring replacement are also determined based on the spatial distribution of the identified healthy trees. The approach was tested on data from 30 sites covering over 700 ha, with seedlings ranging from 9 months to 3 years’ old (mean tree heights 30–2 m). Test sites contained a range of geomorphologies and levels of weed infestation. The results indicate detection precision and specificity in excess of 90% and recall approaching 99% for dense point cloud resolution of 4–6 cm. As network pre-training is unnecessary, there is no need for high resolution imagery, which allows greater operational coverage per unit time. The algorithm may also be used on multi- or hyperspectral data; and may be useful if employed in conjunction with other supervised learning techniques to reduce the need for manual labelling of training data sets.}

Significant amount of research has been conducted on the aspect of networking for using drones as base stations to provide different services. In this work, we deviate from the traditional use of drones to provide connectivity and explore the delivery of products through drones in the context of maintaining social distancing. However, drone delivery process for critical applications such as delivering medical supplies is vulnerable to attacks such as impersonation attacks. The security of drone operation is important to save the users from any breaches that can lead to financial and physical losses. To cope with these security issues and to make the delivery process transparent, we propose a blockchain-based drone delivery system that registers and authenticates the participating entities including products (medical supplies), warehouse (medical centers) and drones. To this end, we utilize Ethereum platform for implementation of blockchain and smart contract and we present an analysis of different factors that influence the authentication process in terms of time and the number of transactions. Furthermore, to make the communication of a drone with command and control center more secure and robust, we use machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection system.}

This paper provides a review of several thermal performance assessment techniques and a broad classification based on measurement types, methods, and applications. Moreover, the article provides a comprehensive survey of various quantitative indices utilized for practical heat-loss assessment of building elements. This paper’s unique contribution is the proposed three-layer framework that details the handling and processing of UAS-based thermal imagery for heat loss quantification. Primarily, the novelty of this work lies in the application of an instance segmentation technique (Mask R–CNN) to compute the thermal transmittance values (e.g., U-values) for various objects (e.g., doors, walls, windows, and facades). To the best of our knowledge, this research work is first-of-its-kind using a sizeable thermal data repository (e.g. 100,000 augmented images). Multiple standard U-values are analyzed for windows and walls and compared with The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) building standards. The preliminary results of Mask-RCNN from over 100,000 trained (including augmented) images from multiple campus buildings yield the following performance metrics: 1) provides an Average Precision (AP) of 0.67 (windows) and 0.46 (facades); and 2) Intersection of Union (IoU) of 0.05 (windows) and 0.5 (facades) respectively. Moreover, the U-values are consistently close enough to the ASHRAE standards in distinguishing window types (e.g. 0.77 for single-pane windows and 0.38 for double-pane windows).}

This study evaluates the capability of a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, which can capture a spatially heterogeneous relationship between inputs and an output, to retrieve bathymetry of a shallow stream, of which water depth is less than about 1 m from simple RGB imagery. A field experiment was performed for measuring water depth and simultaneously for acquiring remotely-sensed data with RGB digital numbers (DN) using a digital camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A 2D shallow water model, which was validated by comparison with the field-surveyed data, was used to simulate the water depth of unmeasured regions. Band ratios of ln(DNG/DNR) was selected as an optimal spectral input of bathymetric inversion models through the principal component analysis (PCA). Results showed that global inversion models based on multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) resulted in large discrepancy between estimation and observation due to the spatially varying response of the PCA-selected band ratio to water depth over the experimental channel. In contrast, the GWR model successfully alleviated the biases of the conventional models as R2 increased to 0.85 from 0.60 by accurately modelling the effect of spatial heterogeneity, which arose from variable bottom types attributed to submerged vegetation, on the remote-sensing radiance-water depth relationship.}

The persistent mission without any human intervention on the battery charge is obtained by means of an on-field wind generator supplying a charge station that adopts resonant wireless power transfer. The objective of the fleet management is to provide the best connectivity over the time considering the variability of both the bandwidth request and the wind energy availability. The optimal management is performed by a system controller adopting reinforcement learning (RL) for deciding the number of drones to take off and, consequently, the instantaneous provided bandwidth. A constant charge time of drone battery represents a key element of the system because this enables to strongly reduce the complexity of the system controller task. To this purpose, an adaptive current control for the charge station is introduced to compensate charge time variabilities due to the coupling factor changes caused by misalignments that can occur between a pad and a drone. The results have highlighted that the RL provides good performance improvement in case of green generation. An important aspect arose from this study is the ability of RL to increase the saved energy even if it is not considered as a target of the controller.}

The challenges faced in this response phase are numerous, due to the limited availability of resources and the lack of centralized coordination, infrastructure and personnel. The logistical process of these type of operations is initiated with the assessment of the local situation after the emergency alert given by the authorities in the affected country or by the international community, depending on the scale and severity of the disaster or crisis, in a period up to 24 hours after the occurrence of the disaster.

The outdoor transmission model and outdoor–indoor transmission model cannot be normalized, and an effective hybrid transmission model is difficult to establish when the UAV serves both indoor users and outdoor users. We propose a ”indoor-outdoor-iterative optimization” (IOI) coverage scheme that does not require the establishment of a hybrid transmission model, that is, covering indoor users first, then outdoor users, and finally iterative optimization. When the outdoor user’s location information is unknown, the user’s required bandwidth and power cannot be accurately calculated. In order to obtain the location information of outdoor users, we propose a method to estimate outdoor user distribution (MEUD) by using user density. We further estimate the transmit power of all users, and greatly reduce the calculation amount. Simulation results show that the greater the user density, the closer the estimated value is to the accurate value. By user’s distribution, we propose a scheme based on 3D location, power and bandwidth allocation, which can maximize the coverage of indoor users and outdoor users and ensure the fairness of all users. According to the size relationship between the remaining resources and the resources required by outdoor users, we divide the situation into three cases. The feasibility of the scheme is discussed in three cases, and specific algorithms are given respectively. Finally, we give a comprehensive algorithm based on three cases. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm and ensure that the gap in communication rate between users of MEUD is less than 0.5%.}

As the most widely used FVC extraction method, the photographic method has the advantages of simple operation and high extraction accuracy. However, when soil moisture and acquisition times vary, the extraction results are less accurate. To accommodate various conditions of FVC extraction, this study proposes a new FVC extraction method that extracts FVC from a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) greyscale image of wheat by using a density peak k-means (DPK-means) algorithm. In this study, Yangfumai 4 (YF4) planted in pots and Yangmai 16 (Y16) planted in the field were used as the research materials. With a hyperspectral imaging camera mounted on a tripod, ground hyperspectral images of winter wheat under different soil conditions (dry and wet) were collected at 1 m above the potted wheat canopy. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral images of winter wheat at various stages were collected at 50 m above the field wheat canopy by a UAV equipped with a hyperspectral camera. The pixel dichotomy method and DPK-means algorithm were used to classify vegetation pixels and non-vegetation pixels in NDVI greyscale images of wheat, and the extraction effects of the two methods were compared and analysed. The results showed that extraction by pixel dichotomy was influenced by the acquisition conditions and its error distribution was relatively scattered, while the extraction effect of the DPK-means algorithm was less affected by the acquisition conditions and its error distribution was concentrated. The absolute values of error were 0.042 and 0.044, the root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.028 and 0.030, and the fitting accuracy R2 of the FVC was 0.87 and 0.93, under dry and wet soil conditions and under various time conditions, respectively. This study found that the DPK-means algorithm was capable of achieving more accurate results than the pixel dichotomy method in various soil and time conditions and was an accurate and robust method for FVC extraction.}

abstract = {We describe the development of tools to exploit the enormous resource of street-level imagery in Google Street View to characterize food cultivation practices along roadside transects at very high spatial resolution as a potential complement to traditional remote sensing approaches. We report on two software tools for crop identification using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to Google Street View imagery. The first, a multi-class classifier distinguishes seven regionally common cultivated plant species, as well as uncultivated vegetation, built environment, and water along the roads. The second, a prototype specialist detector, recognizes the presence of a single plant species: in our case, banana. These two classification tools were tested along roadside transects in two areas of Thailand, a country where there is good Google Street View coverage. On the entire test set, the overall accuracy of the multi-class classifier was 83.3%. For several classes, (banana, built, cassava, maize, rice, and sugarcane), the producer's accuracy was over 90%, meaning that the classifier was infrequently making omission errors. This performance on roadside transects is comparable with that of some remote-sensing classifiers, yet ours does not require any additional site-visits for ground-truthing. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the classifier on the 40% of images it is most sure about is excellent: 99.0%. For the prototype specialist detector, the area under the ROC curve was 0.9905, indicating excellent performance in detecting the presence of banana plants. While initially tested over the road network in a small area, this technique could readily be deployed on a regional or even national scale to supplement remote sensing data and yield a fine-grained analysis of food cultivation activities along roadside transects.}

abstract = {To perform robust and efficient fruit detection in orchards is challenging since there are a number of variances in the working environments. Recently, deep-learning have shown a promising performance in many visual-guided agriculture applications. However, deep-learning based approaches requires labelling on training data, which is a labour-intensive and time-consuming task. In this study, a fast implementation framework of a deep-learning based fruit detector for apple harvesting is developed. The developed framework comprises an auto label generation module and a deep-learning-based fruit detector ‘LedNet’. The Label Generation algorithm utilises the multi-scale pyramid and clustering classifier to assist fast labelling of training data. LedNet adopts feature pyramid network and atrous spatial pyramid pooling to improve the detection performance of the model. A light-weight backbone is also developed and utilised to improve computational efficiency. From the experimental results, LedNet achieves 0.821 and 0.853 on recall and accuracy on apple detection in orchards, and its weights size and inference time are 7.4 M and 28 ms, respectively. The experimental results show that LedNet can perform real-time apple detection in orchards robustly and efficiently.}

The first interface is the standard RC Joystick (RCJ) controller, the second interface is the multimodal speech and visual gesture (mSVG) interface, and the third interface is the modified version of the RCJ interface with altitude, attitude, and position (AAP) assist. The modified RCJ interface was achieved with the aid of the Keyboard (KBD). A model of the mSVG interface previously designed and tested was used in this comparison. An experiment study was designed to measure the completion time and navigation accuracy of participants using each of the three interfaces, on a developed path_v02 test flight path. Thirty-seven (37) participants volunteered. The NASA task load index (TLX) survey questionnaire was administered at the end of each interface experiment to access the participants experience and to estimate the interface cognitive workload. A commercial software, the RealFlight Drone Simulator (RFDS) was used to estimate the RCJ skill level of the participants. From the results of the experiment, it was shown that the flying hours, the number of months flying, and the RFDS Level 4 challenge performance was a good estimator for participants RCJ flying skill level. A two-way result was obtained in the comparison of the RCJ and mSVG interfaces. It was concluded that, although the mSVG was better than the standard RCJ interface, the AAP-assisted RCJ was found to be as effective as (in some cases better than) the mSVG interface. It was also shown, from the speech gesture ratio result, that the participants had a preference for gesture over speech when using the mSVG interface. Some further works such as an outdoor field test and a performance comparison at higher nCA levels were suggested.}

First, a full-order sliding mode surface in a decentralized manner is designed to incorporate both the individual position tracking error and the synchronized formation error while the UAV group is engaged in building a certain desired geometric pattern in three dimensional space. Second, a decentralized virtual plant controller is constructed which allows the embedded low-pass filter to attain the chattering free property of the sliding mode controller. In addition, robust adaptive technique is integrated in the decentralized chattering free sliding control design in order to handle unknown bounded uncertainties, without requirements for assuming a priori knowledge of bounds on the system uncertainties as stated in conventional chattering free control methods. Subsequently, system robustness as well as stability of the decentralized full-order sliding mode control of multiple UAVs is synthesized. Numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control framework to achieve robust 3D formation flight of the multi-UAV system.}

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) algorithms are the state of the art in automated classification of wildlife camera trap images. The challenge is that the ecologist cannot know in advance how many images per species they need to collect for model training in order to achieve their desired classification accuracy. In fact there is limited empirical evidence in the context of camera trapping to demonstrate that increasing sample size will lead to improved accuracy. In this study we explore in depth the issues of deep learning model performance for progressively increasing per class (species) sample sizes. We also provide ecologists with an approximation formula to estimate how many images per animal species they need for certain accuracy level a priori. This will help ecologists for optimal allocation of resources, work and efficient study design. In order to investigate the effect of number of training images; seven training sets with 10, 20, 50, 150, 500, 1000 images per class were designed. Six deep learning architectures namely ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, DnsNet-121, DnsNet-161, and DnsNet-201 were trained and tested on a common exclusive testing set of 250 images per class. The whole experiment was repeated on three similar datasets from Australia, Africa and North America and the results were compared. Simple regression equations for use by practitioners to approximate model performance metrics are provided. Generalizes additive models (GAM) are shown to be effective in modelling DL performance metrics based on the number of training images per class, tuning scheme and dataset. Overall, our trained models classified images with 0.94 accuracy (ACC), 0.73 precision (PRC), 0.72 true positive rate (TPR), and 0.03 false positive rate (FPR). Variation in model performance metrics among datasets, species and deep learning architectures exist and are shown distinctively in the discussion section. The ordinary least squares regression models explained 57%, 54%, 52%, and 34% of expected variation of ACC, PRC, TPR, and FPR according to number of images available for training. Generalised additive models explained 77%, 69%, 70%, and 53% of deviance for ACC, PRC, TPR, and FPR respectively. Predictive models were developed linking number of training images per class, model, dataset to performance metrics. The ordinary least squares regression and Generalised additive models developed provides a practical toolbox to estimate model performance with respect to different numbers of training images.}

abstract = {Demand for food and other agricultural products is projected to increase by 50% globally by 2050. This increasing food demand places growing pressure on agricultural production at a time where there is little scope to expand agricultural lands. In addition, other constraining factors, such as climatic and soil constraints negatively impact agricultural productivity at global scale. To help ensure future food security, we must improve soil-crop management practices to achieve optimum productivity. One major area where productivity could be improved is for crops grown on dispersive sodic soils, which currently affect over 581 million ha worldwide. One strategy is to identify crops and/or cultivars that are more stress tolerant and productive on sodic soil and can improve agricultural productivity. However, limited work has been done to identify tolerant varieties and there is a pressing need for innovative and improved solutions to identify stress tolerance. In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based thermal imaging has been widely used in precision agriculture for detecting crop diseases and stress, and this technique has significant potential to also assess crop performance on sodic soils. In this review, we present the current understanding of how thermal imaging techniques can provide a viable technological solution to monitor crop temperature and quantify abiotic stress, which is one of the major causes for yield loss of the major rain-fed field crops, particularly wheat. To the best of our knowledge, no such detailed review has been published. Being able to identify plant stress is a primary requirement to identify more or less tolerant species or cultivars grown on sodic soil under rain-fed conditions. The aim of this review is to provide a clear and concise summary of the impacts of abiotic stress on crops and the use of UAV-thermal imaging, including sensors and calibration, data processing, advantages, and limitations in crop phenotyping, and particularly quantifying abiotic stress to help sustain productivity in sodic soil environments.}

Using LiDAR and imaging sensors mounted on multirotor UAVs, we can observe fine-scale crop variations that can help improve fertilizer management and maximize yields. In this study we used UAV mounted LiDAR and multispectral imaging sensors to monitor two sugarcane field trials with variable nitrogen (N) fertilization inputs in the Wet Tropics region of Australia. From six surveys performed at 42-day intervals, we monitored crop growth in terms of height, density and vegetation indices. In each survey period, we estimated a set of models to predict at-harvest biomass at fine scale (2m×2m plots). We compared the predictive performance of models based on multispectral predictors only, LiDAR predictors only, a fusion of multispectral and LiDAR predictors, and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) benchmark. We found that predictive performance peaked early in the season, at 100–142 days after the previous harvest (DAH), and declined closer to the harvest date. At peak performance (i.e. 142 DAH), the multispectral model performed slightly better (R¯2=0.57) than the LiDAR model (R¯2=0.52), with both outperforming NDVI benchmark (R¯2=0.34). This, however, flipped later in the season, with LiDAR performing slightly better than the multispectral imaging and NDVI benchmark. Interestingly, the fusion model did not perform significantly better than the multispectral model at 100–142 DAH, nor better than LiDAR in subsequent periods. We also estimated a model to predict contemporaneous leaf N content (%) using multispectral imagery, which demonstrated an R¯2 of 0.57. Our results are of particular interest to nutrient management programs aiming to deliver N fertilizer guidelines for sustainable sugarcane production, as both fine-scale biomass and leaf N content predictions are feasible when management interventions are still possible (i.e. as early as at 100 DAH).}

abstract = {Land degradation is a major environmental and social issue in temperate steppes. It is commonly determined from vegetation cover using remote sensing techniques. Steppes in eastern Mongolia are subject to resource extraction activities, such as mining and oil extraction, which affect land degradation. Recent technological progress in remote sensing has facilitated the acquirement of high-resolution data by, for example, the CubeSat satellite or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), providing data for detailed maps of vegetation cover and plant functional groups (PFGs). Traditional methods for monitoring vegetation cover often face typical scale issues, such as the upscaling of vegetation parameters if plot-scale field measurements are integrated to satellite data. Here, we studied the spatial distribution of PFG using machine learning and a combination of field measurements, UAV imagery (spatial resolution: 2 cm), and PlanetScope multi-temporal imagery. We provide two products at two spatial resolutions: one for UAV data, which is restricted to comparatively small areas around field measurements, and one for PlanetScope, which covers large parts of northeastern Mongolia. The results showed that the overall accuracies of UAV classification were 91–95%, whereas those of PlanetScope were 78–95%. In integrating the classified UAV data to the PlaneScope data, our proposed model minimized the scale issue that often impedes classification. Importantly, our findings revealed that the ecological effects of dirt road and railroad extended up to 60–120 m into the adjacent, otherwise less degraded steppe vegetation. A comparison between burned and unburned areas in different years indicates that wildfires affect the composition of PFG in reducing the fractional cover of graminoids and forbs, and that increasing cover of bare ground leads to a distinct and patchy mosaic of different vegetation types.}

Reliable methods and tools are required for appropriate selection of traits, may provide a better understanding of crop responses to multiple stresses, especially in sodic soil. A novel strategy was developed using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-thermal imaging and agglomerative hierarchical clustering-based techniques to evaluate and rank the physiological performance of 18 contrasting wheat genotypes grown on a moderately sodic and a highly sodic soil in north-eastern Australia. We obtained UAV-thermal imaging data at different times of the day (9:30, 12:00, and 15:00 hrs) close to flowering stage. Crop biophysical parameters (Leaf potassium concentration, normalized difference vegetation index, crop water uptake, stomatal conductance, plant moisture content, and aboveground biomass) were measured at close to flowering by destructive plant sampling and ground-based proximal sensing and yield was machine harvested at maturity. Canopy temperatures derived from thermal imagery between 28.9 and 35.4 °C were observed at the moderately sodic site, and between 36.2 and 41.0 °C at the highly sodic site from 9:30 to 15:00 hrs. Canopy temperature was consistently higher than corresponding ambient air temperatures indicating plant water stress at both sites. While the air temperature was not significantly different (p > 0.05) between the two sites, canopy temperature was significantly higher (p < 0.01) on highly sodic soil compared to moderately sodic soil, indicating greater water stress at the highly sodic site. This difference was most likely due to the adverse impacts of sodic soil constraints and not primarily due to environmental variations. Hence, our study revealed that sodic soil constraints can intensify plant water stress. Statistical analysis between canopy temperature (9:30, 12:00, and 15:00 hrs) and crop biophysical parameters showed close negative correlations at both moderately sodic (R2 = 0.54 to 0.83) and highly sodic (R2 = 0.30 to 0.89) sites. A closer correlation was observed at 15:00 hrs for both sites. Thus, high-resolution UAV-thermal imaging has potential to detect water-stressed plants on sodic soil. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used as an unsupervised machine learning tool for ranking of physiological performance of wheat genotypes. Results suggest that UAV-thermal imaging and AHC techniques can discriminate cultivars tolerant to sodicity. The study improves our understanding of crop physiological behaviour and can assist farmers in selection of water stress tolerant genotypes to sustain food security in sodic soil under water-limited environments.}

abstract = {Oxygen excess ratio (OER) tracking of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) air-feed subsystem is an interesting topic to obtain a high energy conversion ratio. The control purpose is challenging due to the unknown nonlinear function, time-varying external disturbance and unmeasured variable. To deal with the above problems, a neural network control scheme based on tracking error observer and disturbance observer is proposed. Firstly, a canonical form of the PEMFC air-feed subsystem is developed based on the input–output feedback linearization method. Meanwhile, a tracking error observer which only uses the system output is developed for the reconstruction of the unmeasured variable. Secondly, the neural network based on a novel adaptive learning law is proposed to approximate the unknown nonlinear function. An identification model with a second-order low-pass filter is designed such that the adaptive learning law is adjusted by the observer error and modeling error, simultaneously. Finally, to reduce the effect caused by compound disturbance including the external disturbance and neural network approximation error, a nonlinear disturbance observer is proposed. The main contribution of this study is not only avoiding the prior knowledge of system uncertainty, external disturbance and the unmeasured variable but also improving the OER tracking performance under the measurement noise. Lyapunov theory analysis shows that the system tracking error is uniformly ultimately bounded. Numerical simulations and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments show that the proposed neural network control algorithm can maintain OER at the target value even under external disturbance. The experimental results show that the performance indexes including the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean square error (RMSE) and the standard deviation (SD) of the proposed controller during the whole process are 0.0213, 0.0547 and 0.0538, respectively.

abstract = {Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a prospective technology to enhance the computing power of mobile devices by offloading the tasks to MEC server. Due to the limited size of mobile devices, the insufficient of battery becomes a serious problem. Wireless power transfer (WPT) and mobile devices cooperation can extend the endurance of mobile devices. Integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) into wireless powered MEC system, the energy collection efficiency can be improved with the short direct path power transfer. However, mobile devices will interfere with each other by utilizing the same bandwidth during the devices cooperation. In this paper, we proposed an anti-interference UAV powered cooperative mobile edge computing scheme, in which mobile devices utilizes different subcarriers to transmit the information. Moreover, a resource optimization problem is formulated to minimize the transmit energy of the UAV through joint subcarriers and power allocation of mobile devices with the constraints of delay and computing tasks size. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.}

abstract = {This article investigates the problem of deploying a swarm of UAVs equipped with gas sensors for industrial remote gas-plume sensing. This setup’s objective is to continuously adjust the swarm formation to maximize the combined perception for the dynamically evolved plume’s cloud, focusing around areas with the highest concentration/intensity. Initially, such a setup is formulated into an optimization problem, the solution of which could be acquired by the maximization of an appropriately defined objective function. Due to the model-free approach, this objective function’s analytical form is not available, prohibiting standard gradient descent methodologies. To this end, a tracking algorithm is developed and studied, which operates in a distributed manner and enables the UAV swarm to build a common consensus dynamically, during the evolution of the leakage phenomenon. The overall performance is tested in a simulative yet realistic environment using ANSYS Fluent suite, considering a simultaneous gas-leak incident at two different points. Aside from the standalone evaluation study, the proposed gas-plume tracking scheme is able to outperform a state-of-the-art alternative algorithm, namely Efficient Global Optimization (EGO), in various simulation setups, deploying a different number of UAVs on the field.}

Trajectory optimization is a promising way to achieve superior flight time because of the finite solar energy absorbed in a day. In this work, a method of trajectory optimization and guidance for HALE solar-powered aircraft based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework is introduced. According to flight and environment information, a neural network controller outputs commands of thrust, attack angle, and bank angle to realize an autonomous flight based on energy maximization. The validity of the proposed method was evaluated in a 5-km radius area in simulation, and results have shown that after one day-night cycle, the battery energy of the RL-controller was improved by 31% and 17% compared with those of a steady-state strategy with a constant speed and a constant altitude and a kind of state-machine strategy, respectively. In addition, results of an uninterrupted flight test have shown that the endurance of the RL controller was longer than those of the control cases.}

abstract = {Mapping accurately vegetation surfaces in space and time in the ice-free areas of Antarctica can provide important information to quantitatively describe the evolution of their ecosystems. Spaceborne remote sensing is the adequate way to map and evaluate multitemporal changes on the Antarctic vegetation at large but its nature of occurrence, in relatively small and sparse patches, makes the identification very challenging. The inclusion of an intermediate scale of observation between ground and satellite scales, provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery, is of great help not only for their effective classification, but also for discriminating their main communities (lichens and mosses). Thus, this paper quantifies accurately recent changes of the vegetated areas in Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica) through a novel methodology based on the integration of multiplatform data (satellite and UAV). It consists of multiscale imagery (spatial resolution of 2 m and 2 cm) from the same period to create a robust classifier that, after intensive calibration, is adequately used in other dates, where field reference data is scarce or not available at all. The methodology is developed and tested with UAV and satellite data from 2017 showing overall accuracies of 96% and kappa equal to 0.94 with a SVM classifier. These high performances allow the extrapolation to a pair of previous dates, 2006 and 2013, when atmospherically clear very high-resolution satellite imagery are available. The classification allows verifying a loss of the total area of vegetation of 4.5% during the 11-year time period under analysis, which corresponds to a 10.3% reduction for Usnea sp. and 9.8% for moss formations. Nevertheless, the breakdown analysis by time period shows a distinct behaviour for each vegetation type which are evaluated and discussed, namely for Usnea sp. whose decline is likely to be related to changing snow conditions.}

Rice architecture is a key aspect of its domestication and a major factor that limits its high productivity. The ideal rice culm structure, including major_axis_culm, minor axis_culm, and wall thickness_culm, is critical for improving lodging resistance. However, the traditional method of measuring rice culms is destructive, time consuming, and labor intensive. In this study, we used a high-throughput micro-CT-RGB imaging system and deep learning (SegNet) to develop a high-throughput micro-CT image analysis pipeline that can extract 24 rice culm morphological traits and lodging resistance-related traits. When manual and automatic measurements were compared at the mature stage, the mean absolute percentage errors for major_axis_culm, minor_axis_culm, and wall_thickness_culm in 104 indica rice accessions were 6.03%, 5.60%, and 9.85%, respectively, and the R2 values were 0.799, 0.818, and 0.623. We also built models of bending stress using culm traits at the mature and tillering stages, and the R2 values were 0.722 and 0.544, respectively. The modeling results indicated that this method can quantify lodging resistance nondestructively, even at an early growth stage. In addition, we also evaluated the relationships of bending stress to shoot dry weight, culm density, and drought-related traits and found that plants with greater resistance to bending stress had slightly higher biomass, culm density, and culm area but poorer drought resistance. In conclusion, we developed a deep learning-integrated micro-CT image analysis pipeline to accurately quantify the phenotypic traits of rice culms in ∼4.6 min per plant; this pipeline will assist in future high-throughput screening of large rice populations for lodging resistance.}

The delineation process of identifying such regions in cities requires a lot of resources. While there are various studies that identify informal settlements based on satellite image classification, relying on both supervised or unsupervised machine learning approaches, these models either require multiple input data to function or need further development with regards to precision. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for identifying and informal settlements using street intersection data. With such minimal input data, we attempt to provide planners and policy-makers with a pragmatic tool that can aid in identifying informal zones in cities. The algorithm of the model is based on spatial statistics and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The proposed model relies on defining informal settlements based on two ubiquitous characteristics of informal settlements. We applied the model in five major cities in Egypt and India that have spatial structures in which informality is present. These cities are Greater Cairo, Alexandria, Hurghada and Minya in Egypt, and Mumbai in India. The predictSLUMS model shows high validity and accuracy for identifying and predicting informality within the same city the model was trained on or in different ones of a similar context. To enable this model to be used as a pragmatic tool for future prediction or further research concerning informal settlements and slums, we have made the python code for the pre-trained ANN models of the five studied cities.}

Firstly, we present a search probability map based environmental model, and formulate a multi-UAV cooperative search path optimization problem. Then, we propose a solution strategy based on an improved intelligent water drops (IWD) optimization algorithm. Compared with the traditional IWD algorithm, the proposed algorithm can simultaneously model the cooperation and competition among UAVs by introducing several heterogeneous water drop populations and a co-evolutionary mechanism. Water drops in the same population cooperate with each other, whereas water drops among different populations compete with each other to obtain the optimal path and reduce meaningless search effort. Meanwhile, the proposed algorithm can improve its search capability using a new soil update mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over other baselines.}

abstract = {Real-time tracking of the dynamic intrusion targets consists of two crucial factors: the path forecast of the target and real-time path optimization of multi-UAV target tracking. For the first one, the uncertainty of the target trajectory is an obstacle to realizing real-time tracking. Thus a trajectory prediction method is proposed in this paper to ensure the sampling period of the target. Owing to the poor prediction accuracy of the single-step trajectory, a multi-step Unscented Kalman Filter (MUKF) is proposed to forecast its multi-step trajectory further in different regions. For the second one, there are two problems: poor optimization accuracy of the tracking trajectory and larger local optimization deviation, which will cause failure of the regional tracking. Under this circumstance, a hybrid algorithm called SAQPSO is proposed, combining the specific mechanism of two intelligence algorithms. The annealing mechanism in the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is used to modify the Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm. Then the characteristic of quantum particles is used to update the population and enhance global searchability. Furthermore, to testify the effectiveness of the trajectory optimization algorithm and related target prediction method, a specific simulation environment is given as an example, in which the tracking trajectories of eight different algorithms are compared. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

The purpose of this monitoring is to provide an advantage in terms of on-farm management decision making, crop marketing planning, and support for policy decision-making. We identified here which VI's can be used to predict soybean grain yield (GY) by using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and remote multispectral sensor. For this purpose, experiments were carried out in three sites during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons in Brazil. The VI's were measured together with the plant stand assessment at 25 days after emergency (DAE) when the plants were at V4 phenological stage. The processing of the VI models was performed based on the imaging reflectance factor data performed in the field. For statistical data analyses, a correlation network was used to express the relationship between GY and VI's graphically. Path analysis was performed for identifying the cause-and-effect relationship between VI's and GY. Subsequently, a decision tree algorithm was generated considering GY as a dependent variable. At last, the relative deviation coefficient was used to illustrate the differences between the VI's in the construction of the decision tree and GY. Our results showed potential for predicting soybean yield based on UAV and the multispectral sensor coupled. SAVI and NDVI indices stood out for predicting yield, where the regions with the highest values of these indices can obtain the highest yield observed in the field, providing an advantage in management at the property level.}

abstract = {Accurate information regarding the weight of vehicle loads plays a significant role in maintaining the structural health of bridges. However, the only method currently available for ascertaining the weight of loads is the bridge weigh-in-motion (BWIM) system, which is not widely used because of the high cost of the large device involved. There is therefore a need to develop an effective, low-cost technology to ascertain vehicle loads in relation to spatiotemporal load distribution on long-span bridges. This paper proposes a non-contact vehicle identification methodology to distinguish a vehicle from its load based on machine vision technology and deep learning algorithms. The vehicle information (i.e., type, weight, position, and motion trajectory, etc.) is conveniently obtained from a roadside monitoring surveillance camera, while the axle-weight distribution interval for nine classified vehicle types is obtained from the statistical information of 8402 delivery vehicles from which the relationship between a unique vehicle type and the corresponding weight information is established. Meanwhile, a dataset containing 8624 vehicle images was established for training the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), where nine rough-grained vehicle classifications were contained in order to enhance the generalizability of the network. Optimization analysis was conducted to improve the network accuracy in vehicle types identification. The position of vehicles can also be effectively detected by a faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN), where the pre-trained DCNN with 98.17% vehicle types classification accuracy is employed as the co-shared network layer to enhance computation efficiency. Utilizing the object detection results from the Faster R-CNN and utilizing a Kalman filter, a vehicle in motion could also be simultaneously real-time tracked by the monitoring video, while a graphical user interface (GUI) incorporated into the video camera enabled automatic identification. A post-processing module has been established based on the proposed method, and a field test was conducted to validate the reliability of the system.}

abstract = {Objective, accurate, and fast assessment of civil infrastructure conditions is critical to timely assess safety risks. Current practices rely on visual observations and manual interpretation of reports and sketches prepared by inspectors in the field, which are labor intensive, subject to personal judgment and experience, and prone to error. Terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) are promising for automatically identifying structural condition indicators, as they are capable of providing coverage for large areas with accuracy at long ranges. Major challenges in using this technology are in storing significant amount of data and extracting appropriate features enabling condition assessment. This paper proposes a novel adaptive wavelet neural network (WNN)-based approach to compress data into a combination of low- and high-resolution surfaces, and automatically detect concrete cracks and other forms of damage. The adaptive WNN is designed to sequentially self-organize and self-adapt in order to construct an optimized representation. The architecture of the WNN is based on a single-layer neural network consisting of Mexican hat wavelet functions. The strategy is to first construct a low-resolution representation of the point cloud, then detect and localize anomalies, and finally construct a high-resolution representation around these anomalies to enhance their characterization. The approach was verified on four cracked concrete specimens. The experimental results show that the proposed approach was capable of fitting the point cloud, and of detecting and fitting the crack. The results demonstrated data compression of 99.4%, 72.2%, 92.4% and 78.9% for the four specimens when using low resolution fit for crack detection. For specimens 1, 2 and 3, 97.1%, 42.5% and 63.9% compression of data were obtained for crack localization, which is a significant improvement over previous TLS based crack detection and measurement approaches. Using the proposed method for crack detection would enable automatic and remote assessment of structural conditions. This would, in turn, result in reducing costs associated with infrastructure management, and improving the overall quality of our infrastructure by enhancing maintenance operations.}

The improved swarm control algorithm can help to make all agents accurately track the speed of virtual leaders. Then, we introduce the conception of virtual communication circle to control the communication power of each UAV, and the moving function of the target position is improved to meet the limited conditions of given communication distance, to ensure the non-collision and stable communication of the UAV during the moving process. All UAVs in the group system will keep converging, avoiding collision and the speed is the same as that of the virtual pilot. Therefore, multiple UAVs can track the virtual pilot for cluster flight and a distributed cooperative control strategy can be acquired. The simulation results show that the strategy proposed in this paper makes a better communication performance among UAVs in real time, and the UAV groups achieve the information more timely, which is proved to be an effective way to ensure the security communication among multiple UAVs.}

Results show that in general the one-dimension convolutional neural network model outperforms the long-short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) and the bidirectional LSTM-RNN models.

In this paper, taking privacy concern and competition among providers into consideration, we utilize RL technique to design a privacy-preserving incentive mechanism for multiple providers and multiple IoT devices. Specifically, we model the pricing and demand problem of providers and IoT devices as a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game, in which the providers work as leaders to determine their prices first, and then the IoT devices determine their demands as followers. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game. Due to privacy concern, providers and IoT devices are unwilling to disclose their own parameters, which makes the derivation of NE becoming a great challenge. To address this problem, a new RL-based Pricing Mechanism (RLPM) is proposed, which enables providers to learn their optimal pricing strategies without knowing private information of other participants. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the convergence and effectiveness of the RLPM compared with other existing algorithms.}

abstract = {Tea (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide. Tea leaves are plucked by hand or using a machine. Hand plucking prevents broken leaves and ensures that only the most essentially favorable parts are plucked (e.g., one tip with two leaves [OTTL]); thus, hand-plucked tea usually has high economic value. Localizing the plucking points of tea is the first step to develop a high-quality tea-plucking machine. In this study, we proposed to identify the plucking points of tea shoots in fields using machine vision and deep learning. In the study, images of various tea bush varieties were acquired from tea gardens using digital cameras and cell phones. A faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) was first trained to detect OTTL regions in the images. A fully convolutional network (FCN) was subsequently trained to identify the plucking points in the OTTL regions. The Faster R-CNN model achieved a precision of 79% and a recall of 90%. The FCN achieved a mean accuracy of 84.91% and a mean intersection-over-union of 70.72%. The experiment demonstrated that the developed algorithms can also be used on varieties other than those used to train the model.}

Data aggregation approaches based on Compressive Sensing (CS) enjoy the benefits of having their traffic volume reduced. However, existing CS-based data aggregation schemes have drawbacks, such as errors in data reconstruction process and the large overheads in regenerating and broadcasting feasible measurement matrices when the network is scaled up. To this end, we propose a topology-aware data aggregation (TADA) protocol, which preserves the advantages of CS-based schemes while alleviating the aforementioned issues. Extensive performance comparisons demonstrate that the data reconstruction error rate of TADA is much lower than other CS-based schemes under test. More important, for most WSN applications, since the underlying physical layer prefers frames with small payloads, the proposed TADA utilizes less transmissions from sensors to UAV in each round of data aggregation, and thus can yields a lower energy consumption.}

abstract = {Wildfires occurring near and within cities are a potential threat to the population's life and health and can cause significant economic damage by destroying infrastructure and private property. Due to the relatively small area of these wildlands, the accuracy of fire risk-assessment plays a significant role in fire management. Introducing the experience of real events can improve accuracy. But this approach is limited by a lack of knowledge of pre-fire conditions, mainly vegetation characteristics as related to their definition as a fuel parameter because of their high temporal variation. To solve this problem, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was designed to reconstruct the spectral characteristics of the vegetation just before the fire with spatial resolution 0.5–2 m from the Landsat image. To test the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the approach has been examined on urban vegetation sites and applied to restore spectral information of the actual vegetation patch before it was burned in 2016 in Haifa, Israel. The results show that the reconstructed RGB image allows for mapping the location of green vegetation with high spatial accuracy. However, spectral data in the visible range have some limitations when it comes to identifying differences between soil and dry plants. The reconstructed image was used to sharp the original data from Landsat. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index maps were produced from the resulting high-resolution multispectral image. The output maps allow to determine the location of vegetation and estimate the level of its dryness on the urban wildland landscape. The proposed method aims to estimate vegetation dryness and, as a result, identify the fuel characteristics at the time of the fire. It has the potential of using for evaluation and improve the weights of the input parameters for the fire-risk assessment and fire-behavior modeling on a specific area.}

Furthermore, vision-based approaches can cause errors, considering the complex types of deterioration that develop in different scales and forms in monuments.

This study aims to develop a model that automatically detects and maps deteriorations (biological colonization, contour scaling, crack, higher plant, impact damage, microkarst, missing part) and restoration interventions using the Mask R-CNN algorithm, which has recently come to the fore with its feature of recognizing small and large-sized objects. To this end, a total of 2460 images of Yazılıkaya monuments in the Hattusa archeological site, which is on the UNESCO heritage list, were gathered. In the training phase of the proposed method, it was trained in model 1 to distinguish deposit deterioration commonly observed on the surface of monuments from other anomalies. Other anomalies trained were model 2. In this phase of the models, the average precision values with high accuracy rates ranging from 89.624% to 100% were obtained for the deterioration classes. The developed algorithms were tested on 4 different rock reliefs in Yazılıkaya, which were not used in the training phase. In addition, an image of the Eflatunpınar water monument, which is on the UNESCO tentative list, was used to test the model's universality. According to the test results, it was determined that the models could be successfully applied to obtain maps of deterioration and restoration interventions in monuments in different regions.}

At the present stage, the battlefield reconnaissance and communication network mainly depends on the cooperation of soldiers. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle and pilotless technology, in the background of information warfare, the use of mobile agents to complete the formation of battlefield communication networks and the battlefield situation awareness has become a new trend. The Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology is becoming more and more mature, and its distribution, synergy, parallelism, robustness and intelligence provide the basic conditions for the construction of a battlefield self organizing network. In this paper, we use UAVs and unmanned combat vehicles to build a mobile ad hoc network that meets the conditions of the battlefield. The network can solve the problem of slow convergence or non convergence of the traditional self-organizing network without relying on the fixed basic network facilities, which has the characteristics of rapid expansion, strong destruction resistance and no centrality. So it can meet the needs of communication in the battlefield. In this process, we combine the A star algorithm with the ant colony algorithm to realize the real-time path planning in combination with the edge computing power of the agent and the battlefield situation collected by the sensor, and the battlefield aggregation and search task can be completed quickly. And according to the planned route, the route forwarding strategy under known path is used to complete the information transmission.}

abstract = {During the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) reconnaissance missions in the middle-low troposphere, the reconnaissance images are blurred and degraded due to the scattering process of aerosol under fog, haze and other weather conditions, which reduce the image contrast and color fidelity. Considering the characteristics of UAV itself, this paper proposes a new algorithm for dehazing UAV reconnaissance images based on layered scattering model. The algorithm starts with the atmosphere scattering model, using the imaging distance, squint angle and other metadata acquired by the UAV. Based on the original model, a layered scattering model for dehazing is proposed. Considering the relationship between wave-length and extinction coefficient, the airlight intensity and extinction coefficient are calculated in the model. Finally, the restored images are obtained. In addition, a classification method based on Bayesian classification is used for classification of haze concentration of the image, avoiding the trouble of manual working. Then we evaluate the haze removal results according to both the subjective and objective criteria. The experimental results show that compared with the origin image, the comprehensive index of the image restored by our method increases by 282.84%, which proves that our method can obtain excellent dehazing effect.}

The Yangtze River Basin in China accounts for one-fifth of the rapeseed yield in the world. However, the fragmented farming lands in the Yangtze River Basin make it difficult to accurately monitor winter oilseed rape growth at large scale using the medium-resolution satellite data. The low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides a feasible way to accurately and non-destructively estimate AGB in winter oilseed rape at the plot level. In this study, we evaluated the contributions of vegetation indices (VIs) and texture metrics, derived from multispectral images captured by the camera mounted on a UAV, to predict the AGB in winter oilseed rape. The AGB was estimated with (1) multiple VIs and (2) multiple VIs and texture metrics. The partial least square regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF) regression models were trained with datasets of the experiment in 2016–2017 and 2017–2018, and then applied to predict AGB of the 2018–2019 growth season. Results demonstrated that the incorporation of texture metrics to both PLSR and RF models provided more accurate estimations of AGB in winter oilseed rape than the models based solely on VIs. The accuracy of the AGB predicted by the RF regression model using VIs and texture metrics (RMSE = 274.18 kg/ha for the validation dataset) was slightly higher than the results of the PLSR model (RMSE = 284.09 kg/ha for the validation dataset). According to the evaluation of the important variables, the red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge) and ratio vegetation index (RVI) were selected as the most important input features by PLSR and RF regression models. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) contrast was selected as an important texture metrics for the AGB prediction, indicating that NDVI contrast could be a sensitive indicator of the spatial distribution of shadow caused by the different amount of biomass. This study suggested the great potential of UAV in estimating the plot-level AGB by combining VIs and texture metrics.}

We analyze the control results under different working conditions by using adaptive fuzzy-PID. Through simulation and experimental studies, we can draw the conclusions as follows: compared with PID control method, firstly, AFR control error can be reduced by 80% in normal condition; secondly, the control error is reduced by 55% in rapid acceleration condition; in addition, the control error can be reduced by 71% in continuous disturbance condition; comparison results with existing Fuzzy-PID also show that the improved controller has advantage in terms of resisting rapid and continuous interferences; moreover, in practical application of fuzzy-PID control, the highest AFR errors are about 3%. In normal condition, the error is reduced from 5 to 1% compared with PID control, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the improved fuzzy-PID control model.

Affected by rough sea wave, a feasible final landing condition is planned such that the UAV could land on the ship board in a safe environment. Then, the solution to the ship landing operation is transformed into the UAV trajectory tracking. Due to the under-actuated nature of the UAV, an adaptive robust hierarchical algorithm is developed such that the position tracking to the desired trajectory and the attitude tracking to the command attitude are achieved. In particular, an asymmetric saturated command force is designed by introducing a dynamic compensator to ensure the nonsingular attitude extraction, and a tracking error constrained applied torque is exploited to avoid the nature singularity of Euler angle in sequence. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed in view of the hierarchical system stability theory. Simulations are performed to validate the proposed strategy.}

abstract = {We have studied massive MIMO hybrid beamforming (HBF) for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, where the transceivers only have a few radio frequency chain (RFC) numbers compared to the number of antenna elements. We propose a hybrid beamforming design to improve the system’s spectral, hardware, and computational efficiencies, where finding the precoding and combining matrices are formulated as optimization problems with practical constraints. The series of analog phase shifters creates a unit modulus constraint, making this problem non-convex and subsequently incurring unaffordable computational complexity. Advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques effectively handle non-convex problems in many domains; therefore, we have transformed this non-convex hybrid beamforming optimization problem using a reinforcement learning framework. These frameworks are solved using advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques implemented with experience replay schemes to maximize the spectral and learning efficiencies in highly uncertain wireless environments. We developed a twin-delayed deep deterministic (TD3) policy gradient-based hybrid beamforming scheme to overcome Q-learning’s substantial overestimation. We assumed a complete channel state information (CSI) to design our beamformers and then challenged this assumption by proposing a deep reinforcement learning-based channel estimation method. We reduced hybrid beamforming complexity using soft target double deep Q-learning to exploit mmWave channel sparsity. This method allowed us to construct the analog precoder by selecting channel dominant paths. We have demonstrated that the proposed approaches improve the system’s spectral and learning efficiencies compared to prior studies. We have also demonstrated that deep reinforcement learning is a versatile technique that can unleash the power of massive MIMO hybrid beamforming in mmWave systems for next-generation wireless communication.}

Adaptive neural networks are employed to approximate the unknown nonlinearities of the hydraulic actuator, i.e., the valve deadband and the unmodeled dynamics caused by the valve leakage. A disturbance observer is designed and integrated into the controller to compensate for the external disturbance and the equivalent interactive force acted on the piston rod of the hydraulic actuator. Under the framwork of backstepping technique, both the state feedback and output feedback controllers of the exoskeleton are designed. The velocity of the piston rod is estimated via a high gain observer in the output feedback control design. By utilizing the barrier Lyapunov function method and the proposed control, the output constraints are handled and the semi-globally uniformly boundedness of the closed-loop system is also guaranteed. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the tracking performance of the proposed control approach.}

This has created the problem of micro unmanned aerial vehicle (MUAV) in private or sensitive areas which can represent a personal or public threat. An improved MUAV detection method is proposed in this paper using artificial neural network (ANN) based feature extraction and reconstruction. The clutters form static/non-static objects in the collected radio frequency (RF) signals are suppressed via employing the background estimate method and suppressing the linear trend. Then principal component of the RF signals are extracted based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. The higher order cumulant (HOC) algorithm is utilized to improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the RF signals, which can make Gaussian noise prone to zero. Hilbert spectrums of the analyzed features are considered to determine if one MUAV is present in the detection area using ANN. Finally, the region of interest (ROI) containing RF signals is defined to estimate the azimuth and first frequency of MUAV. Detection results in real-life scenarios are obtained which show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in detecting MUAV.}

A number of 146 soil samples (0–30 cm) were collected in Khorramabad plain (680 ha). For the quantitative evaluation of SOC spatial variability, two scenarios were considered to use remote sensing data (R) and a combination of geo-morphometric and remote sensing data (GR). The data randomly were split into 80% (117 points) for training and 20% (29 points) for validation. The model performances were evaluated by the statistical indices as the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE). According to principal component analysis (PCA), nine covariates including transformed soil adjusted vegetation index (TSAVI), relative vegetation index (RVI), Band 10, Band 11,Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Standard height(Standard_he), Valley_Dep, terrain surface texture (texture), and terrain surface convexity (Convexity) were selected as the environmental predictors. Results showed that the hybrid model RF-OK (RMSE = 0.05and R2 = 0.93) and SoLIM model (RMSE = 0.47and R2 = 0.41) with scenario GR had the highest and lowest accurate respectively. TSAVI, DEM, and Band 10 were the most important predictors and explanation more than 50% of SOC spatial variability in the study area.

Hence, this paper investigates a difficult problem of safe control for the trailing UAV against actuator faults, input saturation, and wake vortex effect. By using disturbance observers, external wake vortex, disturbances, and internal actuator faults are estimated. Then, with the help of estimated knowledge of disturbance, backstepping control laws are developed for the longitudinal dynamics and the lateral-directional dynamics, respectively. One of the key features of the proposed strategy is that, the inherent problem, i.e., “explosion of complexity” in conventional backstepping control, is solved by the presented dynamic surface control scheme. Another key feature is that external wake vortex, disturbances, and internal actuator faults, input saturation are simultaneously considered. It is shown by Lyapunov stability analysis that the closed-loop system is uniformly ultimately bounded with safety requirements guaranteed even in the presence of wake vortex and actuator faults. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is further validated by simulation results.}

With the help of an introduced TVABLF, all state variables are confined to predefined regions. Based on the backstepping method and NNs approximation technique, a smooth tracking controller and its adaptive laws are co-designed for the uncertain systems. The system effects caused by the input quantization is compensated by the proposed algorithm with nonlinear decomposition. By adopting the SGPFS theory, the tracking performances are ensured to be achieved in finite time. It is rigorously proved that the output of the system follows the specified trajectory in finite time, whilst the system state variables are constrained within asymmetric boundaries. QUAVs are typical nonlinear systems of 6-Dof, and the control input signal requires quantization. We apply the developed method to the controller design of uncertain QUAVs, and the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the main results.}

In the keypoint feature extraction network, we take the high-resolution network (HRNet) as the backbone to detect the bird’s keypoints in the high-resolution branch and extract the global features from the low-resolution branch for posture recognition. We design the components generation module in the local feature extraction network, which takes detected keypoints into the clustering algorithm to generate the bird’s components. We then utilize the components into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract the local features for posture recognition. Finally, we fuse the global and local features to execute the bird’s posture recognition. Our main contributions are fourfold: (1) We have been modified the first point of contribution. We take the bird’s keypoints, which have never been used in the bird’s posture recognition, to estimate the bird’s posture and achieved good results.

The proposed control strategy is based on a double four-time-scale (4TS) decomposition of the longitudinal and lateral-directional dynamics. The longitudinal dynamics include the altitude, velocity, pitch, and flight path angle dynamics, with the control signals being the elevator deflection and the throttle position, while the lateral-directional dynamics include the side-slip angle, bank angle, yaw rate and roll rate dynamics, with the control signals being the aileron and rudder deflection. The nonlinear control strategy drives the system to follow references in the aerodynamic velocity, the flight path angle and the load factor, which in return provides references in bank angle, side-slip angle and yaw rate. In addition, the control strategy allows to select the desired dynamics for all the singularly perturbed subsystems. Numerical results are included for a realistic nonlinear UAV model, including control saturation and presenting control robustness capabilities under unmodelled dynamics.}

abstract = {This study focuses on a sampled-data fuzzy decentralized tracking control problem for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) under the variable sampling rate condition. To this end, the overall dynamics of the quadrotor is expressed as a decentralized Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model interconnected with each other. Although the proposed decentralized control technique divides the overall UAV control system into attitude and position subsystems, the stability of the entire control system is guaranteed. Besides, in this paper, the model uncertainty, interconnection, and reference trajectory are considered as disturbances acting on the tracking error. To attenuate these disturbances, a novel sampled-data tracking control design technique is derived based on a linear reference model to be tracked and the time-dependent Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF). By doing so, both the stability of the tracking error dynamics and the minimization of tracking performance are guaranteed. Also, the proposed tracking control design method is derived as a linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based optimal problem. Finally, a simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design methodology.}

abstract = {Owing to small size, sensing capabilities and autonomous nature, the Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have enormous applications in various areas e.g., remote sensing, navigation, archaeology, journalism, environmental science, and agriculture. However, the un-monitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient un-supervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM)and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM.}

abstract = {Since conventional in situ measurements of suspended sediments in the river system are labor-intensive and time-consuming, remote sensing approaches using multi- or hyper-spectral cameras have widely been applied to obtain high-resolution suspended sediment concentration (SSC) distributions in rivers and streams. However, in nature, the properties of heterogeneous sediment, such as the mineral content and particle size distribution, induce a strong variability in the optical images of the suspended sediments. For this reason, the robust estimation of the suspended sediment using the remote sensing technique is challenging due to the optical variability of the suspended sediment. Thus, it is necessary to deal with this variability of the optical images to improve the accuracy of remote sensing-based SSC measurements and extend them to the global estimator. In this study, a robust Machine Learning (ML) model for SSC estimation based on hyperspectral images was developed by considering the optical variability of the suspended sediment in water bodies. A series of field-scale tracer experiments were conducted in open channels with three different sediment types in order to obtain both the SSC using laser diffraction sensors and hyperspectral images using a UAV camera. The experimental results showed that the optical characteristics of SSC were critically heterogeneous due to the properties of the sediment. Using these experimental dataset, four explicit regression models and two implicit ML regression models were developed and compared to select an optimal estimator. Consequently, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model using relevant spectral bands in a wide wavelength range yielded the most accurate results, with an R2 of 0.90 for the whole dataset. However, linear regression models, which could not consider various spectral bands and the nonlinear effect of the optical variability of SSC, were limited in their ability to retrieve SSC from hyperspectral images. Furthermore, the SVR model accurately reproduced the spatio-temporal SSC distributions in all study cases, including low-visibility suspended sediments, thus successfully resolved the optical variability of SSC with widely selected spectral bands from recursive feature elimination (RFE). The SVR model also successfully retrieved the SSC distribution in uncalibrated rivers. The results of this study demonstrated that the proposed ML regression models based on the hyperspectral imagery achieved a significant improvement in SSC estimation in terms of accuracy and global applicability.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the fixed-time control problem of autonomous ship landing operations of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to external disturbances. A continuous reference altitude is planned for the UAV by introducing a high order polynomial function and a continuous differentiable switching function. To ensure a safe and precise board landing operation under bad sea condition, a landing constraint condition is designed in terms of rotational motion of the ship. By combining the planar motion of the ship with the reference altitude, the landing mission is converted into the control development for the UAV tracking. By introducing the hierarchical design, an adaptive fixed-time control algorithm is proposed for the UAV such that the trajectory and command attitude tracking are achieved, respectively. It is proved via Lyapunov stability theory that the proposed control algorithm guarantees the fixed-time trajectory tracking of the UAV subject to unknown external disturbances and inertia parameters. Simulation examples verify the proposed strategy.}

As the battery capacity of mobile devices is limited, the computation tasks running on the mobile devices will terminate once the battery is dead. In order to achieve sustainable computation, energy-harvesting technology has been introduced into D2D networks. At present, how to make multiple energy harvesting mobile devices work collaboratively to minimize the long-term system cost for task execution under limited computing, network and battery capacity constraint is a challenging issue. To deal with such a challenge, in this paper, we design a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) based cost-aware collaborative task-execution (CACTE) scheme in energy harvesting D2D (EH-D2D) networks. To validate the CACTE scheme's performance, we conducted extensive experiments to compare the CACTE scheme with four baseline algorithms, including Local, Random, ECLB (Energy Capacity Load Balance) and CCLB (Computing Capacity Load Balance). Experiments were accompanied by various system parameters, such as the mobile device's battery capacity, task workload, the bandwidth and so on. The experimental results show that the CACTE scheme can make multiple mobile devices cooperate effectively with one another to execute many more tasks and achieve a higher long-term reward, including lower task latency and fewer dropped tasks.}

abstract = {Owing to the size limitations of launchers, foldable main wings and foldable vertical tails are usually used in the design of barrel-launched unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the folding mechanisms are complex and bulky. Further, the coupling effect between aerodynamic performance and control capability is not typically considered in the aerodynamic layout design of traditional drum-launched UAVs; thus, the overall performance is often improved by serial design and multi-turns optimization, which result in low design efficiency. Based on the available research on barrel-launched UAVs, this paper presents an optimal design scheme for non-vertical tail aerodynamic layout considering the control capability of multiple control surfaces. A flying-wing configuration, with two groups of ailerons and one group of all moving tips, is employed in the design, and its control capability and aerodynamic performance are quantitatively described in terms of the volume of attainable moment subset and lift–drag ratio. The focus of the current design is shifted from improvement of single aerodynamic performance to optimization of overall performance. To overcome the computational complexity observed in direct optimization, the number of design variables is reduced by identifying the key test factors. The concept of a surrogate model matrix comprising cell surrogate models is proposed to effectively fit the aerodynamic characteristics and control capability of the wing. A multi-objective optimization based on the surrogate model matrix is carried out using the neighborhood cultivation genetic algorithm, which effectively improves the optimization efficiency. The entire process is implemented on an ISIGHT platform for automatic optimization design of the wing. At two design points selected on the pareto frontier, the results show that the lift–drag ratio is increased by 28.36%, reachable torque space is increased by 64.29% in state 1, lift–drag ratio is increased by 23.11%, and reachable torque space is increased by 164.29% in state 2. These results provide a reference for the aerodynamic layout design of barrel-launched UAVs for practical control requirements.}
