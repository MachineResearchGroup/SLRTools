abstract={With the widespread use of high-speed trains in recent years, rail transport has become a more comfortable and safe means of transportation. The safety and maintenance of railways are critical to safe travel. Conventional railway inspection systems are carried out by measuring train as well as manual control along the way. Human-based inspection systems are slow and measuring train-based inspection systems are expensive and occupy the line being inspected. In this study, a method is proposed for the control of the rail track with an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed method uses the deep Hough transform method for autonomously moving on the rail. Unlike normal image processing-based techniques, this method does not need any preprocessing and parameter adjustment. After removing the rails from the obtained rail images, the rail defects are detected by semantic segmentation. The developed method was compared with those in the literature, and it was seen that better results were obtained.},

In such scenarios, the UAV network can lease part of the spectrum of a terrestrial licensed network in exchange for providing relaying service. In order to optimize the performance of the UAV network and prolong its lifetime, some of the UAVs will function as a relay for the primary network while the rest of the UAVs carry out their sensing tasks. Here, we propose a team reinforcement learning algorithm performed by the UAV's controller unit to determine the optimum allocation of sensing and relaying tasks among the UAVs as well as their relocation strategy at each time. We analyze the convergence of our algorithm and present simulation results to evaluate the system throughput in different scenarios.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with artificial intelligence (AI) have opened a revolutionized way for mobile crowdsensing (MCS). Conventional AI models, built on aggregation of UAVs' sensing data (typically contain private and sensitive user information), may arise severe privacy and data misuse concerns. Federated learning, as a promising distributed AI paradigm, has opened up possibilities for UAVs to collaboratively train a shared global model without revealing their local sensing data. However, there still exist potential security and privacy threats for UAV-assisted crowdsensing with federated learning due to vulnerability of central curator, unreliable contribution recording, and low-quality shared local models. In this paper, we propose SFAC, a secure federated learning framework for UAV-assisted MCS. Specifically, we first introduce a blockchain-based collaborative learning architecture for UAVs to securely exchange local model updates and verify contributions without the central curator. Then, by applying local differential privacy, we design a privacy-preserving algorithm to protect UAVs' privacy of updated local models with desirable learning accuracy. Furthermore, a two-tier reinforcement learning-based incentive mechanism is exploited to promote UAVs' high-quality model sharing when explicit knowledge of network parameters are not available in practice. Extensive simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed SFAC can effectively improve utilities for UAVs, promote high-quality model sharing, and ensure privacy protection in federated learning, compared with existing schemes.},

Deep convolutional network have shown a great potential for tasks like object detection and have been continuously improved in the last years. Still, the amount of training data is large and their generation can be complex and time consuming, especially if the appearance of the detected object is not clearly specified. The concept presented here is to train a deep convolutional neural network just with a few two dimensional images of unmanned aerial vehicle to simplify the process of generating training data. Performance of the trained network is evaluated with data from real experimental flights and compared with hand-labeled ground truth data to validate the correctness. To cover situations when the classifier fails at the detection, the output is integrated in a image processing pipeline for object tracking in order to establish a continuous tracking.},

abstract={This paper addresses sound source separation and identification for noise-contaminated acoustic signals recorded with a microphone array embedded in an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), aiming at people's voice detection quickly and widely in a disaster situation. The key approach to achieve this is Deep Neural Network (DNN), but it is well known that training a DNN needs a huge dataset to improve its performance. In a practical application, building such a dataset is not often realistic owing to the cost of manual data annotation. Therefore, we propose a Partially-Shared Deep Neural Network (PS-DNN) which can learn multiple tasks at the same time with a small amount of annotated data. Preliminary results show that the PS-DNN outperforms conventional DNN-based approaches which require fully-annotated data in training in terms of identification accuracy. In addition, it maintains performance even when noise-suppressed signals are used for sound source separation training, and partially annotated data is used for sound source identification training.},

abstract={While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present us with many benefits in the modern world, the immature use and malicious exploitation of this technology increase its potential to cause harm and fear. For that reason, in order to mitigate threats, the demand for technology that enables the detection of UAVs is ever increasing. Many studies focus on detecting the presence of UAVs and the direction of approach (DOA), but in order to overcome the issues caused by acoustic sensor limitations, researchers used a combination of sensors and nodes. This paper proposes a different method to overcome the limitation with a single node in place of the previous approach of using multiple and high-priced acoustic sensors. Within this study, data augmentation and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used in the dataset. We investigated convolutional neural network (CNN), convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) and ResNet-50 to identify UAV’s DOA on a Raspberry Pi 3 which has low computational resources. Our empirical results confirm that the CRNN classifier is more suited to operate in a real detection system since it can predict DOA in only 0.429 seconds with an accuracy of 97.60% on a Raspberry Pi 3.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as low-altitude flight base stations to satisfy the coverage requirements of wireless users in various scenarios. In practical applications, since the transmitted power and energy resources of the UAVs are limited and the propagation environments are complicated and time-variant, it is challenging to control a group of UAVs to ensure coverage performance while preserving the connectivity and safety of the UAV networks. To this end, a two-step environment-learning-based method is proposed for the intelligent deployment of the UAVs. First, a machine learning algorithm is used to establish an accurate prediction model of the link qualities from the UAVs to the users under a specific scenario for the next step. Then, a modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed to control the movements of the UAVs according to the predicted link qualities and to maximize the proportion of covered users. The prioritized experience replay mechanism is introduced to the standard DDPG algorithm to accelerate the deployment procedure. The coverage performance is analyzed in both the interference-free situation and the situation with co-channel interference. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has a higher convergence speed than the standard DDPG method. Additionally, the proposed deployment method can achieve higher coverage performance and better adaptability to the dynamic environment than three commonly used methods, the random method, the K-means-based method, and the statistical-channel-model-based method.},

abstract={Weeds compete with crops for resources such as light, nutrients, water and space. When mature, weeds can produce thousands to hundreds of thousands of seeds that can survive for a long time and posing a great threat to crops. The best way to avoid weed threats is to remove weeds before they bloom such that the chances of weed seeds falling into the soil can be reduced. Most existing drone-based weeds identification methods use additional equipments to enhance the identification ability. In addition to increasing the cost, such solutions also increase power consumption and load burden of drones. In this paper, we propose a low-cost Weed Identification System (WIS) using RGB images taken by drones as training data and applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to build the identification model. The result of the WIS can be used as a reference for agriculture researchers and can also be used to inform farmers to take necessary reactions. The WIS identifies weeds with an accuracy of up to 98.8%. Compared to other high-cost methods, the WIS does achieve similar identification accuracy at low cost.},

abstract={Due to the tremendous advancement in interactive multimedia systems and technologies, security has become a major aspect. Advanced technology can be utilized for hacking autonomous systems like Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAVs) in different ways such as spoofing and jamming. It can be spoofed by the injection of fake signals into the sensors. For the protection of the UAVs from the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal spoofing attack, we propose a new methodology by incorporating a machine learning (ML) algorithm such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). A detailed analysis of several learning algorithms is also carried out to choose the suitable learning algorithm for the proposed work. Once the suitable ML algorithm is selected, we perform K-fold analyses to develop other learning models by choosing different values of K-folds thus we called them K-learning models. The purpose of developing K-learning models is to apply voting techniques to the developed K-learning models. Moreover, the signal features used in the proposed work are jitter, jitter (absolute), jitter (local), jitter (RAP), jitter (ppq5), shimmer, shimmer (local), shimmer (dB), shimmer (apq3), shimmer (apq5) and frequency modulation. Based on these features of the signal, we train our proposed model for the detection of counterfeit GPS signals. To gauge the performance of the proposed model, we perform different experimentation analyses such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results and analysis show the effectiveness of the proposed work over existing techniques.},

This operation can help to promote classification accuracy but it is facing new challenges in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne hyperspectral imagery with high spatial and spectral resolutions (H2 imagery). The ground objects’ various spatial scales result in it being challenging to determine the optimal size for the spatial patches. In addition, due to the severe spectral variability and spatial heterogeneity of the H2 imagery, “spatial patching” only exploits the local spatial information and results in serious salt-and-pepper (SP) noise and isolated areas in the classification maps. In this article, to address these issues, a novel spectral patching network (SPNet) with an end-to-end DL architecture is proposed for UAV-borne H2 imagery classification. The “spectral patching” approach is proposed to preserve the global spatial information and almost all the spectral information of the original hyperspectral imagery. An end-to-end deep encoder–decoder network is then constructed based on the spectral patching mechanism, which introduces the deep residual network (ResNet) and atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) modules to extract multiscale high-level semantic information for the H2 imagery classification. The experimental results obtained with the Wuhan UAV-borne H2 imagery (WHU-Hi) UAV-borne hyperspectral data set demonstrate that SPNet can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and visualization performance in the classification of H2 imagery.},

abstract={This paper investigates an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled network consisting of smart mobile devices and multiple UAVs as aerial base stations in a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) architecture. Mobile devices are partitioned into several clusters and offload their tasks to UAV servers via the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) protocol. We aim to jointly maximize the number of served IMDs, the user scheduling, the number of UAVs, and their $3$D placement. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem subject to some Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Due to its non-convexity, we break the problem into two subproblems. We propose a machine-learning-based algorithm for the first subproblem, i.e., optimizing the UAVs' number and $3$D placements, and the user association. Unlike existing literature, our algorithm achieves low computational complexity and fast convergence. The second subproblem, the user scheduling, is non-convex too. We utilize the $\ell_p$-norm concept and optimize the user scheduling by applying the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) algorithm. The aforementioned process is performed iteratively until convergence, and a near-optimal solution is achieved. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed scheme is analyzed. Regarding fast convergence and low computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, we confirm its superior performance through simulation results.},

abstract={Collaborative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networking has the characteristics of flexibility, efficiency, ubiquity, etc., which can enhance wireless network coverage and improve the quality of service to ground users. However, collaborative UAV networking has main challenges such as location deployment and energy optimization. For collaborative networking scenarios, it is necessary to focus on solving key issues such as algorithm convergence and time complexity. In response to the above problems, we propose to leverage hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with spatial attention mechanism to reduce time complexity according to actual application requirements of location deployment. Firstly, the convolutional neural network is used to improve the ability of discriminating state features. Then, an improved spatial attention mechanism is introduced to apply different weights to state features of different spatial locations, and focuses on the state features that are favorable for UAV deployment in spatial locations. Finally, the offline training state attention model is added to the state input of hybrid deep reinforcement learning for adaptive deployment training. The simulation results show that the training time of the algorithm can be greatly reduced while both mean opinion score (MOS) and energy consumption performance are reduced by about 10%.},

abstract={Attack from the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been the main means of high-precision strike. Therefore, classifying ground vehicles from the UAV with high accuracy is of great significance. In order to avoid the complex feature extracting process and realize the classification of UAV-to-ground vehicles in different situations, this paper proposed a method based on micro-Doppler signatures using singular value decomposition (SVD) and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). First, models of UAV-to-ground vehicles are built to analyze the micro-Doppler components and Doppler signals in five different cases are given. Second, time-frequency spectrums of Doppler signals with low signal-to-noise ratios are improved after removing noise using SVD. Third, transfer-learning of pre-trained DCNNs is achieved using measured data and classification under various conditions is realized using the new-trained network. When there is no noise, the overall classification accuracy of two types of Doppler signals, three types of Doppler signals, four types of Doppler signals and five types of Doppler signals has reached 100%, 97%, 97%, and 96%, respectively. Comparison with current methods which need to extract micro-Doppler features by time-frequency techniques are also made. Outstanding performance proves the superiority and robustness of the proposed method.},

abstract={Nowadays, agricultural producers are increasingly attempting to combine computer vision methods with the output from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to automate farm operations aiming at speed, precision, and cost. In this context, time-consuming tasks such as crop monitoring may be solved in a more efficient and less error-prone manner. In particular, for estimating productivity and managing pests, a key task that may be automated is the characterization of crop regions into full-grown trees, tree seedlings, tree gaps, and background. In this paper, we address the classification of aerial images into these classes, targeting at samples from a citrus plantation acquired by UAVs. Although Deep Learning-based approaches have been used successfully for many classification problems, little is discussed on the effects of parameters tuning (involving features, classifiers, and sampling methods) for each specific problem. Therefore, our goal is to solve this task while addressing explainability, by running an experimental analysis that explores classical methods as well as Deep Learning-based approaches.},

abstract={Agronomic inputs such as water , nutrients and fertilisers play a vital role in the health, growth and yield of crops. The lack of each of these inputs induces biotic and abiotic stress in the crop. Farmers are relying on groundwater because of decreased rainfall. The irrigation method can be improved by acquiring awareness of the health of crops and soils. In general, crop and soil quality is controlled by means of manual observation, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive and contributes to incorrect choices and substantial waste of resources. There is also an immediate need to automate the inspection process that will finally benefit farmers and agricultural scientists. In this paper, the identification of the water-stressed areas in the crop(maize) field has been studied, and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing is used to automate the crop health-monitoring process. We proposed a framework (model) based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify the stressed and normal/healthy areas in the maize crop field. The performance of the proposed framework has been compared with different models of CNN, such as ResNet50, VGG-19, and Inception-v3. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models and successfully classify stressed and normal areas with 95 % accuracy on train data and 93 % accuracy with 0.9370 precision and 0.9403 F1 score on test data.},

The proposed self-learning ADP method can improve the control performance by online learning while ensuring the state of the system stable at the equilibrium point.

abstract={High-altitudelong-endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are employed in a variety of fields because of their ability to fly for a long time at high altitudes, even in the stratosphere. Two paramount concerns exist: enhancing their safety during long-term flight and reducing their weight as much as possible to increase their energy efficiency based on analytical redundancy approaches. In this letter, a novel deep-learning-aided navigation filter is proposed, which consists of two parts: an end-to-end mapping-based synthetic sensor measurement model that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to estimate the angle of attack (AOA) and sideslip angle (SSA) and an unscented Kalman filter for state estimation. Our proposed method can not only reduce the weight of HALE UAVs but also ensure their safety by means of an analytical redundancy approach. In contrast to conventional approaches, our LSTM-based method achieves better estimation by virtue of its nonlinear mapping capability.},

abstract={The 5th generation (5G) wireless network with Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered to be one of the most effective solutions for improving the communication coverage. However, UAV is easily affected by the wind, accompanied by a certain time delay during the air communication. Thus the inaccurate beamforming will be performed by the base station (BS), resulting in the unnecessary capacity loss. To address this issue, we propose a novel Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)-based arrival angle predictor to predict the specific communication location of UAV under the 5G Internet of Things (IoT) networks in this paper. Specifically, a grid-based coordinate system is applied during the data preprocessing to make the training process easier and more effective. Moreover, the RNN model with the highest accuracy can be saved during the training process to ensure the real-time prediction. Simulation results reveal that the RNN-based predictor we proposed is of high prediction accuracy, which is 98% in average. Therefore, a more precise beamforming can be performed by BS to reduce the unnecessary capacity loss, resulting in a more effective and reliable communication system.},

abstract={Miniaturizing an autonomous robot is a challenging task - not only the mechanical but also the electrical components have to operate within limited space, payload, and power. Furthermore, the algorithms for autonomous navigation, such as state-of-the-art (SoA) visual navigation deep neural networks (DNNs), are becoming increasingly complex, striving for more flexibility and agility. In this work, we present a sensor-rich, modular, nano-sized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), almost as small as a five Swiss Franc coin - called Fünfliber - with a total weight of 18g and 7.2cm in diameter. We conceived our UAV as an open-source hardware robotic platform, controlled by a parallel ultra-low power (PULP) system-on-chip (SoC) with a wide set of onboard sensors, including three cameras (i.e., infrared, optical flow, and standard QVGA), multiple Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors, a barometer, and an inertial measurement unit. Our system runs the tasks necessary for a flight controller (sensor acquisition, state estimation, and low-level control), requiring only 10% of the computational resources available aboard, consuming only 9mW - 13x less than an equivalent Cortex M4-based system. Pushing our system at its limit, we can use the remaining onboard computational power for sophisticated autonomous navigation workloads, as we showcase with an SoA DNN running at up to 18Hz, with a total electronics' power consumption of 271mW.},

abstract={Aerial communication using directional antennas (ACDA) is a promising solution to enable long-distance and broad-band unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-UAV networking. The automatic alignment of directional antennas allows the transmission energy to focus in certain direction and significantly extends the communication range and rejects interference. Robust automatic alignment of directional antennas is not easy to achieve, considering practical issues such as the limited on-board sensing devices due to the physical constraints of UAV payload and power supplies, uncertain and varying UAV movement patterns, and unstable GPS and unknown communication environments. In this paper, we develop reinforcement learning (RL)-based online antenna control solutions for the ACDA system to conquer these challenges. The control solution adopts an uncertain UAV mobility modeling and intention estimation framework to capture and predict the uncertain intentions of UAV maneuvers and hence permit robust tracking. To account for an unstable GPS environment, the control solution features a learning of communication channel models to provide additional measurement signals in GPS-denied settings. A novel stochastic optimal control solution for nonlinear random switching dynamics is developed that integrates RL, an effective uncertainty evaluation method called multivariate probabilistic collocation method (MPCM), and unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). Simulation studies are conducted to illustrate and validate the proposed solutions.},

abstract={Autonomous navigation for large Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs) is straight-forward to implement, just employ expensive and sophisticated sensors and monitoring devices. On the contrary, usual small quadrotor UAV still have the challenge on obstacle avoidance since this kind of UAV can only carry very light weight sensors such as cameras. Given the above reason, making autonomous navigation over obstacles on small UAV is much more challenging. In this paper, we focus on proposing a novel and memory efficient deep network architecture named UAVNet for small UAV to achieve obstacle detection in the urban environment. Compared with state-of-the-art DNN architecture, UAVNet has only 2.23M parameters(which is half compared with MobileNet) and 141 MFLOPs complexity. Though the parameters are fewer than usual, the accuracy is acceptable, about 80% validated on ImageNet-2102 dataset. To further justify the utility of UAVNet, we also implement the architecture on Nvidia TX2 in real environment using NCTU campus dataset. The experiment shows the proposed UAVNet can detect obstacles to 15 fps, which is a real-time application.},

abstract={There is a strong interest in utilizing commercial cellular networks to support unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to send control commands and communicate heavy traffic. Cellular networks are well suited for offering reliable and secure connections to the UAVs as well as facilitating traffic management systems to enhance safe operation. However, for the full-scale integration of UAVs that perform critical and high-risk tasks, more advanced solutions are required to improve wireless connectivity in mobile networks. In this context, integrated access and backhaul (IAB) is an attractive approach for the UAVs to enhance connectivity and traffic forwarding. In this paper, we study a novel approach to dynamic associations based on reinforcement learning at the edge of the network and compare it to alternative association algorithms. Considering the average data rate, our results indicate that the reinforcement learning methods improve the achievable data rate. The optimal parameters of the introduced algorithm are highly sensitive to the donor next generation node base (DgNB) and UAV IAB node densities, and need to be identified beforehand or estimated via a stateful search. However, its performance nearly converges to that of the ideal scheme with a full knowledge of the data rates in dense deployments of DgNBs.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel multiclass-target classification method for mmWave frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar operating in the frequency range of 77 - 81 GHz, based on custom range-angle heatmaps and machine learning tools. The elevation field of view (FoV) is increased by orienting the Radar antennas in elevation. In this orientation, the radar focuses the beam in elevation to improve the elevation FoV. The azimuth FoV is improved by mechanically rotating the Radar horizontally, which has antenna elements oriented in the elevation direction. The data from the Radar measurements obtained by mechanical rotation of the Radar in Azimuth are used to generate a range-angle heatmap. The measurements are taken in a variety of real-world scenarios with various objects such as humans, a car, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), also known as a drone. The proposed technique achieves accuracy of 97.6 % and 99.6 % for classifying the UAV and humans, respectively, and accuracy of 98.1 % for classifying the car from the range-angle FoV heatmap. Such a Radar classification technique will be extremely useful for a wide range of applications in cost-effective and dependable autonomous systems, including ground station traffic monitoring and surveillance, as well as control systems for both on-ground and aerial vehicles.},

abstract={The latest advances in terms of network technologies open up new opportunities for high-end applications, including using the next generation video streaming technologies. As mobile devices become more affordable and powerful, an increasing range of rich media applications could offer a highly realistic and immersive experience to mobile users. However, this comes at the cost of very stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, putting significant pressure on the underlying networks. In order to accommodate these new rich media applications and overcome their associated challenges, this paper proposes an innovative Machine Learning-based scheduling solution which supports increased quality for live omnidirectional (360°) video streaming. The proposed solution is deployed in a highly dynamic Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based environment to support immersive live omnidirectional video streaming to mobile users. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations and compared against three state-of-the-art scheduling solutions, such as: static Prioritization (SP), Required Activity Detection Scheduler (RADS) and Frame Level Scheduler (FLS). The results show that the proposed solution outperforms the other schemes involved in terms of PSNR, throughput and packet loss rate.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of joint caching and resource allocation is investigated for a network of cache-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that service wireless ground users over the LTE licensed and unlicensed (LTE-U) bands. The considered model focuses on users that can access both licensed and unlicensed bands while receiving contents through UAV cache-user links and content server-UAV-user links. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and content caching. To solve this problem, a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of liquid state machine (LSM) is proposed. Using the proposed LSM algorithm, the cloud can predict the users' content request distribution while having only limited information on the network's and users' states. The proposed algorithm also enables the UAVs to autonomously choose the optimal resource allocation strategies depending on the network states. Simulation results using real datasets show that the proposed approach yields up to 33.3% and 50.3% gains, respectively, in terms of the number of users that have stable queues compared to two baseline algorithms: Q-learning with cache and Q-learning without cache. The results also show that LSM significantly improves the convergence time of up to 33.3% compared to Q-learning.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of tracking an actively evading target by employing a team of coordinating unmanned aerial vehicles while also learning the level of intelligence for appropriate countermeasures. Initially, under infinite cognitive resources, we formulate a game between the evader and the pursuing team, with an evader being the maximizing player and the pursuing team being the minimizing one. We derive optimal pursuing and evading policies while taking into account the physical constraints imposed by Dubins vehicles. Subsequently, we relax the infinite rationality assumption, via the use of level-k thinking. Such rationality policies are computed by using a reinforcement learning-based architecture and are proven to converge to the Nash policies as the thinking levels increase. Finally, simulation results verify the efficacy of the approach.},

Since the transmission modes of UAVs may influence their trajectories, we study the trajectory design problem for UAVs aiming to maximize the total utility in consideration of their transmission modes. This problem is a Markov decision problem (MDP) with a large state-action space, and thus, we propose a multi-UAV trajectory design algorithm using multi- agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve this problem.

abstract={Millimeter-wave (mmWave) hybrid analog-digital beamforming is a promising approach to satisfy the low-latency constraint in multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) systems, which serve as network infrastructure for flexible deployment. However, in highly dynamic multi-UAV environments, analog beam tracking becomes a critical challenge. The overhead of additional pilot transmission at the price of spectral efficiency is shown necessary to achieve high resilience in operation. An efficient method to deal with high dynamics of UAVs applies machine learning, particularly Q-learning, to analog beam tracking. The proposed Q-learning-based beam tracking scheme uses current/past observations to design rewards from environments to facilitate prediction, which significantly increases the efficiency of data transmission and beam switching. Given the selected analog beams, the goal of digital beamforming is to maximize the SINR. The received pilot signals are utilized to approximate the desired signal and interference power values, which yield the SINR measurements as well as the optimal digital weights. Since the selected analog beams based on the received power do not guarantee the hybrid beamforming achieving the maximization SINR, we therefore reserve additional analog beams as candidates during the beam tracking. When the candidates include the ideal beams, the combination of analog beams with their digital weights achieving the maximum SINR consequently provides the optimal solution to the hybrid beamforming.},

abstract={Semantic segmentation for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images has become one of the research focuses in the field of remote sensing at present, which could accurately analyze the ground objects and their relationships. However, conventional semantic segmentation methods based on deep learning require large-scale models that are not suitable for resource-constrained UAV remote sensing tasks. Therefore, it is important to construct a light-weight semantic segmentation method for UAV remote sensing images. With this motivation, we propose a light-weight neural network model with fewer parameters to solve the problem of semantic segmentation of UAV remote sensing images. The network adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoder, we build a light-weight convolutional neural network model with fewer channels of each layer to reduce the number of model parameters. Then, feature maps of different scales from the encoder are concatenated together after resizing to carry out the multiscale fusion. Moreover, we employ two attention modules to capture the global semantic information from the context and the correlation among channels in UAV remote sensing images. In the decoder part, the model obtains predictions of each pixel through the softmax function. We conducted experiments on the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, UAVid dataset, and UDD6 dataset to verify the effectiveness of the light-weight network. Our method obtains quality semantic segmentation results evaluated on UAV remote sensing datasets with only 9 M parameters the model owns, which is competitive among popular methods with the same level of parameters.},

abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can potentially meet the high data-rate requirements of unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) networks. However, as the prerequisite of mmWave communications, the narrow directional beam tracking is very challenging because of the 3-D mobility and attitude variation of UAVs. Aiming to address the beam tracking difficulties, we propose to integrate the conformal array (CA) with the surface of each UAV, which enables the full spatial coverage and the agile beam tracking in highly dynamic UAV mmWave networks. More specifically, the key contributions of our work are threefold: 1) a new mmWave beam tracking framework is established for the CA-enabled UAV mmWave network; 2) a specialized hierarchical codebook is constructed to drive the directional radiating element (DRE)-covered cylindrical CA, which contains both the angular beam pattern and the subarray pattern to fully utilize the potential of the CA; and 3) a codebook-based multiuser beam tracking scheme is proposed, where the Gaussian process machine learning-enabled UAV position/attitude prediction is developed to improve the beam tracking efficiency in conjunction with the tracking-error aware adaptive beamwidth control. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed codebook-based beam tracking scheme in the CA-enabled UAV mmWave network, and demonstrate the advantages of CA over the conventional planner array in terms of spectrum efficiency and outage probability in the highly dynamic scenarios.},

abstract={In the 5th generation (5G) networks, coordinated multiple point (CoMP) is one of key technologies to improve the quality of service (QoS) of edge users. To meet the requirement of growing data rates, millimeter-wave (mmWave) can be employed in the CoMP system. However, the QoS of users may be degraded if line-of-sight (LoS) mmWave channels are not guaranteed. In this article, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided communication scheme is proposed to enhance the QoS of edge users, where the UAV helps a primary base station (BS) and a coordinated BS simultaneously. In the proposed scheme, since the UAV only feeds back the channel state information (CSI) to the primary BS, the CSI obtained at the coordinated BS through a backbone network becomes outdated. In order to overcome the performance loss caused by the CSI feedback delay, a machine learning based channel estimation scheme is studied for the coordinated BS to perform hybrid beamforming. Furthermore, to eliminate the inter-BS interference, a maximize signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (Max-SINR) based beamforming compensation scheme is proposed for the primary BS and UAV. The simulation results show that both the bit error rate (BER) and sum rate performance can be improved by employing the proposed schemes.},

In addition to traditional image processing methods, deep learning networks are also frequently used in object detection in wide area images. Although vehicle detection methods in WAS provide high accuracy, they also involve significant computational complexity and require hardware with intensive processing power. In this study, a low complexity and high accuracy hybrid vehicle detection method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) with support of morphological operations is presented. Results on the COWC dataset show that the proposed architecture can detect vehicles with precision of 96% even though the number of neural network parameters is just above a hundred thousands. A comparison on number of parameters with respect to commonly used neural networks reveal that the proposed architecture uses significantly lower number of parameters. Performance evaluation and the comparison of the proposed method with YOLO-v4 show the success of the presented miniature CNN network.},

abstract={Along with the popularization of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), societal concerns related to security, privacy, and public safety have gained more attention, thus opening a new avenue for small UAV surveillance. However, the conventional radar technologies pose challenges for the surveillance of small UAVs due to the high cost, small radar cross section, low flying altitude, and slow flying speed. In this article, we propose a novel micro-Doppler signature-based surveillance method using machine learning techniques, for detection, classification, and localization of small UAVs. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate the performance gain of our proposed method by applying long short-term memory neural network.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications and networks are of utmost concern. However, they have challenges such as the limited on-board energy and restricted transmit power. In this paper, we study a UAV-enabled communication scenario that a set of UAVs perform a virtual antenna array (VAA) to communicate with different remote base stations (BSs) by using collaborative beamforming (CB). To achieve a better transmission performance, the UAV elements can fly to optimal positions by using optimal speeds and adjust to optimal excitation current weights for performing CB transmissions. However, there are some trade-offs between energy consumption and transmission performance. Thus, we formulate a time and energy minimization communication multi-objective optimization problem (TEMCMOP) of CB in UAV networks to simultaneously minimize the total transmission time, total performing time of VAAs and total motion and hovering energy consumptions of UAVs by jointly optimizing the positions, flight speeds and excitation current weights of UAVs, as well as the order of communicating with different BSs. Due to the complexity and NP-hardness of the formulated TEMCMOP, we propose an improved multi-objective ant lion optimization (IMOALO) algorithm with chaos-opposition based learning solution initialization and hybrid solution update operators to solve the problem. Simulation results verify that the proposed IMOALO can effectively solve the formulated TEMCMOP and it has better performance than some other benchmark approaches.},

abstract={Deep learning-based methods are continuously boosting the performance of detecting objects in natural images. On the contrary, detecting objects in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images remains to be a difficult task in the field of computer vision, due to the challenge of training a well-performed detection model working on UAV images which usually contain instances with varied orientations, scales, and contours, etc. Furthermore, only a few researchers have focused on this field, probably because of difficulties in UAV data acquisition and labelling. Inspired by this, we collected a large-scale dataset with multi-scale and high-resolution UAV images, named MOHR, which contains 10,631 images captured by a UAV affixed with three kinds of cameras. Since these images were captured in a suburban environment, we manually annotated five classes of objects, including car, truck, building, collapse and flood damage. An empirical study was then conducted by adopting six advanced object detection methods all of which are based on deep learning technologies. The results indicate the great potential of these evaluated object detection models, but also reveal that the research on such a challenging UAV dataset using current deep learning techniques is far reaching.},

abstract={Acoustic applications on a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) have been hindered by its low input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Such low SNR condition poses prominent challenges for beamforming algorithms, statistical methods, and existing mask-based deep learning algorithms. We propose the small model on low SNR (SMoLnet), a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) to suppress UAV noise in noisy speech signals recorded off a microphone array mounted on the UAV. The proposed SMoLnet employs a large analysis window to achieve high spectral resolution since the loud UAV noise exhibits a narrow-band harmonic pattern. In the proposed SMoLnet model, exponentially-increasing dilated convolution layers were adopted to capture the global relationship across the frequency dimension. Furthermore, we performed direct spectral mapping between noisy and clean complex spectrogram to cater to the low SNR scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed SMoLnet outperforms existing dilation-based models in terms of speech quality and objective speech intelligibility metrics for UAV noise reduction. In addition, the proposed SMoLnet requires fewer parameters and achieves lower latency than the compared models.},

abstract={The monitoring of growth stages of a crop is vital for farmers to optimize the use of agronomic inputs and crop-management. Manual observation of the growth stages of a crop in large fields is a time consuming and labor-intensive task. To reduce human efforts in this tedious work, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based remote sensing with the emergence of different technologies like deep learning is helping in monitoring the health of a crop. However, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models need a lot of labeled data and computations to get trained to automate the process. In this paper, a pixel-based segmentation method has been proposed for tassel detection, and estimation of growth stages like tasseling, and day to 50% tasseling of maize crop. The performance analysis shows that the proposed method reduces time in developing the dataset for the training of CNN models. It also gives an advantage over training-time and computational complexity when compared to CNN models like YOLO and Faster-RCNN.},

abstract={Deep Neural Networks are considered a reference point in many applications, but they come with a higher cost related to the system used resources, i.e., memory and computational power. To build such real-time embedded systems is a challenge and a difficult choice, at least from the point of view of the best-fitted system like the one that should be specifically chosen for the computer vision tasks, to give an example. In this paper, such a task represents the central element of several different tested systems used to detect humans from a quadcopter. In this respect, a comparative study between detection systems implemented with one of the most general embedded platforms (i.e., a Raspberry Pi platform sustained or not by a neural engine Neural Compute Stick 2) and, respectively, with the Jetson Nano, as a dedicated embedded platform, is conducted and the results are discussed. Due to the specific characteristics of each embedded system, due to the particular hardware and software optimizations, different performances were obtained, even for similar detection systems. All these illustrate the impossibility of choosing the optimal system for a certain application only based on the catalog data analysis of both processor and system as a whole. The paper also highlights the advantages and limitations associated with each of the analyzed embedded system, specifically from the perspective of the functionality provided to the final detection system.},

abstract={An end-to-end image dehazing method based on convolution neural network is presented to solve the problem in which Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) high-resolution remote sensing images have reduced image sharpness due to haze. First, the original atmospheric scattering model is adapted to get an end-to-end dehazing model. Then, several unknown parameters are unified into one parameter, and the unknown parameter is estimated by using a multiscale convolution neural network. Finally, the parameter estimates are incorporated into the dehazing model to get a haze-free image. For the no reference image dataset, we first train the network using existing datasets, and then the network is trained using a self-built dataset. In this article, the haze removal effect for different types of unmanned remote sensing images is tested and compared with those of the main dehazing algorithms. The experiments show that the algorithm in this article has different degrees of improvement regarding its visual effect and objective indicators.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones are increasingly used for urban applications like traffic monitoring and construction surveys. Autonomous navigation allows drones to visit waypoints and accomplish activities as part of their mission. A common activity is to hover and observe a location using on-board cameras. Advances in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) allow such videos to be analyzed for automated decision making. UAVs also host edge computing capability for on-board inferencing by such DNNs. To this end, for a fleet of drones, we propose a novel Mission Scheduling Problem (MSP) that co-schedules the flight routes to visit and record video at waypoints, and their subsequent on-board edge analytics. The proposed schedule maximizes the utility from the activities while meeting activity deadlines as well as energy and computing constraints. We first prove that MSP is NP-hard and then optimally solve it by formulating a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Next, we design two efficient heuristic algorithms, jsc and vrc, that provide fast sub-optimal solutions. Evaluation of these three schedulers using real drone traces demonstrate utility-runtime trade-offs under diverse workloads.},

A novel adaptive neural network (NN) control law, based on an artificially constructed sliding manifold and radial basis functions (RBF) NNs, is proposed to achieve stable positioning of the quadrotor without any linearizing operations. Specifically, RBFNN approximators are utilized to compensate for uncertainties/disturbances, and the update law for weights of neural network is designed. By Lyapunov techniques, the stability of system is guaranteed and all the signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be bounded. Simulation results validate the superior performance and robustness of the proposed controller by comparing it with the classical control scheme.},

Through this work we try to resolve both these issues by construction of a straightforward machine learning architecture which accurately implements gesture recognition in real time and can also be utilized to build a generalized model. The solution we have developed is based on the premise that an architecture which can contextually recognize gestures and can also adaptively identify variations to the same can be used for solving problems ranging from body language detection, translating sign language to devising an intuitive method for controlling UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles).},

The proposed approach specifically targets the challenge of imperfect Channel State Information (CSI) due to the uncertainties of the wireless links. The users are characterized by types that depend on their experienced channel conditions, which are typically unknown to the UAVs, while the latter probabilistically estimate the users’ types. The users’ transmission powers are iteratively optimized and determined, while an Reinforcement Learning (RL)-empowered user-to-UAV association procedure is realized. The overall framework is evaluated via modeling and simulation regarding its proper operation, effectiveness and efficiency, under different scenarios.},

To get the data from only a respective paddock, the fence lines must also be detected correctly in the aerial images and videos. This will help to keep the data from each paddock separate. A unique system based on a combination of deep learning and machine learning is proposed to accurately detect the fence lines in the videos recorded by a UAV at an altitude of 80 m.},

abstract={This paper investigates the problem of age of information (AoI)-aware resource awareness in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile-edge computing (MEC) system, which is deployed by an infrastructure provider (InP). A service provider leases resources from the InP to serve the mobile users (MUs) with sporadic computation requests. Due to the limited number of channels and the finite shared I/O resource of the UAV, the MUs compete to schedule local and remote task computations in accordance with the observations of system dynamics. The aim of each MU is to selfishly maximize the expected long-term computation performance. We formulate the non-cooperative interactions among the MUs as a stochastic game. To approach the Nash equilibrium solutions, we propose a novel online deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme, which enables each MU to behave using its local conjectures only. The DRL scheme employs two separate deep Q-networks to approximate the Q-factor and the post-decision Q-factor for each MU. Numerical experiments show the potentials of the online DRL scheme in balancing the tradeoff between AoI and energy consumption.},

abstract={This paper investigates the time-varying formation control problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (multi- UAV) systems with unknown uncertainties and varying time delays. Firstly, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is adopted to estimate the lumped model uncertainties online for compensation. Then, a novel RBFNN-based fully distributed adaptive control scheme consisting of control law to stabilize the system and adaptive law to adjust RBFNN weights is developed to tackle the time-varying formation tracking problem in the presence of varying time delay. The uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB) of the formation tracking errors is theoretically analyzed through Lyapunov approach. Comparative simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control and adaptive laws proposed in this paper.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones) are emerging as a promising technology for both environmental and infrastructure monitoring, with broad use in a plethora of applications. Many such applications require the use of computer vision algorithms in order to analyse the information captured from an on-board camera. Such applications include detecting vehicles for emergency response and traffic monitoring. This paper therefore, explores the trade-offs involved in the development of a single-shot object detector based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can enable UAVs to perform vehicle detection under a resource constrained environment such as in a UAV. The paper presents a holistic approach for designing such systems; the data collection and training stages, the CNN architecture, and the optimizations necessary to efficiently map such a CNN on a lightweight embedded processing platform suitable for deployment on UAVs. Through the analysis we propose a CNN architecture that is capable of detecting vehicles from aerial UAV images and can operate between 5-18 frames-per-second for a variety of platforms with an overall accuracy of ~ 95%. Overall, the proposed architecture is suitable for UAV applications, utilizing low-power embedded processors that can be deployed on commercial UAVs.},

abstract={When a natural disaster occurs, the most critical task is to search and rescue trapped people as soon as possible. In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely employed because of their high durability, low cost, ease of implementation, and flexibility. In this article, we collected a new thermal image dataset captured by drones. After that, we used several different deep convolutional neural networks to train survivor detection models on our dataset, including YOLOV3, YOLOV3-MobileNetV1, and YOLOV3- MobileNetV3. Due to the limited computing power and memory of the onboard microcomputer, to balance the inference time and accuracy, we found the optimal points to prune and fine-tune the survivor detection network based on the sensitivity of the convolutional layer. We verified it on NVIDIA’s Jetson TX2 and achieved a real-time performance of 26.60 frames/s (FPS). Moreover, we designed a real-time survivor detection system based on DJI Matrice 210 and Manifold 2-G to provide search and rescue services after the disaster.},

abstract={The control of equipment such as camera gimbal, Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) and Load Transporting System (LTS) on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with its own flight control directly affects the performance of the mission in tasks such as tracking the target along the specified path and leaving payloads on the targets specified in the dangerous areas. In this study, neural network based real-time control of a hexarotor UAV is performed so that the payloads on the targets determined by path tracking can be left with minimum error. The Nonlinear AutoRegressive eXogenous (NARX) model of the UAV is obtained after the flight data are passed through the pre-processing, feature extraction and feature selection stages. The obtained neural network model is embedded in the flight control card to realize real time path tracking of the UAV. The three payloads in the cubic structure are both transported by the originally designed LTS and left with the help of LTS to targets on the path. Environmental testing is conducted taking into account the limitations of the physical properties of the LTS and specified path tracking on the autonomously moving UAV, and the impact on proposed NARX control algorithm's mission performance is examined.},

abstract={This article presents a geometric adaptive controller for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle with artificial neural networks. It is assumed that the dynamics of a quadrotor is disturbed by the arbitrary, unstructured forces and moments caused by wind. To address this, the proposed control system is augmented with the multilayer neural networks, and the weights of the neural networks are adjusted online according to an adaptive law. By using the universal approximation theorem, it is shown that the effects of the unknown disturbances can be mitigated. More specifically, under the proposed control system, the tracking errors in the position and heading directions are uniformly ultimately bounded. These are developed directly on the special Euclidean group to avoid the complexities or singularities inherent to local parameterizations. The efficacy of the proposed control system is first illustrated by numerical examples. Then, several indoor flight experiments are presented to demonstrate that the proposed controller successfully rejects the effects of wind disturbances even for aggressive, agile maneuvers.},

abstract={With the development of technology and the decreasing of manufacturing costs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered to be one of the most effective relay to expand the communication coverage and improve the performance of cellular networks. However, the communication system of UAV is very susceptible to Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing, causing it to deviate from the original trajectory and perform abnormal behavior. To address this issue, the abnormal behavior detection scheme of UAV using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the reliable normal behavior models for two different scenarios are established by applying RNNs to avoid the confusion of slight offset and abnormal behavior, so as to improve the accuracy of proposed detection scheme of UAV. Besides, in order to ensure the accuracy of training samples of RNNs, Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm is used to obtain a large number of current 2D arrival angle of UAV. Moreover, an appropriate threshold is selected through amounts of experiments to measure the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) between the real position and the position provided by normal behavior models, thus detecting the abnormal behavior of UAV. Experimental results reveal that the proposed abnormal behavior detection scheme is of high accuracy.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used to provide enhanced information coverage as well as relay services for ground Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. Considering the substantially limited processing capability, the IoT devices may not be able to tackle with heavy computing tasks. In this article, a multi-UAV-aided mobile-edge computing (MEC) system is constructed, where multiple UAVs act as MEC nodes in order to provide computing offloading services for ground IoT nodes which have limited local computing capabilities. For the sake of balancing the load for UAVs, the differential evolution (DE)-based multi-UAV deployment mechanism is proposed, where we model the access problem as a generalized assignment problem (GAP), which is then solved by a near-optimal solution algorithm. Based on this, we are capable of achieving the load balance of these drones while guaranteeing the coverage constraint and satisfying the quality of service (QoS) of IoT nodes. Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is conceived for the task scheduling in a certain UAV, which improves the efficiency of the task execution in each UAV. Finally, sufficient simulation results show the feasibility and superiority of our proposed load-balance-oriented UAV deployment scheme as well as the task scheduling algorithm.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently attracted significant attention due to their outstanding ability to be used in different sectors and serve in difficult and dangerous areas. Moreover, the advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence have increased the use of UAVs in various applications and solutions, such as forest fires detection and borders monitoring. However, using deep neural networks (DNNs) with UAVs introduces several challenges of processing deeper networks and complex models, which restricts their on-board computation. In this work, we present a strategy aiming at distributing inference requests to a swarm of resource-constrained UAVs that classifies captured images on-board and finds the minimum decision-making latency. We formulate the model as an optimization problem that minimizes the latency between acquiring images and making the final decisions. The formulated optimization solution is an NP-hard problem. Hence it is not adequate for online resource allocation. Therefore, we introduce an online heuristic solution, namely DistInference, to find the layers placement strategy that gives the best latency among the available UAVs. The proposed approach is general enough to be used for different low decision-latency applications as well as for all CNN types organized into pipeline of layers (e.g., VGG) or based on residual blocks (e.g., ResNet).},

abstract={With the wide applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in engineering such as the inspection of the electrical equipment from distance, the demands of efficient object detection algorithms for abundant images acquired by UAV have also been significantly increased in recent years. In computer vision and data mining communities, traditional object detection methods usually train a class-specific learner (e.g., the SVM) based on the low level features to detect the single class of images by sliding a local window. Thus, they may not suit for the UAV images with complex background and multiple kinds of interest objects. Recently, the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have already shown great advances in the object detection and segmentation fields and outperformed many traditional methods which usually been employed in the past decades. In this work, we study the performance of the region-based CNN for the electrical equipment defect detection by using the UAV images. In order to train the detection model, we collect a UAV images dataset composes of four classes of electrical equipment defects with thousands of annotated labels. Then, based on the region-based faster R-CNN model, we present a multi-class defects detection model for electrical equipment which is more efficient and accurate than traditional single class detection methods. Technically, we have replaced the RoI pooling layer with a similar operation in Tensorflow and promoted the mini-batch to 128 per image in the training procedure. These improvements have slightly increased the speed of detection without any accuracy loss. Therefore, the modified region-based CNN could simultaneously detect multi-class of defects of the electrical devices in nearly real time. Experimental results on the real word electrical equipment images demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the traditional object detection algorithms in defect detection.},

abstract={Deploying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted base stations with a renewable energy charging infrastructure in a temporary event (e.g., sporadic hotspots for light reconnaissance mission or disaster-struck areas where regular power-grid is unavailable) provides a responsive and cost-effective solution for cellular networks. Nevertheless, the energy constraint incurred by renewable energy (e.g., solar panel) imposes new challenges on the recharging coordination. The amount of available energy at a charging station (CS) at any given time is variable depending on: the time of day, the location, sunlight availability, size and quality factor of the solar panels used, etc. Uncoordinated UAVs make redundant recharging attempts and result in severe quality of service (QoS) degradation. The system stability and lifetime depend on the coordination between the UAVs and available CSs. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning time-step based algorithm for the UAV recharging scheduling and coordination using a Q-Learning approach. The agent is considered a central controller of the UAVs in the system, which uses the $\epsilon$-greedy based action selection. The goal of the algorithm is to maximize the average achieved throughput, reduce the number of recharging occurrences, and increase the life-span of the network. Extensive simulations based on experimentally validated UAV and charging energy models reveal that our approach exceeds the benchmark strategies by 381% in system duration, 47% reduction in the number of recharging occurrences, and achieved 66% of the performance in average throughput compared to a power-grid based infrastructure where there are no energy limitations on the CSs.},
