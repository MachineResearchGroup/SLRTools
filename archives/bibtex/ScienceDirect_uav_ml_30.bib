abstract = {The boundary effect of correlation filters is one key issue to limit the performance of visual tracking. Most existing methods focus on using regularization to constrain filters in the spatial domain, but less attention is paid to the channel information that is also important to enhance the discriminative ability of the filter. In this paper, we propose to learn the spatial-channel regularization jointly with the filter for visual tracking. Specifically, the channel regularization is integrated into the spatial regularization, which is exploited to make the filter more compact in spatial and channel domains. It benefits to improve the discriminative ability to identify the target from the background, even distractors. Additionally, the temporal coherence of the target is developed to enable the filter to be robust. The temporal regularization can suppress the sudden change of the spatial-channel regularization on the time axis, which can indirectly control the filter to pay attention to the target’s robust features. The regularization and filter can be jointly optimized by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. We evaluate our method on a standard database. The results show that compared with traditional methods, our tracker has improved significantly in performance and can achieve real-time tracking.}

One major challenge in such applications is how to deploy each robotic agent autonomously in a distributed manner. In this paper, we proposed a distributed coverage control strategy named multi-stage virtual force interaction scheme (VFIS), where the agents’ deployment process is split into stages and each agent iteratively seeks its next position according to the interaction among agents and the interaction between agents and the perceived environment. The interactions are realized via virtual repulsive forces and virtual vortex forces, where the latter are newly proposed to enhance the exploration capability of agents. We also designed a group of benchmark testing problems for the mission of monitoring coverage of complex environments with unknown obstacles. Extensive simulation experiments were conducted based on the defined benchmark configurations and the results showed a favorable performance of the invented strategy. In addition, practical experiments were carried out using a group of mobile robots, which validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Due to the large variability in mission requirements, greater emphasis is given to safety-critical displays, command and control functions as well as associated technology developments. Additionally, a top-level definition of RPAS mission-essential functionalities is provided, addressing planning and real-time decision support for single and multi-aircraft operations. While current displays are able to integrate and fuse information from several sources to perform a range of different functions, these displays have limited adaptability. Further development to increase HMI2 adaptiveness has significant potential to enhance the human operator's effectiveness, thereby contributing to safer and more efficient operations. The adaptive HMI2 concepts in the literature contain three common elements. These elements comprise the ability to assess the system and environmental states; the ability to assess the operator states; and the ability to adapt the HMI2 according to the first two elements. While still an emerging area of research, HMI2 adaptation driven by human performance and cognition has the potential to greatly enhance human-machine teaming through varying the system support according to the user's needs. However, one of the outstanding challenges in the design of such adaptive systems is the development of suitable models and algorithms to describe human performance and cognitive states based on real-time sensor measurements. After reviewing the state-of-research in human performance assessment and adaptation techniques, detailed recommendations are provided to support the integration of such techniques in the HMI2 of future Communications, Navigations, Surveillance (CNS), Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) and Avionics (CNS + A) systems.}

In this study, we acquired high spatial resolution multispectral and RGB imagery over a subtropical natural forest in southwest China using a fixed-wing UAV system. Digital aerial photogrammetric (DAP) technique was used to generate multi-spectral and RGB derived point clouds, upon which individual tree crown (ITC) delineation algorithms and a machine learning classifier were used to identify dominant tree species. To do so, the structure-from-motion method was used to generate RGB imagery-based DAP point clouds. Then, three ITC delineation algorithms (i.e., point cloud segmentation (PCS), image-based multiresolution segmentation (IMRS), and advanced multiresolution segmentation (AMRS)) were used and assessed for ITC detection. Finally, tree-level metrics (i.e., multispectral, texture and point cloud metrics) were used as metrics in the random forest classifier used to classify eight dominant tree species. Results indicated that the accuracy of the AMRS ITC segmentation was highest (F1-score = 82.5 %), followed by the segmentation using PCS (F1-score = 79.6 %), the IMRS exhibited the lowest accuracy (F1-score = 78.6 %); forest types classification (coniferous and deciduous) had a higher accuracy than the classification of all eight tree species, and the combination of spectral, texture and structural metrics had the highest classification accuracy (overall accuracy = 80.20 %). In the classification of both eight tree species and two forest types, the classification accuracies were lowest when only using spectral metrics, indicated that the texture metrics and point cloud structural metrics had a positive impact on the classification (the overall accuracy and kappa accuracy increased by 1.49–4.46 % and 2.86–6.84 %, respectively).}

In practice, to our best knowledge, existing image quality assessment algorithms might have deviation and supersaturation distortion on aerial images. To alleviate this problem, we leverage a random forest classification model to learn the mapping relationship between aerial image features and the quality ranking results.

Our prioritization approach operates before the MVS algorithm is executed and consists of two steps. In the first step, we aim to find a good set of matching partners for each view. In the second step, we rank the resulting view clusters (i.e. key views with matching partners) according to their impact on the fulfillment of desired quality parameters such as completeness, ground resolution and accuracy. Additional to geometric analysis, we use a novel machine learning technique for training a confidence predictor. The purpose of this confidence predictor is to estimate the chances of a successful depth reconstruction for each pixel in each image for one specific MVS algorithm based on the RGB images and the image constellation. The underlying machine learning technique does not require any ground truth or manually labeled data for training, but instead adapts ideas from depth map fusion for providing a supervision signal. The trained confidence predictor allows us to evaluate the quality of image constellations and their potential impact to the resulting 3D reconstruction and thus builds a solid foundation for our prioritization approach. In our experiments, we are thus able to reach more than 70% of the maximal reachable quality fulfillment using only 5% of the available images as key views. For evaluating our approach within and across different domains, we use two completely different scenarios, i.e. cultural heritage preservation and reconstruction of single family houses.}

abstract = {Background: As public health strategists and policymakers explore different approaches to lessen the devastating effects of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), blockchain technology has emerged as a resource that can be utilized in numerous ways. Many blockchain technologies have been proposed or implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive reviews have been conducted to uncover and summarise the main feature of these technologies. Objective: This study aims to explore proposed or implemented blockchain technologies used to mitigate the COVID-19 challenges as reported in the literature. Methods: We conducted a scoping review in line with guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). To identify relevant studies, we searched 11 bibliographic databases (e.g., EMBASE and MEDLINE) and conducted backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. The study selection and data extraction were conducted by 2 reviewers independently. Data extracted from the included studies was narratively summarised and described. Results: 19 of 225 retrieved studies met eligibility criteria in this review. The included studies reported 10 used cases of blockchain to mitigate COVID-19 challenges; the most prominent use cases were contact tracing and immunity passports. While the blockchain technology was developed in 10 studies, its use was proposed in the remaining 9 studies. The public blockchain technology was the most commonly utilized type in the included studies. All together, 8 different consensus mechanisms were used in the included studies. Out of 10 studies that identified the used platform, 9 studies used Ethereum to run the blockchain. Solidity was the most prominent programming language used in developing blockchain technology in the included studies. The transaction cost was reported in only 4 of the included studies and varied between USD 10−10 and USD 5. The expected latency and expected scalability were not identified in the included studies. Conclusion: Blockchain technologies are expected to play an integral role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Many possible applications of blockchain were found in this review; however, most of them are not mature enough to reveal their expected impact in the fight against COVID-19. We encourage governments, health authorities, and policymakers to consider all blockchain applications suggested in the current review to combat COVID-19 challenges. There is a pressing need to empirically examine how effective blockchain technologies are in mitigating COVID-19 challenges. Further studies are required to assess the performance of blockchain technologies’ fight against COVID-19 in terms of transaction cost, scalability, and/or latency when using different consensus algorithms, platforms, and access types.}

Computationally efficient representations of space–time correlations can be constructed using local models of conditional dependence which can reduce the computational load. We formulate a stochastic local interaction model for regular and scattered space–time data that incorporates interactions within controlled space–time neighborhoods. The strength of the interaction and the size of the neighborhood are defined by means of kernel functions and adaptive local bandwidths. Compactly supported kernels lead to finite-size local neighborhoods and consequently to sparse precision matrices that admit explicit expression. Hence, the stochastic local interaction model’s requirements for storage are modest and the costly covariance matrix inversion is not needed. We also derive a semi-explicit prediction equation and express the conditional variance of the prediction in terms of the diagonal of the precision matrix. For data on regular space–time lattices, the stochastic local interaction model is equivalent to a Gaussian Markov Random Field.}

abstract = {With growing consumer demand and expectations, companies are attempting to achieve cost-efficient and faster delivery operations. The integration of autonomous vehicles, such as drones, in the last-mile network design can curtail many operational challenges and provide a competitive advantage. This paper deals with the problem of delivering orders to a set of customer locations using multiple drones that operate in conjunction with a single truck. To take advantage of the drone fleet, the delivery tasks are parallelized by concurrently dispatching the drones from a truck parked at a focal point (ideal drone launch location) to the nearby customer locations. Hence, the key decisions to be optimized are the partitioning of delivery locations into small clusters, identifying a focal point per cluster, and routing the truck through all focal points such that the customer orders in each cluster are fulfilled either by a drone or truck. In contrast to prior studies that tackle this problem using multi-phase sequential procedures, this paper presents mathematical programming models to jointly optimize all the decisions involved. We also consider two polices for choosing a cluster focal point - (i) restricting it to one of the customer locations, and (ii) allowing it to be anywhere in the delivery area (i.e., a customer or non-customer location). Since the models considering unrestricted focal points are computationally expensive, an unsupervised machine learning-based heuristic algorithm is proposed to accelerate the solution time. Initially, we treat the problem as a single objective by independently minimizing either the total cost or delivery completion time. Subsequently, the two conflicting objectives are considered together for obtaining the set of best trade-off solutions. An extensive computational study is conducted to investigate the impacts of restricting the focal points, and the influence of adopting a joint optimization method instead of a sequential approach. Finally, several key insights are obtained to aid the logistics practitioners in decision making.}

However, most of the algorithms assume that all problem-related data remain unchanged during the optimization process, which is not a realistic assumption. Recently, dynamic optimization problems (DOPs) grabbed remarkable attention from the research community. However, the literature still lacks clear guidelines on selecting the most appropriate bio-inspired algorithm under changing environments. Due to the availability of many design choices, the selection of a suitable bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithm becomes an immediate challenge. This study proposes an algorithm recommendation architecture using Q-learning and hyper-heuristic approaches to help decision-makers select the most suitable bio-inspired algorithm for a given problem. To this end, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO), Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) are employed as low-level optimizers so that the Q-learning and hyper-heuristic automatically select the optimizer in each cycle of the optimization process. The proposed algorithms are implemented in dynamic multidimensional knapsack problems, a natural extension of the well-known 0–1 knapsack problem. The performances of the recommender and standalone bio-inspired algorithms are evaluated through a comprehensive experimental analysis including appropriate statistical tests. Thus, the significant differences among the algorithms are revealed. The obtained results point out the efficiencies of the Q-learning-based algorithm recommender and MRFO in solving the dynamic multidimensional knapsack problem.}

Software Product Line (SPL) testing is challenging mainly due to the potentially huge number of products under test. Most of the research on this field focuses on making testing affordable by selecting a representative subset of products to be tested. However, once the tests are executed and some failures revealed, debugging is a cumbersome and time consuming task due to difficulty to localize and isolate the faulty features in the SPL.
Objective
This paper presents a debugging approach for the localization of bugs in SPLs.
Method
The proposed approach works in two steps. First, the features of the SPL are ranked according to their suspiciousness (i.e., likelihood of being faulty) using spectrum-based localization techniques. Then, a novel fault isolation approach is used to generate valid products of minimum size containing the most suspicious features, helping to isolate the cause of failures.
Results
For the evaluation of our approach, we compared ten suspiciousness techniques on nine SPLs of different sizes. The results reveal that three of the techniques (Tarantula, Kulcynski2 and Ample2) stand out over the rest, showing a stable performance with different types of faults and product suite sizes. By using these metrics, faults were localized by examining between 0.1% and 14.4% of the feature sets.
Conclusion
Our results show that the proposed approach is effective at locating bugs in SPLs, serving as a helpful complement for the numerous approaches for testing SPLs.}

Given the desired formation pattern and the group trajectory, it is formulated as obtaining the control inputs of robots so that the formation errors converge to zero gradually with obstacle/collision avoidance subject to state and input constraints. The well-known nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) can be utilized as the solution framework due to its stability and robustness according with the reference state vector. Particularly, the null-space-based modulated reference trajectory generator is proposed to modulate the reference state vector of each robot. The original reference velocity, obtained from the Lyapunov stability theory, will be modulated quantitatively in the presence of each obstacle, and then the modulated velocities are integrated effectively on the basis of null space. From the perspective of trajectory generator, it is proven that the robots will avoid obstacles or collision without violating the stability of formation system. Finally the simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency and strong robustness of our method.}

However, these solutions typically require the use of additional participating nodes or sensors (e.g., to verify the location of the airplane by analyzing the physical signal) or modification of the current protocol architecture (e.g., adding encryption or authentication mechanisms). Due to the regulation process regarding avionic systems and the fact that the ADS-B system is already deployed in most airplanes, applying such modifications to the current protocol at this stage is impractical. In this paper we propose an alternative security solution for detecting anomalous ADS-B messages, which is aimed at the detection of spoofed or manipulated ADS-B messages sent by an attacker or compromised airplane. The proposed approach utilizes an LSTM encoder-decoder algorithm for modeling flight routes by analyzing sequences of legitimate ADS-B messages. Using these models, aircraft can autonomously evaluate ADS-B messages received and identify deviations from the legitimate flight path (i.e., anomalies). We examined our approach on thirteen different flight route datasets into which we injected different types of anomalies. In addition, we compared our proposed method with five commonly used anomaly detection algorithms: GMM-HMM, DBSTREAM, one class SVM, LOF and Isolation Forest. Our experiments show that by using our approach, we were able to detect all of the injected attacks with an average false alarm rate of 4.5%. Moreover, in all cases, the performance of the LSTM encoder-decoder algorithm outperformed the other algorithms.}

abstract = {Virtual laser scanning (VLS), the simulation of laser scanning in a computer environment, is a useful tool for field campaign planning, acquisition optimisation, and development and sensitivity analyses of algorithms in various disciplines including forestry research. One key to meaningful VLS is a suitable 3D representation of the objects of interest. For VLS of forests, the way trees are constructed influences both the performance and the realism of the simulations. In this contribution, we analyse how well VLS can reproduce scans of individual trees in a forest. Specifically, we examine how different voxel sizes used to create a virtual forest affect point cloud metrics (e.g., height percentiles) and tree metrics (e.g., tree height and crown base height) derived from simulated point clouds. The level of detail in the voxelisation is dependent on the voxel size, which influences the number of voxel cells of the model. A smaller voxel size (i.e., more voxels) increases the computational cost of laser scanning simulations but allows for more detail in the object representation. We present a method that decouples voxel grid resolution from final voxel cube size by scaling voxels to smaller cubes, whose surface area is proportional to estimated normalised local plant area density. Voxel models are created from terrestrial laser scanning point clouds and then virtually scanned in one airborne and one UAV-borne simulation scenario. Using a comprehensive dataset of spatially overlapping terrestrial, UAV-borne and airborne laser scanning field data, we compare metrics derived from simulated point clouds and from real reference point clouds. Compared to voxel cubes of fixed size with the same base grid size, using scaled voxels greatly improves the agreement of simulated and real point cloud metrics and tree metrics. This can be largely attributed to reduced artificial occlusion effects. The scaled voxels better represent gaps in the canopy, allowing for higher and more realistic crown penetration. Similarly high accuracy in the derived metrics can be achieved using regular fixed-sized voxel models with notably finer resolution, e.g., 0.02m. But this can pose a computational limitation for running simulations over large forest plots due to the ca. 50 times higher number of filled voxels. We conclude that opaque scaled voxel models enable realistic laser scanning simulations in forests and avoid the high computational cost of small fixed-sized voxels.}

In this paper a general definition of autonomous systems is presented and discussed that leads naturally to the establishment of metrics to measure the level of autonomy of a system. This definition is based on the systems ability to achieve goals under uncertainties and it does not involve the means by which the goals are achieved, such as sensing and feedback. This paper takes the point of view that any autonomous system is a control system, and that to achieve higher levels of autonomy one may need to add methods traditionally developed in areas such as operations research and AI.

Different from the previous work, the states of the followers form a predefined time-varying formation while tracking the state of the leader with bounded unknown control input. Besides, the communication topology can be switching, and the dynamics of each agent can have nonlinearities. Firstly, a nonlinear time-varying formation tracking control protocol is presented which is constructed using only local neighboring information. Secondly, an algorithm with four steps is proposed to design the time-varying formation tracking protocol, where the time-varying formation tracking feasibility condition is introduced. Thirdly, by using the Lyapunov theory, the stability of the proposed algorithm is proven. It is proved that the high-order multi-agent system with switching topologies achieves the time-varying formation tracking if the feasibility condition holds and the dwell time is larger than a positive constant. Finally, a numerical example with six followers and one leader is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.}

abstract = {The Sudanian Savanna (SS) of West Africa is characterized by tropical savannas and woodlands. Accurate estimation of AGB and carbon stocks in this biome is important for addressing sustainable development goals as the information can aid natural resource management at varied spatial scales. Previous AGB mapping efforts focused on humid forests, with little attention on savannas. This study explored the use of annual monthly time-series of Senitinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map AGB in the SS. Backscatter, spectral reflectance, and derivatives (vegetation indices and biophysical parameters) were combined with field inventory data in a Random Forest regression to map AGB. Eight experiments were conducted with different data configurations to determine: (1) the potential of S-1 and S-2 for AGB mapping, (2) optimal image acquisition period for AGB mapping, and (3) contribution of image derivatives to improving the accuracy of AGB mapping. The predicted map was validated with 40% of the inventory data. Uncertainty in the AGB was assessed using mean absolute error, root mean squared error, coefficient of determination and symmetrical mean absolute percentage error. Results show that about 90% of the study area have low AGB stocks of less than 90 Mg/ha. Compared to S-1 (RMSE: 78.6; MAE: 25.6), S-2 achieved better prediction accuracy (RMSE: 60.6; MAE: 19.2), although combination of the two according to seasonality produced the best results (RMSE: 45.4; MAE: 16.3). Images acquired in the dry season were found to be more useful for predicting AGB than those of rainy season. Also, stress-related vegetation indices and a red-edge dependent normalized difference vegetation index not tested in previous AGB studies using Sentinels were found to be significant contributors to the superior performance of S-2. Since biomass is a finite resource, our results can provide valuable information on the sustainable use of biomass and energy security including studies on carbon cycling and ecosystem functions in the region. The demonstrated possibility of using open access earth observation data to map and monitor AGB in data scarce regions is useful and beneficial to attaining SDG indicators 15.2.1 (sustainable forest management) and 15.3.1 (proportion of land that is degraded over total land area). Further work on developing species-specific wood densities and allometric equations is required to improve AGB and carbon stock estimation in the SS.}

abstract = {Informal small-scale mining is spread in many countries and provides livelihood to numerous families in rural areas yet often with devastating social and environmental impacts. The alluvial gold mining process in Colombia, also known as placer mining, involves excavations using heavy machinery and creates large footprints of bare soil and mining ponds. The very dynamic nature of this extractive activity and its spread in rural and remote areas make its mapping and monitoring very challenging. The use of freely available satellite data of the Copernicus programme provides great new possibilities to study these activities and provides stakeholders integrated data to better understand the spatial and temporal extent of the activities and mitigate affected areas. The objective of this work is to assess the potential of Sentinel-2 data to identify mining areas and to understand the dynamics in landcover change over a study area located at the border of the municipalities of El Bagre and Zaragoza in Bajo Cauca, Colombia. The study utilizes a classification approach followed by post-processing using field knowledge on a set of images from 2016 to 2019. Sequential pattern mining of classified images shows the likelihood of certain annual and seasonal changes in mining-impacted landcover and in the natural vegetation. The results show a slight reduction in the detected mining areas from 2016 to 2019. On the other hand, there are more mining activities in the dry season than in the wet season. Excavated areas of bare soil have a 50% chance to remain in excavation over the considered period or they transition to non-vegetated areas or mining ponds. Vegetation loss due to the extractive activities corresponds to about 35% while recovered vegetated areas are 7% of the total excavated areas in June 2019. An analysis of abandoned sites using NDVI shows that it takes a much longer period than the one considered in this paper for potential natural recovery of vegetation. Finally, the work was disseminated among stakeholders and the public on MapX (https://mapx.org), an online open platform for mapping and visualizing geospatial data on natural resources. It is a pilot study the will be the basis of the analysis of more regions in the department of Antioquia.}

abstract = {The new era of sharing information and “big data” has raised our expectations to make mobility more predictable and controllable through a better utilization of data and existing resources. The realization of these opportunities requires going beyond the existing traditional ways of collecting traffic data that are based either on fixed-location sensors or GPS devices with low spatial coverage or penetration rates and significant measurement errors, especially in congested urban areas. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) or simply “drones” have been proposed as a pioneering tool of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) infrastructure due to their unique characteristics, but various challenges have kept these efforts only at a small size. This paper describes the system architecture and preliminary results of a first-of-its-kind experiment, nicknamed pNEUMA, to create the most complete urban dataset to study congestion. A swarm of 10 drones hovering over the central business district of Athens over multiple days to record traffic streams in a congested area of a 1.3 km2 area with more than 100 km-lanes of road network, around 100 busy intersections (signalized or not), many bus stops and close to half a million trajectories. The aim of the experiment is to record traffic streams in a multi-modal congested environment over an urban setting using UAS that can allow the deep investigation of critical traffic phenomena. The pNEUMA experiment develops a prototype system that offers immense opportunities for researchers many of which are beyond the interests and expertise of the authors. This open science initiative creates a unique observatory of traffic congestion, a scale an-order-of-magnitude higher than what was available till now, that researchers from different disciplines around the globe can use to develop and test their own models.}

Logarithmic multivariate Gaussian models are trained to evaluate the performance of aircrafts at different flight phases (takeoff, ascent, cruise, etc.) separately. By including a forward synchronization, feature selection, and mini-batch training process, this model overcomes challenges introduced by the large size and high dimensionality of flight datasets. This framework also addresses the re-sampling issue in existing literature causing difficulties in handling time-series signals with different lengths. For demonstration and validation, the developed model is applied to analyze performance anomalies associated with the mechanical system and pilot operation in a historical flight dataset. Compared with existing literature focusing on similar datasets, this evaluation methodology shows promise in detecting performance anomalies especially at approach and takeoff phases. Therefore, the developed model is expected to be an effective addition to the current anomaly analysis and monitoring technologies for scheduled commercial flights. Applications include assisting transportation management systems by handling large amounts of historical flight datasets to analyze mechanical and operational anomalies, which may potentially improve future aeronautical system design and pilot training.}

The state observer is proposed to estimate unmeasured states and the adaptive tracking control is investigated to handle system uncertainties and external disturbances using neural networks (NNs) and parameter adaption method. For tackling the input saturation, an auxiliary design system is introduced to analyze the effect of input saturation, and states of auxiliary design system are used to develop the adaptive neural control.

Therefore, a precise method for monitoring individual tree health and estimating disturbance severity is urgently needed. Theoretically, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is a promising tool in high resolution remote sensing, which can provide information regarding the structural change of the affected trees with millimeter precision. However, few studies have explored the potential of TLS application in this field, especially when using only mono-temporal data. In this study, a single-scan TLS data-based method was developed and validated to classify defoliation at both individual-tree scale and plot scale. The objects were classified into three classes: healthy/slightly defoliated, moderately defoliated and severely defoliated. Sixty features were extracted from TLS data and optimized to six (individual-tree scale) and five (plot scale) explanatory variables by using a Random Forest method to accomplish the classification. By this approach, individual trees can be classified into three defoliation levels with 80% overall accuracy (kappa value 0.70), while plot-scale classification had 94% overall accuracy (kappa value 0.91). Point distribution characteristics proposed in this method were among the most important features for defoliation estimation. Evidently, the methods presented in this study are capable of providing satisfactory estimates of defoliation severity, and supporting a precise inventory and monitoring of forest health.}

Laser scanning nowadays offers a cost-efficient method to capture dense, accurate 3D topographic data of surfaces of the bridge. However, given the typical complexity of bridges, current workflows using commercial software to construct a bridge model still require intensive labour work. This paper presents a new approach to automatically extract the point cloud of surfaces of structural components of box and slab-beam bridges. The proposed method consists of 3 Parts: (1) point-to-surface, (2) superstructure and (3) substructure extraction. The method uses both spatial point clouds and contextual knowledge to extract point cloud subsets corresponding to surfaces of individual bridge components in a consecutive order from superstructure to substructure. For each bridge component, two levels of extraction are (1) coarse extraction to separate candidate points of the component from the full data set and (2) fine filtering to obtain final 3D points of individual surfaces using cell- or voxel-based region growing (CRG or VRG), followed by a connected surface component (CSC) method. An experimental test on one box-girder and one slab-beam bridges shows that the proposed method successfully extracts all surfaces of bridge components with the lowest F1-score of 0.93 based on a point-based evaluation. Moreover, a shape similarity evaluation also shows that discrepancies between extracted surfaces and ground truth ones are no larger than 0.82 for the area overlap ratio and 0.59 degrees for the angular deviation. The proposed method contributes to the automatic generation of 3D geometric bridge models and to give point clouds of individual surface for damage identification.}

The study was carried out at a centre which is part of the European Plant Phenotyping Network (EPPN) also aiming at contribute to the standardisation of phenotyping protocols. Four groups of 20 potted vines each were subjected to various irrigation treatments restoring 100% (control), 75% (IRR75%), 50% (IRR50%) and 25% (IRR25%) of their daily water consumption within a 22-day period of drought imposition. Leaf gas exchanges, leaf water potential (Ψ), photosystem II efficiency (Fv/Fm), RGB and NIR data were simultaneously collected during drought imposition. Values of Ψ in IRR25% vines reached −1.2 MPa pre-dawn, in turn stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic rate reached values as low as approx. 0.02 mol H2O m−2 s–1 and 1.0 μmol CO2 m−2 s–1, respectively. Through a cross-validation analysis, this study modelled (R2 = 0.78) the estimation of plant canopy area based on the number of pixel of RGB images of vines under various drought levels. Estimated leaf area was employed to calculate water consumption per unit leaf area, which resulted correlated (R2 = 0.86) with Ψ. Results revealed a correlation between Ψ and Dark Green colour class (R2 = 0.71) and suggest a new working hypothesis concerning the phenotyping of leaf (or petiole) angle. NIR and Dark Green colour fraction decreased with increasing levels of drought while the Yellow one increased. The outcomes presented may strengthen the role of RGB and NIR based images to identify the occurrence of water-stress in Vitis spp. and contribute to both the standardisation of phenotyping protocols pursued by the global phenotyping community and the possible development of new tools for precision irrigation in a HTP domain.}

abstract = {Oil spills due to accidental leakage from Container Ships in a Marine environment poses a major challenge to aquatic living organisms and affects human health by increasing the environmental pollution. Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's) are deployed for detection and cleaning of oil spills. As the coastal areas are vast and lengthy, effective path planning of deployed AUVs is necessary. Many path planning algorithms for AUVs have been proposed in literature using approaches which necessitate search through large distance. The AUVs have to travel through a large distance to detect the spills in the search area resulting in more energy consumption. In this article we propose an efficient approach for determination of optimal AUV paths for detection of oil spills resulting in reduced search distance for a given area. The proposed approach implements a hybrid evolutionary optimization algorithm named Whale Cuckoo Search Optimization Algorithm (WCSOA) that results in increase in the search space, global search ability and the convergence speed. With the proposed approach the overall search delay and energy consumption of AUVs are reduced. It is observed from the simulation results obtained that the proposed approach provides reduction in AUV energy consumption by 57% compared to the existing Boustrophedon and WOA approach.}

To further support such a deployment, a new intelligent multi-task allocation and path planning algorithm has been proposed in this paper based upon the self-organising map (SOM) and the fast marching method (FMM). To specifically address the two critical issues of energy consumption and communication range, a novel energy coordination scheme as well as a task prioritising method have been proposed to efficiently assign tasks to a multi-USV system. The algorithm has been verified and validated through a number of computer-based simulations and has been proven to work effectively in both simulated and practical maritime environments.}

To overcome these problems, a new OMP algorithm is developed based on information theoretic learning (ITL), which is built on the following new techniques: (1) an ITL-based correlation (ITL-Correlation) is developed as a new similarity measure which can better exploit higher-order statistics of the data, and is robust against many different types of noise and outliers in a sparse representation framework; (2) a non-second order statistic measurement and minimization method is developed to improve the robustness of OMP by overcoming the limitation of Gaussianity inherent in a cost function based on second-order moments. The experimental results on both simulated and real-world data consistently demonstrate the superiority of the proposed OMP algorithm in data recovery, image reconstruction, and classification.}

The transformed box is used by workers who pack products then dispatched to customers. Nowadays, due to the rapid growth of E-commerce market and the growing variety of product box erecting technology requires more flexibility to erect various sizes of box efficiently. Such requirement brought the issue of significant setup time for erecting machine. A setup occurs when a worker adjusts a machine to change from the last box type of the previous order to the first box type of the next order and the setup is a big disruption in operating a box erecting machine. In this paper, we presents two ways to mitigate the disruption of a box erecting machine. One is to automate the setup process of the erecting machine and we propose the new type of machine which automates the whole setup process. The other way is to sequence box erecting jobs considering the setup time. It can reduce the setup time without any costly investment.}

The dynamics and kinematics of hose are modeled via a finite-segment multi-body method, which describes the hose–drogue assembly as a link-connected system. A controllable drogue is connected to the hose for automatically stabilizing the drogue's relative position under the influences of tanker trailing vortex, receiver bow wave, atmospheric turbulence, gust, and wind shear. Thus, a drogue position control law based on fractional-order method is designed to resist the multi-wind disturbances. Noting that it is difficult to tune the parameters of fractional-order controller (FOC), a modified pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO), the hybrid of heterogeneous comprehensive learning strategy and PIO (HCLPIO), is carried out to optimize the parameters of FOC. The simulation results show that the proposed optimized fractional-order feedback controllers effectively stabilize the controllable drogue to swing within an acceptable range.}

The study aims to enable manipulators to move the object in the desired and predefined direction efficiently. It is also desired to keep the force applied to the object limited to avoid distortion of its shape. Since practical systems usually confront limitations such as lack of complete system model information and disturbances, the presented approach should confront the effects of such phenomena on the performance. To fulfill the purpose, based on the universal approximation property, a powerful approximator for estimating uncertainties and disturbances based on differential equations is presented. Then a robust approximator-controller structure is designed to solve the multi-objective issue of position, orientation, and force control in the cooperating robotic system. To confirm a stable object grasp, and transportation, Lyapunov analysis is utilized and based on a thorough mathematical analysis, it is shown that the presented approximator-controller structure assures system stability. Finally, the proposed scheme is applied to two three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robot arms that cooperatively handle a common and rigid object. Various tests are performed assuming the unavailability of system model information and in the existence of perturbations, and the results are analyzed}

Battery and fuel cells are promising alternatives owing to high efficiency and low (even zero) local emissions. However, they are limited by either the low capacity or sluggish dynamic response. These shortcomings can be overcome by the hybridization of battery and fuel cells, which have been the focus of leading international automotive and shipbuilding companies.

The recursive feasibility of the optimization problem for the compound controller is guaranteed, and the closed-loop stability is ensured. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed scheme, a robust MPC framework is employed for comparative analysis. Finally, numerical simulations and discussions are provided to corroborate the performance of both compound strategies.}

On the basis of adequate data of the large amplitude oscillation experiment device in wind tunnel test, the unsteady aerodynamics model with nonlinearity, coupling and hysteresis is established by the improved Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method. Considering the nonlinearity of the longitudinal model of the advanced fighter and the aerodynamics characteristics of the post-stall maneuver, the control law under large attack angle is designed combining the backstepping method and the daisy chain allocation method. The first order filter is adopted to prevent the “differential explosion” problem. The designed control allocation law guarantees that the conventional surfaces and the vector nozzle deflect coordinately within the position limits and the rate limits. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) network is applied to model the uncertainty, and the stability of the proposed control law which considering the uncertainty is also proved. Digital simulations of the typical “Cobra” maneuver under the unsteady aerodynamics are completed with comparisons under different conditions. Simulations results verify the validity of the proposed control law under unsteady aerodynamics and the aerodynamics uncertainty.}

At present, most of the solutions are based on lower time resolution data or composite satellite data. In this paper, multi-source satellite data were fused by weighted average method and reconstructed through the Data INterpolating Convolutional Auto-Encoder method (DINCAE) and used to investigate daily sea surface responses to typhoons. The root mean squared error (RMSE) between the reconstructed data and the cross-validation data for SST and CHL was only 1.093 °C and 0.7833 mg/m3. Three response patterns were reported over the East China Sea (ECS). The first one was that both SST and CHL have significant changes, the second was that only SST changes a lot, and the third one was only CHL changes significantly after typhoons. Moreover, it was found that, after some typhoons, the SST or CHL had a wide range of changes, but the amount of changes is not large. The different responses were related to the wind speed and moving speed of typhoons. In addition, when two typhoons pass by successively, although the wind speed is low, the sea surface would have significant responses. Further, areas of significant SST drops coincide with negative sea level anomaly (SLA) fields in some typhoon tracks. SST drops to its minimum level 2 days after the arrival of a typhoon and returns to its previous level 15 days after the arrival. CHL keeps increasing until 4 days after the typhoon’s passage, and then drops to its initial level around 10 days after the passage. The responses of SST and CHL decrease with distance, with prominent changes occurring within 100 km of the typhoon’s center.}

abstract = {Underactuated robotic systems have become an important research topic aiming at significant improvement of the behavioural performance and energy efficiency. Adopting some bio-inspired ideas and properties, the self-organisation and main tasks of the robotic systems can be achieved by coordination of the subsystems and dynamic interaction with the environment. Conversely, biological systems achieve energy efficient and adaptive behaviours through extensive autologous and exogenous compliant interactions. The "trick" that give rise to the lifelike movements is appropriate application of the bio-inspired ideas and properties, and construction of control systems in a generally underactuated system. In this paper, we aim to strengthen the links between two research communities of robotics and control by presenting a systematic survey work in underactuated robotic systems, in which both key challenges and notable successes in bio-inspiration, trajectory planning and control are highlighted and discussed. One particular emphasis of this article lies on the illustration of roles of bio-inspired properties, control algorithms and prior knowledge in achieving these successes and specifically, how they contribute to the taming of the complexity of the linked domains. We demonstrate how bio-inspiration and control methods may be profitably applied, and we also note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.}

abstract = {Object tracking in crowded spaces is a challenging but very important task in computer vision applications. However, due to interactions among large-scale pedestrians and common social rules, predicting the complex human mobility in a crowded scene becomes difficult. This paper proposes a novel human trajectory prediction model in a crowded scene called the social-affinity LSTM model. Our model can learn general human mobility patterns and predict individual’ s trajectories based on their past positions, in particular, with the influence of their neighbors in the Social Affinity Map (SAM). The SAM clusters the relative positions of surrounding individuals, and represents the distribution of the relative positions by different bins with semantic descriptions. We formulate the problem of trajectory prediction together with interactions among people as a sequence generation task with social affinity. The proposed model utilizes the LSTM to learn general human moving patterns as well as the Social Affinity Map to connect neighbors with a weight matrix corresponding to SAM bins for learning the social dependencies between correlated pedestrians. By capturing the object’ s past positions and connecting the hidden states of it’ s neighbors in different SAM bins with different elements of the weight matrix, the social-affinity LSTM is able to predict the trajectory of each pedestrian with its own features and neighbors’ influence. We compare the performance of our method with the Social LSTM model on several public datasets. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on these datasets with the best results, especially the datasets with more social affinity phenomena.}

abstract = {The problem of infinite-horizon multi-agent differential games is investigated, where the process can be modeled by a set of uncertain linear dynamics. The players are divided into two teams, one of which consists of a fixed number of follower agents while the other has one leader agent. The two teams constitute the adversaries. The multi-agent differential games can be transformed into a two-player game. The dynamics of the agents are subjected to norm-bound model uncertainties. Based on quadratic stabilization techniques, a set of saddle point strategies of the game is designed to stabilize the closed-loop multi-agent system, where the weighting matrices of the cost function are properly selected. For any given cost function, by modifying the solution of the linear quadratic differential game of the nominal model, the sufficient conditions are presented such that the stabilization of the system is guaranteed and the uncertainties are compensated. It is proved that the modified solution achieves optimality. A numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.}

Several factors have been highlighted as key controls of bloom occurrence, including nutrient dynamics, local hydrology, climatic perturbations, watershed geomorphology, biogeochemistry, food-web control, and algal competition. However, a major research gap continues to be the degree to which groundwater inputs modulate microbial biomass production and food-web dynamics at the terrestrial-aquatic interface. We present a synthesis of groundwater related algal bloom literature, upon which we derive a foundational hypothesis: long residence times cause groundwater to be geochemically and biologically distinct from surface water, allowing groundwater inputs to modulate algal bloom dynamics (growth, decline, toxicity) through its control over in-stream water chemistry. Distinct groundwater chemistry can support or prevent algal blooms, depending on specific local conditions. We highlight three mechanisms that influence the impact of groundwater discharge on algal growth: 1) redox state of the subsurface, 2) extent of water-rock interactions, and 3) stability of groundwater discharge. We underscore that in testing hypotheses related to groundwater control over algal blooms, it is critical to understand how changes in land use, water management, and climate will influence groundwater dynamics and, thus, algal bloom probabilities. Given this challenge, we argue that advances in both modeling and data integration, including genomics data and integrated process-based models that capture groundwater dynamics, are needed to illuminate mechanistic controls and improve predictions of algal blooms.}

abstract = {Humanoid robotics is an emerging area of interest in the current engineering research scenario, owing to its ability to impersonate human deportment and emulate various jobs. The given article emphasizes the development and implementation of a hybrid navigational controller to optimize the path length, energy demand, and time spent for accomplishing assigned tasks. The proposed navigational controller is developed by hybridizing the metaheuristic Improved Spider Monkey Optimization (ISMO) approach and the Regression Analysis (RA) approach. Various input parameters like obstacle and target locations are fed to the RA approach that implements a proper navigational direction selection. And it forwards to the SMO approach that is improved using piecewise B-Spline path smoother, which exercises further refinement of the output turning angle and smoothness of path around obstacles. Simulations and real-time experiments are undertaken using different controllers involving single robot systems, which shows the proposed controller’s superiority. An average improvement of 13.72% and 13.94% in path length against RA in simulation and experiment, respectively, and an average improvement of 7.59% and 7.5% in path length against ISMO in simulation and experiment, respectively, is obtained. It is further evaluated for navigation by implementing in a single robot having a multi-target problem. Multiple robot navigation has to deal with the self-collision situations that are solved by prioritizing the specified robot using the dining philosopher controller. It is implemented in the proposed controller for navigation of multiple robots to solve the conflict. Both scenarios are tested in the simulation environment and ratified in the experimental environment. Average deviation under 5% for path length and time spent for single robot navigation and multiple robot navigation is obtained, which shows a good agreement with each other. Energy efficiency test has been performed in contrast to default controller of NAO for various joints, and an average improvement of 8.16%, 5.9% and 20.57%, has been recorded in torque for ankle, knee and hip, respectively. Comparison is carried with an established navigational controller in a similar environmental setup shows an improvement of 8.6% and 10.365%, respectively, in path length and time spent. The results obtained from these setups prove the proposed hybrid controller to be robust, efficient and superior while performing path planning.}

Recently, there have been significant advances in the use of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) instruments, which facilitate the capture of detailed forest structure. However, for tree species recognition the structural information from TLS has mainly been used to complement spectral information. TLS-only classification studies have been limited in size and diversity of plot forest types. In this paper, we investigate the potential of TLS for tree species classification. We used quantitative structure models to determine 17 structural tree features. These features were computed for 758 trees of five tree species, including two understory species, of a 1.4 hectare mixed deciduous forest plot. Three classification methods were compared: k-nearest neighbours, multinomial logistic regression and support vector machine. We assessed the potential underlying causes for structural differences with principal component analysis. We obtained classification success rates of approximately 80%, however, with producer accuracies for three of the five species ranging from 0 to 60%. Low producer accuracies were the result of a high intra- and low inter-species variability. These effects were, respectively, caused by a high size-dependency of the structural features and a convergence of structural traits across species as a result of the individual tree position in the forest canopy and shade tolerance. Nevertheless, the producer accuracies could be improved through sensitivity vs. specificity trade-offs, with over 50% for all species being obtainable. The high intra -and low inter-species variability complicate the classification. Furthermore, the classification performance and best classification method greatly depend on its targeted application. In conclusion, this study proves the added value of TLS for tree species classification but also shows that TLS opens up potential for testing and further development of ecological theory.}

However, in the actual operation of the combustion system, there are contradictory indicators such as electricity consumption, coal consumption and clinker quality that are difficult to be jointly optimized, as well as dynamic and complex working conditions that are difficult to be artificially adjusted to the optimal state. In order to solve the above problems, a multi-objective optimal predictive control model is proposed in this paper. The prediction part of the model consists of a prediction model of cement burning system based on convolutional neural network. The optimization part, on the other hand, combines electricity and coal consumption into one energy target and uses cement clinker quality as a constraint to find the optimal production state. This modeling approach simplifies the problem and avoids the need to solve for the Pareto optimal solution. The control part is then based on the above-mentioned model with a double-cycle coupled cycle optimization to obtain set values of controlled variables that satisfy the changing operating conditions and finally control target to track the dynamic operating conditions. Experimental results show that the method described in this paper reduces the content of free calcium oxide after cement combustion, thus improving the quality of cement clinker, while reducing the fluctuations of the control variables in each production process and improving the stability of the combustion system. There is also a significant reduction in production energy consumption.}

The minmax formulation is shown to provide distributed control policies for linear systems under mild assumptions. The stability and robustness characteristics of the proposed solution are studied in terms of gain and phase margins, and related to the robustness properties of the single-agent LQR controller.

However, due to the relatively long distance between remote cloud and end nodes, cloud computing cannot provide effective and direct management for end nodes, which leads to security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel trust evaluation model based on the trust transitivity on a chain assisted by mobile edge nodes, which is used to ensure the reliability of nodes in the Internet of Things and prevent malicious attacks. The mobile edge nodes offer a new solution to solve the above problems with relatively strong computing and storage abilities. Firstly, we design calculation approaches to different trust chains to measure their trust degrees. Secondly, we propose an improved Dijkstra’s algorithm for collecting trust information of sensor nodes by mobile edge nodes. Finally, the experimental results show that our trust model based on mobile edge nodes can evaluate sensor nodes more precisely and enhance the security on the Internet of Things.}

However, openly accessible information at high spatial resolution is still missing at large for complete countries or regions. In this study, we combined Sentinel-1A/B and Sentinel-2A/B time series to map building heights for entire Germany on a 10 m grid resolving built-up structures in rural and urban contexts. We utilized information from the spectral/polarization, temporal and spatial dimensions by combining band-wise temporal aggregation statistics with morphological metrics. We trained machine learning regression models with highly accurate building height information from several 3D building models. The novelty of this method lies in the very fine resolution yet large spatial extent to which it can be applied, as well as in the use of building shadows in optical imagery. Results indicate that both radar-only and optical-only models can be used to predict building height, but the synergistic combination of both data sources leads to superior results. When testing the model against independent datasets, very consistent performance was achieved (frequency-weighted RMSE of 2.9 m to 3.5 m), which suggests that the prediction of the most frequently occurring buildings was robust. The average building height varies considerably across Germany with lower buildings in Eastern and South-Eastern Germany and taller ones along the highly urbanized areas in Western Germany. We emphasize the straightforward applicability of this approach on the national scale. It mostly relies on freely available satellite imagery and open source software, which potentially permit frequent update cycles and cost-effective mapping that may be relevant for a plethora of different applications, e.g. physical analysis of structural features or mapping society's resource usage.}

However, executing the planned actions has needed operational models, in which rich computational control structures and closed-loop online decision-making are used to specify how to perform an action in a nondeterministic execution context, react to events and adapt to an unfolding situation. Deliberative actors, which integrate acting and planning, have typically needed to use both of these models together—which causes problems when attempting to develop the different models, verify their consistency, and smoothly interleave acting and planning. As an alternative, we define and implement an integrated acting and planning system in which both planning and acting use the same operational models. These rely on hierarchical task-oriented refinement methods offering rich control structures. The acting component, called Reactive Acting Engine (RAE), is inspired by the well-known PRS system. At each decision step, RAE can get advice from a planner for a near-optimal choice with respect to an utility function. The anytime planner uses a UCT-like Monte Carlo Tree Search procedure, called UPOM, whose rollouts are simulations of the actor's operational models. We also present learning strategies for use with RAE and UPOM that acquire, from online acting experiences and/or simulated planning results, a mapping from decision contexts to method instances as well as a heuristic function to guide UPOM. We demonstrate the asymptotic convergence of UPOM towards optimal methods in static domains, and show experimentally that UPOM and the learning strategies significantly improve the acting efficiency and robustness.}

The optimal problem is transformed to find the trim state corresponding to the maximum volume of the reachable set. First, a relative motion model of the receiver aircraft with respect to the drogue is proposed. Then, based on reachability analysis, an optimization problem is formulated and a solution procedure is given in detail. In the simulation, the volumes of reachable sets are plotted with respect to the given discrete speeds and altitudes, based on which the optimal trim state of the docking phase is determined. Finally, the determined optimal trim state is verified by using numerous docking control simulations and the degree of controllability from another aspect.

Although the radio spectrum is considered as a scarce resource, the issue with spectrum availability is not scarcity, but the inefficient utilization. Unique characteristics of cognitive radio (CR) such as flexibility, adaptability, and interoperability, particularly have contributed to it being the optimum technological candidate to alleviate the issue of spectrum scarcity for multimedia communications. However, multimedia communications over CR networks (MCRNs) as a bandwidth-hungry, delay-sensitive, and loss-tolerant service, exposes several severe challenges specially to guarantee quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). As a result, to date, different schemes based on source and channel coding, multicast, and distributed streaming, have been examined to improve the QoS/QoE in MCRNs. In this paper, we survey QoS/QoE provisioning schemes in MCRNs. We first discuss the basic concepts of multimedia communication, CRNs, QoS and QoE. Then, we present the advantages of utilizing CR for multimedia services and outline the stringent QoS and QoE requirements in MCRNs. Next, we classify the critical challenges for QoS/QoE provisioning in MCRNs including spectrum sensing, resource allocation management, network fluctuations management, latency management, and energy consumption management. Then, we survey the corresponding feasible solutions for each challenge highlighting performance issues, strengths, and weaknesses. Furthermore, we discuss several important open research problems and provide some avenues for future research.}

abstract = {The paper overviews the state-of-art of aircraft powered by hybrid electric propulsion systems. The research status of the design and energy management of hybrid aircraft and hybrid propulsion systems are further reviewed. The first contribution of the review is to demonstrate that, in the context of relatively underdeveloped electrical storage technologies, the study of mid-scale hybrid aircraft can contribute the most to both theoretical and practical knowledge. Meanwhile, the profits and potential drawbacks of applying hybrid propulsion to mid-scale hybrid airplanes have not been thoroughly illustrated. Secondly, as summed in the overview of design methodologies, the multi-objective optimization transcends the single-objective one. The potential of the hybrid propulsion system can be thoroughly evaluated in only one optimization run, if several objectives optimized simultaneously. Yet there are few researches covering the conceptual design of hybrid aircraft using multi-objective optimization. The review of the most popular energy management strategies discloses the third research gap—current methodologies favoured in hybrid ground vehicles do not consider the aircraft safety. Additionally, both non-causal and causal energy management are needed for performing a complicated flight mission with several sub-tasks.}

abstract = {Nowadays, wearable electronic devices with rich functions have significantly facilitated individual combat in the military and daily lives of people. To achieve implanting and sustainable wearable electronic systems, it is necessary to develop self-powered sensors utilizing environmental energy harvesting with superior mechanical stretchability and flexibility. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can capture the low-frequency mechanical energy in human motion and convert it into electricity, which is expected to be a potential solution for this urgent need. In this review, based on advanced applications, the rich functions of TENG-based wearable devices are thoroughly discussed, including human body perception and human-machine interaction, personnel identification, as well as generation and recognition of coded information. Then, we elaborate on three crucial strategies for achieving an optimal design of TENG-based wearable devices, including selection and optimization of flexible materials, structural design and optimization, and synergistic information acquisition using multiple sensors. The representative signal processing methods are investigated to exploit the potential information behind the output signals, including basic qualitative waveform features and quantization thresholds, anti-interference processing and joint processing of multiple signals, and implementation of complex functions based on artificial intelligence. The review concludes with an overview of the remaining key challenges and potential technologies that can achieve the ultimate goal of a “fully self-powered wearable microsystem”.}

abstract = {In this paper, the effects of various parameters, especially three engineering parameters (twist, sweep, lean), on aerodynamic and structural performance of the fan blade were investigated. The change of blade geometry was realized by the free-form deformation (FFD) approach, which was more flexible than traditional parametric methods. A coupled iterative loop was used in a multi-objective optimization process considering two operating conditions. Not only the effect of a single parameter, but also the coupled effects of any two of them were studied. From the Design of Experiment (DoE) results, it was found that the twist and sweep have a relatively strong influence on aerodynamic performance compared with the lean. In addition, it's noteworthy that the effect of twist varied at different operating conditions. At a relatively low mass flow rate, an excessive twist caused a sudden drop in the total pressure ratio. Optimization results showed that the maximum blade stress was dominated by the twist, and a backward sweep at mid-span decreased the stress on the blade surface. The design of twist (DoT) and sweep (DoS) provided a significant improvement of total pressure ratio ranging from 5% to 15% approximately throughout the operating range. Although the peak efficiency was increased by about 1.3% for DoT, the strong tip leakage vortex caused a premature rotating instability compared with the baseline design.}

The compared strategies were the Classical First Order Sliding Mode Controller, the Super Twisting Sliding Mode Controller, the Modified Super Twisting Sliding Mode Controller and the Nonsingular Terminal Super Twisting Sliding Mode Controller. The last three controllers are based on the second order sliding mode technique, and they ensure robustness with respect to modeling errors even under external disturbances while reducing the chattering phenomenon in comparison with first order sliding mode controllers. Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove convergence in finite time of the altitude tracking error in the different proposed control laws.

In these models, drones are launched from the truck to deliver packages and return to the truck after delivery. The considered models vary with respect to the level of synchronization between the truck and the drones. We mathematically formulate the associated routing problems and prove theoretical bounds on the maximum possible savings that can be obtained by these models compared to truck-only routes. Further, we use a Truck and Drone Routing Algorithm (TDRA), which we use to evaluate these models on four sets of problem instances, as well as two realistic case studies. Our numerical results indicate that a higher level of synchronization considerably leads to reduced customer waiting times. The results of our case study analysis also show that these models can obtain more than 60% customer waiting time reduction compared to a truck-only scenario although the percentage of reduction depends on the values of the underlying parameters of the problem, such as the number of drones, the drone to truck speed ratio, and the drone flight time limit.}

This narrative takes sociomaterial arrangements for granted and conceptualizes technology affordance - the problem-solving capability of a technology - as a standard built-in feature that automatically activates during technology deployment, leading to undiversified and predetermined collective benefits. This paper demonstrates that not everything is as it seems; implementing a technology is a necessary but insufficient condition for triggering its potential problem-solving capability. The potential affordance and effects of a technology are mediated by the sociomaterial arrangements that users assemble to connect their goals to the materiality of technological artifacts and socio-organizational context in which technology deployment takes place. To substantiate this argument and illustrate the mediating role of sociomaterial arrangements, we build on sociomateriality and technology affordance theory, and we present the results of a systematic review of Covid-19 literature in which 2187 documents are examined. The review combines text data mining, co-occurrence pattern recognition, and inductive coding, and it focuses on four digital technologies that public authorities have deployed as virus containment measures: infrared temperature-sensing devices; ICT-based surveillance and contact-tracing systems; bioinformatic tools and applications for laboratory testing; and electronic mass communications media. Reporting on our findings, we add nuances to the academic debate on sociomateriality, technology affordance, and the governance of technology in public health crises. In addition, we provide public authorities with practical recommendations on how to strengthen their approach to digital technology deployment for pandemic control.}

During solar operation, each heliostat is aligned individually in such a way that the overall surface normal bisects the angle between the sun’s position and the aim point coordinate on the receiver. Due to various tracking error sources, achieving accurate alignment ≤1 mrad for all the heliostats with respect to the aim points on the receiver without a calibration system can be regarded as unrealistic. Therefore, a calibration system is necessary not only to improve the aiming accuracy for achieving desired flux distributions but also to reduce or eliminate spillage. An overview of current larger-scale central receiver systems (CRS), tracking error sources and the basic requirements of an ideal calibration system is presented. Leading up to the main topic, a description of general and specific terms on the topics heliostat calibration and tracking control clarifies the terminology used in this work. Various figures illustrate the signal flows along various typical components as well as the corresponding monitoring or measuring devices that indicate or measure along the signal (or effect) chain.

abstract = {Gully head erosion is a significant process in semi-arid regions contributing to land degradation and hillslope dynamics. Predicting when and where gully heads will expand under different seasonal scenarios is an essential step to take the appropriate mitigation measures. The LANDPLANER model was applied in this study area in order to analyze and investigate specific issues related to the triggering of gully head processes. The model is mainly designed to describe the dynamic response of slopes (or basins) under changing scenarios, including meteorological factors, vegetation or land use, and slope morphology. This model enabled us to predict the occurrence of gully heads under different seasonal conditions defined by Curve Number and rainfall scenarios. The LANDPLANER erosion modeling schema is twofold and integrates two different approaches. The first is empirical and exploits an erosion topographic threshold equation, while the second is aimed to define an erosion index calculated starting from the results of the hydrological model. These two indices predict where erosion processes can occur. To analyze the impact of land use changes on slope response to rainfall events, we simulated seasonal land use changes scenarios, modifying the Curve Number values associated to each specific land use classes. The twofold strategy was also adopted to validate the model, namely testing the model with synthetic dataset, and applying the model to real cases. The results indicated that the density of gully heads is more frequent in the South facing slopes with low elevation (around 200–300 m), steeper slope (within 20–40°), and higher average accumulation value (>100 m). Higher values of topographic threshold and erosion index (region 1: 13.1, region 2: 8.9) are obtained for the cold season in winter, where rainfall is intense and vegetation cover is lowest in the rangelands. Given to both observing receiver operating characteristic curve, the best and worst performances of gully head occurrence belong to the third Curve Number scenario (the lowest vegetation cover in terms of rangelands in winter) and the second Curve Number scenario (the lowest vegetation covers in terms of agricultural lands in summer) in turn. Further, the LANDPLANNER model effectively characterizes the status and trend of gully head formation in the study area.}

Across Antarctica, moss beds are experiencing changes in health as their environment changes. As Antarctic moss beds are spatially fragmented with relatively small extent they require very high resolution remotely sensed imagery to monitor their distribution and dynamics. This study demonstrates that multi-sensor imagery collected by an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) provides a novel data source for assessment of moss health. In this study, we train a Random Forest Regression Model (RFM) with long-term field quadrats at a study site in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica and apply it to UAS RGB and 6-band multispectral imagery, derived vegetation indices, 3D topographic data, and thermal imagery to predict moss health. Our results suggest that moss health, expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100% healthy, can be estimated with a root mean squared error (RMSE) between 7 and 12%. The RFM also quantifies the importance of input variables for moss health estimation showing the multispectral sensor data was important for accurate health prediction, such information being essential for planning future field investigations. The RFM was applied to the entire moss bed, providing an extrapolation of the health assessment across a larger spatial area. With further validation the resulting maps could be used for change detection of moss health across multiple sites and seasons.}

GOA is a recently proposed metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the swarming behavior of grasshoppers. This algorithm is proved to be efficient in solving global unconstrained and constrained optimization problems. However, the original GOA has some drawbacks, such as easy to fall into local optimum and slow convergence speed. To overcome these shortcomings, an improved GOA which combines three strategies to achieve a more suitable balance between exploitation and exploration was established. Firstly, Gaussian mutation is employed to increase population diversity, which can make GOA has stronger local search ability. Then, Levy-flight strategy was adopted to enhance the randomness of the search agent's movement, which can make GOA have a stronger global exploration capability. Furthermore, opposition-based learning was introduced into GOA for more efficient search solution space. Based on the improved GOA, an effective kernel extreme learning machine model was developed for financial stress prediction. As the experimental results show, the three strategies can significantly boost the performance of GOA and the proposed learning scheme can guarantee a more stable kernel extreme learning machine model with higher predictive performance compared to others.}

Although DTNs were originally designed for space-planned explorations, they can be used for crisis management in natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, etc. One of the major disadvantages of DTNs is the lack of sufficient motivation among nodes to forward messages. This problem can lead to degradation in network performance. In this paper, we propose a method to forward messages inspired by the Landlord-Peasants game in such a way that leads to more collaboration between selfish nodes. In our proposed method, each node joins one of the coalitions. In each coalition, the sender and receiver nodes play the role of landlord and peasant, respectively. Both landlord and peasant, upon relaying a message, receive reputation. In this way, both parties have a motivation to participate in forwarding operations. The simulation of the proposed algorithm shows its superiority compared to well-known baseline methods such as Direct Delivery, PRoPHET, Epidemic, and Spray&Wait in terms of delivery ratio, buffer usage, number of hops, etc. For the sake of fairness, we also compare the proposed method with a learning-based state-of-the-art method, called K-nearest neighbors routing. The results also show that the overhead of the proposed method is not much higher than that of baseline and state-of-the-art methods.}

First, we describe a video pre-processing step, to increase invariance against water reflections and water colours. Second, we investigate the temporal and spatial properties of water and derive corresponding local descriptors. The descriptors are used to locally classify the presence of water and a binary water detection mask is generated through spatio-temporal Markov Random Field regularization of the local classifications.

Different from continuous working system, a considerable part of IWS’s lifetime is spent in storage state. Temperature, humidity, corrosion and long-term storage in storage state jointly contribute to a non-ignorable part of the degradation of the IWSs. Motivated by this problem, in this paper, a novel reliability model considering both storage degradation and working degradation is developed based on Wiener process. In the proposed model, the distribution of degradation states at the transition points between storage state and working state is included. Further, the IWS whose duration time of storage state and working state are predetermined fixed values is categorized as scheduled IWS and the IWS whose duration time of the two states are random variables is random IWS. Randomness that exists in duration time of each state period as well as the accumulative duration time of each state is analysed and considered. The general degradation model of scheduled IWS and random IWS are obtained and expression of IWS’s reliability is derived from the proposed model. Finally, analytical results as well as Monte Carlo simulation results are compared to illustrate the effectiveness of the model.}

abstract = {The smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) is a type of sliding mode filter formulated in a predictor-corrector format and has seen significant development over the last 15 years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the SVSF and its variants. The developments, applications and improvements of the SVSF in terms of robustness and optimality are investigated. In addition, the combination of the SVSF with different filtering strategies is considered in an effort to improve estimation accuracy while maintaining robustness to model uncertainty. State estimation techniques such as the unscented and cubature Kalman filters (UKF & CKF), SVSF, the combination of SVSF with UKF (UK-SVSF), and the combination of CKF with SVSF (CK-SVSF) are applied on a 4-DOF industrial robotic arm. The SVSF state estimation performance is examined under different operating conditions. The results of these filters have been compared based a number of statistics such as the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), among others. It is shown that the UK-SVSF and CK-SVSF strategies acquire the best performance in the presence of uncertainties.}

abstract = {The vast majority of modern consumer-grade cameras employ the Rolling Shutter (RS) mechanism, which often produces geometrically distorted images due to inter-row delay during imaging, that needs to be properly handled. While several models and solutions have been proposed for the motion estimation problem of the monocular RS camera, the corresponding motion estimation model and algorithm have not been developed for the standard RS stereo setup. This is primarily due to the temporal-dynamic nature of the RS camera, which results in scanline-varying camera poses. This paper fills in this gap by developing two tractable RS stereo models under constant velocity motion and constant acceleration motion respectively, which only need to simply scale the optical flow vector. We further propose two corresponding RS stereo motion estimation algorithms to accurately compute the relative pose of the RS stereo camera between two consecutive frames. As a result of utilizing these RS stereo models associated with the parallel visual rays, our proposed methods offer better disambiguation of the translation and rotation, hence leading to significantly improved performance compared with the Global Shutter (GS) stereo model. Furthermore, we develop an RS stereo image correction method to remove RS distortions and recover high-quality GS images by conducting motion compensation. Experimental results on both simulated data and real RS stereo images show the superiority of our proposed models and methods.}

It addresses many challenges in terms of flexibility, scalability, radio resource management and energy efficiency. Caching popular contents at radio remote heads (RRHs) plays an important role for reducing fronthaul traffic congestion and delay in cache-enabled Cloud-RAN. Although, mathematical optimization methods have shown to be providing numerical solutions for addressing key signal processing issues in Cloud-RAN, the exponential complexity hinders their application in practice, particularly in large networks. Learning-based methods have become attractive to overcome the complexity issues associated with the mathematical optimization methods. Several subset selection problems have been formulated as a mixed-integer non linear program (MINLP) in wireless networks. Determinantal point process (DPP) is a probabilistic model of choosing two similar items which are negatively correlated. In this paper, we propose a DPP based-learning (DPPL) framework to obtain a subset of admitted users for cache-enabled Cloud-RAN with limited fronthaul capacity. The formulated problem of minimizing the total network cost including power and fronthaul cost while admitting as many users as possible is converted into mixed-integer second order cone programming (MI-SOCP). The subset of admitted users is obtained by learning the quality-diversity trade-off of the DPP using the optimal subsets of admitted users which are obtained by the optimization approach. We then propose an optimization algorithm to determine the beamforming and the base station-user allocation for the obtained subset of admitted users. We provide numerical results to assess the performance and complexity of the proposed DPPL algorithm and compare it with its optimization counterpart. The results reveal that the proposed DPPL can achieve a comparable performance with much lower complexity.}

To overcome some of the defects of the inflatable wing parameter design method, this paper proposes an optimization design scheme based on orthogonal testing and support vector machines (SVMs). Orthogonal testing design is used to estimate the appropriate initial value and variation domain of each variable to decrease the number of iterations and improve the identification accuracy and efficiency. Orthogonal tests consisting of three factors and three levels are designed to analyze the parameters of pressure, uniform applied load and the number of chambers that affect the bending response of inflatable wings. An SVM intelligent model is established and limited orthogonal test swatches are studied. Thus, the precise relationships between each parameter and product quality features, as well the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), can be obtained.

A search over the last decade was conducted in Web of Science and Scopus using the keywords: “flood vulnerability” OR “spatial modelling” AND “developing country”. The results reveal that flood vulnerability mapping in developing countries was integrated and multi-disciplinary and the mapping was mainly done at a community level or local level. Indicator-based multi-criteria analysis approaches and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were commonly used in mapping flood vulnerability. The selection of criteria or indicators was mostly based on the existing literature and expert knowledge. Stakeholder participation and use of indigenous knowledge in producing the flood vulnerability maps was limited in the reviewed studies. Sensitivity analysis was hardly done and the lack of reliable, updated and high-resolution data adversely affected the validation and usability of the flood vulnerability maps. Since a lot of people especially in urban areas are expected to be vulnerable to flood hazards due to climate change, validated and accurate flood vulnerability maps are crucial in supporting decision making and strategic interventions aimed are reducing flood risks.}

For control purposes virtual reticle plane (VRP) algorithm is used to track the relative 3D position of the quadrotor to the tilting and moving target landing platform within the range of the camera’s field of view (FOV). In this article, the landing platform’s tilting motion is considered sinusoidal type oscillatory motion for the overhead camera. For control purposes, an adaptive finite-time control (AFTC) is proposed, based on the finite-time control (FTC) and adaptive approximation of uncertainties. A constructive combination of FTC and adaptive approximation inherits benefits of both to overcome each other’s limitations. The task of the controller is to regulate the position error to zero in time calculated by VRP. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the VRP algorithm to track the desired parameters of the moving target. Finally, simulations are performed to illustrate the effectiveness and improved performance of the proposed AFTC in response time, robustness, and tracking accuracy.}

Despite substantial amounts of effort invested in the area, there has been very little actual deployment of mechanisms to guarantee QoS in the Internet. As a result, the Internet is largely operating on a “best effort” basis in terms of QoS. Here, we attempt a historical overview in order to better understand how we got to the point where we are today and consider the evolution of QoS/QoE in the future. As we move towards more demanding networking environments where enormous amounts of data is produced at the edge of the network (e.g., from IoT devices), computation will also need to migrate to the edge in order to guarantee QoS. In turn, we argue that distributed computing at the edge of the network will inevitably require infrastructure decentralisation. That said, trust to the infrastructure provider is more difficult to guarantee and new components need to be incorporated into the Internet landscape in order to be able to support emerging applications, but also achieve acceptable service quality. We start from the first steps of ATM and related IP-based technologies, we consider recent proposals for content-oriented and Information-Centric Networking, mobile edge and fog computing, and finally we see how distributed Internet governance through Distributed Ledger Technology and blockchains can influence QoS in future networks.}

However, it is difficult to adapt to different velocities and different types of obstacles including dynamic obstacle and static obstacle (such as road boundary) for AV. To solve the problem of path planning under different velocities and different types of obstacles, a two potential fields fused adaptive path planning system (TPFF-APPS) which includes two parts, a potential field fusion controller and an adaptive weight assignment unit, is presented in this work. In the potential field fusion controller, a novel potential velocity field is built by velocity information and fused with a traditional artificial potential field for adapting various velocities. The adaptive weight assignment unit is designed to distribute adaptively the weights of two potential fields for adapting different types of obstacles at the same time, including road boundary and dynamic obstacles. The simulation is carried on the Carsim-Matlab co-simulation platform, and the simulation results indicate that the proposed TPFF-APPS has excellent performance for path planning adapting to different velocities and different types of obstacles.}

Methods that consider high-order correlations in the label space, usually do not utilize pairwise correlations. In most of these methods, label correlations are considered as prior knowledge, which can be misleading in problems with noisy or missing labels. In such cases, learning the label correlation as part of the model training task is more effective. In this paper, a rule-based evolutionary multi-label classification method is proposed that incorporates the local label correlations through the high-order label subsets and pairwise dependencies. Graph structures are employed to model the label dependencies and the estimated label similarities are used to obtain more accurate label sets for the classification rules. To refine the high-order label relations, a novel hierarchical density-based clustering method is proposed to obtain a k-way partitioning for the label graphs based on their pairwise correlations. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimented on multiple benchmark datasets from different domains and compared with several well-known multi-label classification algorithms. The proposed method has shown the highest average rank along multiple metrics and the results are consistently better than or similar to the compared methods with statistical significance.}

In this work we develop an adaptive integrated guidance, navigation, and control system that can complete these maneuvers in environments with unknown dynamics, with initial conditions spanning a large deployment region, and without a shape model of the asteroid. The system is implemented as a policy optimized using reinforcement meta-learning. The lander is equipped with an optical seeker that locks to either a terrain feature, reflected light from a targeting laser, or an active beacon, and the policy maps observations consisting of seeker angles and LIDAR range readings directly to engine thrust commands. The policy implements a recurrent network layer that allows the deployed policy to adapt real time to both environmental forces acting on the agent and internal disturbances such as actuator failure and center of mass variation. We validate the guidance system through simulated landing maneuvers in a six degrees-of-freedom simulator. The simulator randomizes the asteroid's characteristics such as solar radiation pressure, density, spin rate, and nutation angle, requiring the guidance and control system to adapt to the environment. We also demonstrate robustness to actuator failure, sensor bias, and changes in the lander's center of mass and inertia tensor. Finally, we suggest a concept of operations for asteroid close proximity maneuvers that is compatible with the guidance system.}

The algorithm, called Check Node Self-Update (CNSU) algorithm, is based on layered normalized min-sum (LNMS) decoding algorithm while utilizing iteration parallel techniques to integrate both Variable Nodes (VNs) message and A-Posterior Probability(APP) message into the Check Nodes (CNs) message, which eliminates memories of both the VNs message and the APP message as well as updating module of APP message in CNs unit.

In addition, boll number provides a better understanding on the physiological and genetic mechanisms of crop growth and development, facilitating timely decisions on crop management to maximize profit. Traditional in-field cotton boll number counting by visual inspection is time consuming and labor-intensive. In this work, we presented novel image processing algorithms for automatic single cotton boll recognition and counting under natural illumination in the field. A digital camera mounted on a robot platform was used to acquire images with a 45° downward angle on three different days before harvest. A double-thresholding with region growth algorithm combining color and spatial features was applied to segment bolls from background, and three geometric-feature-based algorithms were developed to estimate boll number. Line features detected by linear Hough Transform and the minimum boundary distance between two regions were used to merge disjointed regions split by branches and burrs, respectively. The area and the elongation ratio between major and minor axes were used to separate bolls overlapping in clusters. A total of 210 images captured under sunny and cloudy illumination conditions on three days were used to validate the performance of the cotton boll recognition method, with an F1 score of around 0.98; whereas, the best accuracy for boll counting was around 84.6%. At the whole plot level, fifteen plots were used to build a linear regression model between the estimated boll number and the overall fiber yield with a R2 value of 0.53. The performance was evaluated by another ten plots with a mean absolute percentage error of 8.92% and a root mean square error of 99 g. The methodology developed in this study provides a means to estimate cotton boll number from color images under field conditions and would be helpful to predict crop yield and understand genetic mechanisms of crop growth.}

abstract = {A physically based metamodel is proposed to describe the dependency of canopy reflectance on the wavelength, leaf and soil optical properties. The four-stream solution is first applied to describe the interaction between the soil background and the vegetation layers. This leads to the calibration of four terms for a given canopy structure, observation configuration and leaf properties. This number can be reduced to two terms by using a linear approximation which shows a slight degradation when the multiple scattering contribution is significant. The dependency of each of the two or four terms on wavelength and leaf properties is described using the leaf total absorption coefficient. Our approach requires only 12 (linear approximation) to 24 (four-stream solution) simulations of a reference model to describe the full canopy reflectance dependency on wavelength, leaf and soil properties. The approach was evaluated against reference canopy reflectance simulations using the ray tracing LuxCoreRender model. LuxCoreRender was first compared against reference radiative transfer models. The reference dataset corresponds to a range of detailed 3D maize canopies showing variation of leaf and background properties and one heterogeneous scene including vegetation elements of different shapes that is classically used for model inter-comparison exercises under different view and sun directions in a set of wavebands. Results demonstrate that our approach provides an accurate description of the dependency of canopy reflectance on wavelength, leaf and soil properties with RMSE = 0.0017 for the four-stream solution and RMSE = 0.0022 for the linear approximation. The proposed approach appears therefore computationally effective and well suited to generate a large number of canopy reflectance simulations with detailed 3D radiative transfer models that can be used to retrieve vegetation characteristics from remote sensing observations.}

abstract = {Accurately estimating the aquatic-plant area on a pond surface is of great significance for regulating nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, increasing the dissolved-oxygen content, and ensuring the healthy growth of aquaculture organisms. Currently, remote-sensing methods for monitoring pond-surface aquatic plants have a high cost, long cycle, and poor real-time performance, which limits the practicability of these methods in aquaculture. To address the above problems, a pond-surface aquatic-plant area estimation method based on a hue-saturation (H-S)-component combination and an improved Otsu method, was proposed, which utilizes the advantages of fast and non-destructive computer-vision technology. First, the pond-surface images collected by the camera were preprocessed using a median filter. Second, a visual-saliency map of the aquatic plants was generated by combining the H and S components of the HSV color space. Then, the appropriate Otsu optimal threshold-selection criterion formula was selected to determine the optimal segmentation thresholds of the aquatic plants and background water. Finally, the aquatic plants in the image were segmented using the binary method, and the aquatic-plant area on the pond surface was estimated, based on the proportion of aquatic-plant pixels. In this study, an improved Otsu method was proposed to adaptively select the Otsu optimal threshold-selection criterion formula by judging the position of the highest and second highest peaks of the gray histogram of the visual-saliency map, which solved the problem of finding the appropriate segmentation threshold for different proportions of aquatic plants and background water. The proposed method was tested on real pond-surface images with a mean misclassification error of 0.0284, mean F1 score of 0.8396, mean precision of 0.8428, and mean recall of 0.9146. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method could accurately segment aquatic plants to accurately estimate the aquatic-plant area on the pond surface.}

abstract = {An operationally adaptive (OA) system for prediction of acoustic transmission loss (TL) in the atmosphere is developed in this paper. This system uses expert neural network predictors, each corresponding to a specific range of source elevation. The outputs of the expert predictors are combined using a weighting mechanism and a nonlinear fusion system. Using this prediction methodology the computational intractability of traditional acoustic propagation models is eliminated. The proposed system is tested on a synthetically generated acoustic data set for a wide range of geometric, source, environmental, and operational conditions. The results show a significant improvement in both accuracy and reliability over a benchmark prediction system.}

abstract = {In this paper, a robust adaptive neural network based controller is presented for multi agent high order nonlinear systems with unknown nonlinear functions, unknown control gains and unknown actuator failures. At first, Neural Network (NN) is used to approximate the nonlinear uncertainty terms derived from the controller design procedure for the followers. Then, a novel distributed robust adaptive controller is developed by combining the backstepping method and the Dynamic Surface Control (DSC) approach. The proposed controllers are distributed in the sense that the designed controller for each follower agent only requires relative state information between itself and its neighbors. By using the Young's inequality, only few parameters need to be tuned regardless of NN nodes number. Accordingly, the problems of dimensionality curse and explosion of complexity are counteracted, simultaneously. New adaptive laws are designed by choosing the appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals. The proposed approach proves the boundedness of all the closed-loop signals in addition to the convergence of the distributed tracking errors to a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulation results indicate that the proposed controller is effective and robust.}
