abstract = {Autonomous systems have been established as a ground-breaking technology in agriculture, particularly for resource optimization and labor savings. However, even those solutions that are limited to monitoring activities, such as yield estimation, rely on costly robotic platforms equipped with a series of range devices (e.g., LIDAR and GPS-RTK). Recently, vision-based strategies have gained considerable attention as a less expensive and more efficient alternative, capable to be on par with or even surpass approaches that benefit from range sensors. Nonetheless, they exploit deep learning methodologies, which require burdensome labeling procedures to perform training. To address these shortcomings, we present a novel approach that performs yield estimation requiring only a monocular camera and needs a limited amount of supervision information. It detects, locates and maps fruits and tree canopies to estimate the total yield of a specific crop. To keep the image labeling effort to a minimum, we propose a weakly-supervision paradigm that only requires a simple binary label encoding the presence or the absence of fruits in the training images. Our approach does not make any assumptions on the underlying platform, i.e., it can be used by collecting images either with a hand-held camera or with an autonomous robot. Therefore, we are able to considerably reduce the deployment time, the energy and the cost of the overall yield estimation system. At the same time, we keep the performance comparable to both vision-based fully supervised baselines (which require costly labeling operations) and classical systems that rely on more expensive and power-demanding sensors.}

Recent research results on related fields have catalyzed several accurate, versatile and reliable real-time Visual SLAM systems suitable for self-localization under a wide variety of environmental preconditions. These methods extend their functionalities from being only a good camera tracker to being able to recursively build up camera’s surroundings. The fast development of Visual SLAM research has proposed demands on innovating evaluation methods for Visual SLAM systems. However, retrieving images and ground truth from various kinds of environments, estimating calibration parameters between several sensors and annotating useful labels all require cumbersome human labor and will introduce inevitable errors. In this paper, we propose a method that uses virtually established models to automatically generate photorealistic images with accurate ground truth and several kinds of pixel-level annotations useful for Visual SLAM development and evaluation. We build and render a challenging dataset in low-texture environments with large scale camera movement, multiple moving objects and varying luminance status. We also propose several new evaluation criteria that can fully take advantage of ground truth and annotations from synthetic datasets. Experiments are conducted using the proposed datasets and criteria with several state-of-the-art Visual SLAM methods to demonstrate the functionality of our datasets.}

abstract = {Quadrocopters offer an attractive platform for aerial robotic applications due to, amongst others, their hovering capability and large dynamic potential. Their high-speed flight dynamics are complex, however, and the modeling thereof has proven difficult. Control algorithms typically rely on simplified models, with feedback corrections compensating for unmodeled effects. This can lead to significant tracking errors during high-performance flight, and repeated execution typically leads to a large part of the tracking errors being repeated. This paper introduces an iterative learning scheme that non-causally compensates repeatable trajectory tracking errors during the repeated execution of periodic flight maneuvers. An underlying feedback control loop is leveraged by using its set point as a learning input, increasing repeatability and simplifying the dynamics considered in the learning algorithm. The learning is carried out in the frequency domain, and is based on a Fourier series decomposition of the input and output signals. The resulting algorithm requires little computational power and memory, and its convergence properties under process and measurement noise are shown. Furthermore, a time scaling method allows the transfer of learnt maneuvers to different execution speeds through a prediction of the disturbance change. This allows the initial learning to occur at reduced speeds, and thereby extends the applicability of the algorithm for high-performance maneuvers. The presented methods are validated in experiments, with a quadrocopter flying a figure-eight maneuver at high speed. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the approach, with the tracking errors after learning being similar in magnitude to the repeatability of the system.}

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel adaptive multi-scale system for performing visual place recognition. Unlike recent previous multi-scale place recognition systems that use manually pre-fixed scales, we present a system that adaptively selects the spatial scales. This approach differs from previous multi-scale methods, where place recognition is performed through a non-optimized distance metric in a fixed and pre-determined scale space. Instead, we learn an optimized distance metric which creates a new recognition space for clustering images with similar features while separating those with different features. Consequently, the method exploits the natural spatial scales present in the operating environment. With these adaptive scales, a hierarchical recognition mechanism with multiple parallel channels is then proposed. Each channel performs place recognition from a coarse match to a fine match. We present specific techniques for training each channel to recognize places at varying spatial scales and for combining the place recognition hypotheses from these parallel channels. We also conduct a systematic series of experiments and parameter studies that determine the effect on performance of using different numbers of combined recognition channels. The results demonstrate that the adaptive multi-scale approach outperforms the previous fixed multi-scale approach and is capable of producing better than state of the art performance compared to existing robotic navigation algorithms. The system complexity is linear in the number of places in the reference static map and can realize the online place recognition in mobile robotics on typical dataset sizes We analyze the results and provide theoretical analysis of the performance improvements. Finally, we discuss interesting insights gained with respect to future work in robotics and neuroscience in this area.}

In order to obtain the better dynamic response of the longitude command, a novel control parameter design method is presented for the automatic carrier landing system. To overcome difficulties in the manual parameter adjustment task, the Lévy flight based pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) algorithm is utilized by converting the parameter design problem to an optimization problem. To optimize control parameters in the H-Dot autopilot and the approach power compensation system, a weighted linear cost function in the time domain is adopted. Series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method. Comparative results indicate that our method is much better than other methods.

Based on the study results of this behavior, the perception and neurology of flying insects, a novel bio-inspired guidance law is proposed for the terminal guidance for small aerial vehicle with charge-coupled device imaging seekers. The kinematics relationship between a small aerial vehicle and target is analyzed, and a two-dimensional guidance law model is established by using artificial neural networks. To compare with the proportional guidance law, the numerical simulations are carried out in the vertical plane and in the horizontal plane respectively. The simulation results show that the ballistic of the small aerial vehicle is straighter and the normal acceleration is smaller by using the bio-inspired guidance law than by using the proportional guidance law. That is to say, the bio-inspired guidance law just uses the information of the target from the imaging seeker, but the performance of it can be better than that of the proportional guidance law.}

This paper presents a novel neuron model of a locust looming detector, i.e. the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD1), in order to provide effective solutions to enhance the collision selectivity of looming objects over other visual challenges. We propose an approach to model the biologically plausible mechanisms of ON and OFF pathways and a biophysical mechanism of spike frequency adaptation (SFA) in the proposed LGMD1 visual neural network. The ON and OFF pathways can separate both dark and light looming features for parallel spatiotemporal computations. This works effectively on perceiving a potential collision from dark or light objects that approach; such a bio-plausible structure can also separate LGMD1’s collision selectivity to its neighbouring looming detector — the LGMD2. The SFA mechanism can enhance the LGMD1’s collision selectivity to approaching objects rather than receding and translating stimuli, which is a significant improvement compared with similar LGMD1 neuron models. The proposed framework has been tested using off-line tests of synthetic and real-world stimuli, as well as on-line bio-robotic tests. The enhanced collision selectivity of the proposed model has been validated in systematic experiments. The computational simplicity and robustness of this work have also been verified by the bio-robotic tests, which demonstrates potential in building neuromorphic sensors for collision detection in both a fast and reliable manner.}

This mechanism involves optimal placement of a wireless sensor network in a 2D environment for optimizing a set of metrics, such as coverage and cost. The topic of WSND has two challenging parts. First, it has a Multiobjective Optimization (MOO) nature instead of a single optimal solution due to the existing set of nondominated solutions. Second, its Variable length (V-length) decision space obtains nonhomogeneous solutions in terms of length. These challenging concepts cause traditional MOO algorithms to become insufficient to solve WSND; thus, developing an MOO algorithm with a V-length nature is required. In this study, Social Class Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization (SC-MOPSO) was developed for solving difficult optimization problems with MOO and V-length nature. The algorithm extends the concept of social interaction of Particle Swarm Optimization by decomposing the solution space into classes on the basis of their dimension. Furthermore, it incorporates intra and inter class operators for assuring the required dynamics of solution changes to reach the Pareto front. A set of mathematical optimization problems with two and three objectives based on different dimensions of mathematical functions was tested for evaluation. In addition, SC-MOPSO and the benchmarks were evaluated for accomplishing WSND. Experimental results show that SC-MOPSO outperforms all benchmarks in terms of domination for WSND with maximum percentage of 100% for Weighted Sum Variable Length Particle Swarm Optimization (WS-VLPSO) and minimum percentage of 68% for Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II).}

Second, a radar detection probability model is established by taking into account the influence of the radar maximum detection range, the aircraft RCS, and the distance between the aircraft and the radar. Third, a trajectory optimization solution framework with the dynamic model, constraint conditions, and optimal objectives is constructed. The hp-adaptive Radau pseudospectral method and the stepwise increasing constraints method are proposed to solve the optimal control problem.

Evidence has grown in the literature that such forecasts with a meaningful lead time are possible on various geographic scales and for a broad range of crops. Here, we present a systematic review of the methods applied in end-of-season yield forecasting and three frequently used data sources: weather data, satellite data and crop masks. Our literature database comprises 362 studies (2004–2019) which were evaluated regarding methods, crops, regions, data sources, lead time and performance. Moreover, we present 24 sources of real-time and predictive weather data, 21 sources of remote sensing data and 16 crop masks. Yield forecasting in our literature sample has been performed for 44 crops in 71 countries, also including many non-staple crops, but with an apparent bias in regions and crops. Forecasting performance depends on various factors, including crop, region, method, lead time to harvest and input diversity. Our systematic review supports a broader application of locally successful approaches at larger scales by providing a comprehensive, accessible compendium of necessary information for yield forecasting. We discuss improvement potentials with respect to methodological approaches and available data sources. We additionally suggest standardization procedures for future forecasting studies and encourage studying additional crops and geographic regions. Implications of forecasts for different target groups on different scales and the adaptation towards climate change are also discussed.}

All navigation systems are categorized in six classes: dead reckoning, image processing, statistical based developed algorithms, fuzzy logic control, neural network and genetic algorithm, and Kalman filter based. Researches in many agricultural operations from water monitoring to aerial crop scouting revealed that the centimeter level accuracy in all techniques is available and the velocity range for evaluated autonomous vehicles almost is smaller than 1m/s.

The method is firstly introduced to design the distributed coordination controllers for NMASs, which not only avoids the transmission of redundant data compared with traditional time-triggered adaptive dynamic programming (TTADP) strategy and minimizes the performance function of each agent. The event-triggered conditions are proposed based on Lyapunov functional method, which is deduced by guaranteeing the stability of NMASs. Then a new adaptive policy iteration algorithm is presented to obtain the online solutions of the Hamiton–Jocabi–Bellman (HJB) equations. In order to implement the proposed ETADP method, the fuzzy hyperbolic model based critic neural networks (NN) are utilized to approximate the value functions and help calculate the control policies. In critic NNs, the NN weight estimations are updated at the event-triggered instants leading to aperiodic weight tuning laws so that computation cost is reduced. It is proved that the weight estimation errors and the local neighborhood coordination errors is uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, two simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed ETADP method.}

abstract = {In the last twenty years, advances in technology led to a progressive digitalization in photography and photogrammetry and to the development of a considerable number of image processing software. In several fields, Digital Image Processing techniques began to spread. For example, in Civil Engineering there are many methodologies for the monitoring of reinforced concrete structures or road pavements. In most cases they involve the application of mathematical and morphological filters to two-dimensional images, to obtain quantitative information about the decay of the analyzed structures. Instead in Architectural Restoration there are still few researches focused on these methodologies, because of the great complexity and uniqueness of historical buildings. Furthermore, until now architectural photogrammetry mainly concerned geometric survey and it was not widely used to diagnose the presence of alterations on buildings, despite the great potential of a non-invasive, contactless survey technique. Therefore, the aim of this research is to create an analysis approach, to detect damages on three-dimensional models, richer in information about depth and volume. The analysis can be carried out through a specific set of spatial and morphological filters for advanced surface analysis, adopting software tools mostly used for three-dimensional metrology and surface topography. A sequence of operations can be executed, allowing to obtain quantitative information about some kinds of alterations (cracks or features induced by material loss) from three-dimensional models like point clouds or polygonal meshes. The procedure was tested and validated on a case study (Palazzo Palmieri, Monopoli – Italy). The result of the research is a low interaction approach, through which it is possible to identify and quantify damages on the surfaces.}

abstract = {To solve the problems of incomplete 2D display soil erosion, difficult visual expression, poor detail simulation of eroding slope, complex modeling technology, and high cost, a three-dimensional model reconstruction method for slope erosion based on sequence images is proposed. The method mainly uses structure from motion (SFM) and multi-view stereo (MVS) technology. First, the image sequence is feature matched using the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm for images captured by ordinary cameras. The random sampling and consensus algorithm is used to remove the false matching point generated by the nearest neighbor. Next, using the SFM method, the camera matrix and three-dimensional point coordinates are solved iteratively, and the nonlinear optimization is realized by bundle adjustment to distribute the errors evenly and improve the accuracy of the model. Finally, based on the patch-based multi-view stereo algorithm, the sparse point cloud generated by SFM is used as the seed patch to diffuse under local photometric uniformity and global visibility constraints to reconstruct the dense point cloud and establish the 3D model. To verify the reliability of the experimental methods, this paper takes the red soil erosion slope in Chenggong District of Kunming, Yunnan, China as the experimental object and realizes the rapid reconstruction of the three-dimensional model of the erosion gully on the slope. Multiple groups of adjacent eroded gully images are taken to verify the model, which involves method and accuracy of model. The results show that the modeling method has a good effect on soil modeling. The error from the control points is small and the relative accuracy is as high as 94.20%, 98.01%, etc. As a result, the control points can provide a reference for corrosion monitoring research for its reliable results.}

abstract = {A line is a common geometry for pollution sources, e.g., outdoor traffic pollution, and is thus useful for developing a suitable source term estimation (STE) method. Most existing methods regard the source as a single point that only includes location and strength parameters; however, limited attention has been paid to the geometric information of the source. This negligence may cause errors, or even failure, in the STE. Therefore, this paper proposes a line source estimation method that combines Bayesian inference with the super-Gaussian function. This function can approximate the shape of sources with several intuitive coefficients, which are adjusted to their true value through Bayesian inference. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through estimation of a line source in two cases: an ideal urban boundary layer, via simulation, and a complex urban square, via a wind tunnel experiment. The results demonstrate that this method is capable of identifying the source information without any prior geometric information regarding the source. Moreover, it was confirmed that the conventional point-based assumption method leads to failure in estimating the line source, which implies that geometry estimation is necessary for STE.}

abstract = {This paper presents an estimator-based minimal learning parameter (EMLP) neuroadaptive dynamic surface containment control design capable of guaranteeing transient and steady-state behavior for multiple quadrotors with uncertainties, such that the followers can be driven into the convex hull constituted by multiple dynamic leaders with prescribed bounded errors. To facilitate the control design, the quadrotor dynamics is decomposed into translational and rotational subsystems. For each subsystem, in order to enable smooth and rapid learning of unknown system uncertainties and reduce the computational load in traditional neural network (NN), the estimation errors, instead of tracking errors, are used to regulate NN weights and only one NN learning parameter is required for adaptive neural approximation with the aid of MLP, which is more feasible for real-time implementation. Additionally, dynamic surface control (DSC) technique is introduced in control design to extract the time derivative of virtual control laws, and thus the issue of “explosion of complexity” can be circumvented. As an extension, prescribed performance function and error transformation technique are utilized to address the preselected containment synchronization error constraints problem. Finally, the stability analysis is established to prove that all error signals are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.}

abstract = {Vegetation dynamics and phenology play an important role in inter-annual vegetation changes in terrestrial ecosystems and are key indicators of climate-vegetation interactions, land use/land cover changes and variation in year-to-year vegetation productivity. Satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for vegetation phenology monitoring over large geographic domains using various types of observations and methods over the past several decades. The goal of this paper is to present a detailed review of existing methods for phenology detection and emerging new techniques based on the analysis of time-series, multispectral remote sensing imagery. This paper summarizes the objective and applications of detecting general vegetation phenology stages (e.g., green onset, time or peak greenness and growing season length) often termed ‘land surface phenology’, as well as more advanced methods that estimate species-specific phenological stages (e.g., silking stage of maize). Common data processing methods, such as data smoothing, applied to prepare the time-series remote sensing observations to be applied to phenological detection methods are presented. Specific land surface phenology detection methods as well as species-specific phenology detection methods based on multispectral satellite data are then discussed. The impact of different error sources in the data on remote-sensing based phenology detection are also discussed in detail, as well as ways to reduce these uncertainties and errors. Joint analysis of multi-scale observations ranging from satellite to more recent ground-based sensors is helpful for us to understand satellite-based phenology detection mechanism and extent phenology detection to regional scale in the future. Finally, emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of phenology is presented that includes observations from Cubesats, near-surface observations such as PhenoCams and image data fusion techniques to improve the spatial resolution of time-series image data sets needed for phenological characterization.}

Recent advances in computational power have allowed the use of online parameter estimation techniques in varied applications such as reconfigurable or adaptive control, system health monitoring, and fault tolerant control. The combined problem of state and parameter identification leads to a nonlinear filtering problem; furthermore, many aerospace systems are characterized by nonlinear models as well as noisy and biased sensor measurements. Extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a commonly used algorithm for recursive parameter identification due to its excellent filtering properties and is based on a first order approximation of the system dynamics. Recently, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) has been proposed as a theoretically better alternative to the EKF in the field of nonlinear filtering and has received great attention in navigation, parameter estimation, and dual estimation problems. However, the use of UKF as a recursive parameter estimation tool for aerodynamic modeling is relatively unexplored. In this paper we compare the performance of three recursive parameter estimation algorithms for aerodynamic parameter estimation of two aircraft from real flight data. We consider the EKF, the simplified version of the UKF and the augmented version of the UKF. The aircraft under consideration are a fixed wing aircraft (HFB-320) and a rotary wing UAV (ARTIS). The results indicate that although the UKF shows a slight improvement in some cases, the performance of the three algorithms remains comparable.}

Artificial intelligence (AI) is most prominent among these in the radiology space, touted as the “stethoscope of the 21st century” for its potential to revolutionize diagnostic precision, provider workflow, and healthcare expenditure. Partially owing to AI's unique characteristics, and partially due to its novelty, existing regulatory paradigms are not well suited to balancing patient safety with furthering the growth of this new sector. The current review examines the historic, current, and proposed regulatory treatment of AI-empowered medical devices by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). An innovative framework proposed by the FDA seeks to address these issues by looking to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and adopting a total product lifecycle (TPLC) approach. If brought into force, this may reduce the regulatory burden incumbent on developers, while holding them to rigorous quality standards, maximizing safety, and permitting the field to mature.}

The system is able to explore and reconstruct large scenes at a high level of detail, passing through five semantic levels, finally generating a detailed semantic model of the building. Our autonomous scanning platform collects raw data regarding the scene. At the first level of modelling, our autonomous scanning platform collects data regarding the scene and generates a point cloud that is later structured in a semantic point cloud model containing indoor, clutter and outlier point clouds. The second and third levels of semantic models consist of a simple B-rep representation and a model of basic building components, which includes the walls, ceiling, floor and columns, as well as their topology. Openings are then added, thus yielding our fourth semantic model. Finally, small components in buildings, such as sockets, switches, lights and others are recognised, resulting in the fifth semantic model. This approach has been tested on real data of building floors using our Mobile Platform for Autonomous Digitization (MoPAD). To the authors' knowledge this is the first work that, after obtaining 3D data with an autonomous mobile scanning platform, achieves such detailed modelling of building interiors. The performance of the method has been assessed quantitatively against ground truth on simulated and real environments. Two videos are available at the Supplementary material of this paper.}

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of existing literature on vessel/ship detection and classification from optical satellite imagery. Although SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) is still the leading technology for maritime monitoring, the number of studies based on optical satellite data is quickly growing. Altogether we analysed 119 papers on optical vessel detection and classification for the period from 1978 to March 2017. We start by introducing all the existing sensor systems for vessel detection, but subsequently focus only on optical imaging satellites. The article demonstrates the temporal development of optical satellite characteristics and connects this to the number and frequency of publications on vessel detection. After presenting the methods used for optical imagery-based vessel detection and classification in detail, along with the achieved detection accuracies, we also report possibilities for fusing optical data with other data sources. The studied papers show that the most common factors greatly influencing the vessel detection accuracy are the following: different weather conditions affecting sea surface characteristics, the quantity of clouds and haze, solar angle, and imaging sensor characteristics. All these factors bring great variations in the selection of the most suitable method; some still continue to pose unsolved challenges. For higher relevance and wider usage, we suggest that the algorithms for detection and classification should support a variety of targets and meteorological conditions, and ideally also a variety of optical satellite sensors. At least, they should be tested on many images under different conditions. This is not usually the case in the existent literature. We also observed that many authors omit an appropriate performance quantification, which is critical for a practical assessment and a numerical comparison of the presented algorithms. Overall it can be seen that vessel monitoring from spaceborne optical images is a popular research topic and has a great operational potential in the near future due to the large amount of satellite data, much of it free and open.}

In this regard, a system of linear inequalities (SLI) in the control inputs is developed, and it is proved that if this SLI has a solution at all times, applying it to the system leads to moving its state trajectories towards the desired point in space for all initial conditions. But, since it may happen that this SLI has infinitely many solutions or even no solution, the best (possibly, approximate) solution is obtained by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Different LP problems with different properties and applications are proposed for this purpose. Formulation of the control problem as an LP makes it possible to take into account the effect of actuator saturation simply by adding bound constraints to the problem. We can also make the resulting control system robust to model uncertainties. Some numerical examples including the output voltage regulation of double-source DC-DC converter and robot path-planning, both by considering the effect of actuators saturation and taking into account the uncertainties in model, are also presented.}

abstract = {Gait recognition has proven to be effective for long-distance human recognition. View angle, one form of the gait variations, can change the human appearance greatly and reduce its performance. For most existing gait datasets, the angle interval between the two nearest views is large. This means that the angle does not cover the entire view space and prevent better view-invariant feature extraction for CNN. Additionally, the angles between cameras and people vary widely in typical camera deployments for monitoring people. In this paper, we, therefore, propose a novel view synthesis approach based on view space covering to deal with the challenge of large-angle interval. Specifically, a Dense-View GEIs Set (DV-GEIs) is introduced to expand this view approach, from 0° to 180° with 1° interval. GEI is a popular feature representation for gait, which can be obtained by aligning human silhouettes and averaging them in a gait cycle. In order to synthesize DV-GEIs set, Dense-View GAN (DV-GAN) is proposed to model the gait attribute distribution and generate new GEIs with various views. DV-GAN consists of a generator, discriminator, and monitor, where the monitor is designed to preserve human identification and view information. Compared with our previous work DV-GAN-pre, we add a center for each object in the monitor to improve the discriminative capability of synthesized images during the modeling process. The proposed method is evaluated on the CASIA-B and OU-ISIR dataset. The experimental results show that view space covering is an effective way to light the burden of view-invariant feature extraction for CNN and make the feature more discriminative. We believe the idea of view space covering will further improve the development of gait recognition.}

There is also a lack of detailed remote sensing studies in water towers, for example the southwestern Cape of South Africa, where invasive alien trees threaten water security. There is a need for cost-effective, easy to use, inclusive and repeatable approaches to map invasive alien plants to inform management. We use a novel, transdisciplinary approach, combining Google Earth Engine's processing power, freely available Sentinel imagery (fusion of Sentinel-1 and -2), expert engagement (including researchers, managers and decision makers), drone technology and field trips, to provide an accurate and up-to-date understanding of the occurrence and density of invasive alien trees in an important water tower for the southwestern Cape of South Africa at a 20 m resolution. We explored the efficacy of combining bands and indices with the highest alien tree discriminatory power based on a statistical spectral analysis of 10 of the 13 Sentinel-2 bands and 39 relevant indices with various other data inputs (e.g. Sentinel-1, topographic information) in six classifications using robust and advanced non-parametric image classifiers. All six classifications performed well, with invasive alien trees discriminated from surrounding shrublands with 89-92% accuracy, and alien tree groups discriminated with 74-84% accuracy. Data fusion of Sentinel-1 and -2 and inclusion of topographic information (elevation and landform) marginally improved the accuracy statistics. However we caution against over-reliance on accuracy statistics given the relatively small sample sizes typically used in multispectral classifications. The rich spectral information contained in the red edge and shortwave infrared parts of the spectrum were critical for alien tree discrimination as the key traits distinguishing these alien trees from indigenous shrubland vegetation are differences in biomass and water usage. Discrimination between different types of alien trees and discriminating alien trees from native vegetation with high water use (e.g. wetlands and mountain forests) remained a challenge for the given spatial and spectral resolutions of Sentinel-2 imagery, despite reasonable accuracy statistics. Though the results present a significant advance for the region, given currently available out-dated maps, engagement with decision makers showed that managers require even more detailed products for alien tree management.}

This study proposes a consensus protocol utilizing a novel dynamic sliding mode control, ensuring robust performance and chattering attenuation. For this purpose, firstly, a new time-varying nonlinear sliding manifold is introduced that guarantees exponential finite-time stability. Secondly, a novel reaching law is established that ensures fixed reaching time independent of initial conditions. The fixed reaching time enables the specification of the reaching time by considering the problem constraints. Then, a novel terminal disturbance observer is proposed to efficiently estimate the overall effect of uncertainties and disturbances in the finite-time. Finally, an adaptive form of the proposed controller is presented by incorporating the disturbance observer into the proposed sliding mode control. The proposed consensus protocols are applied to a multi-agent system consisting of two well-known chaotic power systems (PMSM and BLDCM). Computer simulations and comparative studies confirm the results of this study in terms of tracking errors and fast convergence.}

In contrast to most existing DE review papers, additional analyses are performed in this survey by investigating the impacts of various parameter settings on given DE variants to identify their optimal values required for solving certain problem classes. The qualities of modifications incorporated into selected DE variants are also evaluated by measuring the performance gains achieved in terms of search accuracy and/or efficiency against the original DE.

In disease resistance phenotyping, spectral signatures can be analysed to derive infection severity scores and to screen breeding lines. Hyperspectra of winter wheat spikes were acquired in a Fusarium head blight phenotyping trial at the milk- and wax-ripening phenological phases. Disease severity ratings were simultaneously performed by an expert on a 9-point visual scale. Ordinal support vector machine models were then trained to assign hill plots to the individual severity levels. The predictive models' performance was evaluated for data collection timing, spectral pre-processing and permitted rating-error tolerance. The models trained to spectra acquired at the milk-ripening phase were sufficiently accurate to reliably distinguish between low, medium and high symptom severity; with accuracy approaching 100% for two-point error tolerance. However, deterioration in prediction quality was noted for the wax-ripening campaign, presumably due to spike-drying. After aggregation of the spectra using the median function no gain could be associated with further pre-processing. Modest performance improvements obtained with two schemes do not justify the additional data acquisition costs involved, but standard normal variate could be advantageous for some scenarios with mean-aggregated spectra. In addition to phenotyping, the results are discussed in relation to large-scale farming applications. Elevated infection risk detection prior to anthesis is recommended for fungicide treatment, considering the pathogen biology. The study is accompanied by a publicly-available dataset and the computational scripts employed to obtain the results.}

abstract = {The Eurasian steppe is the largest steppe region in the world and is an important part of the global grassland ecosystem. The eastern Eurasian steppe has favorable hydrothermal conditions and has the highest productivity and the richest biodiversity. Located in the arid and semi-arid region, the eastern Eurasian steppe has experienced large-scale grassland degradation due to dramatic climate change and intensive human activities during the past 20 years. Hence, accurate estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB, gC m−2) and belowground biomass (BGB, gC m−2) is necessary. In this study, plenty of AGB and BGB in-situ measurements were collected among dominated grassland types during summer in 2013 and 2016–2018 in the eastern Eurasian steppe. Vegetation indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and climate variables were chosen as independent variables to establish predictive models for AGB and BGB with random forest (RF). Both AGB (R2 = 0.47, MAE = 21.06 gC m−2, and RMSE = 27.52 gC m−2) and BGB (R2 = 0.44, MAE = 173.02 gC m−2, and RMSE = 244.20 gC m−2) models showed acceptable accuracy. Then the RF models were applied to generate spatially explicit AGB and BGB estimates for the study area over the last two decades (2000–2018). Both AGB and BGB showed higher values in the Greater Khingan Mountains and decreased gradually to the east and west sides. The mean values for AGB and BGB were 62.16 gC m−2 and 531.35 gC m−2, respectively. The climatic factors were much more important in controlling biomass than anthropogenic drivers, and shortage of water and raising temperature were the main limiting factor of AGB and BGB, respectively, in the peak growth season. These findings provide scientific data for the scientific management of animal husbandry and can contribute to the sustainable development of grassland ecology in the eastern Eurasian steppe.}

This problem has complexity not only in terms of combinatorial constraints but also in terms of multiple objectives. The local heuristic-based algorithms are extremely efficient in solving the single-objective ETSPs. However, their efficacy is limited in solving the multi-objective ETSPs due to the presence of multiple objectives. To bridge this gap, a two-stage evolutionary algorithm (TSEA) is developed to solve multi-objective ETSPs. In this algorithm, the first stage involves the use of a hybrid local search evolutionary algorithm (HLS-EA) which incorporates the local heuristic of nearest neighbor and 2-opt in the framework of real-coded NSGA-II to solve the individual objectives of multi-objective ETSP. These individual single-objective solutions which represent the corner solutions of the Pareto optimal front are used in the second stage as seed solutions in seeded HLS-EA (SHLS-EA) for solving the corresponding multi-objective ETSP. The developed algorithm is tested on 17 two-objective, 6 three-objective, and 2 four-objective ETSPs to show the superior performance over multi-objective variants of the Lin-Kernighan algorithm. Also, the developed algorithm is compared with several variants of DE and GA to illustrate the superior performance over the variants of evolutionary algorithms. Further, the algorithm is extended to the multi-objective ETSPs up to 10,000 cities.}

The household-operated land management model leads to a highly fragmented and heterogeneous agricultural landscape; therefore, fine crop mapping in smallholder agricultural areas remains challenging. By using very high spatial resolution (VHSR) images, this study aimed to explore parcel-level crop mapping methods using the case of a typical smallholder agricultural area in Wuhan, China. Object-based image analysis techniques as well as random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify WorldView-2 (WV2) images into eight crop-level agricultural land use categories. Several classification models were built using the combination of two classifiers and different image features, including spectral, geometrical, and textural features. The results showed that the classification model using the RF classifier and all 27 selected features had the highest accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 80.04% and a kappa value of 0.78; specifically, the user’s and producer’s accuracies of rice, cotton, lotus, bare paddy field and bare upland field exceeded 80%. We found that the performance of the RF and SVM classifiers was generally comparable, although as the input features increased, the accuracy of the RF was slightly higher than that of the SVM. The use of spatial features, such as the gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) standard deviation, GLCM correlation, and area of image objects, could help improve the accuracy of parcel-level crop mapping. Our research confirmed the practical value of single-temporal VHRS images and RF classifiers in mapping parcel-level crops in complex agricultural areas. This framework provides a methodological reference for accurately monitoring crop distribution in smallholder agriculture areas to support the development of local precision agriculture.}

This article proposes a SpectruM-Aware clusteR-based rouTing (SMART) scheme that enables SUs to form clusters in a cognitive radio network (CRN) and enables each SU source node to search for a route to its destination node on the clustered network. An intrinsic characteristic of CRNs is the dynamicity of operating environment in which network conditions (i.e., PUs’ activities) change as time goes by. Based on the network conditions, SMART enables SUs to adjust the number of common channels in a cluster through cluster merging and splitting, and searches for a route on the clustered network using an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning. Simulation results show that SMART selects stable routes and significantly reduces interference to PUs, as well as routing overhead in terms of route discovery frequency, without significant degradation of throughput and end-to-end delay.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of small fault detection from closed-loop control for discrete-time nonlinear uncertain systems. The problem is challenging due to (i) the considered system is subject to unstructured nonlinear uncertain dynamics; (ii) the faults are considered to be “small” in the sense that system states and control inputs in faulty mode remain close to those in normal mode; and (iii) fault detection needs to be accomplished during closed-loop control which might counteract the fault effects and thus diminish fault information for detection use. To overcome these challenges, a novel adaptive dynamics learning based fault detection scheme is proposed. Specifically, a new concept of fault dynamics residual is first developed to extract and represent enhanced fault information from closed-loop control. Then, an ideal estimator is constructed by using absolute measures of the proposed fault dynamics residuals. To make the ideal estimator implementable for systems with nonlinear uncertain dynamics, an adaptive dynamics learning approach is subsequently proposed to achieve the locally-accurate approximation of the uncertain fault dynamics. Finally, an adaptive threshold is developed based on the actual estimation system for real-time decision making, i.e., the fault is claimed to be detected when the associated residual signal becomes larger than the adaptive threshold. Rigorous analysis is performed to deduce the small fault detectability condition, which is shown to be significantly relaxed compared to those of existing fault detection methods. Extensive simulations have also been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.}

The new control configuration employs Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system FIS submodels to map input characteristics to the output of a dynamic and nonlinear system. The commonly used learning algorithm, which is called a hybrid method (Backpropagation and Least Square Error), has been carried out as well as particle swarm optimisation (PSO) approach, in order to select the optimal parameters of the ANFIS submodels. Once the system has been modelled efficiently and accurately, the proposed controller is designed by rearranging the generalised submodels. The controller performance is evaluated by simulations conducted on a binary distillation column, which is characterised by a nonlinear and dynamic behaviour. The obtained results show that the PSO-ANFIS based NARMA-L2 achieved more efficient modelling and control performances when compared with other controllers. These controllers include ANN-based NARMA-L2, (PD, PI and PID like) fuzzy-tuned by GA and PSO and traditional PID, which are also implemented to the column for comparison. Stability and robustness of the proposed controller regarding system inputs variance have also been tested by applying asynchronous setpoints of both inputs of the process.}

The previous four layers, originating from HMAX, provide robust feature representation of specific object, and the feature classification stage in the H layer is implemented with ELM. The HMAX model simulates the hierarchical processing mechanism in primate visual cortex, to calculate complex features representation. As a biological learning algorithm for generalized SLFNs, ELM learns much faster with good generalization performance, and performs well in classification applications.

If only a small portion of the executions are labelled erroneously, we expect a fault localisation technique to be robust to these errors. However, it is not known which fault localisation techniques with high accuracy are robust and which techniques are best at finding faults under the trade-off between accuracy and robustness. In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the impacts of labelling perturbations on spectrum-based fault localisation techniques (SBFL) is presented from different aspects first. We theoretically analyse the influence of labelling perturbations on three relations among risk evaluation formulas and the effect of mislabelling cases on the ranking of faulty statements. Then, we conduct controlled experiments on 18 programs with 3079 faulty versions from different domains to compare the robustness of 23 classes of risk evaluation formulas. Besides, experiments are conducted for evaluating the robustness of two neural network-based techniques. The impacts of perturbation degrees, number of faults and types of labelling perturbation on the robustness of formulas are empirically studied, and several interesting findings are obtained.}

This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.}

To be specific, IoT connects the physical and cyber world to capture real-time data for modeling and analyzing, and data mining methods incorporated in the virtual model aim to discover hidden knowledge in collected data. The proposed digital twin has been verified in a practical BIM-based project. Based on large inspection data from IoT devices, the 4D visualization and task-centered or worker-centered process model are built as the virtual model to simulate both the task execution and worker cooperation. Then, the high-fidelity virtual model is investigated by process mining and time series analysis. Results show that possible bottlenecks in the current process can be foreseen using the fuzzy miner, while the number of finished tasks in the next phase can be predicted by the multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model. Consequently, tactic decision-making can realize to not only prevent possible failure in advance, but also arrange work and staffing reasonably to make the process adapt to changeable conditions. In short, the significance of this paper is to build a data-driven digital twin framework integrating with BIM, IoT, and data mining for advanced project management, which can facilitate data communication and exploration to better understand, predict, and optimize the physical construction operations.

To take advantage of these technologies, services and products have launched cameras, drones, and algorithms in the cloud, from which the farmer can easily obtain valuable information for the optimization of their production. Notwithstanding the previous, in Latin America (and in general in the undeveloped countries), these technologies are costly and sometimes difficult to access for most farmers. This study proposes developing the low-cost Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) for precision agriculture tasks called AgriQ. It comprises three subsystems: (a) the drone; (b) the multispectral imaging system; and (c) the open-source software responsible for computing valuable information for the farmers. Intending to obtain a competitive UAS, we tackle the problem from four main points: (1) the construction of the drone; (2) the vision algorithms; (3) the autonomous trajectory considering all the parameters for properly recovering all the crops’ visual information; and (4) the construction of a low-cost multispectral imaging system with multiple bands. The multispectral imaging system is onboard the quadrotor and is composed of two low-cost cameras that have been modified to output multispectral imagery. With all this unmanned aerial system, we compute 8 vegetation indices that provide useful information to the farmers. To verify that the AgriQ is competitive versus commercial systems, we compared its performance to the professional multispectral camera RedEdge-M and popular Pix4D software. For this purpose, we have conducted experiments in two real environments, one of which is a real crop field. The experiments’ data show that our AgriQ UAS achieved prominent results at a fraction of the commercial system cost. Furthermore, to provide the user with a complete low-cost tool for precision agriculture, all the parts of the AgriQ are presented and explained in detail. The software is developed using open-source code where our contribution is available online on our GitHub site.}

The main findings are: (1) ICT technique adoption is affected by application design and socio-demographic factors, while research in BTs in this area only focuses on application design factors; (2) ICTs and BTs have similar applications in agricultural production (information provision for efficient decisions and production improvement), logistics (tracing), and supply chain (trust-building); (3) ICT techniques are applied more to production improvement, while BTs focus more on using visibility, traceability, and automation to improve transparency and transaction efficiency in whole sectors; (4) in relation to consumption, ICTs focus on balancing supply and demand to achieve market stability, while BTs investigate effects on consumer purchasing decisions. Insights are also proposed for future research based on common challenges in the application of ICT and blockchain in agriculture in the following areas: (i) security and privacy protection; (ii) solutions for scalability and interoperability; (iii) solutions for high cost and high consumption, and demands for high knowledge in technology application; (iv) formulation of policies and regulations related to standard criteria for market stability. This review provides a basis for studying the combination of ICTs and BTs in agriculture and furthers the understanding of their usage by comparison; this has significant implications for technological development and agricultural sustainability.}

Today's methods for controlling these resources either use expensive and conservative strategies (e.g. reactive control), or employ pre-defined power schedules that heighten the risk of operation failure in a dynamic environment. An intelligent Power Management System (PMS) is required to improve, or maintain, system capability. The strategies proposed in this paper aim to contribute towards an intelligent PMS. Using optimization methods, an adaptive and flexible PMS, capable of constructing the best executable power schedules while satisfying real-time requirements, is presented. A three-level optimization strategy is introduced. Due to the feasibility requirement of the solutions produced, the first level uses a constraint satisfaction approach. Then, the solution is quickly improved using a local search algorithm and, next, a global search algorithm is used in the remaining execution time to explore the possibility of further improvement in the solution. The efficiency of the last two levels is enhanced by use of convex programming techniques. Using a case study, we demonstrate that the proposed PMS is capable of rapidly producing a feasible solution, and subsequently optimizing this solution to provide an improved solution. The proposed PMS is capable of adapting to a dynamic environment, by coping with any change in problem description and problem constraints, and constructing a new best executable solution, while satisfying realtime requirements.}

In the design of type-2 fuzzy logic systems, the early applications were realized in a way that both the antecedent and consequent parameters were chosen by the designer with perhaps some inputs from some experts. Since 2000s, a huge number of papers have been published which are based on the adaptation of the parameters of type-2 fuzzy logic systems using the training data either online or offline. Consequently, the major challenge was to design these systems in an optimal way in terms of their optimal structure and their corresponding optimal parameter update rules. In this review, the state of the art of the three major classes of optimization methods are investigated: derivative-based (computational approaches), derivative-free (heuristic methods) and hybrid methods which are the fusion of both the derivative-free and derivative-based methods.}

In this work the authors propose a method to visualize local robustness properties of a nonlinear control system by means of a projection mapping defined by a self-organizing map (SOM). This kind of visualization is potentially useful for control system design since local properties of the closed loop control system –sensitivity functions– are visualized, revealing operating points of critical performance, and suggesting tuning of the controllers or even adaptive control strategies by means of localized controllers. The proposed method is verified under simulation, showing a good coincidence between the small signal response around different operating points and maps of models built automatically from control system data under different working conditions. Finally, some concluding remarks, including limitations of the proposed method and suggestions for future work are given.}

abstract = {Moringa oleifera Lam. is a functional plant considered to be high in nutrients as well as medicinal properties, largely utilised in most of the developing countries. Therefore, early prediction of M. oleifera biomass yield is a valuable pre- and post-harvest planning strategy for ensuring a reliable supply of the plant products and for marketing purposes. Subsequently, the objective of the current study was to explore the potential use of hyperspectral data in predicting biomass yield of different cultivars of M. oleifera. Canopy hyperspectral data were collected on five M. oleifera cultivars when they were one month and two months old using a hand-held spectroradiometer. The M. oleifera plants were harvested after two months and their leaves as well as stems were separated and immediately (i.e. within a minute) weighed (g plant −1). First-order derivative was used to transform the reflectance spectra and analysis of variance (ANOVA) as well as random forest (RF) regression and classification algorithm were used to analyse the data. The results showed that the first-order spectra of the five cultivars were significantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from each other in most portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Furthermore, the results indicated that the studied M. oleifera cultivars can be discriminated from each other using their first-order derivative of reflectance and RF classifier. RF regression models developed to predict the biomass yield of a two-month old M. oleifera crop were more accurate compared to the models developed when the plant was month old. The relative root mean square error of validation (RRMSEV) for biomass models of two-months old plants ranged between 23 and 37%, while the RRMSEV for biomass models of one-month-old plants ranged between 30 and 59%. Cultivar Tanzania obtained the most accurate whole plant biomass yield prediction model with a RRMSEV of 23.20%. When the data aggregated across the five cultivars to develop a universal model, the results showed R2 = 0.59: RMSEV = 6.47 g plant−1; RRMSEV =29.42% for the whole plant biomass yield, R2 = 0.52, RMSEV = 4.78 g plant−1RRMSEV =29.51% for the leaves biomass yield and R2 = 0.42; RMSEV = 2.17 g plant−1 RRMSEV = 37.35% for the stem biomass yield. Based on current results, the study infers that combined spectral data across different cultivars may not be useful in estimating M. oleifera biomass yield. The results underscore the use of hyperspectral data as a quick non-destructive means to measure the yield of M. oleifera medicinal plant. Furthermore, the present study gives an insight into the potential of hyperspectral data to be extrapolated to larger scales for prediction of biomass yield of medicinal plants using spaceborne and airborne acquired data.}

The large size, spatial complexity, and interannual variability of seagrass ecosystems significantly challenge field monitoring. In this study, a multi-mission satellite time-series was used to estimate long-term changes in seagrass status in a macrotidal system dominated by Zostera noltei, at Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast). Metrics of seagrass extent and density were obtained from Earth Observation (EO) using validated and inter-calibrated Landsat, SPOT and Sentinel2 data from 1985 to 2020. The information provided by satellite data made it possible to compute and compare several seagrass indicators currently in use in several European countries (France, Portugal and UK) within the WFD. Both the seagrass extent and meadow-averaged density displayed increasing trends since 1985. A time-series of merged observations from various satellites revealed a high degree of interannual variability in seagrass extent, with abrupt losses (up to 50% within one year) alternating with periods of slow recovery (typically 4–6 years). The seagrass meadow which was in a moderate status (sensu the WFD) in the 1980s, achieved an overall recurrent good or high status since the mid-1990s. Altogether, the methods and results presented here demonstrated that EO is a reliable source of information for mapping and assessing the status of intertidal seagrass, complementing in situ measurements by providing long-term, spatial view and standardized observation framework. We recommend the systematic use of EO time-series in complement to traditional field measurements in seagrass monitoring programs such as the WFD.}

While forecasting methods are rapidly evolving towards more complex statistical and physical models, the use of simple and traditional methods is still preferred in routine predictions.

This paper uses edge cloud computing technology and wearable technology to improve the inconvenient information flow of on-site maintenance of communication networks. We propose an Emergent Task Allocation Mechanism based on Comprehensive Reputation and Regional Prediction Model (ETARR) in the edge cloud computing environment to solve emergency task allocation in smart network maintenance. Firstly, based on the basic reputation value, we add the work enthusiasm and work activity as the indicators to measure the work efficiency of the maintenance personnel. By using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the historical reputation value sequence, the work enthusiasm of the maintenance personnel is quantified. Furthermore, based on the historical movement route of the maintenance personnel, the location of maintenance personnel is predicted by using the modified Workers’ Movement Patterns (WMP) model. Finally, combined with the reputation value requirements of the emergency task and the geographical location of the maintenance personnel, the maintenance emergency task is assigned. Simulation results show that the ETARR mechanism proposed in this paper reduces the cost of task allocation, improves the efficiency of the completion of the emergency task, and can be better applied to the emergency task scenario in the smart network maintenance environment.}

These ships require expert and intelligent systems to plan safe paths in order to avoid collision with both static and dynamic obstacles. This research proposes a novel path planning approach based on the anisotropic fast marching (FM) method to specifically assist with safe operations in complex marine navigation environments. A repulsive force field is specially produced to describe the safe area distribution surrounding obstacles based on the knowledge of human. In addition, a joint potential field is created to evaluate the travel cost and a gradient descent method is used to search for appropriate paths from the start point to the end point. Meanwhile, the approach can be used to constantly optimize the paths with the help of the expert knowledge in collision avoidance. Particularly, the approach is validated and evaluated through simulations. The obtained results show that it is capable of providing a reasonable and smooth path in a crowded waters. Moreover, the ability of this approach exhibits a significant contribution to the development of expert and intelligent systems in autonomous collision avoidance.}

However, there is one gloomy side of the ICT technology that contributes toward the inflation of carbon footprint. Research from 2020, estimates the ICT sector, carbon emission, to be 1,100 million tons. The future generation networks and IoT will further escalate this figure, as these would overburden the core ICT pillars i.e. Data Centers (DC's), and Mobile networks (NT). This in turn will inflate the ICT power consumption and leads to more carbon emission. Thus researchers and industries are continuously putting efforts to transform ICT into Green ICT. Apart from this, there is one bright side of ICT i.e. “Green BY ICT” that helps other industries to abate their carbon emission using smart IoT applications. However, the smart IoT devices/sensors/actuators used for this are mostly battery-operated. To reduce the battery waste, efforts are also being made to either prolong their battery life or to make them self-powered or battery-free. This survey discusses both aspects of ICT i.e. Green of ICT and Green by ICT. Firstly, the recent approaches for the Greening of ICT include techniques for Green-DC, Green-NT are discussed. Post discussing this, the paper also confers the energy harvesting solutions & energy-efficient techniques for the greening of user device/senor. In continuation of this, 5G green physical layer solution, Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) that prolongs battery life is also discussed, including its enhancement from release 13 to release 16, recent techniques to further optimize the NB-IoT performance, and future research challenges. Apart from this the recent advancement related to renewable energy solutions for Green ICT is also discussed. Overall this survey concludes that ICT's own environmental impact must be evaded, to utilize the ICT's tremendous potential.}

In this paper, we develop an autonomous system for drones to race fully autonomously using only onboard resources. Instead of commonly used visual navigation methods, such as simultaneous localization and mapping and visual inertial odometry, which are computationally expensive for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), we developed the highly efficient snake gate detection algorithm for visual navigation, which can detect the gate at 20 HZ on a Parrot Bebop drone. Then, with the gate detection result, we developed a robust pose estimation algorithm which has better tolerance to detection noise than a state-of-the-art perspective-n-point method. During the race, sometimes the gates are not in the drone’s field of view. For this case, a state prediction-based feed-forward control strategy is developed to steer the drone to fly to the next gate. Experiments show that the drone can fly a half-circle with 1.5 m radius within 2 s with only 30cm error at the end of the circle without any position feedback. Finally, the whole system is tested in a complex environment (a showroom in the faculty of Aerospace Engineering, TU Delft). The result shows that the drone can complete the track of 15 gates with a speed of 1.5m∕s which is faster than the speeds exhibited at the 2016 and 2017 IROS autonomous drone races.}

However, the detachment of ceramic tiles and the water infiltration in deep layers are still common problems. So, this paper proposes active infrared thermography as a thermographic acquisition mode, in contrast to the common use of passive thermography, and segmentation of defect areas and automation in the thermal image processing as added values never before proposed in the ceramic tiling thermographic inspection. For that, specimens of ceramic tiling for building façades were tested under different laboratory conditions, with inserted corks (simulating detachments), and by injecting water into holes drilled in the back surfaces (simulating water infiltration), as defects. Good results have been obtained in all the tests, both in dry and wet conditions in the specimens and for surfaces with homogeneous and heterogeneous surface properties, serving the introduction of this workflow for a first and fast inspection in ceramic tiling building façades. Future research will work with the fine-tuning phase of the methodology by applying it to real case studies.}

To achieve this, this paper proposes an automated approach to recognize concrete crack patterns from images. By analyzing the characteristics of structural and non-structural cracks, a binary classification of crack patterns into isolated patterns and map patterns is proposed. The recognition of crack patterns is performed through similarity comparisons using DISTS index. Various parameters that may affect the performance are investigated through several experiments conducted using real-world images. According to the experimental results, the proposed method is shown to successfully recognize crack patterns with an accuracy of over 96%. Recommendations are further proposed to enhance the performance of the method.}

This paper meets the mentioned objectives to discuss grid resilience and reliability, their quantification metrics, and their enhancement techniques in detail.

The limitations in resources and workforce can hinder the timely acquisition of critical information and make the process costly. Crowdsourcing and participatory disaster damage assessment have emerged as a possible solution to address this challenge. However, such approaches generally suffer from a lack of reliability. This research improves the effectiveness of crowdsourcing in post-disaster damage assessment by enhancing the content and reliability of information gathered through public participation. The paper presents a novel framework for quantification and reduction of uncertainty in the outcome of participatory damage assessment. First, to reduce the complexity and subjectivity, the classification of overall damage state is decomposed into more straightforward microtasks in the form of a questionnaire survey. A decision rule is implemented to infer the damage state of buildings from the participant responses. Second, an information-theoretic model based on a maximum a posteriori probability estimation is presented for obtaining an accurate probabilistic description of the inferred damage states while quantifying and accounting for the reliability of the citizen participants as well as the relative ambiguity of images. A pilot study is presented by involving 70 non-expert citizen participants to assess the post-disaster imagery of 60 buildings collected following Hurricane Harvey. A comparison of the outcome with the available expert labels shows relatively high accuracy. The proposed model also outperforms the common majority-vote approach, especially as the number of unreliable participants increases.}

abstract = {Separating ground from non-ground points is a challenging and essential task before the applications of airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data. The classical filters generally show good results on simple landscapes, but suffer from large filtering errors on complex landscapes with steep slopes and terrain discontinuities. To produce more satisfactory results over these landscapes, a scale-irrelevant and terrain-adaptive interpolation-based filter is presented in this paper. The contributions of the proposed method include a 1D spline-based algorithm for the collection of evenly distributed ground seeds as many as possible, a scale-irrelevant interpolation for estimating the heights of unclassified points and a terrain-adaptive elevation threshold to adapt to various terrain characteristics. The performance of the proposed method was first evaluated on the International Society Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) benchmark dataset. Results show that the proposed method with the average total error of 2.70% and kappa coefficient of 90.84% outperforms the existing filtering algorithms developed in recent decade (2010–2020). The performance of the proposed method was further assessed on four high-density airborne LiDAR point clouds located in urban and forested sites and compared with four state-of-the-art filters including progressive morphological filter (PMF), cloth simulation filter (CSF), progressive TIN densification (PTD) and multiresolution hierarchical filter (MHF). Results demonstrate that the proposed method is averagely more accurate than the well-known filters in terms of total error and kappa coefficient, and much faster than PTD and MHF. Moreover, the proposed method produces more satisfactory DEMs than the classical methods.}

abstract = {The application of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites is continuously increasing due to their superior mechanical properties and the associated weight advantage. However, they are susceptible to more complex types of damage, and advanced damage characterization systems are required to prevent catastrophic failures. Various non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT&E) and in-situ structural health monitoring (SHM) techniques have been applied for damage detection in FRP composites. These techniques have been continuously developed to achieve reliable inspections, especially for safety-critical applications such as the aerospace industry. This review presents recent advances in NDT&E techniques and SHM techniques, particularly for damage diagnosis in FRP composites. For selecting the most suitable NDT technique based on specific criteria, the analytical hierarchy process is applied as a decision-making tool to evaluate and rank the NDT techniques. The size of the specimen is found to be the most important criterion that significantly affects technique selection. Finally, the importance of developing in-situ SHM systems is outlined, and different in-situ SHM systems are then reviewed and discussed. This review provides progress of the recent damage characterization techniques and enables researchers to devise selection criteria to select the most appropriate technique for their own work.}

The main purpose of this contribution is to answer such questions and to provide a fairly unifying framework to allow a better understanding of the progress of this research subject with appreciable industrial and academic benefits. In this paper we focus on the main challenges, practical aspects and mathematical core concepts of the video stabilization techniques.

However, it is also the most complex in terms of execution time. Despite the development of several BS algorithms, maritime foreground segmentation and change detection remain major challenges owing to the complex, unconstrained, and diverse nature of ocean scenarios. However, only a few studies have investigated the applications of BS algorithms in maritime environments, especially those involving boats in the open sea. This study compares BS methods involving use of a non-static electro-optical sensor in combination with visible-light and infrared cameras to identify the best method for use in open sea scenarios, especially from the viewpoint of avoiding piracy and armed robbery. Thirty-seven methods, ranging from simple temporal differencing to more sophisticated ones, were validated via extensive experiments and analyses using realistic maritime datasets and practical maritime applications. In addition, because most methods considered in this study were not previously evaluated at the pixel level on open sea datasets, this paper proposes an appropriate maritime BS benchmark, based on which the 37 methods were compared to compensate for their prior lack of detailed analyses. The experimental results indicate that BS algorithms of the multiple features category can better handle maritime challenges, thereby realizing higher accuracies when analyzing visible-light and thermal videos. The proposed evaluation, therefore, complements those reported previously. Consequently, the proposed study enables users to identify the most suitable BS algorithm for use in intelligent maritime transportation, maritime security surveillance systems, and autonomous ships in the open sea.}

abstract = {Several methods have been proposed to delineate management zones in agricultural fields, which can guide interventions of the farmers to increase crop yield. In this study, we propose a new approach using remote sensing data to delineate management zones at three farm sites located in southern Brazil. The approach is based on the hypothesis that the measured aboveground biomass (AGB) of the cover crops is correlated with the measured cash-crop yield and can be estimated from surface reflectance and/or vegetation indices (VIs). Therefore, we used seven different statistical models to estimate AGB of three cover crops (forage turnip, white oats, and rye) in the season prior to cash-crop planting. Surface reflectance and VIs were used as predictors to test the performance of the models. They were obtained from high spatial and temporal resolution data of the PlanetScope (PS) constellation of satellites. From the time series of 30 images acquired in 2017, we used the PS data that matched the dates of the field campaigns to build the models. The results showed that the satellite AGB estimates of the cover crops at the date of maximum VI response at the beginning of the flowering stage were useful to delineate the management zones. The cover-crop AGB models that presented the highest coefficient of determination (R2) and the lowest root mean square (RMSE) in the validation and test datasets were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Cubist (CUB) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB). For most models and cover crops, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were the two most important AGB predictors. At the date of maximum VI at the beginning of the flowering stage, the correlation coefficients (r) between the cover-crop AGB and the cash-crop yield (soybean and maize) ranged from +0.70 for forage turnip to +0.78 for rye. The fuzzy unsupervised classification of the cover-crop AGB estimates delineated two management zones, which were spatially consistent with those obtained from cash-crop yield. The comparison between both maps produced overall accuracies that ranged from 61.20% to 68.25% with zone 2 having higher cover-crop AGB and cash-crop yield than zone 1 over the three sites. We conclude that satellite AGB estimates of cover crops can be used as a proxy for generating management zone maps in agricultural fields. These maps can be further refined in the field with any other type of method and data, whenever necessary.}

abstract = {Internet of Drones (IoDs) is getting growing interest of researchers due to its applicability in wide range of applications for transportation, weather monitoring, emergency monitoring for flood, earth quake, healthcare and road hazards. To update the data about emergency situation, a real-time data sharing is mandatory. However, regular message transmission by various drones may not only overwhelm a central server but it also causes congestion on the network. It is mandatory to reduce messaging cost and congestion. This paper presents a fog-assisted congestion avoidance approach for Smooth Message Dissemination (SMD). We present a message forwarding algorithm for congestion avoidance to select the appropriate next-hop node using layered model. This model is based on various layers having drones. In first phase, it looks for an appropriate drone in a layer near the fog server for message forwarding. In next step, the drone is identified in nearby layers to forward the emergency message to next-hop to further locate the group head as per priority. It is a drone that has less distance towards fog server and inform in its one-hop circle. It can stop forwarding message after delivering it to fog server. Finally, the fog server disseminates information timely towards upper layers for necessary actions for emergency situations. The performance of the proposed approach is validated through extensive simulations using NS 2.35. Results prove the dominance of SMD over counterparts in terms of messaging overhead, packet delivery ratio, throughput, energy consumption and average delay. Proposed SMD improves PDR by 85% and message overhead cost by 91% as compared to counterparts.}

In this research, we propose an ensemble convolutional bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CBiLSTM) network with optimal hyper-parameter selection for undertaking sound classification. We first transform each audio signal into a spectrogram representation using the Short-time Fourier transform (STFT). A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) variant is subsequently proposed to optimize the learning rate, weight decay, numbers of filters and hidden units in the convolutional and BiLSTM layers, respectively, in order to extract effective spatial–temporal characteristics from the spectrogram inputs. To tackle the issue of stagnation in optimization, the proposed algorithm incorporates local exploitation using secant and Newton–Raphson methods, promising leader generation using regular and irregular super-ellipse formulae, and three-dimensional spherical search coefficients. Moreover, it takes into account multiple fused elite signals in conjunction with numerical analysis based exploitation to balance between diversification and intensification. A variety of CBiLSTM networks with distinctive optimized settings are devised. An ensemble model is then constructed by incorporating a set of three yielded networks based on a majority voting scheme. Evaluated using several audio data sets, our ensemble CBiLSTM networks outperform those with default and optimal settings identified by other search methods, existing deep architectures and state-of-the-art related studies. In addition to sound classification tasks, the proposed PSO algorithm also outperforms a number of classical and advanced search methods for solving diverse unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions with statistical significance.}

abstract = {Aerosol microphysical properties, scattering and absorption characteristics, and in particular, the vertical distributions of these parameters over the eastern Loess Plateau, were analyzed based on aircraft measurements made in 2020 during a summertime aircraft campaign in Shanxi, China. Data from six flights were analyzed. Statistical characteristics and vertical distributions of aerosol concentration, particle size, optical properties, including aerosol scattering coefficient (σsp), backscattering ratio (βsc), Ångström exponent (α), single-scattering albedo (SSA), partially-integrated aerosol optical depth (PAOD), and black carbon concentration (BCc), were obtained and discussed. Mean values of aerosol particle number concentration (Na), particle volume concentration (Va), mass concentration (Ma), surface concentration (Sa), and particle effective diameter (EDa) were 854.92 cm−3, 13.37 μm3 cm−3, 20.06 μg/m3, 170.08 μm3 cm−3, and 0.47 μm, respectively. Mean values of BCc, σsp (450, 525, 635 nm), βsp (525 nm), α(635/450), and SSA were 1791.66 ng m−3, 82.37 Mm−1 at 450 nm, 102.57 Mm−1 at 525 nm, 126.60 Mm−1 at 635 nm, 0.23, 1.47, and 0.92, respectively. Compared with values obtained in 2013, Na decreased by 60% and Ma decreased by 45%, but the scattering coefficients increased in different degrees. In the vertical direction, aerosol concentrations were higher at lower altitudes, decreasing with height. Vertical profiles of σsp, βsp, α(635/450), and BCc measured during the six flights were examined. Two peaks in Na were identified near the top of the boundary layer and between 2000 and 2200 m. Fine particles with EDa smaller than 0.8 μm are dominant in the boundary layer and coarse aerosols existed aloft. Aerosol scattering properties and BCc in the lowest layer of the atmosphere contributed the most to the total aerosol radiative forcing. SSA values were greater than 0.9 below 2500 m, with lower values at higher levels of the atmosphere. On lightly foggy days, SSA values were greater than 0.9, and aerosols played a cooling role in the atmosphere. On hazy days, lower-level SSA values were generally greater than 0.85, with aerosols likely having a warming effect on the atmosphere. 48-hour backward trajectories of air masses during the observation days showed that the majority of aerosol particles in the lower atmosphere originated from local or regional pollution emissions, contributing the most to the total aerosol loading and leading to high values of aerosol concentration and radiative forcing.}

abstract = {Integration of aerial and ground images has been proved as an efficient approach to enhance the surface reconstruction in urban environments. However, as the first step, the feature point matching between aerial and ground images is remarkably difficult, due to the large differences in viewpoint and illumination conditions. Previous studies based on geometry-aware image rectification have alleviated this problem, but the performance and convenience of this strategy are still limited by several flaws, e.g. quadratic image pairs, segregated extraction of descriptors and occlusions. To address these problems, we propose a novel approach: leveraging photogrammetric mesh models for aerial-ground image matching. The methods have linear time complexity with regard to the number of images. It explicitly handles low overlap using multi-view images. The proposed methods can be directly injected into off-the-shelf structure-from-motion (SFM) and multi-view stereo (MVS) solutions. First, aerial and ground images are reconstructed separately and initially co-registered through weak georeferencing data. Second, aerial models are rendered to the initial ground views, in which color, depth and normal images are obtained. Then, feature matching between synthesized and ground images are conducted through descriptor searching and geometry-constrained outlier removal. Finally, oriented 3D patches are formulated using the synthesized depth and normal images and the correspondences are propagated to the aerial views through patch-based matching. Experimental evaluations using five datasets reveal satisfactory performance of the proposed methods in aerial-ground image matching, which succeeds in all of the ten challenging pairs compared to only three for the second best. In addition, incorporation of existing SFM and MVS solutions enables more complete reconstruction results, with better internal stability.}

The problem occurs when test oracles do not exist. Specifically, the test suite will contain a large number of unlabelled test cases, i.e., test cases whose output is not identified as being either correct (passing) or incorrect (failing). Such unlabelled test cases cannot be directly used, thereby leading to a degradation of localization effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an approach based on test classification to enable the use of unlabelled test cases in localizing faults. In our approach, unlabelled test cases are classified based on their execution information and are then assigned corresponding estimated labels to allow them to be utilized in fault localization. Experimental results show that with the utilization of these newly labelled test cases, the effectiveness of fault localization can indeed be improved.}

For a single vehicle, we formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and derive properties of the optimal solution allowing it to be decomposed into two simpler problems. For a multi-vehicle problem, including traffic congestion effects, we use a similar approach by grouping vehicles into “subflows.” We also provide an alternative flow optimization formulation leading to a computationally simpler problem solution with minimal loss in accuracy.}

However, ensuring consensus in real-world scenarios, with non-convex obstacles and kinodynamic motion constraints, proves to be a hard task, since it is quite difficult to model such a problem analytically. Therefore, this paper studies the problem of state agreement for Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) in unknown cluttered complex environments. Here, we propose and analyze a distributed consensus algorithm combined with a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree-based planner, which allows linear and nonlinear systems to reach a common target on their states inside bi- or three-dimensional spaces filled with static obstacles. We demonstrate that, with enough time, our planning strategy ensures probabilistic completeness convergence independently of the topological communication network employed, since some connectivity constraints are observed. Simulated results with linear and nonlinear models are provided, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method in comparison with the state-of-the-art literature for the specific case of position consensus (rendezvous) missions.}

In addition, the risk of failing or deteriorating elements in a multi-satellite system (MSS) leads to the uncertainty in its operating environment which challenges traditional centralized planning algorithms. Centralized algorithms depend on one coordinator to overview entire system, which is a single poitn of failure, so if it malfunctional, the MSS may go down. To overcome this problem, a distributed onboard mission planning algorithm based on the Hybrid Dynamic Mutation Genetic Algorithm (HDMGA) is proposed for such MSS. The satellites are considered as autonomous agents which can communicate and negotiate with other satellites. The mission objective is decomposed through the team negotiation procedures, and the local goals are dispatched to the participant satellite. The local planning procedure on each satellite is modeled as local search problems, while the planning problem for entire team is formulated as strongly-coupled distributed optimization problem. The verification shows that the proposed distributed approach can achieve the same results as the centralized approach. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed approach shows superior performance on both computation time and success rate, as compared with other two state-of-the-art distributed mission planning approaches.}

However, understanding how anthropogenic and climate factors affect synergistically the PAHs distribution in this vulnerable ecological environment is deficient. Here the spatiotemporal distribution of PAHs in sediments from a typical river of the Loess Plateau were investigated. The PAHs were mainly from coal combustion in the range of 194–514 ng g−1, and their concentrations were generally higher in normal season than wet season as the dilution effect of high river discharge and strong precipitation. The interactive effects of land-use and precipitation showed PAHs enriched in forest-grass land were transferred into rivers through surface and subsurface runoff during light rainfall, resulting in the increase of the PAHs concentrations in river sediments. In contrast, large precipitation in wet season would obscure any spatial variations. In addition, human activities, especially energy production, directly enhanced PAHs accumulation in river sediments due to the emission from the production processing of oil and coal, and indirectly influenced the PAHs by impacting the per capita GDP. These findings had important implications for the management and prediction of PAH accumulation.}

However, difficult and urgent agricultural challenges persist, and traditional agricultural production regulation methods are time consuming and laborious. Moreover, the application of intelligent algorithms to modern agricultural production requires the support of a database, which can be complex and difficult to use in practice and requires a large amount of computing. Fortunately, model predictive control (MPC) methods can achieve highly accurate control operations with moderate complexity and can also allow for rolling optimization in a limited time domain, which improves precision. Despite being a process control method that originated in industry, MPC is highly suited for application in agriculture because it can effectively address nonlinear and large time-delay systems. The aim of this review is to introduce MPC and describe its current application in agriculture. In this review, the development of MPC and various improved MPC schemes are described. The development of MPC is divided into three stages. In addition, applications and new technologies associated with MPC in irrigation systems, agricultural machinery, agricultural production, product processing and greenhouses are analyzed. Smart agriculture will have a promising future because of the implementation of MPC technologies derived from successful industrial applications. Finally, challenges and future perspectives of MPC technology use in agriculture are summarized and forecasted.}

Many existing fatigue crack sensing methods are contact-based, hence extensive human operation is necessary for sensor and/or actuator deployment.

We treat crack breathing behavior, the small cyclic movement of the crack perpendicular to the crack path under repetitive fatigue loads, as a robust indicator for crack identification. The differential image features provoked by a breathing crack can be extracted, enhanced, and visualized through a series of image processing techniques. The performance of the proposed approach is experimentally validated through two laboratory setups including a small-scale steel compact specimen and a large-scale bridge to cross-frame connection specimen. Test results demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in reliably identifying the fatigue crack, even the true crack is surrounded by other non-crack features.}

However, generally such methods do not discriminate between edges belonging to horizon boundary and others due to clouds or other natural phenomenon. Additionally, most edge based methods suffer more in the presence of edge gaps. To address these issues, we propose an edge-less horizon line detection approach based on pixel classification, hence not relying on edge information. The key idea is formulating a multi-stage graph using classification maps, instead of edge maps, where each node cost reflects the likelihood of pixel belonging to the horizon boundary. The shortest path is found in the formulated multi-stage graph using dynamic programming which conforms to the detected horizon line. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach on two challenging data sets and provide comparisons with two edge-based methods: one relying on edge detection while the other based on edge classification. Overall, the proposed approach achieves comparable performance against carefully crafted edge based formulations. A by-product of the edge-less approach is its capability of associating a confidence level with the found solution, which can be used to confirm the presence or absence of a horizon line in a given image. The method is also capable of dealing with partial horizon line in an image. To further improve the detection performance, we propose a fusion strategy which combines both edge-based and edge-less information. Extensive evaluations, including a publicly available data set, illustrate the superiority of the proposed fusion approach.}

The improvements include using chaos map logic to initialize the population of PSO. Also, adaptive mutation is utilized to balance local and global search. Then, the inactive particles are replaced by new fresh particles to push the solution toward global optimal. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulation is carried out and the results are compared with slandered PSO and with recent work CIPSO.

Most existing works regard the remote cloud server as a special edge server. However, service quality cannot be met when some of the edge servers cannot be connected. Besides, the computation capability of the cloud has not been fully exploited especially when edge servers are congested. We develop an on-line offloading decision and computational resource management algorithm with joint consideration of collaborations between device–cloud, edge–edge and edge–cloud. The objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of the system, subject to computational capability and task buffer stability constraints. Lyapunov optimization technique is used to jointly deal with the delay-energy trade-off optimization and load balancing. The optimal CPU-cycle frequencies, best transmission powers and offloading scheduling policies are jointly handled in the three-layer system. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that, with V varies in [0.1,5]×109, the proposed algorithm can save more than 50% energy and over 120% task processing time than three existing benchmark algorithms averagely.}

The viability of the framework is demonstrated through an application scenario: conceptual design and development of a navigation and control system for a rotor-craft UAV.}

The model is called reactive because the agents do not keep previous information but only respond to the current system state. Moreover, they only communicate with their close neighbors, limited by their sensory radius, except with the virtual agent that can be seen by everyone at the whole time. The aim of the model is to group the agents around the virtual agent while it moves to desirable directions. We solve the inverse problem of parameter estimation in order to drive the model toward specific objectives. This task is performed with the Generalized Extremal Optimization (GEO) algorithm, and the results are tested with path planning scenarios.}

By introducing a nonlinear coordinate transformation, we convert the original nonlinear system with asymmetrical state constraints into a new augmented one free from state constraints, which allows for the complete obviation of the feasibility conditions in the strategy. Furthermore, by making use of the feature from skew symmetric matrix in the augmented system, we develop the neural adaptive control algorithms collectively without the need for repetitive design procedure, in which only one Lyapunov function and one step derivation are involved, leading to a design approach whose synthesis complexity does not increase with the order of the system.}

A number of recent studies have demonstrated the potential to estimate many of these traits from hyperspectral reflectance data, primarily in ecophysiological contexts. Here, we summarize recent advances in the use of hyperspectral reflectance data for plant phenotyping, and discuss both the potential benefits and remaining challenges to its application in plant genetics contexts. The performances of previously published models in estimating six traits from hyperspectral reflectance data in maize were evaluated on new sample datasets, and the resulting predicted trait values shown to be heritable (e.g., explained by genetic factors) were estimated. The adoption of hyperspectral reflectance-based phenotyping beyond its current uses may accelerate the study of genes controlling natural variation in biochemical and physiological traits.}

In real-world applications, the data from the target domain is often precious and hard to obtain, while the data from source domains is plentiful. Thus, since the complexity of Gaussian process based multi-task/transfer learning approaches grows cubically with the total number of source＋ target observations, the method becomes increasingly impractical for large (>104) source data inputs even with a small amount of target data. In order to scale known transfer Gaussian processes to large-scale source datasets, we propose an efficient aggregation model in this paper, which combines the predictions from distributed (small-scale) local experts in a principled manner. The proposed model inherits the advantages of single-task aggregation schemes, including efficient computation, analytically tractable inference, and straightforward parallelization during training and prediction. Further, a salient feature of the proposed method is the enhanced expressiveness in transfer learning — as a byproduct of flexible inter-task relationship modelings across different experts. When deploying such models in real-world applications, each local expert corresponds to a lightweight predictor that can be embedded in edge devices, thus catering to cases of online on-mote processing in fog computing settings.}

In that perspective, SIFT descriptor is the most widely used due to its robustness to scale, rotation, and perspective distortions as well as illumination changes. However, the processing effort and the amount of memory required by SIFT make it ill-suited for applications with limited memory and processing power. In this paper, we propose a novel keypoint descriptor called CBDF (Compressed Binary Discriminative Feature) designed to be accurate, memory efficient and fast at the same time. High speed and memory efficiency are made possible due to a binary descriptor obtained by aggregating gradient features. Local discriminative analysis (LDA) is used to make sure the aggregated feature leads to a discriminative descriptor. Accuracy is also enforced by the use of scale, rotation, and illumination invariant features. The CBDF descriptor is stored on a 32-byte vector (which is one order of magnitude smaller than the usual 512-byte vector for SIFT) while matching is done with the Hamming distance. Extensive evaluations on various benchmark datasets show that CBDF is not only faster and generally more accurate than SIFT and SURF, but also more accurate than recent descriptors such as ORB, BRISK and BRIEF.}

abstract = {Urban waterlogging is a hydrological cycle problem that seriously affects people's life and property. Characterizing waterlogging variation and explicit its driving factors are conducive to prevent the damage of such disasters. Conventional methods, because of the high spatial heterogeneity and the non-stationary complex mechanism of urban waterlogging, are not able to fully capture the urban waterlogging spatial variation and identify the waterlogging susceptibility areas. A more robust method is recommended to quantify the variation trend of urban waterlogging. Previous studies have simulated the waterlogging variation in relatively small areas. However, the relationship between variables is often ignored, which cannot comprehensively reveal the dominant drivers affecting urban waterlogging. Therefore, a novel approach is proposed that combined stepwise cluster analysis model (SCAM) and hierarchical partitioning analysis (HPA) within a general framework and verifies the applicability through logistic regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine. According to the dominant driving factors, different simulation scenarios are established to analyze waterlogging density variation. Results found that the SCAM provides accurate and detailed simulated results both in urban centers where waterlogging frequently occurs and urban fringe with few waterlogging events, which shows an excellent performance with a high classification accuracy and generalization capability. HPA detected that the impervious surface abundance (28.07%), vegetation abundance (20.80%), and cumulate precipitation (16.25%) are the dominant drivers of waterlogging. This result suggests that priority should be given to controlling these three factors to mitigate the risk of waterlogging. It is interesting to note that under different urbanization and rainfall scenarios, the urban waterlogging susceptibility has a considerable variation. The watershed spatial location and watershed characteristics are relevant aspects to be considered in identifying and assessing waterlogging susceptibility, which provides original insights that urban waterlogging mitigation strategies should be developed according to different local conditions and future scenarios.}

On the other hand, new water bodies can be designed during landscape restoration (e.g. after coal mining). Effective management of new water resources requires continuous monitoring; in situ surveys are, however, extremely time-demanding. Remote sensing has been widely used for identifying water bodies. However, the use of optical imagery is constrained by accuracy problems related to the difficulty in distinguishing water features from other surfaces with low albedo, such as tree shadows. This is especially true when mapping water bodies of different sizes. To address these problems, we evaluated the potential of integrating hyperspectral data with LiDAR (hereinafter “integrative approach”). The study area consisted of several spoil heaps containing heterogeneous water bodies with a high variability of shape and size. We utilized object-based classification (Support Vector Machine) based on: (i) hyperspectral data; (ii) LiDAR variables; (iii) integration of both datasets. Besides, we classified hyperspectral data using pixel-based approaches (K-mean, spectral angle mapper). Individual approaches (hyperspectral data, LiDAR data and integrative approach) resulted in 2–22.4 % underestimation of the water surface area (i.e, omission error) and 0.4–1.5 % overestimation (i.e., commission error).The integrative approach yielded an improved discrimination of open water surface compared to other approaches (omission error of 2 % and commission error of 0.4 %). We also evaluated the success of detecting individual ponds; the integrative approach was the only one capable of detecting the water bodies with both omission and commission errors below 10 %. Finally, the assessment of misclassification reasons showed a successful elimination of shadows in the integrative approach. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of hyperspectral and LiDAR data can greatly improve the identification of small water bodies and can be applied in practice to support mapping of restoration process.}

To address the limitations of manual checking, this study proposes a technique to automatically check whether scaffold work platforms conform to the safety regulations based on 3D point cloud data. The proposed technique first detects the location of scaffolds from the point cloud data by finding the vertical scaffold components, known as uprights. Then, scaffold work platforms, which are planar and horizontal components, are detected based on the histogram of the Z values of the point cloud data. Once the work platforms are extracted, the toe-boards and guard-rails are detected along all the four sides of each work platform. Then, the detected toe-boards and guard-rails are checked to identify any violation of safety regulations. Validation experiments were conducted on a point cloud dataset acquired from a construction site in Singapore. The experimental results show that the proposed technique could successfully detect scaffolds and work platforms from point cloud data, and extract toe-boards and guard-rails for safety regulation checking. All the violations of safety regulations in the point cloud data were successfully identified using the proposed technique.}

abstract = {In this paper, a mission execution decision making methodology is proposed based on the interrelationship between mission requirements and system capability. A mission–system correlation model is established after analyzing mission–function and function–system separately to determine the connections between mission and system. A detailed contrastive analysis between mission requirements and system capability, including transforming intrinsic health into mission health and modules interrelationship analysis, is then conducted for the given mission, which provides quantitative suggestions for objective and timely mission-execution decision making. A case study on a cruise is used to illustrate the performance of the methodology.}

abstract = {Landslides are a common hazard worldwide that result in major economic, environmental and social impacts. Despite their devastating effects, inventorying existing landslides, often the regions at highest risk of reoccurrence, is challenging, time-consuming, and expensive. Current landslide mapping techniques include field inventorying, photogrammetric approaches, and use of bare-earth (BE) lidar digital terrain models (DTMs) to highlight regions of instability. However, many techniques do not have sufficient resolution, detail, and accuracy for mapping across landscape scale with the exception of using BE DTMs, which can reveal the landscape beneath vegetation and other obstructions, highlighting landslide features, including scarps, deposits, fans and more. Current approaches to landslide inventorying with lidar to create BE DTMs include manual digitizing, statistical or machine learning approaches, and use of alternate sensors (e.g., hyperspectral imaging) with lidar. This paper outlines a novel algorithm to automatically and consistently detect landslide deposits on a landscape scale. The proposed method is named as the Contour Connection Method (CCM) and is primarily based on bare earth lidar data requiring minimal user input such as the landslide scarp and deposit gradients. The CCM algorithm functions by applying contours and nodes to a map, and using vectors connecting the nodes to evaluate gradient and associated landslide features based on the user defined input criteria. Furthermore, in addition to the detection capabilities, CCM also provides an opportunity to be potentially used to classify different landscape features. This is possible because each landslide feature has a distinct set of metadata – specifically, density of connection vectors on each contour – that provides a unique signature for each landslide. In this paper, demonstrations of using CCM are presented by applying the algorithm to the region surrounding the Oso landslide in Washington (March 2014), as well as two 14,000ha DTMs in Oregon, which were used as a comparison of CCM and manually delineated landslide deposits. The results show the capability of the CCM with limited data requirements and the agreement with manual delineation but achieving the results at a much faster time.}

abstract = {This work provides a new approach for extended drone targets (EDTs) tracking from inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images based on robust extended cubature Kalman multi-Bernoulli track-before-detect (ECK-MB-TBD) algorithm that handling of the non-linear ISAR observations with Doppler effect. During this work, we present the drone's extension as multiple ellipses with a time-varying orientation angle and solve the resulting inference problem, which involves data association between the nonlinear measurements and sub-ellipses or sub-random matrices model (RMM). In addition, we give a new implementation of the proposed robust ECK-Sub-RMM-MB-TBD filter to estimate the change in the nonlinear orientation of target's shape based on ECK-Beta Gaussian inverse Wishart. Tracking performance is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms on EDTs such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-Sub-RMM-MB-TBD and histogram probabilistic multi-hypothesis (H-PMHT)-TBD. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm. From the results, the SMC-Sub-RMM-MB-TBD algorithm take significantly more time to compute than the proposed algorithm, because the first algorithm needs a large number of the particles for EDTs. The average running times were 88.63 s for SMC-Sub-RMM-MB-TBD, 38.54 s for ECK-Sub-RMM-MB-TBD and 55.34 s for H-PMHT-TBD.}
