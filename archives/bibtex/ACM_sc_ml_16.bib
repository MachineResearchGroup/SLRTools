abstract = {Node classification is a central task in graph data analysis. Scarce or even no labeled data of emerging classes is a big challenge for existing methods. A natural question arises: can we classify the nodes from those classes that have never been seen?In this paper, we study this zero-shot node classification (ZNC) problem which has a two-stage nature: (1) acquiring high-quality class semantic descriptions (CSDs) for knowledge transfer, and (2) designing a well generalized graph-based learning model. For the first stage, we give a novel quantitative CSDs evaluation strategy based on estimating the real class relationships, to get the "best" CSDs in a completely automatic way. For the second stage, we propose a novel Decomposed Graph Prototype Network (DGPN) method, following the principles of locality and compositionality for zero-shot model generalization. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions.},

abstract = {Drivers face parking problems in most area, especially during peak hours. The difficulty roots from the availability of parking space at the given time and place. Despite the technologies and protocols used to solve parking problems and have an intelligent city, many vehicles may pursue a small number of parking spaces, which in turn leads to serious traffic congestion. A driver can spend a lot of time to look for an available parking space closed to his destination, which means the increasing of the traffic problem of the city, a very high consumption of fuel and the spectacular impact on the environment. Wireless sensor networks offer an attractive choice for low cost and easy-to-deploy solutions for intelligent traffic guidance systems and parking lot applications. This paper focuses on comparative study of different smart parking techniques developed with the aim of overcoming said problems using various wireless sensor networks and to propose architecture of a multi-service smart parking management system.},

abstract = {The application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the public sector can usher performance enhancement, productivity and social equity in public service delivery mechanisms. More specifically, emerging digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be employed for more effective retrieval and analysis of complex, real-time data that could also be captured and shared by devices supporting Internet of Things. Literature asserts that governments worldwide must adopt solutions offered by these emerging technologies to drive innovation in public service delivery mechanisms. Appreciating these claims, this study aims to explore the current and potential use of IoT and AI. Based on the related review of literature, the study puts forth a conceptual framework for creating an open and integrated national level agriculture stack (christened as KisanOne by the authors) so that developing countries like India can effectively espouse data driven approach in its agriculture sector. "Kisan One" combines varied aspects of a farmers' activities including weather forecast, soil health indices, seed procurement cycle, sowing cycles, details of fertilizers availability, crop prices, etc, in a unified national stack that is accessible to all the stakeholders using application programming interfaces (APIs). Needless to say, the proposed KisanOne is a utopian implementation where existing and contemporary digital initiatives get unified on a single platform.Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value sans any ability to extract meaning from it. Intelligent data analytics could be employed on real time datasets of KisanOne both for evidence based decision making as well as for malicious intent. This paper, therefore, attempts to offer an insight into such challenges as well as suggest policy recommendations that could strengthen existing regulatory mechanisms for effective implementation of IoT and AI in existing public service delivery schemes of India. The paper is divided into four broad sections. The first section builds the Background of the paper. The next section is divided into four subsections and in this section instance of Agriculture has been detailed with reference to its current scenario and prevailing solutions. India has started using technology in Agriculture to a great extent- some of these applications such as Kisan Suvidha2 mobile app, mKisan SMS Portal, Farmer's Portal, Soil Health Card, Fertilizer Monitoring System(FMS) software, Agrimarket App have been delineated in the study. A use case on transformation of agriculture sector using IoT and AI is also presented in one of the sub-sections. A National Level Integrated Agriculture Stack is also proposed in this paper. The subsequent section presents brief picture of key challenges of implementing IoT and AI in Agriculture sector followed by recommendations and Consulive Remarks. It is an innovative and descriptive study that primarily relies on secondary data gleaned from international/national journals, reports of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and other online academic sources coupled with creative out-of-box thinking to propose the application of IoT and AI in varied public sectors with special emphasis on Agriculture.},

abstract = {Traditional static risk assessment and management are currently not enough in most of the scenarios where the cybersecurity context of an organization varies dynamically. New threats that may affect to the organization can appear, suspicious activity is detected, etc. These changes are not taken into account by a static risk assessment as it is carried out unresponsively to these sudden changes in the context. This paper proposes a dynamic risk management system with the capability of reacting to those rapid changes in the context of the organization. This system is responsible for collecting multiple data from different types of sensors (presence, environmental, wifi, Bluetooth, network anomaly, work climate, etc.) and detecting anomalies in such data using correlation techniques. This architecture also counts with a prediction module that mathematically models the attacks, using Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian networks, and tries to estimate the next step of the attacker. Also, it is capable of automatically inferring the best response action in order to deploy the proper countermeasures against the attack.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a worldwide network of interconnected things that are uniquely addressable, via standard communication protocols. The use of IoT for continuous monitoring of public health is being rapidly adopted by various countries while generating a massive volume of heterogeneous, multisource, dynamic, and sparse high-velocity data. Handling such an enormous amount of high-speed medical data while integrating, collecting, processing, analyzing, and extracting knowledge constitutes a challenging task. On the other hand, most of the existing IoT devices do not cooperate with one another by using the same medium of communication. For this reason, it is a challenging task to develop healthcare applications for IoT that fulfill all user needs through real-time monitoring of health parameters. Therefore, to address such issues, this article proposed a Hadoop-based intelligent care system (HICS) that demonstrates IoT-based collaborative contextual Big Data sharing among all of the devices in a healthcare system. In particular, the proposed system involves a network architecture with enhanced processing features for data collection generated by millions of connected devices. In the proposed system, various sensors, such as wearable devices, are attached to the human body and measure health parameters and transmit them to a primary mobile device (PMD). The collected data are then forwarded to intelligent building (IB) using the Internet where the data are thoroughly analyzed to identify abnormal and serious health conditions. Intelligent building consists of (1) a Big Data collection unit (used for data collection, filtration, and load balancing); (2) a Hadoop processing unit (HPU) (composed of Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and MapReduce); and (3) an analysis and decision unit. The HPU, analysis, and decision unit are equipped with a medical expert system, which reads the sensor data and performs actions in the case of an emergency situation. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system, we use publicly available medical sensory datasets and real-time sensor traffic while identifying the serious health conditions of patients by using thresholds, statistical methods, and machine-learning techniques. The results show that the proposed system is very efficient and able to process high-speed WBAN sensory data in real time.},

abstract = {With the increasing tension of global energy and the situation of worsening ecological environment, the development of electric vehicle, especially efficiency, has become the focus of automobile industries in various countries. However, there is still no energy-efficient navigation service available due to lack of data support. In this paper, we develop a navigation service, called EE-Navi, that finds the most energy-efficient route of electric vehicle. A service framework is designed to map energy consumption of electric vehicles on city streets using driving dataset of electric vehicles and map data so that users find the most energy-efficient route between any two endpoints. The most energy-efficient route does not always coincide with the shortest and fastest routes, which is closely related to road conditions. We collected electric vehicles driving dataset in a Chinese city, Xi'an. The dataset includes more than 30,000 electric vehicles with a data volume of 1TB. We adopted a novel method of power consumption prediction to derive the energy consumption regression model directly from the physical model, which is more professional. If the most energy-saving route recommended by the EE-Navi service is used, an average 7% savings in energy is achieved from the experiment.},

Consequently, the current paradigm of automation will be inadequate for the management and operation of these systems. The dominant approach to ad- dress this issue is to design and develop autonomous systems that can adapt to the changes in various levels and keep delivering the expected functionality. Such systems need fundamentally different architectures, components and methodologies incorporating new paradigms such as machine learning and intelligent decision making. In this workshop, we attempt to discuss the in uence of these paradigms on the development life cycle of adaptive soft- ware, starting from requirements, design and architecture and also their verification and validation.},

abstract = {Edge/fog computing works at the local area network level or devices connected to the sensor or the gateway close to the sensor. These nodes are located in different degrees of proximity to the user, while the data processing and storage are distributed among multiple nodes. In healthcare applications in the Internet of things, when data is transmitted through insecure channels, its privacy and security are the main issues. In recent years, learning from label proportion methods, represented by inverse calibration (InvCal) method, have tried to predict the class label based on class label proportions in certain groups. For privacy protection, the class label of the sample is often sensitive and invisible. As a compromise, only the proportion of class labels in certain groups can be used in these methods. However, due to their weak labeling scheme, their classification performance is often unsatisfactory. In this article, a labeling privacy protection support vector machine using privileged information, called LPP-SVM-PI, is proposed to promote the accuracy of the classifier in infectious disease diagnosis. Based on the framework of the InvCal method, besides using the proportion information of the class label, the idea of learning using privileged information is also introduced to capture the additional information of groups. The slack variables in LPP-SVM-PI are represented as correcting function and projected into the correcting space so that the hidden information of training samples in groups is captured by relaxing the constraints of the classification model. The solution of LPP-SVM-PI can be transformed into a classic quadratic programming problem. The experimental dataset is collected from the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transcription polymerase chain reaction at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil. In the experiment, LPP-SVM-PI is efficiently applied for COVID-19 diagnosis.},

The system responds to the user's personal hand hygiene behavior with animation of a virtual bonsai as an interactive agent. To preserve user privacy, we implemented the system on an edge device and conducted experiments for 4 case studies in 2 real-world organizations.

abstract = {Multimer is a new technology that aims to provide a data-driven understanding of how humans cognitively and physically experience spatial environments. By multimodally measuring biosensor data to model how the built environment and its uses influence cognitive processes, Multimer aims to help space professionals like architects, workplace strategists, and urban planners make better design interventions. Multimer is perhaps the first spatial technology that collects biosensor data, like brainwave and heart rate data, and analyzes it with both spatiotemporal and neurophysiological tools.The Multimer mobile app can record data from several kinds of commonly available, inexpensive, wearable sensors, including EEG, ECG, pedometer, accelerometer, and gyroscope modules. The Multimer app also records user-entered information via its user interface and micro-surveys, then also combines all this data with a user's geo-location using GPS, beacons, and other location tools. Multimer's study platform displays all of this data in real-time at the individual and aggregate level. Multimer also validates the data by comparing the collected sensor and sentiment data in spatiotemporal contexts, and then it integrates the collected data with other data sets such as citizen reports, traffic data, and city amenities to provide actionable insights towards the evaluation and redesign of sites and spaces.This report presents preliminary results from the data validation process for a Multimer study of 101 subjects in New York City from August to October 2017. Ultimately, the aim of this study is to prototype a replicable, scalable model of how the built environment and the movement of traffic influence the neurophysiological state of pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers.},

abstract = {Road latent cost, which quantifies how desirable each road is for traveling, is important information to enable many smartcity applications such as route recommendation. Arguably, vehicle trajectories are a good source to learn these costs as drivers intelligently incorporate them into their routing decisions. However, major past approaches misinterpret drivers' behaviors and suffer from trajectory sparsity problem, mainly because they adopt an edge-centric perspective which fails to exploit the sequential information in the entire trajectories. To address these shortcomings, we model drivers' routing decision process which targets at global path optimality, and present a framework to reliably discover those costs by exploiting entire trajectories while isolating the influence of heterogeneous destinations. Extensions are also made to address several issues in practice. Extensive experiments on real world data show that the road costs learned in this way significantly outperform past approaches in several urban computing tasks and require less data for learning.},

abstract = { Population health data are becoming more and more publicly available on the Internet than ever before. Such datasets offer a great potential for enabling a better understanding of the health of populations, and inform health professionals and policy makers for better resource planning, disease management and prevention across different regions. However, due to the laborious and high-cost nature of collecting such public health data, it is a common place to find many missing entries on these datasets, which challenges the utility of the data and hinders reliable analysis and understanding. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a deep-learning-based approach, called Compressive Population Health (CPH), to infer and recover (to complete) the missing prevalence rate entries of multiple chronic diseases. The key insight of CPH relies on the combined exploitation of both intra-disease and inter-disease correlation opportunities. Specifically, we first propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach to extract and model both of these two types of correlations, and then adopt a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based prevalence inference model to jointly fuse them to facility the prevalence rates data recovery of missing entries. We extensively evaluate the inference model based on real-world public health datasets publicly available on the Web. Results show that our inference method outperforms other baseline methods in various settings and with a significantly improved accuracy (from 14.8% to 9.1%).},

abstract = {Mobile IoT-based augmented and mixed reality (AR/MR) applications are gained increased attention by providing immersive experiences for applications in different domains. In such applications, live video streaming will be processed in a real-time manner for object detection, identification, and tracking, as well as to render virtual overlays on the user's field of view. However, mobile IoT AR/MR applications have a high demand for processing and storage resources that can not be supplied by resource-constrained IoT devices. Hence, edge computing will be fundamental to support mobile IoT AR/MR applications by deploying resources in the proximity of IoT devices. Thus, heavy computation tasks are offloaded to and executed at remote edge servers. In this paper, we discuss the recent solutions designed to enable edge computing for mobile IoT AR/MR applications. We shed light on the limitations of current task offloading approaches designed for edge-assisted IoT applications, and present recent works to support edge-assisted IoT AR/MR applications. We highlight the main challenges and discuss the advantages and limitations of current approaches designed for local and remote object detection in mobile AR/MR applications. Finally, we point out some future research directions in need of further investigation.},

Achieving this for new buildings is feasible, but it may be difficult to transform existing buildings to ZEBs. Digital twins provide a promising approach to monitor existing buildings and further increase their energy efficiency. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a physical entity. It has several applications in product design, product cycle, and fault detection. This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines physics-based and machine learning methods to create a DT for the built environment. A case study for a digital twin of a single room is also discussed. The initial comparison of cooling energy between the physical testbed and the DT model shows promising results for future development. The limitations, challenges, and future development of the approach are also addressed in the paper.},

These IoT devices are connected to outside networks, and as such are often targets of hacking attempts and associated with private user information leaks. The end user is often unaware of how these devices operate, and as a result is unable to notice any unauthorized communication. In response, we aim to create a system to visualize the activity of an IoT device (IoT activity monitor). To create this system, we analyze the network traffic of an IoT device and propose a way to estimate which function it uses. Using Wire-Shark, a packet capture software, we evaluate the data transmitted from the Amazon Echo Spot, Amazon Echo Dot and Amazon Echo Flex, which are smart speakers. We confirmed that we can estimate 8~10 kinds of called functions with 76.1%, 89.8% and 85.2% accuracy for each smart speaker respectively.},

The paper describes the methodology of this scenario approach and an exemplification of identifying research and training needs relating to the implementation of Internet of things in public service provisioning, based on the application of the scenario approach. The methodology foresees expert engagement in the interactive workshops aimed at identification and prioritisation of the needs through a moderated discussion of the pre-constructed future scenarios.

abstract = {Sound event detection (SED) is the task of tagging the absence or presence of audio events and their corresponding interval within a given audio clip. While SED can be done using supervised machine learning, where training data is fully labeled with access to per event timestamps and duration, our work focuses on weakly-supervised sound event detection (WSSED), where prior knowledge about an event's duration is unavailable. Recent research within the field focuses on improving segmentand eventlevel localization performance for specific datasets regarding specific evaluation metrics. Specifically, well-performing event-level localization requires fully labeled development subsets to obtain event duration estimates, which significantly benefits localization performance. Moreover, well-performing segment-level localization models output predictions at a coarse-scale (e.g.,1 second), hindering their deployment on datasets containing very short events (&lt;; 1second). This work proposes a duration robust CRNN (CDur) framework, which aims to achieve competitive performance in terms of segmentand event-level localization. This paper proposes a new post-processing strategy named “Triple Threshold” and investigates two data augmentation methods along with a label smoothing method within the scope of WSSED. Evaluation of our model is done on the DCASE2017 and 2018 Task 4 datasets, and URBAN-SED. Our model outperforms other approaches on the DCASE2018 and URBAN-SED datasets without requiring prior duration knowledge. In particular, our model is capable of similar performance to strongly-labeled supervised models on the URBANSED dataset. Lastly, ablation experiments to reveal that without post-processing, our model's localization performance drop is significantly lower compared with other approaches.},

For such textual content obtained in real-time, we propose an unsupervised text classification system based on general YAGO ontology, graph algorithms and a custom scoring method. The system shows good performance using only ontology information and the ontology structure itself. We compare our system against a SVM-based (Support Vector Machine) classic text classification approach. For determining the relevance of a specific document for a specific topic, our approach develops and compares the ontology sub graphs corresponding to the query and to the document. It leads to a high flexibility in terms of capitalizing the already classified documents when refining and changing the interest topic: a graph-based matching of the already obtained ontology-based document representation against the new query representation is enough to assess the document relevance.},

Short-term and long-term impacts of the SBE on human behaviour is assessed using the iEML framework. Further, a design framework is proposed based on TRIZ-based morphological analysis to offer useful interventions. Based on this framework, conceptual solutions are designed to neutralise the detrimental impacts of SBE on human behaviour. Finally using systems thinking approach, an inter-relationship matrix is formulated between design enablers and design processes of SBE considering psychosocial aspects and mental well-being.

It thus overcomes the range limits and scalability challenges associated with traditional short range wireless sensor networks. Due to their escalating demand, LPWANs are gaining momentum, with multiple competing technologies currently being developed. Despite their promise, existing LPWAN technologies raise a number of challenges in terms of spectrum limitation, coexistence, mobility, scalability, coverage, security, and application-specific requirements which make their adoption challenging. In this paper, we identify the key opportunities of LPWAN, highlight the challenges, and show potential directions of the future research on LPWAN.},

Such datasets can be extremely noisy and often contain a significant amount of outliers that result from sensor malfunction or human operation faults. In order to utilize such data for real-world applications, it is critical to detect outliers so that models built from these datasets will not be skewed by outliers. In this paper, we propose a new outlier detection method that utilizes the correlations in the data (e.g., taxi trip distance vs. trip time). Different from existing outlier detection methods, we build a robust regression model that explicitly models the outliers and detects outliers simultaneously with the model fitting. We validate our approach on real-world datasets against methods specifically designed for each dataset as well as the state of the art outlier detectors. Our outlier detection method achieves better performances, demonstrating the robustness and generality of our method. Last, we report interesting case studies on some outliers that result from atypical events.},

abstract = {Collective self-adaptive systems (CSAS) are distributed and interconnected systems composed of multiple agents that can perform complex tasks such as environmental data collection, search and rescue operations, and discovery of natural resources. By providing individual agents with learning capabilities, CSAS can cope with challenges related to distributed sensing and decision-making and operate in uncertain environments. This unique characteristic of CSAS enables the collective to exhibit robust behaviour while achieving system-wide and agent-specific goals. Although learning has been explored in many CSAS applications, selecting suitable learning models and techniques remains a significant challenge that is heavily influenced by expert knowledge. We address this gap by performing a multifaceted analysis of existing CSAS with learning capabilities reported in the literature. Based on this analysis, we introduce a 3D framework that illustrates the learning aspects of CSAS considering the dimensions of autonomy, knowledge access, and behaviour, and facilitates the selection of learning techniques and models. Finally, using example applications from this analysis, we derive open challenges and highlight the need for research on collaborative, resilient and privacy-aware mechanisms for CSAS.},

abstract = {Recently, human activity recognition and prediction have become important functionalities in ambient-assisted living. Activity inference algorithms detect what task a human undertakes, by analyzing the data stream pattern generated from various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, determining how the data stream should be segmented in real-time, referred to as data segmentation, remains as one of the most difficult challenges. In this paper, we propose an automatic data segmentation approach for real-time activity prediction by employing the Jaro-Winkler Distance measurement. Our approach selects a breakpoint of a stream by comparing the Jaro-Winkler distance between the training dataset and the data stream and finding a peak among the variations. The resultant segment also becomes new training data after being tagged; this removes the need to segment the stream data manually for humans. From the experiment based on MIT's smart home dataset collected from a real living environment, our approach shows reasonable performance of 76% accuracy even though the dataset size is relatively diminutive.},

abstract = {To enable and support smart environments, a recent ICT trend promotes pushing computation from the remote Cloud as close to data sources as possible, resulting in the emergence of the Fog and Edge computing paradigms. Together with Cloud computing, they represent a stacked architecture, in which raw datasets are first pre-processed locally at the Edge and then vertically offloaded to the Fog and/or the Cloud. However, as hardware is becoming increasingly powerful, Edge devices are seen as candidates for offering data processing capabilities, able to pool and share computing resources to achieve better performance at a lower network latency—a pattern that can be also applied to Fog nodes. In these circumstances, it is important to enable efficient, intelligent, and balanced allocation of resources, as well as their further orchestration, in an elastic and transparent manner. To address such a requirement, this article proposes an OpenStack-based middleware platform through which resource containers at the Edge, Fog, and Cloud levels can be discovered, combined, and provisioned to end users and applications, thereby facilitating and orchestrating offloading processes. As demonstrated through a proof of concept on an intelligent surveillance system, by converging the Edge, Fog, and Cloud, the proposed architecture has the potential to enable faster data processing, as compared to processing at the Edge, Fog, or Cloud levels separately. This also allows architects to combine different offloading patterns in a flexible and fine-grained manner, thus providing new workload engineering patterns. Measurements demonstrated the effectiveness of such patterns, even outperforming edge clusters.},

Despite the suitability of arbiter physically unclonable function (APUF) among other PUF variants for the IoT applications, implementing it on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is challenging. This work presents the complete characterization of the path changing switch (PCS)1 based APUF on two different families of FPGA, like Spartan-3E (90 nm CMOS) and Artix-7 (28 nm CMOS). A comprehensive study of the existing tuning concept for programmable delay logic (PDL) based APUF implemented on FPGA is presented, leading to establishment of its practical infeasibility. We investigate the entropy, randomness properties of the PCS based APUF suitable for practical applications, and the effect of temperature variation signifying the adequate tolerance against environmental variation. The XOR composition of PCS based APUF is introduced to boost performance and security. The robustness of the PCS based APUF against machine learning based modeling attack is evaluated, showing similar characteristics as the conventional APUF. Experimental results validate the efficacy of PCS based APUF with a little hardware footprint removing the paucity of lightweight security primitive for IoT.},

abstract = {Sequential location recommendation plays an important role in many applications such as mobility prediction, route planning and location-based advertisements. In spite of evolving from tensor factorization to RNN-based neural networks, existing methods did not make effective use of geographical information and suffered from the sparsity issue. To this end, we propose a Geography-aware sequential recommender based on the Self-Attention Network (GeoSAN for short) for location recommendation. On the one hand, we propose a new loss function based on importance sampling for optimization, to address the sparsity issue by emphasizing the use of informative negative samples. On the other hand, to make better use of geographical information, GeoSAN represents the hierarchical gridding of each GPS point with a self-attention based geography encoder. Moreover, we put forward geography-aware negative samplers to promote the informativeness of negative samples. We evaluate the proposed algorithm with three real-world LBSN datasets, and show that GeoSAN outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential location recommenders by 34.9%. The experimental results further verify significant effectiveness of the new loss function, geography encoder, and geography-aware negative samplers.},

abstract = {The growing connection between the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses many challenges that require novel approaches and even a rethinking of the entire communication and processing architecture to meet new requirements for latency, reliability, power consumption and resource usage. Edge computing is a promising approach to meet these challenges that can also be beneficial in delivering advanced AI-based IoT solutions in areas where connectivity is scarce and resources are generally limited.In this paper, we introduce an edge/fog generic architecture to allow the adoption of edge solutions in IoT deployments in poorly connected and resource limited scenarios. To this end, we integrate, using microservices, an MQTT based system that can collect ingress data, handle their persistency, and coordinate data integration with the cloud using a specific service called aggregator. The edge stations have a dedicated channel with the aggregator based on LoRa to enable long-range transmissions with low power consumption. Some details of the implementation aspects are described along with some preliminary results. Initial testing of the architecture indicates that it is flexible and robust enough to become an alternative for the deployment of advanced IoT services in resource-constrained contexts.},
