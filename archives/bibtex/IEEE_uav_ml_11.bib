abstract={Nowadays unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being widely applied to a wealth of civil and military applications. Robust and high-throughput wireless communication is the crux of these UAV applications. Yet, air-to-ground links suffer from time-varying channels induced by the agile mobility and dynamic environments. Rate adaptation algorithms are generally used to choose the optimal data rate based on the current channel conditions. State-of-the-art approaches leverage physical layer information for rate adaptation, and they work well under certain conditions. However, the above protocols still have limitation under constantly changing flight states and environments for air-to-ground links. To solve this problem, we propose StateRate, a state-optimized rate adaptation algorithm that fully exploits the characteristics of UAV systems using a hybrid deep learning model. The key observation is that the rate adaptation strategy needs to be adjusted according to motion-dependent channel models, which can be reflected by flight states. In this work, the rate adaptation protocol is enhanced with the help of the on-board sensors in UAVs. To make full use of the sensor data, we introduce a learning-based prediction module by leveraging the internal state and an online learning algorithm by employing the pre-trained model that adapts the rate adaptation algorithm to different environments. We implement our algorithm on a commercial UAV platform and evaluate it in various environments. The results demonstrate that our system outperforms the best-known rate adaptation algorithm up to 53% in terms of throughput when the velocity is 2-6 m/s.},

abstract={In wilderness search and rescue missions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be deployed to collect high-resolution imagery which is later reviewed by a first responder. The volume of images and the altitude from which they are taken makes manually identifying potential items of interest, like clothing or other man-made material, a difficult task. For this reason, we created a program that automatically detects unusually-colored objects in aerial imagery in order to assist responders in locating signs of missing persons. The program uses the Reed-Xiaoli (RX) spectral anomaly detection algorithm to determine which pixels in an image are anomalous and then generates an "anomaly map" where brighter pixels signify greater abnormality. While the RX algorithm has previously been proposed for search and rescue missions, up until now it has not been evaluated in a high-fidelity setting with real responders and real equipment. We tested the program on 150 aerial images taken over the Blanco River area in Hays County, Texas after the May 2015 flooding and demonstrated the results at a workshop on flooding hosted by Texas A&M's Center for Emergency Informatics. Early feedback from responders suggests that RX spectral anomaly detection is a valuable tool for quickly locating atypically-colored objects in images taken with UAVs for wilderness search and rescue.},

abstract={As UAVs become increasingly autonomous with decreased physical size, it will become more difficult for human operators to perform a demanding job with many challenges. These challenges include keeping track of UAVs in low-level airspace while considering the psychological state of the operators. The main objective of the operator is to eliminate the high risk of UAV collisions with each other or with unexpected obstacles while in flight. By using AI, the operators psychological state can be assessed in a non-intrusive manner, while equipping the system with the capability to take over and activate the teleoperated mode. In particular, affective computing sensing can aid the user in the teleoperated mode when combined with a particular control technique. A control technique is proposed on the basis of sensory measurements for adjusting the velocity and direction, therefore averting obstacle collisions. Ultrasound sensors are used to provide more real-time local data, however, these sensors can be vulnerable to missing data. To mitigate the issue of sensors with missing data, GANs can generate synthetic values that can be used in an AI-based prediction algorithm to direct the UAV on a path. In this paper, real-time data is collected through on-board Ultrasound sensors mounted on a commercial UAV. The collected data is reported to the edge server where the GAN is implemented along with the ML algorithm to predict the path. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach with an accuracy of more than 96.96%.},

abstract={With their rapid technological developments, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and micro UAVs have become a significant threat for homeland security and air defense systems. In air defense applications, classification of UAVs and discrimination of UAV tracks from non-UAV ones have become necessary. The classification of UAVs in the presence of heavy spatio-temporally varying radar clutter and interference across rural and urban areas, or under different weather conditions such as rain or snow is particularly challenging. In this paper, a classification method for UAV vs. non-UAV target discrimination, and micro-UAV classification using kinematic and Radio Frequency (RF) characteristics is proposed. For three different classes, namely, micro UAV-1, micro UAV-2 and non-UAV, various classifier architectures are implemented and the results based on real radar data are presented.},

abstract={In this study, artificial intelligence and image recognition technologies are combined with environmental sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) for pest identification. Real-time agricultural meteorology and pest identification systems on mobile applications are evaluated based on intelligent pest identification and environmental IoT data. We combined the current mature AIoT technology and deep learning and applied it to smart agriculture. We used deep learning YOLOv3 for image recognition to obtain the location of Tessaratoma papillosa and analyze the environmental information from weather stations through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the occurrence of pests. The experimental results showed that the pest identification accuracy reached 90%. Precise positioning can effectively reduce the amount of pesticides used and reduce pesticide damage to the soil. The current research provides the location of the pest and the extent of the pests to farmers can accurately use pesticide application at a precise time and place and thus reduce the agricultural workforce required for timely pest control, thus achieving the goal of smart agriculture. The proposed system notifies farmers of the presence of different pests before they start multiplying in large numbers. It improves overall agricultural economic value by providing appropriate pest control methods that decrease crop losses and reduce the environmental damage caused by the excessive usage of pesticides.},

abstract={This paper explores the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for Vegetation Encroachment Detection using multi-head attention based Transformers (VE-DETR) network. With the enormous rise in the use of powerlines in complex terrains, vegetation encroachment of overhead powerlines has become an important issue that causes severe powerline failures. Some of the possibilities include falling of trees on or growing into the transmission lines that causes power outages or starting a fire in surrounding areas is a significant concern. This causes a significant threat to the security and stability of the power grids. Thus, it is significant to detect vegetation encroachment for ensuring the security and reliability in operating the power systems. As regular overhead inspections of powerlines are expensive and require a systematic inspection to overcome power outages. UAVs combined with deep learning methods are a viable option for addressing the vegetation encroachment problem that poses a significant risk of powerline failures.},

abstract={We present a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning formulation of the decentralized formation control problem for swarms of fixed-wing UAVs based on a relative state-space construction of obstacles and waypoints. Specifically, a modular state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) approach is applied to a set of behavioral swarm rules (i.e., Reynolds flocking, target seek, and obstacle avoidance). Q-tables are trained offline for each rule using a simulated model of the UAV plant over scenarios with randomized waypoints and obstacle locations. The greatest mass approach is applied to action selection for each UAV by selecting the relative heading that maximizes the weighted sum of Q-values across all Q-tables. To restrain the dimensionality of the state space, object-focused learning is applied during policy evaluation to instantiate multiple Q-tables for each detected neighbor UAV and obstacle. In comparison to existing behavioral swarm controllers, the controller learned via object-focused greatest mass SARSA (OF-GM-SARSA) is generalizable across multiple scenarios in terms of demonstrating desired swarm behaviors while providing a negliaible number of collisions.},

abstract={A novel Fusion Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed in this research for potential real-time monitoring of insulators using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) edge devices. Precise airborne imaging of outdoor objects, such as high voltage insulators, suffers from varied object resolution, cluttered backgrounds, unclear or contaminated surfaces, and illumination conditions. Accurate information about the insulator surface condition is essential and is of a high priority since insulator breakdown is a leading cause of electrical failure. A multi-modal information fusion (MMIF) system is developed during this research to analyze and classify possible contaminations present on the electrical insulators. A novel system, referred to as FCN, consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a binary Multilayer Neural Network (MNN) sub-classifier. While constructing the MMIF dataset for training and testing the novel FCN, the image classification output of the CNN is combined with the leakage current values (LCV) obtained as the classification output of MNN. Each sample of the MMIF dataset is, therefore, represented as a series of fusions. Later, sub-classifiers, of the FCN, are trained to identify the contamination types in the fusion series by implementing a voting system of sub-classifiers which is trained to identify a given class. As a result of the implementation of the proposed FCN, the classification accuracy increased by 8.4%, i.e., from 92% to 99.76%. To compare and benchmark the performance of proposed FCN, conventional classification algorithms are also implemented on the fusion of features that are extracted employing the wavelet transform and PCA methods. State-of-the-art CNN architectures are also discussed on account of their time consumption and memory usage. The conceptualization of a potential hardware implementation of the proposed FCN, on emerging edge devices, is also provided for completeness of the discussion. Pertinent outcomes of this research can be further extended to other potential applications of airborne imaging.},

Flying Wireless Network (FWN) is one of the IoT based implementation and deployment whereby the flying objects are formed in network environment and remote monitoring is done.

abstract={This paper presents an asymptotic attitude tracking controller for a rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicle (RUAV) using the robust integral of the signum of the error(RISE) feedback and neural network (NN) feedforward terms. Usually, the typical NN-based attitude controller guarantees the uniformly ultimately bounded stability. In this study, semi-global asymptotic tracking of the RUAV is guaranteed by the RISE feedback term and NN feedforward term adapted by the projection method. The controller is basically designed by the linear dynamic model inversion method whose model is obtained by the linearization of the nonlinear RUAV model at the hover flight. Then, the uncertainty generated in the linearization is removed by the RISE feedback and NN feedforward terms. The asymptotic tracking of the attitude states is proven with the Lyapunov stability analysis, and a numerical simulation using the nonlinear RUAV model is performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

abstract={Due to the agility, low-cost and robustness, UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Ad Hoc Networks formed by small UAVs have popular application in the battlefield. Considering the high mobility of UAV which may exit and join in the networks frequently, random access is critical for UAV Ad Hoc Networks. Due to the complex and serious electromagnetic environment in the battlefield, how to identify the MAC protocol when demodulation is unrealistic and switch to this MAC protocol adaptively is challenging. In this paper, we propose Demodulation-free Random Access (DFRA) scheme which can help UAVs join in the UAV ad hoc networks without demodulating the property field of MAC protocol header. First, we propose an adaptive feature extraction algorithm and use it for machine learning based MAC protocol identification. Then, DFRA adopts an adaptive MAC switching framework to access the networks. We implement DFRA with USRP N210 and evaluate the performance by experiments. The results show that DFRA can guarantee access accuracy rate over 95% when demodulation is unrealistic.},

In the design process, the effect of unknown nonlinearity in multi-MUAV systems is addressed using neural networks (NNs). In order to balance out the effects of external disturbance and actuator fault, a disturbance observer is designed to compensate for the aforementioned negative impacts. The Nussbaum function is used to address the problem of output dead-zone. The designed fault-tolerant controller guarantees that the output signals of all followers and leader are synchronized by the backstepping technique. Finally, the effectiveness of the control scheme is verified by simulation experiments.},

abstract={Wireless communication with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) will become an integral part of future wireless communication systems. In UAVs real-time data transfer is very critical because UAVs need to be controlled from the ground and their data is also transferred in real time. However, aircraft antennas are prone to airframe shadowing. Aircraft surfaces, on which antennas are placed, obscure the main line-of-sight path. In addition, losses used in link budget analyses show great variability in real time. Therefore, observed end-to-end channels, including all impairments, are in general quite different from theoretical calculations in practice. In this work an end-to-end channel link budget, including all effects, is modelled by applying machine learning methods on measured data obtained during past flights. It is observed that ensemble bagged trees (EBT) and exponential Gaussian process regression (GPR) provide the two best results. Pre-processing data and utilizing raw data are also compared. EBT and exponential GPR can predict the amount of end-to-end losses with 7.49% and 8.07% sensitivity respectively using processed data. When raw data is used as input to the EBT method, it can predict the amount of end-to-end loss with a sensitivity of 2.79%, while a theoretical prediction error is 21.9%.},

abstract={Forest fires are one of the main reasons for environmental degradation. In their early stages, the fires are hard to discover, so a faster and more accurate detection method can help minimize the amount of damage they can inflict. In this paper, we present an approach for autonomous early fire detection, which is based on a system with high degree of reliability and with no need of service or human interaction. To provide the autonomous capabilities to the proposed system, we have developed an object detection method, based on a convolutional neural network, which is presented in the main part of the paper. In order to have a better field of view over the observed area, instead of traditional lookout towers and satellite based monitoring, we use live video feed from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which patrols over the risky area. To make better predictions on the fire probability, we use not only the optical camera of the UAV, but also an on-board thermal camera. With the help of the software platform Node-RED, we have developed a web-based platform, which can present the acquired data in real-time and can notify the interested parties. The workflow for the development of the web-platform is also described in this paper.},

Subsequently, the mean of spectral bands and twelve vegetation indices were calculated to characterize each segment. To classify tree canopies into dead and healthy trees, supervised machine learning using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were applied.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in forest fire monitoring and detection thanks to their high mobility and ability to cover areas at different altitudes and locations with relatively lower cost. Traditional fire detection algorithms are mostly based on the RGB color model, but their speed and accuracy need further improvements. This paper proposes a forest fire detection algorithm by exploiting YOLOv3 to UAV-based aerial images. Firstly, a UAV platform for the purpose of forest fire detection is developed. Then according to the available computation power of the onboard hardware, a small-scale of convolution neural network (CNN) is implemented with the help of YOLOv3. The testing results show that the recognition rate of this algorithm is about 83%, and the frame rate of detection can reach more than 3.2 fps. This method has great advantages for real-time forest fire detection application using UAVs.},

abstract={As low-altitude airspace opens up, aeronautical surveillance based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has started to be widely used in the transportation system. Visual object tracking plays an important role in aeronautical surveillance for its accuracy and timeliness. Although traditional trackers have made great progress, they still tend to fail in complex scenes, such as occlusions, illumination variations, background clutter, and etc. In order to make use of appearance features to distinguish the object and surroundings, we propose a novel architecture called attentional convolutional neural networks (ACNN) in conjunction with offline training and online learning for object tracking. ACNN consists of a trunk equipped with attention blocks that highlight the interesting object, and several branches, which are respectively responsible for specific training sequences. In the tracking stage, all branches are removed and a new fully-connected (fc) layer is added to accomplish binary classification. We regard the candidate with the highest probability as current target. Extensive experimental results on public benchmark show that our method performs outstandingly against state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we have also investigated the relationship between the number of network layers and tracking performance for its practical use.},

abstract={Tight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous missions such as formation flight (FF) and aerial refueling (AR) require an active controller that works in conjunction with a precise sensor that is able to identify an in-front aircraft and to estimate its relative position and orientation. Among possible choices vision sensors are of interest because they are passive in nature and do not require the cooperation of the in-front aircraft in any way. In this paper new vision-based estimation and navigation algorithms based on neural networks is developed. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm have been validated via a detailed modeling and a complete virtual environment based on the six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) nonlinear simulation of aircraft dynamics in an autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) mission. In addition a full-state time-variant tracking controller based on the pole placement method is designed to generate required commands for aircraft control surfaces and engine during an AAR. The performance of the system in the presence of noise has also been examined.},

abstract={With the continuous application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in the field of national defense and civil use, the UAV cluster system in which multiple UAVs cooperate to perform tasks has become a key research in many countries. This paper focuses on the problem of multi-UAV's Coverage Path Planning (mCPP) to exploit all points of interests within an area based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), where each UAV starts with a random position and carries a camera during the mission. There have been a number of optimal algorithms proposed for the coverage path planning of single UAV, however, it is under-explored for multiple UAVs. As such, we leverage Deep reinforcement learning with Double Q-learning Networks (DDQN) to learn a global optimal control policy for a team of UAVs under certain power constraints to cooperate effectively to explore a wider area. Regarding the task area as a 2D plane, we divide it into a collection of uniform grid cells, which represent a section of the environment. The camera field of view of each UAV covers a cell area underneath the UAV. Simulation results demonstrate that wherever the start positions are, the UAV cluster can fully cover the whole task area under the energy constraints and achieve autonomous collaboration. The proposed method has great potential in applying to dynamic environment.},

abstract={In the past two decades, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have demonstrated their efficacy in supporting both military and civilian applications, where tasks can be dull, dirty, dangerous, or simply too costly with conventional methods. Many of the applications contain tasks that can be executed in parallel, hence the natural progression is to deploy multiple UAVs working together as a force multiplier. However, to do so requires autonomous coordination among the UAVs, similar to swarming behaviors seen in animals and insects. This paper looks at flocking with small fixed-wing UAVs in the context of a model-free reinforcement learning problem. In particular, Peng's Q(Î»)$with a variable learning rate is employed by the followers to learn a control policy that facilitates flocking in a leader-follower topology. The problem is structured as a Markov decision process, where the agents are modeled as small fixed-wing UAVs that experience stochasticity due to disturbances such as winds and control noises, as well as weight and balance issues. Learned policies are compared to ones solved using stochastic optimal control (i.e., dynamic programming) by evaluating the average cost incurred during flight according to a cost function. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed learning approach at enabling agents to learn how to flock in a leader-follower topology, while operating in a nonstationary stochastic environment.},

abstract={Unlike autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a higher dimensional configuration space, which makes the motion planning of multi-UAVs a challenging task. In addition, uncertainties and noises are more significant in UAV scenarios, which increases the difficulty of autonomous navigation for multi-UAV. In this letter, we proposed a two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) based multi-UAV collision avoidance approach without explicitly modeling the uncertainty and noise in the environment. Our goal is to train a policy to plan a collision-free trajectory by leveraging local noisy observations. However, the reinforcement learned collision avoidance policies usually suffer from high variance and low reproducibility, because unlike supervised learning, RL does not have a fixed training set with ground-truth labels. To address these issues, we introduced a two-stage training method for RL based collision avoidance. For the first stage, we optimize the policy using a supervised training method with a loss function that encourages the agent to follow the well-known reciprocal collision avoidance strategy. For the second stage, we use policy gradient to refine the policy. We validate our policy in a variety of simulated scenarios, and the extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that our policy can generate time-efficient and collision-free paths under imperfect sensing, and can well handle noisy local observations with unknown noise levels.},

abstract={We present an Aerial-Satellite imagery matching framework for UAVs visual localization. The usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been continuously increasing in many applications, such as defense, agriculture, mapping, and observation. Localization plays an essential role in UAVs navigation system. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is mainly applied for localization; however, GPS interference may occur in a GPS-denied environment. One alternative that can be used is to use a pre-existing satellite image. By comparing aerial photographs with geo-tagged satellite images, global coordinates can be estimated in an intuitive way. However, due to various factors (such as weather, light conditions, and seasonal changes), it draws different visual representations between aerial and satellite imagery. To address this problem, we propose a image matching framework that exploits CNN-based Siamese Neural Network with contrastive learning method. The proposed framework firstly takes two input data; aerial image and satellite image of the area where UAV is estimated to be. By image retrieval and matching process, it predicts global coordinates of center of the aerial image. In this paper, we describe the structure of framework, data preparation, and the efficient representation learning strategy for downstream tasks. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed framework by measuring RMSE.},

pages={1-15},
abstract={Environment perception by computing the depth is a key task for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) type systems. Due to the limited load they can carry, most drones are equipped with a single camera. This prevents general-purpose depth perception methods based either on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) or stereo reconstruction to be effectively used on such platforms. Due to the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have become more and more trustworthy, so their usage on drones is convenient. However, very few such methods have been proposed in the literature, mainly due to the few existing constraints and high diversity that unstructured aerial environments pose. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach for MDE, capable to work on aerial images. The method initially proposes an original CNN, particularly adapted to such scenarios. This is done by finding an optimal feature extractor, introducing a new scene understanding module, a new loss and a novel softmax transformation layer that facilitate a better convergence. Furthermore, since both short- and long-range accuracy is required for a robust UAV perception, we introduce a learning-based correction method that redistributes the depth points across the entire depth interval. The proposed CNN gives accurate results, while the additional refinement further improves the accuracy with only a few additional computational resources (around 1â2 ms). We initially show the capabilities of our method on synthetic images captured in unstructured aerial scenarios. Then, we prove that our method can work in real-life situations, computing depth from a single image (at multiple pitch angles) captured by a drone flying in a series of field and forest-like environments. In all these situations, the depth is densely estimated with increased accuracy and reliability.},

abstract={In aerial image object detection, how to efficiently detect different size objects in input images of different scales and obtain a unified multi-scale representation of the object is an important issue. Existing methods rarely consider the connection between multi-scale training and multi-scale inference, and do not well optimize the constraint of input object samples in the multi-scale training process, which limits the performance of multi-scale representation. In this study, an efficient object detection algorithm for aerial images is proposed to alleviate this problem. Firstly, we propose to use metric learning to obtain the scale representation boundary of each object class, reduce the support of indistinguishable objects at extreme scales in the training process, and enhance the effect of multi-scale representation. Secondly, indistinguishable small objects are merged into small object regions, and these regions are trained to recommend the detector to detect small objects on the following high-resolution scale. Thus, a reasonable association between multi-scale training and inference is established, and the efficiency of multi-scale inference is considerably improved. The proposed algorithm has been tested on three popular aerial image datasets, including VisDrone, DOTA and UAVDT. Experimental results show that it can improve the detection accuracy and reduce the number of processing pixels.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) need multiple operators as of today. Because of limitations of human attention and sensory cueing the operators cannot use all of the data coming in through these sensors. Large scale autonomy would mean the following: fewer operators, larger areas of coverage, and more vehicles. Rigorous optimization of decision theory based approaches to handling this problem suffer from speed limits to real-time computations. Soft-computing methods based on heuristics (AI, reasoning, neural networks and fuzzy logic) are able to handle certain circumstances but cannot supply any guarantees of performance in unstructured environments. We provide solutions based on rigorous approaches, but avoid heavy real-time computation through off line processing. For mapped regions, we convert maps into traversability graphs using trapezoidal map/voronoi type algorithms. We then find the shortest permissible paths for different vehicles using Dijkstra's algorithm and then preening the allowable paths using constraints on individual vehicles. Out third step consists in determining the minimum time taken by a given vehicle over those paths. We insert margins of safety at each level of this hierarchy: buffer zones (size of buffer zone is a ten meters extended polygon around each building) around mapped structures to account for map errors; buffer zones around flight paths to account for position uncertainty of vehicles; performing 1-D optimal control within limits of the vehicles performance so that vehicles can slow down or speed up in response to unexpected events.},

abstract={Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used in different research areas in aerospace to create an intelligent system. Especially, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), known as a drone, can be controlled by AI methods such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in different purposes. Drones with DRL become more intelligent and eventually they can be fully autonomous. In this paper, DRL method supported by real time object detection model is proposed to detect and catch a drone. Additionally, the results are analyzed by comparing the time to catch the target drone in seconds between DRL method, human pilot and an algorithm which directs the drone towards the target position without using any AI method or navigation and guidance method. The main idea is to catch a drone in an environment as fast as possible without crashing any obstacles inside the environment. In DRL method, the agent is a quadcopter drone and it is rewarded in each time step by the environment provided by Airsim flight simulator. Drone is trained to catch the target drone by using DRL model which is based on deep Q-Network algorithm. After training, the tests have been made by the agent drone with DRL model and human pilots to catch stationary and non-stationary target drone. The training and test results show that the agent drone learns to catch target drone which can be a stationary and a non-stationary. In addition. the agent avoids crashing any obstacles in the environment with a minimum success rate of 94%. Also, DRL model performance is compared with the human pilot performances and the agent with DRL model shows better time to catch the target drone. Human pilots struggle to control the drone by using remote controller when catching the target in simulation. However, the agent with DRL model is rarely missing the target when trying to catch the target},

To remove the uncertainty between the true range and the estimated value, the proposed estimator utilizes a saturation function with a time-varying gain. The adaptive rules of the weight parameters of the NN and time-varying gain are derived using Lyapunov stability theory and the overall closed-loop stability is proven by introducing a deadzoned estimation error, which is composed of the estimation error and the saturation function.

abstract={With supervised machine learning algorithms, meaningful information can be extracted from satellite images to support rice farm mapping. The success of these algorithms depends largely on the availability and quality of ground-truth reference data. However, collecting such data is often laborious and time-consuming. The fast development of drone technique has opened up an efficient way for ground truthing. In this study, we construct a drone-based sensing system for the purpose of efficiently collecting ground-truth data. The drone carries dual cameras that provide multispectrsal images with high spatial resolution in the same sensed site. The system is dedicated to collecting training data for rice farm mapping in Australia. To demonstrate the ability of the constructed system, real-flight experiments were conducted. Drone images of rice crops were acquired in the Riverina region of Australia, during the 2018-2019 summer season. Three-dimensional models were constructed from multiple images captured by the drone, where the structural information of rice crops was extracted. Results show that the configuration of dual cameras and the construction of three-dimensional models are particularly advantageous for ground truthing, providing valuable information for reliably identifying rice crops.},

abstract={The parameter tuning optimization design is realized for an active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) in combination with the improvement of the existing swarm intelligence algorithm. Taking the optimization design and application of ADRC as an example, this paper is focused on investigating the improvement of the hybrid algorithm composed of fish swarm algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm and its application in parameter tuning of ADRC. The main contents are as follows. First, the parameters that need to be tuned are determined based on the composition and principle of the ADRC. The module building technology of S-function is adopted to create the module library of ARDC in terms of the modular construction idea and a complete simulation example of ADRC is built in Simulink. Second, the parameters are improved according to the proposed hybrid algorithm composed of the artificial fish swarm algorithm and the standard particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the control performance is tested by the MATLAB simulation of the ADRC whose parameters are optimized by using the algorithm.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown enormous potential in both public and civil domains. Although multi-UAV systems can collaboratively accomplish missions efficiently, UAV network(UAVNET) design faces many challenging issues, such as high mobility, dynamic topology, power constraints, and varying quality of communication links. Topology control plays a key role for providing high network connectivity while conserving power in UAVNETs. In this paper, we propose a distributed topology control algorithm based on discrete particle swarm optimization with articulation points(AP-DPSO). To reduce signaling overhead and facilitate distributed control, we first identify a set of articulation points (APs) to partition the network into multiple segments. The local topology control problem for individual segments is formulated as a degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem. Each node collects local topology information and adjusts its transmit power to minimize power consumption. We conduct simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed AP-DPSO algorithm. Numerical results show that AP-DPSO outperforms some known algorithms including LMST and LSP, in terms of network connectivity, average link length and network robustness for a dynamic UAVNET.},

In order to model the uncertainty of stochastic environments, we formulate the resource allocation problem to be a Markov game, which is the generalization of Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the case of multiple agents.

abstract={Nowadays, drones can be seen in various applications in industry like surveillance and transportation. Industrial drones leverage fully-fledged computer vision techniques, such as object detection based on Deep Learning Neural Networks (DNN), to efficiently perform these objectives. Those techniques come with a high computational effort and are implemented on distributed schemes using ground devices with high performance and power consumption. This limits a drone's operational range since it has to communicate with the ground devices constantly. To alleviate such constraints, an optimized, low-power perception system on the drone is desirable. This work improves a trained DNN architecture to navigate a UAV introduced by the University of Zurich called DroNet. DroNet is computationally expensive and has a high power consumption, making it unsuitable for embedded platforms because of low memory and computational power. In this paper, a ROS-based architecture is first designed to port DroNet on a low-power Jetson Nano board, which conducts the drone's perception and control tasks. Secondly, tuning parameters and various schemes have been carried out to run the inference of the DNN efficiently. To implement the different layers in DNNs, Nvidia's TensorRT SDK is used to compile a high-performance inference engine for the Jetson Nano. Results showed that the Jetson Nano can achieve real-time performance, with 47 frames per second using a Winograd convolution and well-tuned parallelization parameters. The implementation can also achieve a speedup of 2Ã as compared with the Jetson Nanos ARM CPU while increasing the power consumption by 54%. Finally, the Jetson Nano's usability for drone inference algorithm is shown, achieving real-time response using the DroNet DNN without losing detection accuracy.},

abstract={The pine wilt disease (PWD) is one of the most dangerous and destructive diseases to coniferous forests. The rapid spread trend and strong destruction directly threaten the security of forests. The complex spread pattern and the hard labor process of diagnosis call for an effective way to detect the infected areas. In this paper, an airborne edge-computing and lightweight deep learning based system are designed for PWD detection by using imagery sensors. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is firstly utilized to realize a large-scale coverage of forests, which can substantially reduce the hard labor. Except for infected trees, a large number of irrelevant images are also acquired by the UAV, which will overload the burden of process and transmission. Then a lightweight improved YOLOv4-Tiny based method (named as YOLOv4-Tiny-3Layers) is proposed to filter these uninterested images by leveraging the computation capability of edge computing, which can realize a fast coarse-grained detection with a low missing rate. Finally, all the remaining images are transmitted to the ground workstation for the final fine-grained detection. Experimental results show that the proposed system can implement a fast detection with superior performance as compared to other methods, which helps to detect the infected pine trees in a quick manner.},

In this paper, we propose novel learning-based mechanisms for the three-dimensional deployment of UAVs assisting terrestrial networks in the downlink for overloaded situations. The problem is modeled as a game among UAVs. To solve the game, we utilize tools from reinforcement learning, and develop low complexity algorithms based on the multi-armed bandit and satisfaction methods to learn UAVs' locations. Simulation results reveal that the proposed satisfaction based UAV placement algorithm can yield significant performance gains up to about 50% and 41% in terms of throughput and the number of outage users, respectively, compared to a learning based benchmark algorithm.},

abstract={This study presents an approach to the problem of minimizing the impact of low vegetation on the accuracy of a UAV-derived DEM, based on the use of a deep neural network (DNN). It is proposed to use the U-Net network to determine corrections to the height of the raw point cloud so that the processed data reflect the actual earthâs surface. The implemented solution is therefore based on regression, not classification. As a result of the proposed processing method, the expected value of the land surface height is determined for each point of the unified point cloud. In addition, a second U-Net network is trained, enabling the uncertainty of the corrected heights of the land surface to be determined for each point of the unified cloud. The training set includes data from different seasons, which makes the models more resistant and allows for assessment of the impact of the season and more generally the related vegetation status on the model accuracy. The processing results can be used in DEM generation, and also for determining the vertical displacements of the terrain surface associated with underground mining, as well as natural phenomena such as landslides. A key advantage of the proposed processing method is the ability to predict the uncertainty of the results.},

abstract={Last May 2019, fish farms in Taal Lake suffer from fish kill resulting in an estimated loss of 405 tons of fish. It was reported that the measured water sample from the lake shows significant loss of dissolved-oxygen due to over-crowding of fish farm. With the crisis mentioned, recent studies utilize satellite remote sensors to map and monitor the aquaculture inside the lake. The maps are being used as reference material for progress monitoring, as decision-support and lake management tool by the local government and regulatory agencies. Aerial maps were captured using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as it has better resolution than satellite imagery. This study implements image processing and Mask Regional Convolutional Neural Network (Mask RCNN) on high resolution images to create an object detection and segmentation model for aquaculture structures and coastal settlement. To create the detection model, the image dataset undergoes preprocessing before feeding into the training process. Finally, an analytical software was developed to utilize segmented maps for zone management plan implementation, lake resource usage calculation, and gauge the population of settlers along the coastline. This provides meaningful visual and statistical data regarding aquaculture population, lake resource usage, local settlement population and zone development plan status.},

abstract={In this paper, the problem of resource management is studied for a network of wireless virtual reality (VR) users communicating using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)- enabled LTE over unlicensed (LTE-U) network. In the studied model, {the UAVs act as VR control centers that collect tracking information from the VR users over the wireless uplink and, then, send the constructed VR images to the VR users over an LTE-U downlink.} Therefore, resource allocation in such a UAV-enabled LTE-U network must jointly consider the uplink and downlink links over both licensed and unlicensed bands. In such a VR setting, the UAVs can dynamically adjust the data size of each VR image by tuning its quality and format. By doing so, the UAVs can adjust the transmitted data size according to the spectrum allocated to each user so as to meet the delay requirement. Therefore, resource allocation must also take into account the image quality and format. This VR-centric resource allocation problem is formulated as a noncooperative game that enables a joint allocation of licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands, as well as a dynamic adaptation of VR image quality and format. To solve this game, a learning algorithm based on the machine learning tools of echo state networks (ESNs) with leaky integrator neurons is proposed. Unlike conventional ESN learning algorithms that are suitable for discrete-time systems, the proposed algorithm can dynamically adjust the update speed of the ESN's state and, hence, it can enable the UAVs to learn the continuous dynamics of their associated VR users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves up to 14% and 27.1% gains in terms of total VR QoE for all users compared to Q-learning using LTE-U and Q-learning using LTE.},

abstract={Data collection by mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is emerging as data sources for smart city applications, however how to ensure data freshness has sparse research exposure but quite important in practice. In this paper, we consider to use a group of mobile agents (MAs) like UAVs and driverless cars which are equipped with multiple antennas to move around in the task area to collect data from deployed sensor nodes (SNs). Our goal is to minimize the age of information (AoI) of all SNs and energy consumption of MAs during movement and data upload. To this end, we propose a centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution called "DRL-freshMCS" for controlling MA trajectory planning and SN scheduling. We further utilize implicit quantile networks to maintain the accurate value estimation and steady policies for MAs. Then, we design an exploration and exploitation mechanism by dynamic distributed prioritized experience replay. We also derive the theoretical lower bound for episodic AoI. Extensive simulation results show that DRL-freshMCS significantly reduces the episodic AoI per remaining energy, compared to five baselines when varying different number of antennas and data upload thresholds, and number of SNs. We also visualize their trajectories and AoI update process for clear illustrations.},

abstract={This paper considers Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where low resource IoT devices periodically sample a stochastic process and need to upload more recent information to a Base Station (BS). Among the myriad of applications, there is a need for timely delivery of data (for example, status-updates) before the data becomes outdated and loses its value. Since transmission capabilities of IoT devices are limited, it may not always be feasible to transmit over one hop transmission to the BS. To address this challenge, UAVs with virtual queues are deployed as middle layer between IoT devices and the BS to relay recent information over unreliable channels. In the absence of channel conditions, the optimal online scheduling policy is investigated as well as dynamic UAV altitude control that maintains a fresh status of information at the BS. The objective of this paper is to minimize the Expected Weighted Sum Age of Information (EWSA) for IoT devices. First, the problem is formulated as an optimization problem that is however generally hard to solve. Second, an online model free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is proposed, where the deployed UAV obtains instantaneous channel state information (CSI) in real time along with any adjustment to its deployment altitude. Third, we formulate the online problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is a highly stable state-of-the-art DRL algorithm, is leveraged to solve the formulated problem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify findings and comprehensive comparisons with other baseline approaches are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.},

abstract={UAV can work in places that are dangerous, or not easy to reach for humans. However, due to active control and operating difficulties, it is still a challenge to develop fully autonomous flight in complex environments. This paper applies a novel heuristic dynamic programming for the UAV heading optimal tracking controller design, using kernel-based heuristic dynamic programming (KHDP). Kernel-based HDP is developed by integrating kernel methods and approximately linear dependence (ALD) analysis with the critic learning of HDP algorithm. Compared with conventional HDP where neural networks are widely used and their features were manually designed, the proposed algorithm can obtain better generalization capability and learning efficiency through applying the sparse kernel machine into the critic learning process of HDP algorithm. Simulation and experimental results of UAV heading optimal tracking control problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed kernel-based HDP algorithm.},

abstract={There is growing interest to explore the autonomous taxiing that can sense its environment and maneuver safely with little or no human input. This technology is like the one developed for driver less cars that synthesize information from multiple sensors, which sense surrounding environment to detect road surface, lanes, obstacles and signage. This paper presents application of computer vision and machine learning to autonomous method for the surface movement of an air vehicle. We present a system and method that uses pattern recognition which aids unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and enhance the manned air vehicle landing and taxiing. Encouraged with our previous results, we extend upon our research to include multiple object relevant to taxiing. The objective of the current project is to build training dataset of annotated objects acquired from overhead perspective. It is useful for training a deep neural network to learn to detect, count specific airport objects in a video or image. This paper details the procedure and parameters used to create training dataset for running convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a set of aerial images for efficient and automated object recognition. In this method, multiple airport surface signage dataset from satellite images are subjected to training for pattern recognition. This trained system learns and then identifies and locates important visual references from imaging sensors and could help in decision making during taxiing phase.},

abstract={The traditional swarm intelligence algorithm to solve the path planning in single combat style of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can no longer meet the requirements of multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance mission planning (MUCRMP) problem in denied environment for its slow convergence rate, ignorance of complex constraints and guidance to local optimization. A novel method for multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance mission planning in denied environment (MUCRMP-DE) based on an improved synthetic heuristic algorithm is proposed to tackle these. In this paper, a hierarchical model is established with the global optimization goal of UAV's minimum radar detection time at first, including the planning of reconnaissance sequence between and within target groups, as well as relative position to targets. Then an improved synthetic heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the model, which obtains valuable reconnaissance mission plan. For an application example of reconnaissance mission involving 68 targets, the simulation results show that the improved synthetic heuristic algorithm can suit the needs of the mission, particularly in effectively evading the detection of multiple radars. While it can also give better anti-radar attributes to the UA V and efficiently improved the convergence speed in the specific reconnaissance mission.},

abstract={This paper is concerned with the fault-tolerant cooperative control (FTCC) problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) in the communication network. By exploiting neural network (NN) to approximate the nonlinear terms existing in the highly nonlinear multi-UAVs system, a distributed neural adaptive control scheme is proposed when only a subset of follower UAVs has access to the leader UAV's states. To solve the problem of âexplosion of complexityâ in traditional backstepping architecture and reduce the number of online updating parameters of NN, dynamic surface control (DSC) and minimal learning parameter techniques are employed to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, by combining graph theory and Lyapunov approach, it is proved that velocities and altitudes of all follower UAVs can track the velocity and altitude of the leader UAV. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract={The control of complex autonomous systems has significantly improved in recent years and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular in the research community. Although the use of UAVs is increasing, much work remains to guarantee fault- tolerant control (FTC) properties of these vehicles. Model-based controllers are the standard way to control UAVs, however obtaining models of the system and environment for every possible operating condition a UAV can experience in a real-world scenario is not feasible. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in controlling complex systems but requires training in a simulator (requiring a model) of the system. Further, stability guarantees do not exist for learning-based controllers, which limits their large scale application in the real-world. We propose a novel hybrid FTC approach that uses a learned supervisory controller (together with low-level PID controllers) with key stability guarantees. We use a robust reinforcement learning approach to learn the supervisory control parameters and prove stability. We empirically validate our framework using trajectory-following experiments (in simulation) for a quadcopter subject to rotor faults, wind disturbances, and severe position and attitude noise.},

pages={3101-3108},
abstract={This work presents a semantic-aware path-planning pipeline for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using deep reinforcement learning for vision-based navigation in challenging environments. Driven by the maturity of works in semantic segmentation, the proposed path-planning architecture uses reinforcement learning to distinguish the parts of the scene that are perceptually more informative using semantic cues, in effect guiding more robust, repeatable, and accurate navigation of the UAV to the predefined goal destination. Assuming that the UAV performs vision-based state estimation, such as keyframe-based visual odometry, and semantic segmentation onboard, the proposed deep policy network continuously evaluates the optimal relative perceptual informativeness of each semantic class in view. A perception-aware path planner uses these informativeness values to perform trajectory optimization in order to generate the next best action with respect to the current state and the perception quality of the surroundings, essentially guiding the UAV to avoid flying over perceptually degraded regions. Thanks to the use of semantic cues, the policy can be trained in a large number of non-photorealistic randomly-generated scenes, and results to an architecture that is generalizable to environments with the same semantic classes, independently of their visual appearance. Extensive evaluations on challenging, photorealistic simulations reveal a remarkable improvement in robustness and success rate with the proposed approach over the state of the art in active perception.

Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are trained off-line to decide on the existence of a UAV within this border. Particularly, the ResNet-50 model was trained using a collected data set with more than 50,000 registered positive images. Having identified a UAV, a visual servoing scheme is employed to adjust the PTZ-parameters in order for the border of a detected UAV to span as large as possible the cameras Field of View. The advocated servoing scheme is robust enough against the UAVs rapid maneuvers. Experimental studies are offered to highlight the efficiency of the suggested scheme.},

abstract={This work continues a line of research examining the relationship between drone sensor swarm characteristics and performance of the swarm as a holistic system. A swarm of autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) was implemented in simulation to cooperatively perform a Wide Area Search for survivors in a post-disaster scenario. The sensor swarm was controlled through a behavior-based artificially intelligent paradigm whereby each UAV executes one of three sets of simple, uncoupled search behaviors - Social Searcher, Antisocial Searcher, Relay. The relationship between proportions of these behavior sets and time to find 90% of survivors was examined in swarms of 10-50 UAVs. 100 different swarm size and role distributions were generated using Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) methodology. 1000 (100 swarm size x 10 replications) simulation runs revealed an effective distribution pattern which drones could follow to automatically reallocate roles based on current swarm size. Simulations also revealed multiple configurations of role distributions at various swarm sizes that could consistently locate over 90% of survivors in under 20 minutes.},

abstract={In precision farming, a very promising scenario is represented by a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) moving in a cultivated field and collecting high-resolution videos and hyperspectral images, requiring both localization and broadband communication. An effective approach to provide both localization and wideband communication exploits unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that may act as relays to ensure seamless connectivity with a base station (BS). In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm to find the best spatial configuration of a swarm of UAVs to localize a CAV in an unknown environment and assist the communication with a BS. The UAVs cooperate to estimate the position of the CAV exploiting only the received signal strength (RSS). A reward function, based on the distance between the UAVs and the CAV, and the estimated geometric diluition of precision (GDOP), is designed. Numerical results show how the proposed multi-agent Q-learning allows the UAVs to reach low root mean square error (RMSE) in the target localization, even without previous knowledge about the environment.},

abstract={In this paper, an interference-aware path planning scheme for a network of cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. In particular, each UAV acts as a cellular user equipment (UE) and aims at achieving a tradeoff between maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing both wireless latency and the interference caused on the ground network along its path. The problem is cast as a dynamic game among UAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on echo state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN architecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the network state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of time-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses ESN to learn its optimal path, transmission power, and cell association vector at different locations along its path. The proposed algorithm is shown to reach a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium upon convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better wireless latency per UAV and rate per ground UE while requiring a number of steps that is comparable to a heuristic baseline that considers moving via the shortest distance towards the corresponding destinations.},

abstract={A UAV swarm network is a network formed by aggregating a large number of UAVs and coordinate them to execute a specific mission, especially in areas where human intervention is not physically possible or economically viable. The process of coordinating and maintaining a UAV swarm network has various phases. The pattern formation phase is one of the important phases and is highly significant in missions where geography is an important aspect of the mission. For the purpose of automating the pattern generation process, this paper proposes the dynamic polygon generation (DPGen) algorithm that can generate convex polygonal pattern with any number of vertices in linear time. The DPGen algorithm generates a pattern dynamically for any number of drones which increases the scalability of the UAV swarm networks, increasing the magnitude of use-cases of the swarm. The DPGen algorithm contains a mechanism to use this algorithm in a decentralized manner while balancing the load on all the UAVs in the network. The usage of DPGen algorithm reduces the network traffic in the UAV swarm network by 78.26% and decreases the power requirement of the leader drone by 74.39%.},

In this paper, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted IoT architecture is introduced, in which UAV is utilized to achieve low-latency and seamless-coverage acquisition of the sensing data. Furthermore, based on the recent advances on deep reinforcement learning algorithms, considering both data delay requirements and network energy consumption, a real-time flight path planning scheme of the UAV in the dynamic IoT sensor networks has been proposed based on dueling deep Q-network (DQN). Besides, the grid-based method is used to handle the network state modeling, which effectively reduces the complexity of the proposed scheme.

The performance of the reconfigurable antenna is characterized through radiation pattern measurements while the antenna is mounted on the underbelly of the UAV. A low complexity reinforcement learning based adaptive antenna selection algorithm is implemented on the aerial SDR testing platform to enhance the link quality. We present SNR measurements obtained during various indoor and outdoor flight scenarios. The results show that utilizing a reconfigurable antenna and intelligent antenna selection strategy onboard a UAV provides a higher mean SNR compared to an omni-directional antenna in both line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLOS) scenarios, and is more resilient to co-channel interference.},

abstract={For remote characterization of inaccessible underground mine voids, we are developing unmanned aerial vehicles (equipped with multiple sensors, including cameras) to fly into the mine voids to map their shape, condition, and most importantly, mineralization of the surface. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy analysis is normally conducted on rock samples in order to detect the present elements (that constitutes minerals). Mining company staffs, however, are able to judge rock types based upon visual features alone. This implies that there are some associations between the XRF signatures and the visual features of rocks. Inspired by this, we have developed a machine learning approach to predict the presence of elements in rocks, for inferring probable rock and mineral types, from imaging features. Note that there exist a number of works in the literature for classifying rocks from digital images. However, to the best of our knowledge, limited attempt has been made to find association between the digital imaging features and the XRF signatures for mineralogy discovery that we have addressed in this paper. The machine learning algorithm is trained offline based on visual imaging and XRF spectroscopy analysis data of collected rock samples in a laboratory. The imaging features provide the visual cues, and the XRF data provide information on element presence/concentration. The machine learning algorithm (regression) discovered the non-linear relationship between these feature spaces and was able to predict the element presence with high accuracy as evidenced from the experimental results.},

Upon completion of the cluster formation, the UAV optimal positioning in an Euclidean 3D space is obtained by treating a maximization problem of the clusterhead's energy availability, being the UEs that play a critical role within the PSN. Lastly, a non-cooperative game-theoretic approach is adopted to determine in a distributed manner the optimal transmission power (unique Nash equilibrium) of each UE. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is achieved via modeling and simulation and the corresponding numerical results demonstrate its energy efficiency and effectiveness.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has a high degree of independence and intelligence, which can greatly improve and extend the performance and application of UAV. It is an important development direction in the future. There are many creatures with swarm intelligence in natural world, whose individual behavior is simple, but the swarm shows a high level of intelligence. Pigeon's unique hierarchical structure is very similar to the application of the quadrotor cluster. In order to apply the biological flock behavior mechanism to quadrotor swarm, in this paper, a pigeon swarm mechanism based quadrotor formation control algorithm was designed. Meanwhile, a distributed swarm control system was constructed. Four quadrotors with communication were tested in the outfield, the result of which indicates that the mechanism of flock pigeons is conducive to realize the formation control of quadrotors and improve the robustness.},

abstract={For some real systems, physical parameters are generally unknown and cannot be measured precisely. Moreover, a multiple degrees of freedom unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) usually has many physical parameters, and the method of obtaining them is challenging. Much research has been done in this area and a lot of methods have been applied to several UAVs. In this paper, we use particle swarm optimization (PSO) swarm intelligence algorithm to identify the inertia physical parameters of quadrotor helicopter. To primarily reduce complexity of the problem and simplify the design of parameter identification scheme, the dynamics of the whole system is decomposed into two subsystems by model transformation. Then using input and output data which come from model test, the model parameters of quadrotor helicopter are identified successfully. The simulating results validate that this scheme has not only good performance on convergence speed, but also low identification error.},

abstract={The rapid development of UAV has brought great convenience to various application fields. In the meanwhile, its extensive utilization has also resulted in many problems such as public safety hazards, personal security threats and personal privacy violations. UAV is difficult to capture in real-time because of its small scale and complex flight environment. In order to solve the above problems from the perspective of security protection, a low-cost UAV detection, distance measure and protection scheme are proposed based on deep learning in this paper. The influences of different loss functions and thresholds are studied on the detection accuracy of YOLOv4 to improve the detection performance of YOLOv4 on UAV. At the same time, in order to achieve more effective prevention and control of UAV, the monocular ranging method based on PnP is introduced to get the distance between camera and UAV. Finally, the study is applied in the real-world scene, and a good target detection and ranging effect have been achieved so that the proposed model is verified in the feasibility and effectiveness.},

The Faster RCNN algorithm can simultaneously recognize the fuel receiver and the Drogue at long-distance and returns the center coordinate value of the receiver. If the pixel area of the identified Drogue is greater than a certain threshold, the central coordinate value of the Drogue is returned.

abstract={In recent years, the emergence of blockchain technology (BT) has become a unique, most disruptive, and trending technology. The decentralized database in BT emphasizes data security and privacy. Also, the consensus mechanism in it makes sure that data is secured and legitimate. Still, it raises new security issues such as majority attack and double-spending. To handle the aforementioned issues, data analytics is required on blockchain based secure data. Analytics on these data raises the importance of arisen technology Machine Learning (ML). ML involves the rational amount of data to make precise decisions. Data reliability and its sharing are very crucial in ML to improve the accuracy of results. The combination of these two technologies (ML and BT) can provide highly precise results. In this paper, we present a detailed study on ML adoption for making BT-based smart applications more resilient against attacks. There are various traditional ML techniques, for instance, Support Vector Machines (SVM), clustering, bagging, and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) can be used to analyse the attacks on a blockchain-based network. Further, we include how both the technologies can be applied in several smart applications such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), Smart Grid (SG), healthcare, and smart cities. Then, future research issues and challenges are explored. At last, a case study is presented with a conclusion.},

pages={129977-130005},
abstract={Today, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, have become very popular in military applications, commercial applications, and academic research. Flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a new type of ad hoc network, which groups small drones into an ad hoc form. These networks have unique characteristics, including moving in a 3D space, high mobility, frequent topological changes, limited resources, low density of nodes, and so on, which impose various challenges when designing a proper and efficient routing scheme. In this paper, we present a fuzzy logic-based routing scheme for flying ad hoc networks. The proposed routing scheme has two phases: route discovery phase and route maintenance phase. In the first phase, we propose a technique for calculating the score of each node in the network to prevent the broadcast storm problem and control the flood of the control messages, which have been broadcast to discover a new route in the network. This score is calculated based on various parameters such as movement direction, residual energy of nodes, link quality, and node stability. Moreover, in the route selection process, we design a fuzzy system to select routes with more fitness, less delay, and fewer hops for data transfer. The second phase includes two steps: preventing route failure in order to detect and modify paths at the failure threshold, and reconstructing failed routes in order to recognize and quickly replace these routes. Finally, the proposed routing scheme is implemented in NS2 to evaluate its performance and determine its efficiency. The simulation results are compared with three routing methods, namely ECaD, LEPR, and AODV. These results show that the proposed routing method outperforms other routing schemes in terms of end to end delay, packet delivery rate, route stability, and energy consumption. However, it has slightly increased the routing overhead.},

abstract={In this paper, the design of an optimal trajectory for an energy-constrained drone operating in dynamic network environments is studied. In the considered model, a drone base station (DBS) is dispatched to provide uplink connectivity to ground users whose demand is dynamic and unpredictable. In this case, the DBS's trajectory must be adaptively adjusted to satisfy the dynamic user access requests. To this end, a metalearning algorithm is proposed in order to adapt the DBS's trajectory when it encounters novel environments, by tuning a reinforcement learning (RL) solution. The meta-learning algorithm provides a solution that adapts the DBS in novel environments quickly based on limited former experiences. The meta-tuned RL is shown to yield a faster convergence to the optimal coverage in unseen environments with a considerably low computation complexity, compared to the baseline policy gradient algorithm. Simulation results show that, the proposed meta-learning solution yields a 25% improvement in the convergence speed, and about 10% improvement in the DBS' communication performance, compared to a baseline policy gradient algorithm. Meanwhile, the probability that the DBS serves over 50% of user requests increases about 27%, compared to the baseline policy gradient algorithm.},

abstract={In this paper we present a novel framework for geolocalizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using only their onboard camera. The framework exploits the abundance of satellite imagery, along with established computer vision and deep learning methods, to locate the UAV in a satellite imagery map. It utilizes the contextual information extracted from the scene to attain increased geolocalization accuracy and enable navigation without the use of a Global Positioning System (GPS), which is advantageous in GPS-denied environments and provides additional enhancement to existing GPS-based systems. The framework inputs two images at a time, one captured using a UAV-mounted downlooking camera, and the other synthetically generated from the satellite map based on the UAV location within the map. Local features are extracted and used to register both images, a process that is performed recurrently to relate UAV motion to its actual map position, hence performing preliminary localization. A semantic shape matching algorithm is subsequently applied to extract and match meaningful shape information from both images, and use this information to improve localization accuracy. The framework is evaluated on two different datasets representing different geographical regions. Obtained results demonstrate the viability of proposed method and that the utilization of visual information can offer a promising approach for unconstrained UAV navigation and enable the aerial platform to be self-aware of its surroundings thus opening up new application domains or enhancing existing ones.},

The software AnyLogic was used to build simulation environment and agent model under the specific case of helicopters attacking armored targets.

The simulation result is consistent with the actual situation, and the reference value and effectiveness of the method are verified.},

Our approach is based on localization data and simple sparse range data to train the intelligent agent. We based our approach in two state-of-the-art Deep- Rl techniques for terrestrial robot: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC). We compare the performance with a classic geometric-based tracking controller for mapless navigation of UAVs. Based on experimental results, we conclude that Deep- Rl algorithms are effective to perform mapless navigation and obstacle avoidance for UAVs. Our vehicle successfully performed two proposed tasks, reaching the desired goal and outperforming the geometric-based tracking controller on the obstacle avoiding capability.},

abstract={As the usage of drones increases, attack vectors to exploit the vulnerabilities increases as well; particularly in commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi based drones. Hence, drones must be carefully evaluated and selected before deployment in the field. Penetration testing is a way to assess the vulnerabilities of drones, but it may require multiple commands, files or scripts and tools to generate and store the results. Many of these existing techniques and tools are dependent on human control and intervention. In this paper, we propose a Drone Pen-testing tool, which has integrated resources to conduct, organize the penetration tests and store the results. The tool has 3 main operation modes-Admin mode, User Mode and Machine learning mode. In Machine learning mode, the tool passively collects the network traffic from Wi-Fi drone access points for 60 seconds. The collected network traffic (in a pcap file) is used to analyze the IEEE 802.11 b/g/n protocol stack to identify a specific target among the surrounding Wi-Fi drones. This feature helps the user to launch a targeted attack quickly for a particular type of drone when the surrounding has many active drones. The paper explains the features of the scalable and easy to use, GUI (Graphical User Interface) based framework including details of its machine learning mode.},

abstract={This paper presents learning on the fly (LoF), a two-stage online framework to predict the achievable application-layer throughput in the downlink data communication from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to a ground access point. LoF is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN). While the UAV is flying, LoF trains the RNN with constantly observed throughput and in the meantime, makes throughput predictions for the near future. Both the training and prediction can concurrently run on a non-GPU device at the network edge (e.g., on the UAV). To this end, we design LoF with a lightweight RNN architecture and a customized training process by weighted sampling on a sliding window. We implement LoF using PyTorch. Numerical results show that LoF is able to achieve an average prediction accuracy of 87.65%, outperforming existing approaches in the literature.},

abstract={In this paper, a quadrotor UAV dynamic model with the wind speed factor is established and sliding mode controllers are designed for attitude stabilization. Neural network and fuzzy control are proposed to improve the performance of anti-strong wind controller for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Uncertainty of dynamic model can be approximated by radical basis function (RBF) neural network, and fuzzy control can dynamically correct the coefficients of the symbol function during the state convergence process. The simulation results show that the neural network constructed in this paper can track the uncertainty of the model, combining sliding mode with fuzzy control maintains the advantages of fast response and robustness. At the same time, the chattering problem is greatly reduced, which guarantees the anti-strong wind requirements of UAV and improves the stability of the controllers.},
