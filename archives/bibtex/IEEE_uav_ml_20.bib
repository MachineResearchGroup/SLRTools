abstract={Landing is one of the difficult challenges for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In this paper, we propose a vision-based landing approach for an autonomous UAV using reinforcement learning (RL). The autonomous UAV learns the landing skill from scratch by interacting with the environment. The reinforcement learning algorithm explored and extended in this study is Least-Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) to gain a fast learning process and a smooth landing trajectory. The proposed approach has been tested with a simulated quadro copter in an extended version of the USAR Sim (Unified System for Automation and Robot Simulation) environment. Results showed that LSPI learned the landing skill very quickly, requiring less than 142 trials.},

abstract={With the development and popularity of multi-rotor UAVs, actuator fault diagnosis in multi-rotor UAVs has become more and more important. This paper proposes a deep-learning-based method to accurately locate actuator faults by using flight data of a real UAV. The proposed method splits the UAV's data into smaller pieces and then extracts features by one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), and explores internal connections of the UAV's time series data by adding the long short-term memory (LSTM). So, a hybrid CNN-LSTM model is developed for the fault diagnosis of actuator faults. Experiments show that the average accuracy of fault diagnosis of the hybrid CNN-LSTM model is 92.74%, which is better than that of other models, such as the CNN model, the LSTM model, and the deep neural network (DNN) model.},

abstract={Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled multi-access edge computing (MEC) has been introduced as a promising edge paradigm for the future space-aerial-terrestrial integrated communications. Due to the high maneuverability of UAVs, such a flexible paradigm can improve the communication and computation performance for multiple user equipments (UEs). In this paper, we consider the sum power minimization problem by jointly optimizing resource allocation, user association, and power control in an MEC system with multiple UAVs. Since the problem is nonconvex, we propose a centralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm to solve it. However, the centralized method ignores essential issues like distributed framework and privacy concern. We then propose a multi-agent federated reinforcement learning (MAFRL) algorithm in a semi-distributed framework. Meanwhile, we introduce the Gaussian differentials to protect the privacy of all UEs. Simulation results show that the semi-distributed MAFRL algorithm achieves close performances to the centralized MARL algorithm and significantly outperform the benchmark schemes. Moreover, the semi-distributed MAFRL algorithm costs 23$\%$ lower opeartion time than the centralized algorithm.},

abstract={Deep learning applications are rapidly advancing in agriculture, and phenotyping in particular. Identifying the locations of plant centers and counting are critical for assessing stand quality. Yet, its precise measurement after the emergence of plants is impractical in large-scale production fields due to the labor required. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning framework for detecting the centers and counting maize plants using high resolution georeferenced RGB data acquired from a UAV platform. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method over two dates. The obtained results show that the proposed method can efficiently identify the locations of plant centers, and thereby the plant counts, reducing both the manual field counting and human labeling required for image-based analysis.},

abstract={Asphalt roads are the basic component of a land transportation system, and the quality of asphalt roads will decrease during the use stage because of the aging and deterioration of the road surface. In the end, some road pavement distresses may appear on the road surface, such as the most common potholes and cracks. In order to improve the efficiency of pavement inspection, currently some new forms of remote sensing data without destructive effect on the pavement are widely used to detect the pavement distresses, such as digital images, light detection and ranging, and radar. Multispectral imagery presenting spatial and spectral features of objects has been widely used in remote sensing application. In our study, the multispectral pavement images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were used to distinguish between the normal pavement and pavement damages (e.g., cracks and potholes) using machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest. Comparison of the performance between different data types and models was conducted and is discussed in this study, and indicates that a UAV remote sensing system offers a new tool for monitoring asphalt road pavement condition, which can be used as decision support for road maintenance practice.},

abstract={The rising number of technological advanced devices making network coverage planning very challenging tasks for network operators. The transmission quality between the transmitter and the end users has to be optimum for the best performance out of any device. Besides, the presence of coverage hole is also an ongoing issue for operators which cannot be ignored throughout the whole operational stage. Any coverage hole in network operators' coverage region will hamper the communication applications and degrade the reputation of the operator's services. Presently, there are techniques to detect coverage holes such as drive test or minimization of drive test. However, these approaches have many limitations. The extreme costs, outdated information about the radio environment and high time consumption do not allow to meet the requirement competently. To overcome these problems, we take advantage of Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Q-learning to autonomously detect coverage hole in a given area and then deploy UAV based base station (UAV-BS) by considering wireless back-haul with the core network and users demand. This machine learning mechanism will help the UAV to eliminate human-in-the-loop (HiTL) model. Later, we formulate an optimisation problem for 3D UAV-BS placement at various angular positions to maximise the number of users associated with the UAV-BS. In summary, we have illustrated a cost-effective as well as time saving approach of detecting coverage hole and providing on-demand coverage in this article.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used in different scenarios. The need for intelligent and accurate recognition of targets using UAV-based radars is increasingly urgent. As unique information of targets, micro-Doppler characteristics have become an important basis for target recognition. For three typical ground targets including pedestrians, wheeled vehicles, and tracked vehicles, the micro-Doppler modulation of the UAV vibration on echo signals is analyzed first in this article. Second, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is adopted to suppress ground clutter and environmental noise. In order to decrease the computation and increase the contrast, all colored time-frequency diagrams of micro-Doppler signals are transferred into grayscale images. Third, a multilevel target recognition method based on the transfer learning of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) is proposed. The first-level recognition is designed to accurately distinguish pedestrians, wheeled vehicles, and tracked vehicles, while the purpose of the second-level of recognition is to determine the three states of pedestrians including stepping, walking, and jogging. At last, experiments are carried out using a designed Doppler radar to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results indicate that the method in this article not only avoids the complex feature extraction process, but also has higher accuracy and better robustness.},

abstract={Network slices for delay-constrained applications in 5G systems require computing facilities at the edge of the network to guarantee ultra-low latency in processing data flows generated by connected devices, which is challenging with larger volumes of data, and larger distances to the edge of the network. To address this challenge, we propose to extend 5G network slices with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) equipped with multi-access edge computing (MEC) facilities. However, onboard computing elements (CE) consume UAV's battery power thus impacting its flight duration. We propose a framework where a System Controller (SC) can turn on and off UAV's CEs, with the possibility of offloading jobs to other UAVs, to maximize an objective function defined in terms of power consumption, job loss, and incurred delay. Management of this framework is achieved by reinforcement learning. A Markov model of the system is introduced to enable reinforcement learning and provide guidelines for the selection of system parameters. A use case is considered to demonstrate the gain achieved by the proposed framework and discuss numerical results.},

year={2021},
volume={63},
number={1},
pages={19-29},
abstract={The datalink of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is vulnerable to external electromagnetic interference (EMI). The characteristic parameters of the EMI signal can be definitively detected by a developed monitoring platform mounted on the UAV, but it is impossible to determine the lost-link thresholds of the datalink in any state by experiment because the state of the datalink varies dynamically with the flight distance and the UAV's attitudes. In this case, whether a certain state of the UAV's datalink will be interrupted or not by the EMI cannot be evaluated. In this article, a method of EMI prediction for the UAV's dynamic datalink based on the Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed, two indicators, including the interfering frequency and the operation signal power of the datalink, are taken as the training inputs, and the lost-link thresholds of the datalink obtained by the EMI injection test are taken as the training targets. The results show that this method can effectively fit the training samples and determine a 95% confidence interval of the predictive outputs, which has a low predictive error, less than 2.2 dB. Compared with the methods of the layer recurrent neural network and support vector machine, the GPR method has higher predictive accuracy and a stronger generalization ability. Therefore, the detected EMI characteristic parameters can be used as new input samples to predict the lost-link thresholds in any condition. On this basis, the EMI margin can be calculated to evaluate the degree of the anti-EMI redundancy of the UAV's datalink, which can be used for the active adaptation of the UAV's datalink to EMI in the future.},

abstract={Due to their high maneuverability and flexible deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could be an alternative option for a scenario where IoT devices consume high energy to achieve the required data rate when they are far away from the terrestrial base station (BS). Therefore, this paper has proposed an energy-efficient UAV-assisted IoT network where a low altitude quad-rotor UAV provides mobile data collection service from static IoT devices. We develop a novel optimization framework that minimizes the total energy consumption of all devices by jointly optimizing the UAV’s trajectory, devices association, and respectively transmit power allocation at every time slot while ensuring that every device should achieve a given data rate constraint. As this joint optimization problem is non-convex and combinatorial, we adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) based solution methodology that effectively decouples it into three individual optimization sub-problems. The formulated optimization problem has transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP) where the UAV learns its trajectory according to its current state and corresponding action for maximizing the generated reward under the current policy. Finally, we conceive SARSA, a low complexity iterative algorithm for updating the current policy of UAV, that achieves an excellent computational complexity-optimality tradeoff. Numerical results validate the analysis and provide various insights on optimal UAV trajectory. The proposed methodology reduces the total energy consumption of all devices by 6.91%, 8.48%, and 9.94% in 80, 100, and 120 available time slots of UAV, respectively, compared to the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.},

abstract={This paper aims at designing high-data-rate swarm UAV networks with distributed beamforming capabilities. The primary challenge is that the beamforming gain in swarm UAV networks is highly affected by the UAVs’ flight altitude, their movements and the resulting intermittent link blockages, as well as the availability of channel state information (CSI) at individual UAVs. To address this challenge, we propose FlyBeam, a learning- based framework for joint flight and beamforming control in swarm UAV networks. We first present a mathematical formulation of the control problem with the objective of maximizing the throughput of swarm UAV networks by jointly controlling the flight and distributed beamforming of UAVs. Then, a distributed solution algorithm is designed based on a combination of Echo State Network learning and online reinforcement learning. The former is adopted to approximate the utility function for individual UAVs based on online measurements, by jointly considering the unknown blockage dynamics and other factors that affect the beamforming gain. The latter is used to guide the exploitation and exploration in FlyBeam. The effectiveness of FlyBeam is evaluated through an extensive simulation campaign. Results indicate that significant (up to 450%) beamforming gain can be achieved by FlyBeam. We also investigate the effects of blockages and UAV flight altitude on the beamforming gain. It is found that, which is somewhat surprising, higher (rather than lower) beamforming gain can be achieved by FlyBeam with denser blockages in swarm UAV networks.},

Next, a kinematic controller is designed in order to find a desired translational velocity; the information provided by the kinematic controller will be used in the design of a virtual controller wherein a desired rotational velocity will be determined such that the UAV's orientation converges to its desired value. Finally, the information from the observer, the kinematic controller, and the virtual controller are used in the design of a dynamic controller where NNs will be implemented to approximate uncertainties in the UAV's dynamics; the signals generated by the dynamic controller will ensure that the desired lift velocity and the desired rotational velocities are tracked. In all these designs, the effects of sampling errors are highlighted. Next, by designing an appropriate event-execution law, the sampling errors are shown to be bounded during the inter-event period. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed event-sampled controller will be demonstrated with simulation results.},

abstract={This paper proposes a cloud-assisted joint charging scheduling and energy management framework for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. For charging the UAVs those are extremely power hungry, charging towers are considered for plug-and-play charging during run-time operations. The charging towers should be cost-effective, thus it is equipped with photovoltaic power generation and energy storage systems functionalities. Furthermore, the towers should be cooperative for more cost-effectiveness by intelligent energy sharing. Based on the needs and setting, this paper proposes 1) charging scheduling between UAVs and towers and 2) cooperative energy managements among towers. For charging scheduling, the UAVs and towers should be scheduled for maximizing charging energy amounts and the scheduled pairs should determine charging energy allocation amounts. Here, two decisions are correlated, i.e., it is a non-convex problem. We re-formulate the non-convex to convex for guaranteeing optimal solutions. Lastly, the cooperative energy sharing among towers is designed and implemented with multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and then intelligent energy sharing can be realized. We can observe that the two methods are related and it should be managed, coordinated, and harmonized by a centralized orchestration manager under the consideration of fairness, energy-efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Our data-intensive performance evaluation verifies that our proposed framework achieves desired performance.},

abstract={A prerequisite for solving many agricultural problems is to accurately estimate the area affected by crop disasters and its severity rating. In this letter, we propose a pipeline to segment the drought area and distinguish the severity rating of the maize on RGB images accessed by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) through a semantic segmentation method based on deep learning. First, the ground truth is created through expert evaluation and visual interpretation with the aid of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The neural network structure that was used is based on U-Net. Some structural and parameter improvements on U-net were made using SE-ResNeXt-50 as the backbone with the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module. By using RGB images as the input of the neural network for training, the final trained network can work on RGB images captured by a consumer UAV. The experimental results showed that our pipeline achieved an F1-score of 0.9034 and a Jaccard index of 0.8287 on the test set.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) will open up new application fields in smart city-based intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), e.g., traffic management, disaster rescue, police patrol, etc. However, the broadcast and line-of-sight nature of air-to-ground wireless channels give rise to a new challenge to the information security of UAV-to-vehicle (U2V) communications. This paper considers U2V communications subject to multi-eavesdroppers on the ground in urban scenarios. We aim to maximize the secrecy rates in physical layer security perspective while considering both the energy consumption and flight zone limitation, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and the jamming power sent by the roadside unit (RSU). This joint optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), considering time-varying characteristics of the wireless channels. A curiosity-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is subsequently utilized to solve the above MDP, in which the agent is reinforced by an extrinsic reward supplied by the environment and an intrinsic reward defined as the prediction error of the consequence after executing its actions. Extensive simulation results show that compared to the DRL without intrinsic rewards, the proposed scheme can have excellent performance in terms of the average reward, learning efficiency, and generalization to other scenarios.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used to serve as aerial base stations to enhance both the coverage and performance of communication networks in various scenarios, such as emergency communications and network access for remote areas. Mobile UAVs can establish communication links for ground users to deliver packets. However, UAVs have limited communication ranges and energy resources. Particularly, for a large region, they cannot cover the entire area all the time or keep flying for a long time. It is thus challenging to control a group of UAVs to achieve certain communication coverage in a long run, while preserving their connectivity and minimizing their energy consumption. Toward this end, we propose to leverage emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for UAV control and present a novel and highly energy-efficient DRL-based method, which we call DRL-based energy-efficient control for coverage and connectivity (DRL-EC3). The proposed method 1) maximizes a novel energy efficiency function with joint consideration for communications coverage, fairness, energy consumption and connectivity; 2) learns the environment and its dynamics; and 3) makes decisions under the guidance of two powerful deep neural networks. We conduct extensive simulations for performance evaluation. Simulation results have shown that DRL-EC3 significantly and consistently outperform two commonly used baseline methods in terms of coverage, fairness, and energy consumption.},

abstract={The potential benefits of big data and machine learning techniques are yet to be fully realized in real-time, safety-critical applications like unmanned aerial vehicle control. This is because of challenges related to interpretation, error susceptibility, and resources requirements. Due to their robustness and reliability, traditional model-based design techniques still dominate this landscape. However, a growing body of research in adaptive control has demonstrated the potential benefits of merging these two distinct design philosophies. This article investigates the benefits of using a combination of machine learning techniques to automatically tune parameters within a strictly defined model predictive control architecture. Fast orthogonal search and finite action-set learning automata are used to tune model coefficients and objective function weights, respectively. The strategy is validated experimentally on an actual Quanser Qball2 quadcopter and through several simulations of a Parrot AR.drone. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves performance while reducing design effort.},

With the recent growth of computation power, it is feasible to use Deep Learning for real-time applications. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a powerful model for classifying image content, and are widely considered in the computer vision community to be the de facto standard approach for most problems. Current Deep learning approaches for image classification and object detection are designed and evaluated on lab setting human-centric photographs taken horizontally from a height of 1-2 meters. UAV images are taken vertically in high altitude; therefore the objects of interest are relatively small with a skewed vantage point which creates a real challenge in detection and classification of such images. Here we present a deep convolutional approach for classification of Aerial imagery taken by UAV. We applied our network on optical imagery taken with UAV RS-16 from Port Mansfield, TX. Experimental results in comparison with ground-truth show 93.6 % accuracy for UAV image classification.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted Internet-of-Things (IoT) system in a sophisticated three-dimensional (3D) environment, where the UAV’s trajectory is optimized to efficiently collect data from multiple IoT ground nodes. Unlike existing approaches focusing only on a simplified two-dimensional scenario and the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI), this paper considers a practical 3D urban environment with imperfect CSI, where the UAV’s trajectory is designed to minimize data collection completion time subject to practical throughput and flight movement constraints. Specifically, inspired by the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning approaches, we leverage the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to design the UAV’s trajectory and we present a TD3-based trajectory design for completion time minimization (TD3-TDCTM) algorithm. In particular, we set an additional information, i.e., the merged pheromone, to represent the state information of the UAV and environment as a reference of reward which facilitates the algorithm design. By taking the service statuses of the IoT nodes, the UAV’s position, and the merged pheromone as input, the proposed algorithm can continuously and adaptively learn how to adjust the UAV’s movement strategy. By interacting with the external environment in the corresponding Markov decision process, the proposed algorithm can achieve a near-optimal navigation strategy. Our simulation results show the superiority of the proposed TD3-TDCTM algorithm over three conventional non-learning based baseline methods.},

The parameters of the four exponential decay learning rate curves were selected to calculate the verb similarity (that is, four computational verb rules are constructed), then the verb similarity was used to derive the learning rate used for each round of optimization, finally, we trained the network with the obtained learning rate.

abstract={With high mobility, low cost and outstanding maneuverability properties, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm has attracted worldwide attentions in both academia and industry. Nevertheless, the complex and coherent characteristics of the intelligent cooperation of UAV swarm greatly restrict its wide application. The recent development of artificial intelligence provides new methodologies for intelligent cooperation of UAV swarm. However, these methods are resource-in-tensive that cannot be directly applied in the computation and storage constrained UAVs. In this article, we propose a novel digital twin (DT)-based intelligent cooperation framework of UAV swarm. In the framework, a digital twin model is established to reflect the physical entity (i.e., UAV swarm) with high-fidelity and monitors its whole life cycle. Next, the decision model that integrates a machine learning algorithm is built to explore the global optimal solution and controls the behaviors of UAV swarm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, a case study on intelligent network reconstruction is introduced, and simulation results are presented. Finally, a representative application provided by the framework is discussed.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in wireless communication, attracting intensive attentions. UAVs can not only serve as relays, but also serve as aerial base station for ground users (GUs). However, limited energy means that they cannot work for long and cover a limited area of services. In this paper, we investigate 2D UAV trajectory design and power allocation in order to maximize the UAV's service time and downlink throughput. Based on deep reinforcement learning, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for trajectory design and power allocation (TDPA) to solve the energy efficient and communication service quality problem. The simulation results show that TDPA can extend the service time of UAV, improve the communication service quality, and realize the maximization of downlink throughput, which are significantly improved compared with existing methods.},

abstract={Disaster management, search and rescue missions, and health monitoring are examples of critical applications that require object localization with high precision and sometimes in a timely manner. In the absence of the global positioning system (GPS), the radio received signal strength index (RSSI) can be used for localization purposes due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, due to the low accuracy of RSSI, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones may be used as an efficient solution for improved localization accuracy due to their agility and higher probability of line-of-sight (LoS). Hence, in this context, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) to enable a UAV (agent) to autonomously find its trajectory that results in improving the localization accuracy of multiple objects in shortest time and path length, fewer signal-strength measurements (waypoints), and/or lower UAV energy consumption. In particular, we first control the agent through initial scan trajectory on the whole region to 1) know the number of nodes and estimate their initial locations, and 2) train the agent online during operation. Then, the agent forms its trajectory by using RL to choose the next waypoints in order to minimize the average location errors of all objects. Our framework includes detailed UAV to ground channel characteristics with an empirical path loss and log-normal shadowing model, and also with an elaborate energy consumption model. We investigate and compare the localization precision of our approach with existing methods from the literature by varying the UAV's trajectory length, energy, number of waypoints, and time. Furthermore, we study the impact of the UAV's velocity, altitude, hovering time, communication range, number of maximum RSSI measurements, and number of objects. The results show the superiority of our method over the state-of-art and demonstrates its fast reduction of the localization error.},

To be specific, it solves a problem of how to find proper BSs position for multi-UAV as quickly as possible, and it also achieves the goal of maximizing the sum of downlink rates in a communication network. For this purpose, we design a geographical position information learning (GPI-Learning) algorithm to learn the GPI relationship between users and UAVs. This approach consumes less time by avoiding calculation of exact channels and fills a gap existed in the scenario of setting multi-UAV rapidly to serve multi-user. Without loss of generality, we apply GPI-Learning in different scenarios, such as changes in user number or area size. As for different area size, simulation reveals that a proper size is adequate to any smaller size on condition that the smaller size is included in training set. Numerical results witness the good performance of our proposed algorithm.},

abstract={In this paper, we have proposed an energy-efficient unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted Internet of things (IoT) network where a low altitude UAV is employed as a mobile data collector. We develop a novel optimization framework that minimizes the total energy consumption of all devices by jointly optimizing the UAV’s trajectory, device association and respective transmit power allocation at every time slot while ensuring that every device should achieve a given transmission rate constraint. As this joint optimization problem is nonconvex and combinatorial, we adopt reinforcement learning (RL) based solution methodology that effectively decouples it into three individual optimization problems. The formulated problem is transformed as a Markov decision process (MDP) where UAV learns its trajectory according to its current state and corresponding action aiming to maximize the reward under the current policy. Finally, we conceive state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA), a low complexity iterative algorithm for updating the current policy in the case of randomly deployed IoT devices which achieves good computational complexity-optimality tradeoff via numerical results. We find that the proposed methodology reduces the total energy consumption of all devices by 9.23%, 14.06%, and 15.87% in the case of 80, 100, and 120 available time slots of UAV respectively.},

The experiments carried out on two UAV datasets with a spatial resolution of 2-cm confirm the promising capability of the proposed method.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed as aerial base stations to support communication for the ground users (GUs). However, the aerial-to-ground (A2G) channel link is dominated by line-of-sight (LoS) due to the high flying altitude, which is easily wiretapped by the ground eavesdroppers (GEs). In this case, a single UAV has limited maneuvering capacity to obtain the desired secure rate in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. In this paper, we propose a cooperative jamming approach by letting UAV jammers help the UAV transmitter defend against GEs. To be specific, the UAV transmitter sends the confidential information to GUs, and the UAV jammers send the artificial noise signals to the GEs by 3D beamforming. We propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach, i.e., multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to maximize the secure capacity by jointly optimizing the trajectory of UAVs, the transmit power from UAV transmitter and the jamming power from the UAV jammers. The MADDPG algorithm adopts centralized training and distributed execution. The simulation results show the MADRL method can realize the joint trajectory design of UAVs and achieve good performance. To improve the learning efficiency and convergence, we further propose a continuous action attention MADDPG (CAA-MADDPG) method, where the agent learns to pay attention to the actions and observations of other agents that are more relevant with it. From the simulation results, the rewards performance of CAA-MADDPG is better than the MADDPG without attention.},

abstract={The traditional target detection is basically impossible in the air-to-ground scene with high complexity. The detection algorithm based on deep learning has become a research hotspot with its applicability and robustness. However, the small scale of target and the lack of feature information in such scenes will make it difficult for UAV to effectively detect targets. Consider all these, this paper improves the network structure of feature extraction layer, re-selects the scale and quantity of anchors by system clustering method, and optimizes the calculation of Focal loss based on RetinaNet. Through simulation test, the method improves the detection accuracy under the premise of ensuring accuracy. Further more, several experiments on the UAV platform show that the improved RetinaNet has higher detection accuracy.},

abstract={A tracking controller for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is developed to track moving targets in the presence of occlusion. The controller can track moving targets based on a bounding box of the target detected by a deep neural network using the you-only-look-once (YOLO) method. The features generated from the YOLO approach relaxes the assumption of continuous availability of the feature points for applications, which facilitates estimation using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) and the design of image-based tracking controller in this work. The challenge is that when occlusion is present, the bounding box of the moving target becomes unobtainable and makes the estimation diverge. To solve this, a motion model derived by quadratic programming is employed as a process model in the UKF, wherein the estimated velocity is implemented as a feedforward term in the developed tracking controller in order to enhance the tracking performance. Since no motion constraint is assumed for the target, the developed controller can be applied to track various moving targets. Simulations are used to demonstrate the performance of the developed estimator and controller in the presence of occlusion. Experiments are also conducted to verify the efficacy of the developed estimator and controller.},

abstract={In this paper, an interference-aware path planning scheme for a network of cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is proposed. In particular, each UAV aims at achieving a tradeoff between maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing both wireless latency and the interference caused on the ground network along its path. The problem is cast as a dynamic game among UAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on echo state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN architecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the network state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of time-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses the ESN to learn its optimal path, transmission power, and cell association vector at different locations along its path. The proposed algorithm is shown to reach a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium upon convergence. Moreover, an upper bound and a lower bound for the altitude of the UAVs are derived thus reducing the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves better wireless latency per UAV and rate per ground user (UE) while requiring a number of steps that are comparable to a heuristic baseline that considers moving via the shortest distance toward the corresponding destinations. The results also show that the optimal altitude of the UAVs varies based on the ground network density and the UE data rate requirements and plays a vital role in minimizing the interference level on the ground UEs as well as the wireless transmission delay of the UAV.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising candidate solution for data collection of large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we investigate a UAV-aided WSN, where cluster heads (CHs) receive data from their member nodes, and a UAV is dispatched to collect data from CHs. We aim to minimize the total energy consumption of the UAV-WSN system in a complete round of data collection. Toward this end, we formulate the energy consumption minimization problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem by jointly selecting CHs from clusters and planning the UAV's visiting order to the selected CHs. The formulated energy consumption minimization problem is NP-hard, and hence, hard to solve optimally. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, pointer network-A* (Ptr-A*), which can efficiently learn the UAV trajectory policy for minimizing the energy consumption. The UAV's start point and the WSN with a set of pre-determined clusters are fed into the Ptr-A*, and the Ptr-A* outputs a group of CHs and the visiting order of CHs, i.e., the UAV's trajectory. The parameters of the Ptr-A* are trained on small-scale clusters problem instances for faster training by using the actor-critic algorithm in an unsupervised manner. Simulation results show that the trained models based on 20-clusters and 40-clusters have a good generalization ability to solve the UAV's trajectory planning problem in WSNs with different numbers of clusters, without retraining the models. Furthermore, the results show that our proposed DRL algorithm outperforms two baseline techniques.},

In the system we consider, each UAV makes decisions based on local observations, and does not communicate with other UAVs. The algorithm trains a routing policy using an Actor-Critic neural network with multi-resolution observations, including detailed local information and aggregated global information based on mean-field.

abstract={Timing synchronization has a vital role in swarm drones' network (SDN) or a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network. Current timing synchronization methods focus on enhancing single-hop skews which remarkably improve timing synchronization precision at this level. The improper clock of the drone system can cause interference, affect spectrum precision and interrupt the operation of the transceiver. In the drones' network, master drones' (MD) neighbor drone's timing synchronization approaches like Reference Broadcast System (RBS) realize a good performance. However, the requirement of one super drone with a large number of broadcasts for RBS makes it unrealistic to use in some situations like SDN network situation. Appropriate study and adjustments are needed to have real timing synchronization by eliminating the clocks drift and enhancing the timing synchronization precision. Therefore, a new self-timing synchronization approach is proposed in this paper where several MD drones can autonomously generate swarm clusters. The cluster head (CH) instigates a timing synchronization procedure starting with intra-Swarm cluster timing synchronization. The intermediate drones (ID) are elected between two swarm clusters to synchronize all drones in line with the inter-swarm cluster timing synchronization approach. The proposed approach is distributed and flexible to achieve high timing synchronization precision. The paper proposes a novel self-timing synchronization approach for in large scale semi-flat SND network architecture. Self-timing synchronization is swarm cluster-based and applicable for a huge number of master drones in SDN. One is the intra-Swarm cluster where the timing synchronization procedure starts with the CH to synchronize all CM. Secondly, in the inter-swarm cluster timing synchronization, two clusters are synchronized via intermediate drone (ID). However, the simulations demonstrated that in many cases all CHs are synchronized by the synchronized CHs from intra-swarm cluster timing synchronizations; this increased the system throughput and synchronization delay to about 75% compared to what we planned to achieve. Moreover, the simulation results also proved that the achieved synchronization precision can be used for position estimation and prediction with high accuracy.},

In this paper, we propose an analytical method in predicting drone flying behavior based on the machine learning algorithm, which could be integrated into swarm behavior prediction. Radiofrequency (RF) signals emitted from the UAV are captured by software-defined radio (SDR) to form the time series data. By using conventional short-time Fourier transform (STFT), a time-frequency spectrum revealing the RF data energy distribution is obtained for analyzing the signal variance pattern formed by the two different types of UAV flying trajectory. The transformed time-frequency domain matrix would be applied in multiple machine learning classifier for telling the difference of different flying trajectory. The results present the applicability of using machine learning in predicting the flying features and modes of intruding UAV swarm.

abstract={This article proposes a controlling framework for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to integrate the modes of formation flight and swarm deployment over fixed and switching topologies. Formation strategies enable UAVs to enjoy key collective benefits including reduced energy consumption, but the shape of the formation and each UAV's freedom are significantly restrained. Swarm strategies are thus proposed to maximize each UAV's freedom following simple yet powerful rules. This article investigates the integration and switch between these two strategies, considering the deployment environment factors, such as poor network conditions and unknown and often highly mobile obstacles. We design a distributed formation controller to guide multiple UAVs in orderless states to swiftly reach an intended formation. Inspired by starling birds and similar biological creatures, a distributed collision avoidance controller is proposed to avoid unknown and mobile obstacles. We further illustrated the stability of the controllers over both fixed and switching topologies. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the framework.},

abstract={A novel framework is proposed for quality of experience driven deployment and dynamic movement of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The problem of joint non-convex three-dimensional (3-D) deployment and dynamic movement of the UAVs is formulated for maximizing the sum mean opinion score of ground users, which is proved to be NP-hard. In the aim of solving this pertinent problem, a three-step approach is proposed for attaining 3-D deployment and dynamic movement of multiple UAVs. First, a genetic algorithm based K-means (GAK-means) algorithm is utilized for obtaining the cell partition of the users. Second, Q-learning based deployment algorithm is proposed, in which each UAV acts as an agent, making their own decision for attaining 3-D position by learning from trial and mistake. In contrast to the conventional genetic algorithm based learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm is capable of training the direction selection strategy offline. Third, Q-learning based movement algorithm is proposed in the scenario that the users are roaming. The proposed algorithm is capable of converging to an optimal state. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithms show a fast convergence rate after a small number of iterations. Additionally, the proposed Q-learning based deployment algorithm outperforms K-means algorithms and Iterative-GAKmean algorithms with low complexity.},

abstract={The underwater communications have been challenged by the long propagation delay as well as the limited utilizable bandwidth. As a result, although the underwater UAV system can benefit many applications, the communication performance still works as a barrier for its wide adoption. This paper proposes the utilization of non-orthogonal frequency division multiple access to increase the efficiency of underwater UAV networks, which will ideally avoid the negative effect from long propagation time, but rise multiuser interference problem. To solve this problem, this paper model the multi-user interference as a non-cooperative game, and resort the multiagent reinforcement learning to approach the Nash Equilibrium. This method can avoid the a priori constraint of scenario information, which usually cannot be obtained in the underwater UAV communications. A simple but descriptive simulation has validated the feasibility of proposed method.},

abstract={This paper studies downlink communications in multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled wireless communication systems with co-channel interference, where multiple UAVs are employed as aerial base stations (BSs) to serve mobile users on the ground. Our goal is to maximize the average sum-rate throughput of all users over a finite time horizon via UAV dynamic movement and communication (including user association and power control) co-design. Different from conventional offline designs based on the ideal assumption that channel state information (CSI) is perfectly known ahead of the flight, here we consider more challenging scenarios that the UAV can only obtain the real-time CSI along its flight. To tackle the online movement and communication co-design problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), which can handle the problem of our interest with high-dimensional action space. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark schemes and baseline algorithms significantly.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) working as an aerial station can gather the instantaneous information to guarantee the low-latency communication for the smart grid network. In this paper, we firstly construct a practical model of the end-to-end delay with considering the bit-error-ratio (BER) requirement of the communication link, and optimize the UAV's trajectory to minimize the end-to-end delay between the UAV and the smart grid terminals, in which the critical-mission terminals (CMTs) or non-critical-mission terminals (NCMTs) send the individual information to the flying UAV. Although this non-convex problem is difficult to solve, we propose a trajectory design scheme based on Q-learning. To reduce the delay of CMTs, we design the different reward function for CMTs and NCMTs. The promising advantage of proposed scheme is that some NCMTs closed to CMTs may obtain the priority service to reduce the waiting delay. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme obtains almost 17% performance gain comparing to the benchmark schemes.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming an integral part of numerous commercial and military applications. In many of these applications, the UAV is required to self-navigate in highly dynamic urban environments. This means that the UAV must have the ability to determine its location in an autonomous and real time manner. Existing localization techniques rely mainly on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and do not provide a reliable real time localization solution, particularly in dense urban environments. Our objective is to propose an effective alternative solution to enable the UAV to autonomously determine its location independent of the GPS and without message exchanges. We therefore propose utilizing the existing 5G cellular infrastructure to enable the UAV to determine its 3-D location without the need to interact with the cellular network. We formulate the UAV localization problem to minimize the error of the RSSI measurements from the surrounding cellular base stations. While exact optimization techniques can be applied to accurately solve such a problem, they cannot provide the real time calculation that is needed in such dynamic applications. Machine learning based techniques are strong candidates to provide an attractive alternative to provide a near-optimal localization solution with the needed practical real-time calculation. Accordingly, we propose two machine learning-based approaches, namely, deep neural network and reinforcement learning based approaches, to solve the formulated UAV localization problem in real time. We then provide a detailed comparative analysis for each of the proposed localization techniques along with a comparison with the optimization-based techniques as well as other techniques from the literature.},

abstract={A synthetic air data system (SADS) is an analytical redundancy technique that is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and is used as a backup system during air data sensor failures. Unfortunately, the existing state-of-the-art approaches for SADS require GPS signals or high-fidelity dynamic UAV models. To address this problem, a novel synthetic airspeed estimation method that leverages deep learning and an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for analytical redundancy is proposed. Our novel fusion-based method only requires an inertial measurement unit (IMU), elevator control input, and airflow angles while GPS, lift/drag coefficients, and complex aircraft dynamic models are not required. Additionally, we demonstrate that our proposed temporal convolutional network (TCN) is a more efficient model for airspeed estimation than the renowned models, such as ResNet or bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Our deep learning-aided UKF was experimentally verified on long-duration real flight data and has promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, it is confirmed that our proposed method robustly estimates the airspeed even under dynamic flight conditions where the performance of conventional methods is degraded.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are widely utilized for video capturing, processing and transmission have to address jamming attacks with dynamic topology and limited energy. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based UAV anti-jamming video transmission scheme to choose the video compression quantization parameter, the channel coding rate, the modulation and power control strategies against jamming attacks. More specifically, this scheme applies RL to choose the UAV video compression and transmission policy based on the observed video task priority, the UAV-controller channel state and the received jamming power. This scheme enables the UAV to guarantee the video quality-of-experience (QoE) and reduce the energy consumption without relying on the jamming model or the video service model. A safe RL-based approach is further proposed, which uses deep learning to accelerate the UAV learning process and reduce the video transmission outage probability. The computational complexity is provided and the optimal utility of the UAV is derived and verified via simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly improve the video quality and reduce the transmission latency and energy consumption of the UAV compared with existing schemes.},

abstract={This paper aims at enabling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to flock and meanwhile perform navigation tasks in large-scale complex environments in a fully decentralized manner. By incorporating the insights of flocking control inspired by bird flocking in nature, the problem is structured as a Markov decision process and solved by deep reinforcement learning. In particular, coordination among agents is achieved by following a local interaction protocol that each agent only considers the relative position of the nearest two neighbors on its left side and right side. In addition, a flocking control-inspired reward scheme is designed for the emergence of flocking and navigation behaviors.

abstract={Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations (BSs) into terrestrial cellular networks has emerged as an effective solution to provide coverage and complement communication services in a fast and cost-effective manner. The three-dimensional (3D) trajectories of UAVs have a remarkable impact on the performance of such networks. On the other hand, UAVs are battery limited, and thus optimizing their energy consumption is of high importance. In this regard, we propose a novel trajectory design mechanism for rotary-wing UAV-BSs in 3D space to improve the energy efficiency of the network. In this approach, UAVs aim at maximizing an objective function which captures the tradeoff between energy consumption and throughput, while satisfying their ground users’ quality-ofservice requirements. Using reinforcement learning, we model our problem as a multi-armed bandit, and propose an upper confidence bound based algorithm to solve the problem. In our proposed mechanism, UAVs autonomously choose their velocities and update their locations adapted to the system conditions without requiring the prior and full knowledge of the system. Simulation results show that our proposed approach yields significant performance gains reaching up to 33∙85% in terms of improving the network throughput, and up to 95% of enhancing the energy efficiency compared to a learning based benchmark. Comparing to a non-learning based approach, our proposed approach improves the throughput and energy efficiency by 46∙61% and 110%, respectively.},

abstract={In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications, the UAV's limited energy supply and storage have triggered the development of intelligent energy-conserving scheduling solutions. In this paper, we investigate energy minimization for UAV-aided communication networks by jointly optimizing data-transmission scheduling and UAV hovering time. The formulated problem is combinatorial and non-convex with bilinear constraints. To tackle the problem, firstly, we provide an optimal algorithm (OPT) and a golden section search heuristic algorithm (GSS-HEU). Both solutions are served as offline performance benchmarks which might not be suitable for online operations. Towards this end, from a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) perspective, we propose an actor-critic-based deep stochastic online scheduling (AC-DSOS) algorithm and develop a set of approaches to confine the action space. Compared to conventional RL/DRL, the novelty of AC-DSOS lies in handling two major issues, i.e., exponentially-increased action space and infeasible actions. Numerical results show that AC-DSOS is able to provide feasible solutions, and save around 25-30% energy compared to two conventional deep AC-DRL algorithms. Compared to the developed GSS-HEU, AC-DSOS consumes around 10% higher energy but reduces the computational time from second-level to millisecond-level.},

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have been widely adopted to support complex target tracking tasks for military and civilian applications, especially in open and unknown environments. In practical cases, the moving trajectory of the target cannot be known to the UAVs in advance, which brings great challenges to UAVs to realize real-time and effective tracking. In addition, the limited tracking ability of a single UAV can hardly meet the requirements of a high tracking success rate. To deal with these problems above, this paper establishes a multi-UAV cooperative target tracking system. Besides, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm is designed to enable UAVs to make flight action decisions intelligently to track the moving air target, according to the past and current position information of the target only. To further increase the detection coverage of the UAV network when tracking, spatial information entropy is introduced to the reward designing in this algorithm. Simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm yields impressive target tracking performances, and significantly outperforms several common DRL baselines in terms of the tracking success rate. The convergence of the algorithm is also verified by the simulations.},

abstract={Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm has been increasingly studied to collect data from ground sensors in remote and hostile areas. A key challenge is the joint design of the velocities and data collection schedules of the UAVs, as inadequate velocities and schedules would lead to failed transmissions and buffer overflows of sensors and, in turn, significant packet losses. In this paper, we optimize jointly the velocity controls and data collection schedules of multiple UAVs to minimize data losses, adapting to the battery levels, queue lengths and channel conditions of the ground sensors, and the trajectories of the UAVs. In the absence of the up-to-date knowledge of the ground sensors’ states, a Multi-UAV Deep Reinforcement Learning based Scheduling Algorithm (MADRL-SA) is proposed to allow the UAVs to asymptotically minimize the data loss of the system under the outdated knowledge of the network states at individual UAVs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MADRL-SA reduces the packet loss by up to 54% and 46% in the considered simulation setting, as compared to an existing DRL solution with single-UAV and non-learning greedy heuristic, respectively.},

abstract={Classification of terrain images taken from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is presented in this work. The objective is to classify terrain into 5 types: building, green zone, car park, road and canal. The processing flow consists of stitching sets of 4 images to form large field of view images to covers the area of interest. The stitched images were then divided into grids, and each grid were manually labeled as one of the five terrain types. Feature extraction was performed on each grid, where the features consist of percentage of pixels whose color falls with in certain range in the HSV color space, the mean pixel value of each of the BG R channels separately, the mean pixel value of all the channels together, and the number of contours detected from binary images thresholded by simple thresholding and by Otsu's method. Three different classifiers were experimented with: k nearest neighbor, decision tree, and extra tree. Two different dataset were used for training the classifiers: raw dataset where the number of each type of grid were imbalanced due to the nature of the terrains in the area of interest, and an augmented dataset where we artificially increased the number of grids by random flips and rotation such that each class has exactly the same number of grids. A total of six stitched images were reserved for the test set. Experiment results show that best accuracy was achieved by extra tree with accuracy of 85.5%. The results also show that augmenting the training data did not improve the performance.},

This intent is encouraged and motivated with the advancement of related technologies such as the batteries capacity and size, radio transmitters' efficiency, robust and economy frame materials, new generation of microprocessors, and electrical motors technology. The UAVs have become applicable in civilian, military and across industries circumstances like remote sensing, mapping, traffic monitoring, storm tracking and forecasting, precision crop monitoring, aerial photography, unmanned cargo transport, law enforcement and border control surveillance, search and rescue, etc. In this context, the use of UAV for border protection is one of particular importance to the State of Libya from illegal immigrant and smuggling of the weapons. Libya geographical position, considered a transit point to Europe and lack off the security stability in recent years. Moreover, the length of the Libya border and the difficulty of the geographical terrain especially the Sahara in the south make it difficult for the Border Guard to monitor the border. The use of UAV is the best way to protect the borders, which has several advantages, notably cheap cost, suitable for desert climate, the quality of images taken by UAVs, with high.

abstract={In this paper, the problem of content caching and transmission is studied for a wireless virtual reality (VR) network in which cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) capture videos on live games or sceneries and transmit them to small base stations (SBSs) that service the VR users. To meet the VR delay requirements, the UAVs can extract specific visible content (e.g., user field of view) from the original 360° VR data and send this visible content to the users so as to reduce the traffic load over backhaul and radio access links. The extracted visible content consists of 120° horizontal and 120° vertical images. To further alleviate the UAV-SBS backhaul traffic, the SBSs can also cache the popular contents that users request. This joint content caching and transmission problem are formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users' reliability defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of each user satisfies the instantaneous VR delay target. To address this problem, a distributed deep learning algorithm that brings together new neural network ideas from liquid state machine (LSM), and echo state networks (ESNs) is proposed. The proposed algorithm enables each SBS to predict the users' reliability so as to find the optimal contents to cache and content transmission format for each cellular-connected UAV. Analytical results are derived to expose the various network factors that impact content caching and content transmission format selection. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields 25.4% and 14.7% gains, in terms of reliability compared to Q-learning and a random caching algorithm, respectively.},

pages={1250-1265},
abstract={In this article, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless network is considered in which a battery-constrained UAV is assumed to move towards energy-constrained ground nodes to receive status updates about their observed processes. The UAV's flight trajectory and scheduling of status updates are jointly optimized with the objective of minimizing the normalized weighted sum of Age of Information (NWAoI) values for different physical processes at the UAV. The problem is first formulated as a mixed-integer program. Then, for a given scheduling policy, a convex optimization-based solution is proposed to derive the UAV's optimal flight trajectory and time instants on updates. However, finding the optimal scheduling policy is challenging due to the combinatorial nature of the formulated problem. Therefore, to complement the proposed convex optimization-based solution, a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) is used to find the optimal scheduling policy. Since the state space of the MDP is extremely large, a novel neural combinatorial-based deep reinforcement learning (NCRL) algorithm using deep Q-network (DQN) is proposed to obtain the optimal policy. However, for large-scale scenarios with numerous nodes, the DQN architecture cannot efficiently learn the optimal scheduling policy anymore. Motivated by this, a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based autoencoder is proposed to map the state space to a fixed-size vector representation in such large-scale scenarios while capturing the spatio-temporal interdependence between the update locations and time instants. A lower bound on the minimum NWAoI is analytically derived which provides system design guidelines on the appropriate choice of importance weights for different nodes. Furthermore, an upper bound on the UAV's minimum speed is obtained to achieve this lower bound value. The numerical results also demonstrate that the proposed NCRL approach can significantly improve the achievable NWAoI per process compared to the baseline policies, such as weight-based and discretized state DQN policies.},

abstract={This paper studies the adaptive neural control (ANC)-based tracking problem for discrete-time nonlinear dynamics of an unmanned aerial vehicle subject to system uncertainties, bounded time-varying disturbances, and input saturation by using a discrete-time disturbance observer (DTDO). Based on the approximation approach of neural network, system uncertainties are tackled approximately. To restrain the negative effects of bounded disturbances, a nonlinear DTDO is designed. Then, a backstepping technique-based ANC strategy is proposed by utilizing a constructed auxiliary system and a discrete-time tracking differentiator. The boundness of all signals is proven in the closed-loop system under the discrete-time Lyapunov analysis. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed ANC technique is further specified based on numerical simulation results.},

abstract={Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying wireless communication platform have attracted much attention. Benefiting from the mobility, UAV aerial base stations can be deployed quickly and flexibly, and can effectively establish Line-of-Sight communication links. However, there are many challenges in UAV communication system. The first challenge is energy constraint, where the UAV battery lifetime is in the order of fraction of an hour. The second challenge is that the coverage area of UAV aerial base station is limited and the commercial UAV is usually expensive. Thus, covering a large target region all the time with sufficient UAVs is quite challenging. To solve above challenges, in this paper, we propose energy efficient and fair 3-D UAV scheduling with energy replenishment, where UAVs move around to serve users and recharge timely to replenish energy. Inspired by the success of deep reinforcement learning, we propose a UAV Control policy based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (UC-DDPG) to address the combination problem of 3-D mobility of multiple UAVs and energy replenishment scheduling, which ensures energy efficient and fair coverage of each user in a large region and maintains the persistent service. Simulation results reveal that UC-DDPG shows a good convergence and outperforms other scheduling algorithms in terms of data volume, energy efficiency and fairness.},

abstract={As a typical scenario in future generation communication network applications, UAV-assisted communication can perform autonomous data delivery for massive machine type communication (mMTC), where the data generated from Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be carried and delivered to the corresponding locations with no direct communication channels to the IoT devices. Wireless energy transfer technique can recharge the UAV when the system is in operation, assisting the UAV to continuously collect and deliver data. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) model to describe the energy and data transfer optimization problem for the UAV. To maximize the long-term utility of the UAV, the MDP model is solved by value iteration algorithm to obtain the optimal strategies of the UAV to collect data, deliver data, and receive transferred energy to replenish on-device battery energy storage. Furthermore, to tackle the issues of system state uncertainties, partially observable states, and large state space in UAV-assisted communication systems, we extend the MDP model and solve it by using a Q -learning and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) schemes. Simulations and numerical results validate that, compared with baseline schemes, the proposed MDP model with DRL based scheme can achieve better wireless energy and data transfer strategies in terms of the higher long-term utility of the UAV.},

abstract={The scenario considered in this paper is detecting small targets using an unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) equipped with a pan-tilt-zoom(PTZ) camera. We reviewed, compared and modified the state-of-the-art target detection algorithms. Different target detection algorithms have different advantages in terms of accuracy and time consumption. The contributions of this paper are that we obtained pictures using the UAV and created a dataset firstly, then a support vector machine(SVM) based classifier and a YOLO-based Neural Network have been designed to detect targets separately, and both algorithms are evaluated on the test dataset finally. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of traditional machine learning methods based on SVM and deep learning methods based on YOLO on target detection are analyzed through a series of experiments. Limited by the target area selection methods, machine learning methods based on SVM do not have a high detection accuracy. The deep learning method based on neural network focus on improving the accuracy of target detection, while slightly inferior in time consumption. In addition, we modified the YOLO network structure for the special scene of small objects detection in this paper. Experiments show that the modified network can reduce the time consumption and improve the accuracy of small target detection. In summary, different types of target detection methods should be selected and modified according to the practical application scenarios.},

abstract={In this paper, we aim to design a fully-distributed control solution to navigate a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as the mobile Base Stations (BSs) to fly around a target area, to provide long-term communication coverage for the ground mobile users. Different from existing solutions that mainly solve the problem from optimization perspectives, we proposed a decentralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework to control each UAV in a distributed manner. Our goal is to maximize the temporal average coverage score achieved by all UAVs in a task, maximize the geographical fairness of all considered point-of-interests (PoIs), and minimize the total energy consumptions, while keeping them connected and not flying out of the area border. We designed the state, observation, action space, and reward in an explicit manner, and model each UAV by deep neural networks (DNNs). We conducted extensive simulations and found the appropriate set of hyperparameters, including experience replay buffer size, number of neural units for two fully-connected hidden layers of actor, critic, and their target networks, and the discount factor for remembering the future reward. The simulation results justified the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art DRL-EC3 approach based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and three other baselines.},

The algorithm consists of adaptive submodularity and deep learning. The UAV learns the target distribution via the deep neural network.

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become an indispensable part of our intelligent society. Accurate UAV image geo-localization is fundamental in many applications such as search and rescue, precision agriculture, change detection. Previously, the UAV image geo-localization was usually calculated by photogrammetry method or by matching with the well-located reference images. The photogrammetry method relies heavily on the accuracy of the UAV positioning parameters, however, the construction and use of high-precision positioning equipment are expensive and difficult to be widely used. The method based on image matching requires good similarity between matching images, which is hard to be satisfied as the reference image and UAV image are heterologous. The existing methods are difficult to achieve accurate image geo-location on UAVs equipped with economical positioning devices. To address this issue, we propose a coarse-to-fine UAV image geo-localization pipeline. Firstly, we implement the coarse UAV image geo-localization by utilizing the UAV's position parameters. Then, a deep learning algorithm multi-stage Lucas-Kanade (MS-LK) is proposed to refine the UAV image geo-localization results iteratively. MS-LK can make full use of the UAV images' global texture. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two real UAV data sets. The results show that the proposed UAV image geo-localization method can promote the results of the traditional photogrammetry-based approaches.},

abstract={In this study machine learning methods were applied to RGB data obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to assess this effectiveness in vineyard classification. The very high-resolution UAV-based imagery was subjected to a photogrammetric processing allowing the generation of different outcomes: orthophoto mosaic, crop surface model and five vegetation indices. The orthophoto mosaic was used in an object-based image analysis approach to group pixels with similar values into objects. Three machine learning techniques-support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN)-were applied to classify the data into four classes: grapevine, shadow, soil and other vegetation. The data were divided with 22% (n=240, 60 per class) for training purposes and 78% (n = 850) for testing purposes. The mean value of the objects from each feature were used to create a dataset for prediction. The results demonstrated that both RF and ANN models showed a good performance, yet the RF classifier achieved better results.},

abstract={While in high demand for the development of deep learning approaches, extensive datasets of annotated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery are still scarce today. Manual annotation, however, is time-consuming and, thus, has limited the potential for creating large-scale datasets. We tackle this challenge by presenting a procedure for the automatic creation of simulated UAV image sequences in urban areas and pixel-level annotations from publicly available data sources. We synthesize photo-realistic UAV imagery from Google Earth Studio and derive annotations from an open CityGML model that not only provides geometric but also semantic information. The first dataset we exemplarily created using our approach contains 144 000 images of Berlin, Germany, with four types of annotations, namely semantic labels as well as depth, surface normals, and edge maps. Based on this specific case, we demonstrate the entire pipeline and give a comprehensive overview of technical obstacles and solutions. In experiments, we evaluated the quality of our dataset and its potential application in monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation using deep learning methods. To facilitate the creation of further datasets, we provide our source code along with the produced dataset at https://github.com/sian1995/largescaleuavdataset.},

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a well-known technique in the domain of Machine Learning (ML), which interacts with the environment and learning the knowledge without the requirement of massive priori training samples. Thus it is attractive to implement the idea of RL to support UAV tasks in unknown environments. This paper adopts an Adaptive and Random Exploration approach (ARE) to accomplish both the tasks of UAV navigation and obstacle avoidance.

abstract={This paper studies the problem of spectrum shortage in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network during critical missions such as wildfire monitoring, search and rescue, and disaster monitoring. Such applications involve a high demand for high-throughput data transmissions such as real-time video-, image-, and voice- streaming where the assigned spectrum to the UAV network may not be adequate to provide the desired Quality of Service (QoS). In these scenarios, the aerial network can borrow an additional spectrum from the available terrestrial networks in trade of a relaying service for them. We propose a spectrum sharing model in which the UAVs are grouped into two classes of relaying UAVs that service the spectrum owner and the sensing UAVs that perform the disaster relief mission using the obtained spectrum. The operation of the UAV network is managed by a hierarchical mechanism in which a central controller assigns the tasks of the UAVs based on their resources and determine their operation region based on the level of priority of impacted areas and then the UAVs autonomously fine-tune their position using a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the individual throughput and prolong their lifetime. We analyze the performance and the convergence for the proposed method analytically and with extensive simulations in different scenarios.},

abstract={Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with reduced sensing and communication capabilities can support potential use cases in different indoor environments such as automated factories or commercial buildings. In this context, we consider the problem of collision-free autonomous UAV navigation supported by a simple sensor. We propose a navigation system based on object detection and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that only exploits sensing data obtained by a monocular camera mounted on the UAV. Object detection is incorporated into DRL training to reduce flight time and to maximize the probability of avoiding both current and future crashes. Moreover, object detection also helps to remove the impact of wrong predictions from the deep network. When compared to schemes using traditional RL methods, the proposed framework not only leads to collision- free trips, but it also reduces flying times towards given destinations by 25%, and cuts down 50% of unnecessary turns.},

abstract={Navigation of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) in unknown environments is an active area of research for mobile robotics. A main hindering factor for UGV navigation is the limited range of the on-board sensors that process only restricted areas of the environment at a time. In addition, most existing approaches process sensor information under the assumption of a static environment. This restrains the exploration capability of the UGV especially in time-critical applications such as search and rescue. The cooperation with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can provide the UGV with an extended perspective of the environment which enables a better-suited path planning solution that can be adjusted on demand. In this work, we propose a UAV-UGV cooperative path planning approach for dynamic environments by performing semantic segmentation on images acquired from the UAV’s view via a deep neural network. The approach is evaluated in a car park scenario, with the goal of providing a path plan to an empty parking space for a ground-based vehicle. The experiments were performed on a created dataset of real-world car park images located in Croatia and Germany, in addition to images from a simulated environment. The segmentation results demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach in producing maps of the dynamic environment on demand and accordingly generating path plans for ground-based vehicles.},

abstract={Equipped with machine learning (ML) models, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms can execute various applications like surveillance and target detection. However, the connections between UAVs and cloud servers cannot be guaranteed, especially when executing massive data. Thus, traditional cloud-centric approach will not be suitable, since it may cause high latency and significant bandwidth consumption. In this work, we propose a federated learning (FL) framework via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for a UAV swarm which is composed of a leader-UAV and a group of follower-UAVs. Specifically, each follower-UAV updates its local model by using its collected data, and then all follower-UAVs form a NOMA-group to send their respectively trained FL parameters (i.e., the local FL models) to the leader-UAV simultaneously. We formulate a joint optimization of the uplink NOMA-transmission durations, downlink broadcasting duration, as well as the computation-rates of the leader-UAV and all follower-UAVs, aiming at minimizing the latency in executing the FL iterations until reaching a specified accuracy. Numerical results are presented to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can outperform some baseline strategies.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been pervasively applied to environmental monitoring, due to the advantages of low cost and flexible deployment of IoT enabled systems. In many large-scale IoT systems, accurate and efficient data sampling and reconstruction is among the most critical requirements, since this can relieve the data rate of trunk link for data uploading while ensure data accuracy. To address the related challenges, we have proposed an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled spatial data sampling scheme in this paper using denoising autoencoder (DAE) neural network. More specifically, a UAV-enabled edge-cloud collaborative IoT system architecture is first developed for data processing in large-scale IoT monitoring systems, where UAV is utilized as mobile edge computing device. Based on this system architecture, the UAV-enabled spatial data sampling scheme is further proposed, where the wireless sensor nodes of large-scale IoT systems are clustered by a newly developed bounded-size K-means clustering algorithm. A neural network model, i.e., DAE, is applied to each cluster for data sampling and reconstruction, by exploitation of both linear and nonlinear spatial correlation among data samples. Simulations have been conducted and the results indicate that the proposed scheme has improved data reconstruction accuracy under the sampling ratio without introducing extra complexity, as compared to the compressive sensing-based method.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted communications has attracted increasing attention recently. This paper investgates air-ground coordinated communications system, in which trajectories of air UAV base stations (UAV-BSs) and access control of ground users (GUs) are jointly optimized. We formulated this optimization problem as a mixed cooperative-competitive game, where each GU competes for the limited resources of UAV-BSs to maximize its own throughput by accessing a suitable UAV-BS, and UAV-BSs cooperate with each other and design their trajectories to maximize the defined fair throughput to improve the total throughput and keep the GU fairness. Moreover, the action space of GUs is discrete, while that of UAV-BS is continuous. To tackle this hybrid action space issue, we transform the discrete actions into continuous action probabilities and propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach, named AG-PMADDPG (air-ground probabilistic multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient). With well-designed rewards, AG-PMADDPG can coordinate two types of agents, UAV-BSs and GUs, to achieve their own objectives based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that AG-PMADDPG can outperform the benchmark algorithms in terms of throughput and fairness.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been deployed in virtually all tasks of enabling wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). To ensure sustainable energy support and timely coverage of terrestrial Internet of Things (IoT) devices, a UAV needs to continuously hover and transmit wireless energy signals to charge these devices in the downlink. Then, the devices send their independent information to the UAV in the uplink. However, it was noted that the majority of existing schemes related to UAV-enabled WPCN are mainly based on a single UAV and cannot meet the requirements of a large-scale WPCN. In this paper, we design a separated UAV-assisted WPCN system, where two UAVs are deployed to behave as a UAV data collector (UAV-DC) and UAV energy transmitter (UAV-ET), respectively. Thus, the collection of fresh information and energy transfer are treated separately at the level of the two corresponding UAVs. These two tasks could be enhanced by optimizing the UAVs' trajectories. For this purpose, we leverage a multi-agent deep Q-network (MADQN) strategy to provide appropriate UAVs' trajectories that jointly minimize the expected age of information (AoI), enhance the energy transfer to devices, and minimize the energy consumption of UAVs. Simulation results show that our system enhances the performance of our strategy significantly in terms of AoI and energy transfer compared with baseline methods.},

abstract={Railway track sleepers are the most critical component that serves as the backbone for other supplementary components. Frequent monitoring of sleepers ensures better railway track health conditions that ensure the safety of goods and passengers. Recently railway explored various monitoring possibilities based on UAV for the robust, cost effective, and efficient inspection of railway track components.

abstract={With the wide applications of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the civilian and military fields, its operational safety has drawn much attention. A series of fault detection methods are studied to avoid disasters. Due to the capabilities of strong feature extraction and massive flight data processing, the deep learning-based methods have received extensive attention. However, restricted by UAV airborne size, weight, and power consumption, a significant challenge is posed to deploy these complicated detection methods in the airborne application, which requires to run in real time. In this article, a fault detection model acceleration engine (FDMAE) for UAV real-time fault detection is realized under the airborne constraint. First, a high-performance detection model is designed based on stacked long short-term memory networks, and fault detection is achieved by a statistical threshold in this method. Second, a model pruning method based on principal component analysis is proposed to improve computing efficiency. Finally, the pruned fault detection method is optimized and integrated as a flexible acceleration engine through high-level synthesis and deployed on an airborne embedded computing platform based on a field-programmable gate array. Real UAV flight data are used to verify the proposed FDMAE. By comparing accuracy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, speed, and power consumption, the effectiveness of the FDMAE is proven.},
