abstract = {Hydroponic lettuce has been widely cultivated in plant factory and desiring for mechanical harvesting and packing. Sorting of hydroponic lettuce must be carried out before packing. Information perception and image processing of hydroponic lettuce is a crucial technology to develop a robotic sorting system. In this study, DeepLabV3+ models of deep learning technologies were employed with four backbones of ResNet-50, ResNet-101, Xception-65, and Xception-71 to design a vision system of segmenting abnormal leaves (yellow, withered, and decay leaves) of hydroponic lettuce. Two weights assignation methods, i.e., median frequency weights (MFW) and uniform weights (UW), were incorporated into DeepLabV3+ and compared for performance. Results showed that models trained by UW were better than that of MFW assignation method. ResNet-101 had the best segmentation performance in UW assignation method with pixel accuracy of 99.24% and mIoU of 0.8326. In terms of speed, ResNet-50 had the fast segmentation speeds with 154.0 ms per image. This study provided object detection methodology for automatic sorting device of hydroponic lettuce.}

The automation attempts to maximise precision and minimise human intervention in onsite progress monitoring. Such attempts have mainly focussed on exterior construction environments while there are significantly lesser number of studies on interior construction. This imbalance impedes automation of the onsite progress monitoring as a whole. Thus, the core intent of this study is to pave the way for advancing automated indoor progress monitoring by providing a systematic survey of extant literature. Main contributions of this survey include 1) presenting a full spectrum of CV-based approaches, tools, and algorithms adopted for indoor construction progress monitoring (ICPM) 2) portraying a succinct reference to the shortcomings, technical challenges, and scope limitations of the past studies on ICPM. The study then synthesises a readily usable agenda for hybridising CV with other data-driven technologies to improve automation in ICPM.}

The feasibility of neural network approximation of unknown system functions is guaranteed over practical compact sets. It is proved that all the signals are semiglobal uniformly ultimate bounded and the connections between the tracking error and the controller parameters are analyzed in detail.

In this paper, we introduce a weakly-supervised learning method to classify, localize and segment potato defects to automate the quality control task. A large and diversified image-level labeled dataset is created including potatoes from six different classes: healthy, damaged, greening, black dot, common scab and black scurf. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to achieve the classification task. Then, we leverage the discriminative regions that appear in the activation maps of the trained CNN to localize the classified defect. A coarse-to-fine segmentation method is proposed to obtain a more precise defect size. Based on this segmentation, a classification according to the severity of the defect is done, showing the importance of the segmentation phase. Experimental results demonstrate that CNN outperforms conventional classifiers. At a final stage, a multi-label multi-class dataset is used to evaluate the whole system, achieving an average precision of 0.91 and an average recall of 0.90.}

First, the pseudoinverse of the interaction matrix is approached by ELM which avoids the singularity of the interaction matrix effectively and is robust to interferences such as feature noises and camera calibration errors. Second, a reinforcement learning method, Q-learning, is adopted to adaptively adjust the servo gain in order to improve the convergence speed and stability. Compared with other methods, ELM has better generalization performance, faster operation speed and a unique optimal solution. Also, Q-learning has self-learning ability without experience in advance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulations and experiment on a 6-DOF robot with eye-in-hand configuration.}

For this purpose, we propose a set of models simulating the shaking camera motion in real-life applications, such as the hand-held shooting and shooting from unmanned aerial vehicles and moving platforms. First, the stationary video sequence is analyzed carefully. 3D camera path is built using the pseudo-disparity values between the consecutive frames based on the corresponding feature points. This high cost procedure permits to build a relatively smooth camera path in 3D space with the non-significant jitters. Second, the end-user chooses the duration, position, and type of shake and/or jitters in video sequence. Third, the desired simulation is implemented in wavelet domain. The distortions, such as displacements, rotations, and local/global blurring, are simulated depending on the chosen situation. We use the physically-based and sample models. In order to reach the ground-truth demonstration, we crop the original frames. If RGB-D video is available, then realistic perspective projections of shaking synthesized video can be created.}

abstract = {Codling moth (CM) is the most devastating global pest of apples with a huge potential impact on the post-harvest quality and yield of the product. Due to the small size of its larvae and potentially hidden behavior, simple visual inspection is ill-suited for accurate infestation detection. The characteristic vibro-acoustic signals of multiple behaviors of CM larvae such as chewing and boring were identified in a previous study. In this study, two different approaches were proposed to build on this previous work: multi-domain feature extraction with machine learning to show basic classification potential, and matched filter-aided classification to show the effects of preprocessing using the larval behavior templates. Additionally, low-intensity heat stimulation was applied to improve classification results by increasing the larvae’s hidden activity rate. The results indicated that the first approach led to accuracies as high as 97.47 % for an acoustic signal duration of 10 s, with heat stimulation improving classification rates to 98.96 % for the same interval. Finally, the matched filter-aided classification approach improved upon the heat stimulated results even further to obtain a 100 % accuracy on classifying the test set for a signal duration of 5 s. These findings suggest that the vibro-acoustic technique can be an adaptable tool for detecting CM infestation in apples and improve post-harvest classification quality in fruit.}

abstract = {Mobile robots are being increasingly deployed in fields where human intervention is deemed risky. However, in doing so, one of the prime concern is to prevent complete battery depletion which may in turn lead to immobilization of the robot during the mission. Thus, we need to carefully manage the energy available to explore as much of the unknown environment as feasible whilst guaranteeing a safe return journey to home base. For this, we need to identify the key components that draw energy and quantify their individual energy requirements. However, this problem is difficult due to the fact that most of the robots have different motion models, and the energy consumption usually also varies from mission to mission. It is desirable to have a generic framework that takes into account different locomotion models and possible mission profiles. This paper presents a methodology to unify the energy consumption models for various robotic platforms thereby allowing us to estimate operational range in both offline and online fashions. The existing models consider a given mission profile and try to estimate its energy requirements whilst our model considers the energy as a given resource constraint and tries to optimize the mission to be accomplished within these constraints. The proposed unified energy consumption framework is verified by field experiments for micro UGV and multi-rotor UAV test-beds operating under myriad of environmental conditions. The online model estimates operational range with an average accuracy (measured with respect to true range across multiple field trials) of 93.87% while the offline model attains 82.97%.}

Battery prognostics and health management (PHM) is a discipline that not only provides accurate, early, and online health diagnosis, but also guarantees a robust and precise prediction of the remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries, independent of the operating conditions. This paper attempts to develop a novel PHM methodology that addresses the points mentioned above. A large dataset including thirty-eight nickel manganese cobalt oxide battery cells is used. The battery cells have been tested under various test conditions to achieve different aging patterns. Afterward, the health indicators that describe the health trajectory of the battery are extracted from partial charging voltage curves. A recurrent neural network called nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input is developed to estimate battery state of health (SOH) based on the extracted health indicators. The estimated SOH is used as the prognostic feature to develop a remaining useful life of battery (RUL) prediction model based on the similarity-based model. The proposed methods are validated using untrained data. The results indicate that the proposed PHM methodology can estimate the SOH of untrained battery cells with a maximum RMSE of 0.61. The RUL of battery cells with different aging patterns can be predicted with a maximum absolute error of 110 cycles. It can be concluded that the proposed method has the advantages of high precision in the health diagnosis and prognosis of battery cells regardless of their aging patterns, simplicity, and generalization to untrained data. These advantages point out the feasibility of the proposed method for online prognostics and health management of lithium-ion batteries.}

Moreover, the (global) solution is valid for all the flight envelope, since it is based on a general nonlinear model.

Therefore, this choice lead to the development of new networking technologies between UAVs and ground control station.

However, they often contain gaps that result either from physical damage or from a range of image artefacts or data acquisition conditions. A clear understanding of those reasons, and accurate classification of gap-type, are critical for 3D geometry-based damage assessment. In this study, a methodology was developed to delineate buildings from a point cloud and classify the present gaps. The building delineation process was carried out by identifying and merging the roof segments of single buildings from the pre-segmented 3D point cloud. This approach detected 96% of the buildings from a point cloud generated using airborne oblique images. The gap detection and classification methods were tested using two other data sets obtained with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images with a ground resolution of around 1–2cm. The methods detected all significant gaps and correctly identified the gaps due to damage. The gaps due to damage were identified based on the surrounding damage pattern, applying Gabor wavelets and a histogram of gradient orientation features. Two learning algorithms – SVM and Random Forests were tested for mapping the damaged regions based on radiometric descriptors. The learning model based on Gabor features with Random Forests performed best, identifying 95% of the damaged regions. The generalization performance of the supervised model, however, was less successful: quality measures decreased by around 15–30%.}

In this paper, we propose an approach for identifying rust as a key technology in the rust removal process. Rust detection can be performed automatically by processing a sequence of camera images. For the utilization of the approach in practical applications, it is designed to be robust to variations in the conditions of rusted areas caused by the presence of working tools or rust powders in the images. A fuzzy force controller that replicates the human behavior during rust removal is designed to construct a visual servo control framework for the rust removal process.

The step by step investigations of classical and reactive approaches are made here to understand the development of path planning strategies in various environmental conditions and to identify research gap.

The navigation over static and dynamic condition is analyzed (for single and multiple robot systems) and it has been observed that the reactive approaches are more robust and perform well in all terrain when compared to classical approaches. It is also observed that the reactive approaches are used to improve the performance of the classical approaches as a hybrid algorithm. Hence, reactive approaches are more popular and widely used for path planning of mobile robot.

A self-organising map is used at the core of this value system and motion properties of the swarm entities are used as input. Unlike traditional approaches, this value system does not need in advance the precise characteristics of the intended behaviours. We examine the performance of this value system in a series of controlled experiments. Our results demonstrate that the value system can recognise multiple “interesting” structured collective behaviours and distinguish them from random movement patterns. Results show that our value system is most effective distinguishing structured behaviours from random behaviours when using motion properties of individual agents as input. Further variations and modifications to input data such as normalisation and aggregation were also investigated, and it was shown that certain configurations provide better results in distinguishing collective behaviours from random ones.}

abstract = {Nowadays, industrial robots have been widely applied for performing position-controlled tasks with minimum contact such as spot welding, spray painting, packing, and material handling; however, performing high-tolerance assembly tasks still poses a great challenge for robots because of various uncertainties of the parts to be assembled such as fixtures, end effector tools, or axes. From this perspective, the advancement of research and development has led to cutting-edge robotic technologies for industrial applications. To understand the technological trend of industrial robots, investigated the state-of-the-art robotic assembly technologies to identify the limitations of existing works and clarify future research directions in the field. This paper especially interested on typical peg-in-hole (PiH) assemblies, as PiH methods provide insights for further development of robot assemblies. The assembly control strategies for PiH operations is classified by based on the types and features of the assemblies, and the literature in terms of the contributions of these studies is compared to PiH assembly. Finally, the control strategies for robotic PiH assemblies are discussed in detail, and the limitations of the current robotic assembly technologies are discussed to identify the future direction of research for the control of robotic assembly.}

abstract = {A growing research axes in the field of artificial intelligence understudies the corporate behavior that emerges as a result of interactions among non-complex multi-agent robots and the potential of this behavior in providing sustainable solutions to the multi-source localization problem. While locating a single emission source or single target location has been treated extensively, there has been comparatively little emphasis on locating multiple target locations. Although some partial solutions to the general problem of localizing multiple emission sources do exist, they however are not integrated in an adhesive synergy and also lack clear recommended strategies to proceed with a search after a source/target is found. The missing piece of the multisource localization puzzle is the absence of theoretical foundations for progress (after a source is found), convergence, and termination of the search operational algorithm. Cooperation among multi-agents could be active (agents acknowledging each other) or inactive (agents oblivious of each other). In this paper, the authors investigate the potency of multi-objective optimization on a machine learning algorithm (the artificial neural network) for a swarm of robots by leveraging on their basic yaw and thrust actuators in order to achieve collaborative control (group behavior) amidst localization of multiple emission sources. The empirical results from our simulations are promising.}

abstract = {Environmental disasters such as flash floods are becoming more and more prevalent and carry an increasing burden to human civilization. They are usually unpredictable, fast in development and extend across large geographical areas. The consequences of such disasters can be reduced through better monitoring, for example using mobile sensing platforms that can give timely and accurate information to first responders and the public. Given the extended scale of the areas to monitor, and the time-varying nature of the phenomenon, we need fast algorithms to quickly determine the best sequence of locations to be monitored. This problem is very challenging: the present informative mobile sensor routing algorithms are either short-sighted or computationally demanding when applied to large scale systems. In this paper, a real-time sensor task scheduling algorithm that suits the features and needs of city-scale environmental monitoring tasks is proposed. The algorithm is run in forward search and makes use of the predictions of an associated distributed parameter system, modeling flash flood propagation. It partly inherits the causal relation expressed by a search tree, which describes all possible sequential decisions. The computationally heavy data assimilation steps in the forward search tree are replaced by functions dependent on the covariance matrix between observation sets. Taking flood tracking in an urban area as a concrete example, numerical experiments in this paper indicate that this scheduling algorithm can achieve better results than myopic planning algorithms and other heuristics based sensor placement algorithms. Furthermore, this paper relies on a deep learning-based data-driven model to track the system states, and experiments suggest that popular estimation techniques have very good performance when applied to precise data-driven models.

In recent years, various protocols have emerged for improving the adaptability between the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) of the transport layer and the mmWave communication system of the physical layer. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the performance, causes, and improvements of TCP over mmWave networks.

The paper presents a preliminary application of a new methodology to the problem of task assignment, for a large number of unmanned vehicles operating in a cooperative and coordinated fashion. The proposed methodology uses the general concept of Descriptor Functions, to establish a relationship between tasks, their priority, and agents or groups of agents forming a large interconnected system. A bio-inspired model of the division of labor in colonies of social agents is used to derive a set of rules at the individual level that gives rise to agent specialization. Preliminary simulations show interesting results, and the potential of the proposed technique.}

It brings convenience to our society and sometimes requires real-time processing of dramatic data at the same time. However, traditional paradigm of computing on the center cloud can’t always meet such requirement, for the non-negligible time delay of data transmission and communication. Edge computing is a novel computing paradigm proposed to resolve such a problem. As a promising technology, it extends computing from cloud center to the edge of network. Edge computing has the advantage of low latency to achieve a shorter response time, as well as potential to address the concerns of energy consuming, bandwidth burden and security issue. In this paper, we give a survey about edge computing from the aspect of methodologies, application scenarios and its role in Industrial Internet. Some open issues of edge computing are also introduced in this paper. At the end of the manuscript, a discussion about future direction is proposed. The shallow network algorithms such as broad learning system (BLS), which have achieved great improvement in computing efficiency, show an optimistic outlook in this area. We propose our conceive about future applications when shallow network methods like BLS are applied in edge computing and hope the paper will inspire research in relative directions.}

We have extended a Negative Imaginary (NI) consensus control approach to switch the formation shape of the robots whilst only using the relative distances between agents, in combination with those between agents and obstacles. All agents can automatically create a new safe formation to overcome obstacles, then restore the prototype formation once the obstacles are cleared. We address the oscillation and local minima problems, generated by existing algorithms, using a newly developed circle fitting approach. We also highlight the advantages of our proposed algorithms over the kinematic controller and the conventional Artificial Potential Field (APF) controller from both theoretical and experimental standpoints. Simulation and experimental results are then analyzed to validate the feasibility of our proposed approach.}

The resulting features are available in device memory and then can be fed into classifiers such as SVM, logistic regression and boosting methods for object recognition. It is possible to extract multiple features with better performance. The GPU accelerated image integral algorithm speeds up computations up to 35x when compared to the single-thread CPU implementation in a test bed hardware. The proposed framework allows real-time extraction of a very large number of image features from full-HD images (better than 30 fps) and makes them available for access in coalesced order by GPU classification algorithms.}

We also discuss grasping and manipulation methods in which knowledge of inertial parameters is exploited in various ways. We begin with a discussion of literature which investigates how humans estimate the inertial parameters of objects, to provide background and motivation for this area of robotics research. We frame our discussion of the robotics literature in terms of three categories of estimation methods, according to the amount of interaction with the object: purely visual, exploratory, and fixed-object. Each category is analysed and discussed. To demonstrate the usefulness of inertial estimation research, we describe a number of grasping and manipulation applications that make use of the inertial parameters of objects. The aim of the paper is to thoroughly review and categorise existing work in an important, but under-explored, area of robotics research, present its background and applications, and suggest future directions. Note that this paper does not examine methods of identification of the robot’s inertial parameters, but rather the identification of inertial parameters of other objects which the robot is tasked with manipulating.}

Even though previous studies for workspace safety monitoring using computer vision have been undertaken, weather-related conditions such as raindrops and snows affecting pan-tilt-zoom camera visibility have not been considered in depth. Developing a robust detector that is reliable in different weather conditions is a challenge for vision-based monitoring outdoor works in construction sites. This study proposes a deep learning-based real time one-stage instance segmentation model for monitoring systems and data augmentation methods to improve the detector's performance under five weather conditions: brightness, darkness, rainy, snowy, and foggy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model with weather augmentation outperformed the baseline model without augmentation by around 0.05 mAP05:95. Therefore, this work verified the applicability of the model for detecting and segmenting instances robustly in construction sites. This weather augmentation approach could be applicable to any type of vision-based monitoring system such as quality inspection, productivity assessment, schedule monitoring, and other work management as well as safety management affected by the different weather conditions. There are still room for the future researches in the development of fully autonomous vision-based monitoring systems in the applications mentioned.}

A distinctive feature in the IROS ADR and AlphaPilot competitions is that competing drones had to perform on-board processing only. Hence, along these years, teams have presented novel solutions for on-board processing based on a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), microcontrollers and embedded computers such as the Odroid or Intel Stick computers.

abstract = {Visual servoing allows accurate control of positioning and motion relative to a stationary or moving target using vision and is the subject of many studies. Most servoing gains for image-based visual servoing methods are selected heuristically or empirically so accuracy is affected. This study uses reinforcement learning to adaptively tune the proportional servoing gain over sequences of image based visual servoing, instead of using a constant gain. The system is used to control hovering and tracking for a stationary or slowly moving target. An image Jacobian matrix with four dimensions is constructed because a quad-rotor drone features under-actuated dynamics. The Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse method is usually used to calculate the inverse image Jacobian matrix, but this study uses a bagging approach to calculate the inverse kinematics. The desired velocity is obtained from time-varying image errors, which gives greater robustness. An adaptive method to calculate the servoing gain method is proposed, whereby the selection of an appropriate servo gain over time is regarded as a reinforcement learning problem. The proposed visual servoing control system is implemented and tested experimentally using a quad-rotor drone system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust and converges faster than other methods.}

Firstly, the behavior of cyclorotor principles in ascending and descending phases while in close distance to the ground was numerically studied. In addition, a second study phase was also conducted by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to train the obtained database of results obtained numerically to further interpret the operating conditions in ground effect. CFD results predict that the optimum operational status of cyclorotor in close-ground altitudes is 30° pitching oscillation and 200 rpm for rotating speed. The results are indicating that the vertical distance of the aircraft highly influences their efficiency and functionality in producing thrust. A wide range of parameters is assessed using ANN analysis in several flying altitudes from the ground take-off level up to a reasonable height in which still the ground effects are noticeable. These results strongly indicate that an active control of both pitching oscillation and rotation speed is essential in operating at the optimum desired state.}

These conditions are not left unexploited by modern agriculture that seeks to tackle the increased global food demand and the degradation of available resources. Indeed, the precision agriculture sector is flourishing assisted by outstanding innovations, like the UAVs, that can carry a plethora of sensors. It must be noted though that, despite the progress being achieved, several high-quality measurements still demand expensive, often pre-existing but heavy instruments, and meticulous time-consuming operations. The latter requirements are not always in-line with the flight duration and cargo weight limitations of a typical UAV. This gap is apparent when scientists have to apply precise thermal imagery methods to support actions like accurate plant inspection or early disease detection. In order to provide a satisfactory solution, an experimental electric robotic platform, mainly destined for spraying operations, was enhanced so as to improve its functions and to host a high-quality thermal/optical camera. This platform has been equipped with a set of complementary electronic systems so as to provide fluent and robust semi-autonomous remote monitoring operation. The overall layout is lightweight, eliminating soil compaction, reducing vibration and thermal footprint, guarantying almost non-invasive operation and image capturing at very low noise levels. The whole approach is targeting to combine innovative but easy-to-find assistive components of affordable cost in local markets, emphasizing the challenges towards a really functioning solution accompanied by detailed performance data. The overall study is targeting the rapidly growing robotic vehicles market. The proposed platform is following the modern sustainability objectives as it is fully electric and can be assisted by solar panels, for increased autonomy.

The Centralized Cloud Server (CCS) provides the facility to compute critical tasks at the central data server, but it consumes more time due to the distance between CSS and edge device. In this article, we discuss the advantages of edge computing over cloud computing to overcome latency and reliability issues in critical applications. Moreover, the idea of processing and analyzing massive applications at the edge comes up with the requirement of building intelligence at the edge to compute complex tasks within a negligible time. Edge intelligence offers intelligence at the edge to process large datasets for critical computations and to overcome storage issues. Also, the performance tolerant connectivity and low-speed rate issues with 4G and 5G can be solved using a 6G wireless network. The 6G connected edge intelligence application offers ultra-low-latency, security, and reliability mechanisms that could be helpful in COVID-19 pandemic situations. We have also discussed the demonstration of aforementioned massive application in the form of a case study on combating COVID-19 situations using 6G-based edge intelligence. The case study depicts the benefits of using 6G (latency: 10−100μs) over 4G (latency: <10ms) and 5G (latency: <5ms) communication networks. The proposed 6G-enabled scheme is compared against the traditional 4G and 5G networks to designate its efficiency in terms of communication latency and network mobility. Eventually, we then analyzed various open issues and research challenges in this emerging research area for future gains and insights.}

Based on a hydrogen-enriched Wankel rotary engine, multiple engine operations with variable excess air ratios, variable ignition timing, and variable hydrogen enrichment have been carried out a series of engine calibration tests in detail. After recording the required experimental data, three different methods, including quadratic polynomial, artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) are applied to construct a multi-objective regression model which gives a unique insight into the mathematical relationship between the engine performance and the operation and control parameters. For the ANN, the effect of the number of nodes in the hidden layer on the regression performance was discussed, and the weight values of the ANN was optimized using a genetic algorithm. For the SVM, the effects of the kernel function and three optimization methods on regression performance were discussed. The results indicated that the SVM exhibited the best fitting results among the three methods. The optimal R2 for brake thermal efficiency, fuel energy flow rate, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and unburned hydrocarbon is 0.9877, 0.9840, 0.9949, 0.9937, and 0.9992, respectively. It is highly recommended that the SVM method as a generic methodology may be a new direction for nonlinear control system modeling of the Wankel engine.}

abstract = {Sequences of decisions that occur under uncertainty arise in a variety of settings, including transportation, communication networks, finance, defence, etc. The classic approach to find an optimal decision policy for a sequential decision problem is dynamic programming; however its usefulness is limited due to the curse of dimensionality and the curse of modelling, and thus many real-world applications require an alternative approach. Within operations research, over the last 25 years the use of Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), known as reinforcement learning in many disciplines, to solve these types of problems has increased in popularity. These efforts have resulted in the successful deployment of ADP-generated decision policies for driver scheduling in the trucking industry, locomotive planning and management, and managing high-value spare parts in manufacturing. In this article we present the first review of applications of ADP within a defence context, specifically focusing on those which provide decision support to military or civilian leadership. This article’s main contributions are twofold. First, we review 18 decision support applications, spanning the spectrum of force development, generation, and employment, that use an ADP-based strategy and for each highlight how its ADP algorithm was designed, evaluated, and the results achieved. Second, based on the trends and gaps identified we discuss five topics relevant to applying ADP to decision support problems within defence: the classes of problems studied; best practices to evaluate ADP-generated policies; advantages of designing policies that are incremental versus complete overhauls when compared to currently practiced policies; the robustness of policies as scenarios change, such as a shift from high to low intensity conflict; and sequential decision problems not yet studied within defence that may benefit from ADP.}

abstract = {Damage detection is a fundamental measure to study the security status of infrastructure. But some key parts are so difficult to enter by manpower and equipment, making it extremely challenging to detect (e.g. the bottoms of small and medium bridges, urban underground culverts, etc.). Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic solution including two parts: a deep learning method and an unmanned surface vessel (USV) to efficaciously detect damage. For the detection algorithm, a novel anchor-free network, CenWholeNet, which focuses on center points and holistic information, is proposed. The attention mechanism was also introduced into the model innovatively and a parallel attention module (PAM) was put forward. Sufficient ablation experiments substantiate that PAM can enhance the representation capability of models with negligible computational overheads. For the smart device, a USV system without the global positioning systems (GPS) navigation is proposed, supporting real-time transmission of lidar and video information. The presented solution was applied to the inspection of a bridge group, which verified the effectiveness and applicability of the solution to complex projects. Furthermore, the results corroborate that, compared with the influential objective detection methods, such as Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5, CenWholeNet is more suitable for the detection of multiple diseases with variable slenderness ratios and complex shapes. Therefore, CenWholeNet is expected to become a new paradigm of intelligent damage detection for infrastructure.}

abstract = {The self-blast state of a glass insulator directly affects the safety and reliability of transmission lines. To address the insufficient generalization ability of existing detection methods for insulator self-blast states and the drawbacks of deep neural network structures, the theories of transfer learning and closed-loop control are drawn upon to provide an intelligent detection method for the self-blast states of glass insulators. The method proposed in this paper is based on stochastic configuration networks and a feedback transfer learning mechanism. First, to reduce the redundancy of convolutional kernels in the channel extent, the interleaved group convolution strategy is employed to reconstruct the convolutional layers of the Inception network. Second, in view of the different feature applicabilities of different glass insulator images and based on the adaptive convolution module groups, the data structure of the dynamic feature space of insulator images is built with a certain mapping relationship from global to local. Then, the discriminative measure index is used to evaluate the discriminative information of the feature space to enhance the interpretability of the compact feature spance. Third, the fully connected feature vector of the compact feature space is sent to stochastic configuration networks (SCNs), which have universal approximation property to establish the classification criteria of the self-blast states of insulator images with generalization ability. Finally, an imitation of human thinking patterns is employed that exhibits repeated deliberation and comparison. Consequently, based on generalized error and entropy theories, the evaluation index of the objective function is established to evaluate the uncertain detection results of the self-blast states of glass insulator images in real time. Then, the dynamic transfer learning mechanism is constructed based on the constraint of the measurement index of uncertain detection results to realize self-optimizing regulation of the feature space that exhibits multihierarchy and discrimination and reconstructed classification criteria. The experimental results show that compared with other algorithms, the proposed method enhances the generalization ability and detection accuracy of the model.}

In all the mentioned applications the accuracy and the fast response are the most important requirements, thus the research is focused on the design and the implementation of highly accurate hardware systems and fast sensor data fusion algorithms, named Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), aimed at estimating the orientation of a rigid body with respect to a reference frame. A large number of different solutions can be found in the literature, and an experimental comparison of the most popular is presented in this work. In particular, the algorithm based on the gradient descent method and the algorithm based on a nonlinear complementary filter are compared to a standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with the aim to show that a general method can easily compete with ad-hoc solutions and even outperform them in particular conditions. In order to validate the estimation accuracy a Kuka robot is used to compute the ground truth. Moreover, in order to estimate the computational burden, the algorithms are implemented on an ARM-Cortex M4-based evaluation board.}

In this regard, it is assumed that the non-legitimate agents manipulate the data of solar and wind sensors to deteriorate the safe operation. Here, a stochastic real-time procedure based on the observation-action method is utilized to simulate the behavior of attackers. Then, to improve the security and mitigate the impact of such a vulnerability, an integrated framework composed of offline and online units is designed. To construct the offline framework, a data mining process including k-nearest neighbour and support vector machine algorithms is implemented based on real historical data. Furthermore, the online framework tracks the real-time data according to a sensor pre-secured by a firewall. The results show that the proposed framework is capable to relieve the influence of cyber-physical attacks where at least 79% of success rate will be achievable under simultaneous false data injection attacks.}

With the rapid demands of various wireless applications, delay and energy efficiency are two fundamentally important aspects in the next-generation communication. A multi-objective Dyna-Q based routing (MODQR) approach to improve both delay and energy performances is proposed in this paper. For delay, the interference, asymmetrical link condition and probability of transmission failure (PTF) are considered. When deriving the PTF, the gray physical interference model is used. For energy, the ratio of consumed energy to energy capacity is used to monitor energy condition. Reinforcement learning is an effective way to solve the routing problem in a network with uncertain conditions. A path can be chosen by iterative exploration and exploitation. Dyna-Q is an effective reinforcement learning algorithm which can increase the convergence speed. To the best of our knowledge, Dyna-Q is used to solve the multi-objective routing problem for the first time. The path with least end-to-end delay and largest energy efficiency will be selected. Simulation results show that MODQR can obtain up to 80.97%, 83.48% and 86.15% better network performance than three other state-of-the-art routing methods.}

While there are numerous aircraft's conflict resolution approaches in the literature, almost all of them are based on flight dynamics to predict aircraft's future trajectories and generate a conflict resolution strategy by maneuvering and thus modifying flight paths. However, it is unclear how to analyze the current-day operations provided by air traffic controllers from the flight dynamics viewpoint. In this paper, we propose a data-driven resolution generator (D2RG) for air traffic control using machine learning, which guarantees safety. In the D2RG, a resolution strategy for a given conflict situation can be automatically synthesized based on the knowledge about the types and characteristics (or parameters) of resolutions managed by air traffic controllers, which is extracted from flight data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated with flight data from a multi-fidelity modeling and simulation system, and also tested with actual flight data to show its applicability to real scenarios.}

abstract = {This paper proposes an active fault-tolerant control strategy for a quadrotor helicopter against actuator faults and model uncertainties while explicitly considering fault estimation errors based on adaptive sliding mode control and recurrent neural networks. Firstly, a novel adaptive sliding mode control is proposed. In virtue of the proposed adaptive schemes, the system tracking performance can be guaranteed in the presence of model uncertainties without stimulating control chattering. Then, due to the fact that model-based fault estimation schemes may fail to correctly estimate fault magnitudes in the presence of model uncertainties, a fault estimation scheme is proposed by designing a parallel bank of recurrent neural networks. With the trained networks, the severity of actuator faults can be precisely estimated. Finally, by synthesizing the proposed fault estimation scheme with the developed adaptive sliding mode control, an active fault-tolerant control mechanism is established. Moreover, the issue of actuator fault estimation error is explicitly considered and compensated by the proposed adaptive sliding mode control. The effectiveness of the proposed active fault-tolerant control strategy is validated through real experiments based on a quadrotor helicopter subject to actuator faults and model uncertainties. Its advantages are demonstrated in comparison with a model-based fault estimator and a conventional adaptive sliding mode control.}

abstract = {A systematic review and inventory of recent research relating to optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation was conducted, and thematic and geographical trends were summarized. Research was broadly categorized into four major themes of (1) time series, including NDVI trends and shrub expansion; (2) disturbance and recovery, including tundra fires, winter warming, herbivory, permafrost disturbance, and anthropogenic change; (3) vegetation properties, including biomass, primary productivity, seasonality, phenology, and pigments; and (4) classification and mapping. Remaining challenges associated with remote sensing of Arctic vegetation were divided into three categories and discussed. The first are issues related to environmental controls including disturbance, hydrology, plant functional types, phenology and the tundra-taiga ecotone, and understanding their influence on interpretation and validation of derived remote sensing trends. The second are issues of upscaling and extrapolation related to sensor physics and the comparability of data from multiple spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. The final category identifies more philosophical challenges surrounding the future of data accessibility, big data analysis, sharing and funding policies among major data providers such as national space agencies and private companies, as well as user groups in the public and private sectors. The review concludes that the best practices for the advancement of optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation include (1) a continued effort to share and improve in situ-validated datasets using camera networks and small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (2) data fusion with non-optical data, (3) sensor continuity, consistency, and comparability, and (4) free availability and increased sharing of data. These efforts are necessary to generate high quality, temporally dense datasets for identifying trends in Arctic tundra vegetation.}

It is hence reasonable to expect emotion-based artificial agencies to better handle their complex and uncertain environments and their interactions with other known or unknown agencies. Accordingly, an emotional neural network is proposed here for multi-agent systems (MAS). This computational paradigm has the universal approximation property of its well-established predecessor, the multilayer perceptron, but also promises the characteristics of the emotional mind such as fast response and learning. Specifically, we extend our previously established radial basis emotional neural network (RBENN) to approximate the uncertain dynamics in a cooperative adaptive radial basis emotional neuro-controller (CARENC) for a class of higher-ordered uncertain nonlinear MAS. Artificial potential functions are used to describe the interactions among heterogeneous agents. Also, the approximation error is compensated using an adaptive component. Suitable update laws are derived for the weights of RBENN that are consistent with the basic emotional models. In following Lyapunov stability theory, the overall system stability is also guaranteed. Application to two nonlinear multi-agent control problems shows a lower steady-state tracking and lesser control energy consumption when compared with a competing multi-agent neuro controller.}

While this information is not globally available, it can be substituted by digital surface models (DSMs), automatically produced from inexpensive satellite imagery. However, stereo DSMs often suffer from noise and blur. Furthermore, they are heavily distorted by vegetation, which is of lesser relevance for most applications. Such basic models can be filtered by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on labels derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) and 3D city models, in order to obtain a refined DSM. We propose a modular multi-task learning concept that consolidates existing approaches into a generalized framework. Our encoder-decoder models with shared encoders and multiple task-specific decoders leverage roof type classification as a secondary task and multiple objectives including a conditional adversarial term. The contributing single-objective losses are automatically weighted in the final multi-task loss function based on learned uncertainty estimates. We evaluated the performance of specific instances of this family of network architectures. Our method consistently outperforms the state of the art on common data, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and generalizes well to a new dataset of an independent study area.}

Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, PEM Fuel Cell (PEMFC), storage tank, BLDC motor, and motor driver system are modeled and integrated into the Simulink environment in MATLAB. PEM electrolyzer that is energized from the AC grid via the AC/DC converter generates the hydrogen. This generated hydrogen is stored in the storage tank and used by PEMFC to energize to the BLDC motor. The model of the BLDC motor is controlled by using a closed-loop FOPI controller for the variable speed and torque reference values. Parameters of the FOPI are determined by Moth Swarm Algorithm (MSA) optimization method. It is observed from the results that the PEMFC powered FOPI controlled BLDC motor operates stably at high performance for different speed and torque values as expected from the modern drive systems. Furthermore, it is seen that the required energy for the BLDC motor is provided by the PEMFC-PEM electrolyzer system without interruption and the FOPI controlled BLDC motor successfully follows the reference speed values for the different torque values.}

To support the safety applications, both the ETSI ITS-G5 and IEEE 1609 standard families require each vehicle to deliver periodic awareness messages throughout the neighborhood. As the vehicles density grows, the scenario dynamics may require a high message exchange that can easily lead to a radio channel congestion issue and then to a degradation on safety critical services. ETSI has defined a Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) mechanism to mitigate the channel congestion acting on the transmission parameters (i.e., message rate, transmit power and data-rate) with performances that vary according to the specific algorithm. In this paper, a review of the DCC standardization activities is proposed as well as an analysis of the existing methods and algorithms for the congestion mitigation. Also, some applied machine learning techniques for DCC are addressed.}

The wavelet decomposition is used to extract the physical characteristics of the ICS. The KKT condition and the adjacent classification interval are adopted to reduce the training samples, improving the learning rate and system scalability. In addition, the designed boundary samples are employed for incremental learning, avoiding overfitting and reducing false positives rate (FPR).

In this paper, an integrated data-driven defense scheme is proposed, which can sensitively detect data integrity attacks such as false data injection (FDI) attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and replay attacks, and ensures secure transmission against eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, a novel deep learning model is designed so that both the online detection task and the encryption/decryption task can be completed under the same framework. The main idea is inspired by denoising auto-encoders whereas necessary changes are made to adapt to the challenges in the context of CPS attacks, and in light of this, the proposed approach is called modified denoising auto-encoder (MDAE). Unlike supervised classifier-based detectors, the proposed detector can retain sensitivity to unknown attacks because it is trained to learn the normal operation behavior. Moreover, to improve the detectability of the DoS and replay attacks on all data, the check code is designed. Encrypting the transmitted data through nonlinear mapping is achieved using the same MDAE, which prevents the attackers from recording useful information. Benefiting from the fact that the dimension of the variables is reduced after encryption, the transmission traffic can be saved. Simulation results on the measurement data instances generated by the IEEE 118-bus system validate the encryption effects and detection accuracy of the proposed scheme and show the superiority by comparison study.}

abstract = {Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been envisioned as an efficient solution to provide computation-intensive yet latency-sensitive services for wireless devices. In this paper, we investigate the optimal dynamic spectrum allocation-assisted multiuser computation offloading in MEC for overall latency minimization. Specifically, we first focus on a static multiuser computation offloading scenario and jointly optimize users’ offloading decisions, transmission durations and edge Servers’ (ESs) resource allocations. Owing to the nonconvexity of our joint optimization problem, we identify its layered structure and decompose it into two problems: a subproblem and a top-problem. For the subproblem, we propose a bisection search-based algorithm to efficiently find the optimal users’ offloading decisions and ESs’ resource allocations under a given transmission duration. Second, we use a linear search-based algorithm for solving the top-problem to obtain the optimal transmission duration based on the result of subproblem. Further, after solving the static scenario, we consider a dynamic scenario of multiuser computation offloading with time-varying channels and workload. To efficiently address this dynamic scenario, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based online algorithm to determine the near-optimal transmission duration in a real time manner. Numerical results are provided to validate our proposed algorithms for minimizing the overall latency in both static and dynamic offloading scenarios. We also demonstrate the advantage of our proposed algorithms compared to the conventional multiuser computation offloading schemes.}

PiNcH is built applying standard classification algorithms to the eavesdropped traffic, analyzing features such as packets inter-arrival time and size. PiNcH is fully passive and it requires just cheap and general-purpose hardware. To evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, we collected real communication traces originated by a drone running the widespread ArduCopter open-source firmware, currently mounted on-board of a wide range (30+) of commercial amateur drones. Then, we tested our solution against different publicly available wireless traces. The results prove that PiNcH can efficiently and effectively: (i) identify the presence of the drone in several heterogeneous scenarios; (ii) identify the current state of a powered-on drone, i.e., flying or lying on the ground; (iii) discriminate the movements of the drone; and, finally, (iv) enjoy a reduced upper bound on the time required to identify a drone with the requested level of assurance. The effectiveness of PiNcH has been also evaluated in the presence of both heavy packet loss and evasion attacks. In this latter case, the adversary modifies on purpose the profile of the traffic of the drone-RC link to avoid the detection. In both the cited cases, PiNcH continues enjoying a remarkable performance. Further, the comparison against state of the art solution confirms the superior performance of PiNcH in several scenarios. Note that all the drone-controller generated data traces have been released as open-source, to allow replicability and foster follow-up. Finally, the quality and viability of our solution, do prove that network traffic analysis can be successfully adopted for drone identification and status discrimination, and pave the way for future research in the area.}

Formal specification and verification of self-adaptive systems are tasks generally very difficult to carry out, especially when involving time constraints. In this case, in fact, the system correctness depends also on the time associated with events. This article introduces the Zone-based Time Basic Petri nets specification formalism. The formalism adopts timed adaptation models to specify self-adaptive behavior with temporal constraints, and relies on a zone-based modeling approach to support separation of concerns. Zones identified during the modeling phase can be then used as modules either in isolation, to verify intra-zone properties, or all together, to verify inter-zone properties over the entire system. In addition, the framework allows the verification of (timed) robustness properties to guarantee self-healing capabilities when higher levels of reliability and availability are required to the system, especially when dealing with time-critical systems. This article presents also the ZAFETY tool, a Java software implementation of the proposed framework, and the validation and experimental results obtained in modeling and verifying two time-critical self-adaptive systems: the Gas Burner system and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle system.}

Not surprisingly, due to the existence of various model uncertainties and environmental disturbances, robust and stochastic control-based methods have played a key role in G&C system design, and numerous effective algorithms have been successfully constructed to guide and steer the motion of space/aerospace vehicles. Apart from these stability theory-oriented techniques, in recent years, we have witnessed a growing trend of designing optimisation theory-based and artificial intelligence (AI)-based controllers for space/aerospace vehicles to meet the growing demand for better system performance. Related studies have shown that these newly developed strategies can bring many benefits from an application point of view, and they may be considered to drive the onboard decision-making system. In this paper, we provide a systematic survey of state-of-the-art algorithms that are capable of generating reliable guidance and control commands for space/aerospace vehicles. The paper first provides a brief overview of space/aerospace vehicle guidance and control problems. Following that, a broad collection of academic works concerning stability theory-based G&C methods is discussed. Some potential issues and challenges inherent in these methods are reviewed and discussed. Then, an overview is given of various recently developed optimisation theory-based methods that have the ability to produce optimal guidance and control commands, including dynamic programming-based methods, model predictive control-based methods, and other enhanced versions. The key aspects of applying these approaches, such as their main advantages and inherent challenges, are also discussed. Subsequently, a particular focus is given to recent attempts to explore the possible uses of AI techniques in connection with the optimal control of the vehicle systems. The highlights of the discussion illustrate how space/aerospace vehicle control problems may benefit from these AI models.

These videos usually with a larger view containing extensive construction equipment and richer environment information could help the supervisor know more about real-time status of the large-scale construction jobsite. However, due to numerous multi-scale objects, especially for small scale objects in the video, it is difficult to recognize each equipment intuitively, which is not conducive to ensuring jobsite security and guiding construction process. This study presents a real-time multi-scale equipment detection and localization model including the improving YOLOv3 for detection and the grey wolf optimizer improving extreme learning machine (GWO-ELM) for localization. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model are demonstrated via a real hydraulic-engineering megaproject. The experimental results show that the improving YOLOv3 has improved 4.8% mean average precision (mAP) over the multi-scale objects detection, especially, the significant improvements of 17.2% mAP and 13.3% recall at small scale objects detection while maintaining real-time. The improving YOLOv3 is proved robust under various environmental conditions on construction monitoring. Meanwhile, the mean absolute localization percentage errors of different scale objects are less than 1%, which indicates the accuracy and effectiveness of the model to assist supervisor in inspecting construction safety and process.}

In this paper, Japonica rice in northeast China is taken as the research object, and rice canopy hyperspectral data of key growth stages are obtained through plot experiments. Firstly, the standard normal variate (SNV) and SG smoothing method is used to preprocess the hyperspectral data, and based on the processed spectral data and ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO), an improved adaptive updating ant colony optimization algorithm (AU-ACO) is proposed to select feature bands of chlorophyll content by introducing an adaptive adjustment strategy of volatilization coefficient and optimal pheromone updating strategy in different stages, and compared with the standard ACO algorithm and full-band modeling method. Then, taking the extracted feature band and full-band as input, considering the advantages of linear model and nonlinear model, a hybrid prediction model (ELM-P) combining extreme learning machine (ELM) with partial least squares regression (PLSR) is proposed. In this model, PLSR is used to obtain the preliminary prediction of the chlorophyll content in rice, and the linear trend is obtained, and then the ELM with strong nonlinear approximation ability is used to predict the deviation of PLSR model, the final prediction value is obtained by superposition of the two outputs. In order to verify the superiority of the proposed model, PLSR and ELM prediction models are also established by taking the full-band and the feature bands by different extraction methods as input. The simulation experiment results show that under the same prediction model conditions, the feature bands extracted by proposed AU-ACO algorithm as input can reduce the complexity of the model and improve the prediction performance of the model. The determination coefficient (R2-P) of testing set and the determination coefficient (R2-C) of training set for each model are greater than 0.6785, among them, the ELM-P model with the feature band extracted by AU-ACO algorithm as input has the highest prediction accuracy, R2-C and R2-P are 0.7969 and 0.7918 respectively, RMSE-C and RMSE-P are 1.2969 and 1.1293 mg/L respectively, which can provide valuable reference for detecting and evaluating chlorophyll content in Japonica rice.}

AIS is a cooperative system that employs VHF transceivers to share vessel information through terrestrial and satellite communication networks. To track small boats not fitted with AIS, uncooperative surveillance systems are employed. These systems have been studied in a relatively small number of publications. In vessel behaviour pattern recognition, target classification is critically important, particularly, in asymmetric warfare situations.

In our approach, each member of the multi-agent team is assigned to at most one task from a set of spatially distributed tasks, while several agents can be allocated to the same task. The task assignment is dynamic since it is updated at discrete time stages (iterations) to account for the current states of the agents as the latter move towards the tasks assigned to them at the previous stage. Our proposed methods can find applications in problems of resource allocation by intelligent machines such as the delivery of packages by a fleet of unmanned or semi-autonomous aerial vehicles. In our approach, the task allocation accounts for both the cost incurred by the agents for the completion of their assigned tasks (e.g., energy or fuel consumption) and the rewards earned for their completion (which may reflect, for instance, the agents’ satisfaction). We propose a Greedy Coalition Auction Algorithm (GCAA) in which the agents possess bid vectors representing their best evaluations of the task utilities. The agents propose bids, deduce an allocation based on their bid vectors and update them after each iteration. The solution estimate of the proposed task allocation algorithm converges after a finite number of iterations which cannot exceed the number of agents. Finally, we use numerical simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed task allocation algorithm (in terms of performance and computation time) in several scenarios involving multiple agents and tasks distributed over a spatial 2D domain.}

A research framework and three novel indicators, Average Time Interval (ATI), Innovation Speed (IS) and Update Speed (US), are proposed to measure the pace of innovations in the field of AI. The results show that: (1) in 2019, more than 3 AI preprints were submitted to arXiv per hour, over 148 times faster than in 1994. Furthermore, there was one deep learning–related preprint submitted to arXiv every 0.87 h in 2019, over 1064 times faster than in 1994. (2) For AI players, 5.26 new researchers entered into the field of AI each hour in 2019, more than 175 times faster than in the 1990s. (3) As for AI updates (trial and error), one updated AI preprint was submitted to arXiv every 41 days, with around 33 % of AI preprints having been updated at least twice in 2019. In addition, as reported in 2019, it took, on average, only around 0.2 year for AI preprints to receive their first citations, which is 5 times faster than 2000–2007. This swift pace in AI illustrates the increase in popularity of AI innovation. The systematic and fine-grained analysis of the AI field enabled to portrait the pace of AI innovation and demonstrated that the proposed approach can be adopted to understand other fast-growing fields such as cancer research and nano science.}

abstract = {Billions of IoT devices lacking proper security mechanisms have been manufactured and deployed for the last years, and more will come with the development of Beyond 5G technologies. Their vulnerability to malware has motivated the need for efficient techniques to detect infected IoT devices inside networks. With data privacy and integrity becoming a major concern in recent years, increasing with the arrival of 5G and Beyond networks, new technologies such as federated learning and blockchain emerged. They allow training machine learning models with decentralized data while preserving its privacy by design. This work investigates the possibilities enabled by federated learning concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while preserving the participant’s privacy, show similar results as the centralized ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are still needed to make federated approaches robust.}

Restricted by the high cost of conventional full-covered lake field surveys and the large uncertainty of spatial prediction method that models lake underwater depths from the surrounding exposed terrains, the knowledge on lake bathymetry worldwide is scarce and inconsistent. This study aims to solve the problem by investigating how the optimized spatial prediction methods are developed by combining limited field survey data. Two methods, namely, the skeleton-based interpolation method that extends the exposed topography toward the lake underwater area with a constraint of field surveys, and the machine learning method (XGBoost) that establishes the decision rule between measured water depths and multiple geospatial variables to predict depths of unknown underwater areas, were developed and tested in twelve representative lakes in the Tibetan Plateau. Our results suggest that both methods can provide acceptable estimations of underwater topography by comparing with measured data, with the mean R2 of 0.70 approximately. The overall performance of the machine learning method (XGBoost) is more reliable, with the biases less than 20% in water volume estimates for all lake cases. In comparison, the skeleton-based interpolation method outperforms lakes in long and narrow shapes. This study is expected to provide an efficient approach for modeling lake bathymetry and to improve the monitoring capacity of freshwater mass changes, especially for ungauged lakes in harsh environments.}

abstract = {Inland streamflow estimation is essential in global water supply and environment protection. In data-scarce areas a highly efficient way of estimating streamflow is through remote sensing methods. However, high requirement of most previous methods on ground-measured data hinder their wide use in data-scarce areas. Therefore, this paper presented a new framework for estimation of streamflow in medium-to-small rivers with few ground measurements by using high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. A new Virtual Hydraulic Radius (VHR) method was proposed to complement AMHG (at-many-stations hydraulic geometry), a method not requiring any ground measurements when global parameters are used (global–AMHG) in large-scaled rivers but yielding great uncertainties in smaller scaled rivers, thus creating a VHR-AMHG method for medium-to-small rivers. The accuracy verification of the proposed method was performed by comparing it to field measurement data and the global parameters of the original AMHG (global–AMHG). Results showed that the root mean square error calculated from VHR-AMHG was 32.15 m3/s, while that from global–AMHG was 305.65 m3/s, indicating that the VHR-AHRG method yields a significantly higher accuracy for streamflow estimation for medium-to-small rivers. We found that regardless of the size of the river, AMHG is not applicable for rivers having excessively small b values in the equation w = aQb (low-b rivers). For medium-to-small rivers with b < 0.25, AMHG is not recommended. The accuracy of the original AMHG method is limited by the initial value of the model parameters and the condition that the congruent discharge (Qc) has to be within the range of observational discharge. The initial value setting of the model parameters significantly impacts the calculation accuracy. The VHR-AMHG method is able to overcome the deficiencies of the original AMHG, i.e. being overly dependent on the initial value setting with long-series known discharge data. It also eliminates the limitation of the Qc condition, as it achieves a higher accuracy for rivers in which Qc does not satisfy the condition compared to using global-AMHG on rivers that actually meet the condition, thus greatly expanding its usage scope. Thus VHR-AMHG method can provide detailed data on the spatial and temporal distribution of regional and national streamflow for governments and stakeholders, and offer scientific data support for wisely making water supply polices and sustainably protecting eco-environment.}

Technological advances have paved the way for last mile deliveries by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Yet, the limited range and capacity of UAVs remain a challenge. This makes the possibility of pairing drones with well-established means of transportation highly attractive. However, the optimization problem arising in joint delivery by truck and drone has only recently been considered in the literature. We develop a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) with two different time-oriented objective functions. Additionally, we introduce new valid inequalities based on problem properties to strengthen the linear relaxation. One type of valid inequalities is an extension of the well known subtour elimination constraints. As the number of these constraints grows exponentially with instance size, we provide a separation routine that identifies violated cuts in relaxed solutions to add them efficiently. We therefore derive the first branch-and-cut algorithm for the VRPD. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the competitiveness of our MILP formulation and to show the impact of different combinations of valid inequalities. We optimally solve instances with unrestricted drone ranges with up to 20 nodes and instances with range-limited drones with up to 30 nodes. These are significantly larger instance sizes than the previously known exact approaches are able to handle. In addition, we introduce a relaxation of the VRPD that provides good lower bounds in notable reduced run times. To provide managerial insights, we show that integrating truck-drone tandems into transportation systems can not only lead to improvements regarding the speed of deliveries, but can also be used to reduce the fleet size without slowing down the delivery process and increasing the workload of truck drivers.}

However, the popular pure optimization framework based on evolutionary algorithms only starts the compute-intensive optimization process after receiving the power demand, which causes significant delays To address this limitation, this research defines a novel dynamic economic emission dispatcher (DEEDer) problem and the dispatcher learning framework. It is different from previous research and the most current algorithms in the advantage of transferring the on-line compute-intensive optimization task to off-line. To solve the dispatcher, we model the dispatching process as a conditional deterministic Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose the multi-objective proximal policy optimization (MOPPO). The Benchmark Test Set with 10,000 different dispatching tasks for 5-unit and 10-unit system is released to evaluate the generalization of the dispatcher. The experiment results indicate that the neural network dispatcher trained with MOPPO is hundreds to thousands of times faster than the state-of-the-art pure optimization algorithms. Meanwhile, the dispatcher not only has comparable performance as the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms in standard dispatching task but also shows generalization on generating Pareto optimal solutions given any possible dispatching task. Following the DEEDer framework, the proposed method makes it possible to dispatch power in a more agile way as the timely response to the changing of power demand while still controlling economic and emission.}

In this study, ultrasonic-stationary shoulder assisted friction stir welding (U-SSFSW) was employed to join the dissimilar alloys of AZ31B Mg and 6061-T6 Al. Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) was used to model the relationships between the inputs of welding speed, rotating speed and ultrasonic power and the output of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of U-SSFSW joint.

abstract = {In this paper, a binary cooperative bat searching algorithm(BCBA) is developed to tackle binary optimization problems. Different from the original bat searching algorithm, a consensus term was added into the velocity equation of the original bat searching algorithm in the cooperative bat searching algorithm(CBA). To develop the binary algorithm, the velocity value is mapped into a probability value between zero and one, and then the position will update to one or zero depending on the comparison between the mapped velocity and a random number. In this paper, four different mapping functions are investigated to determine the best transfer function for the binary CBA. The numerical illustrations are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of BCBA by comparing with the four binary algorithms in the literature. Moreover, the leader–follower consensus problem of multi-agent systems is studied. The condition of the communication topologies of the leader–follower protocol is relaxed so that the different topologies can be used to share different state information. In order to find the trade-off between the convergence rate and communication cost, a binary variable optimal topology design problem is formulated, and then the BCBA is used to tackle the proposed design problem. The numerical evaluation is conducted to show the competitive performance of the BCBA.}

The proposed controller dynamically and synchronously compensates for aerodynamic variations of heave motion, enhancing disturbance-attenuation capability of the RUAV.

Traditional techniques to evaluate aromas are time-consuming, require special training, costly equipment, and trained personnel. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a portable, low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning modeling to predict aromas in beer. Nine different gas sensors were used i) ethanol, ii) methane, iii) carbon monoxide, iv) hydrogen, v) ammonia/alcohol/benzene, vi) hydrogen sulfide, vii) ammonia, viii) benzene/alcohol/ammonia and ix) carbon dioxide. Output data were assessed for significant differences using ANOVA and least significant differences as post hoc test (α = 0.05). Two artificial neural network (ANN) models were also developed to predict i) the peak area of 17 different volatile aromatic compounds (Model 1) obtained from gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) and ii) the intensity of ten sensory descriptors acquired from a sensory session with 12 trained panelists. Results from the ANOVA showed that there were significant differences between the samples used, which showed that the e-nose was able to discriminate samples. The resulting ANN models were highly accurate with correlation coefficients of R = 0.97 (Model 1) and R = 0.93 (Model 2). The combined method using the developed e-nose and the ANN models could be used by the industry as a low-cost, rapid, reliable and effective technique for beer quality assessment within the production line.

Extensive experiments on existing datasets and our aerial dataset show that Flounder-Net achieves FCN-level accuracy with three types of photograph devices: handheld cameras, surveillance cameras, and drone-based cameras.

Visual sensors, such as Charge-coupled Device (CCD), usually bring severe noise and unpredictable disturbances (including light differences, scene changes, etc.), thus it is necessary to find an adapted detection method to accommodate to the complex missions. Traditional detection model obtains feature characterization manually, which is laborious, time-consuming, mostly depending on researchers experience, and greatly increases the complexity of the recognition procedures. In this paper, we propose a target location strategy Kalman based SSD (K-SSD) utilizing convolution neural network (CNN) to improve the location accuracy and the speed of mobile robot during the automatic navigation. First, one frame of the entire scene is captured by a camera to construct an environment model. Then, a Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) model is trained offline using original images as model input, which can output classes corresponding with their own positions. Finally, we use the Kalman Filter to filter the Gaussian noise to improve the accuracy of location. In the experiments, we use the HUSKY UGV platform to verify the proposed strategy. The results indicate that this algorithm is capable of realizing the fast, robust and accurate posture detection for Gaussian noise and abnormal noise.}

This paper introduces a novel 3D object detection network called the Shape Attention Regional Proposal Network (SARPNET), which deploys a new low-level feature encoder to remedy the sparsity and inhomogeneity of LiDAR point clouds with an even sample method, and embodies a shape attention mechanism that learns the statistic 3D shape priors of objects and uses them to spatially enhance semantic embeddings. Experimental results show that the proposed one-stage method outperforms state-of-the-art one-stage and even two-stage methods on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark.

With the rapid development of imaging technology, computing power, and algorithms, computer vision has thoroughly revolutionized the plant phenotyping and is now a major tool for phenotypic analysis. Based on the above reasons, researchers are devoted to developing image-based plant phenotyping methods as a complementary or even alternative to the manual measurement. However, the use of computer vision technology to analyze plant phenotypic traits can be affected by many factors such as research environment, imaging system, research object, feature extraction, model selection, and so on. Currently, there is no review paper to compare and analyze these methods thoroughly. Therefore, this review introduces the typical plant phenotyping methods based on computer vision in detail, with their principle, applicable range, results, and comparison. This paper extensively reviews 200+ papers of plant phenotyping in the light of its technical evolution, spanning over twenty years (from 2000 to 2020). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including imaging technologies, plant datasets, and state-of-the-art phenotyping methods.

The significant drawback of supervised learning models is the need for vast amounts of manually labeled data (ground truth) for training. To overcome this limitation, unsupervised learning strategies without the requirement for ground truth have achieved extensive attention from researchers in the past few years. This paper presents a novel unsupervised framework for estimating single-view depth and predicting camera motion jointly. Stereo image sequences are used to train the model while monocular images are required for inference. The presented framework is composed of two CNNs (depth CNN and pose CNN) which are trained concurrently and tested independently. The objective function is constructed on the basis of the epipolar geometry constraints between stereo image sequences. To improve the accuracy of the model, a left-right consistency loss is added to the objective function. The use of stereo image sequences enables us to utilize both spatial information between stereo images and temporal photometric warp error from image sequences. Experimental results on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets show that our model not only outperforms prior unsupervised approaches but also achieving better results comparable with several supervised methods. Moreover, we also train our model on the Euroc dataset which is captured in an indoor environment. Experiments in indoor and outdoor scenes are conducted to test the generalization capability of the model.}

In this work, we use the position and orientation of the ground camera image to synthesize a corresponding rendered image from the outdoor large-scale 3D image-based point cloud. To achieve the virtual-real registration, we indirectly establish the spatial relationship between 2D and 3D space by matching the above two kinds (2D/3D space) of cross-domain images. However, matching cross-domain images goes beyond the capability of handcrafted descriptors and existing deep neural networks. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end network, Y-Net, to learn Domain Robust Feature Representations (DRFRs) for the cross-domain images. Besides, we introduce a cross-domain-constrained loss function that balances the loss in image content and cross-domain consistency of the feature representations. Experimental results show that the DRFRs simultaneously preserve the representation of image content and suppress the influence of independent domains. Furthermore, Y-Net outperforms the existing algorithms on extracting feature representations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain image retrieval. Finally, we validate the Y-Net-based registration approach on campus to demonstrate its possible applicability.}

The damage data collected using field surveys and satellite imagery are often not available immediately after a disaster while rapid information is crucial for time-sensitive decision makings. Some researchers turned to social media for real-time situational information of disaster damage. However, existing damage assessment research mostly focused on single data modality (i.e. text or image) and made coarse-grained predictions, which limited their practical applications in assisting city-level operations. The difficulties of retrieving useful information from vast noisy social media data have been outlined by many studies. Thus, we propose a data-driven method to locate and assess disaster damage with massive multimodal social media data. The method splits and processes two data modalities, i.e. texts and images, using two modules. The image analysis module uses five machine learning classifiers that are organized in a hierarchical structure. The text analysis module uses a keyword search-based method. They together mine various damage information including hazard types (e.g. wind and flood), hazard severities, damage types (e.g. infrastructure destruction and housing damage). The method is applied and evaluated with two recent hurricane events. In practice, the method acquires damage information throughout extreme events and supplements conventional damage assessment methods. It enables the rapid damage information access and disaster response for both first responders and the general public. The research effort contributes to achieving more transparent and effective disaster relief activities.}

abstract = {The importance of an optimal solution for disaster evacuation has recently raised attention from researchers across multiple disciplines. This is not only a serious, but also a challenging task due to the complexities of the evacuees’ behaviors, route planning, and demanding coordination services. Although existing studies have addressed these challenges to some extent, mass evacuation in natural disasters tends to be difficult to predict and manage due to the limitation of the underlying models to capture realistic situations. It is therefore desirable to have on-demand mechanisms of locally-driven computing and data exchange services in order to enable near real-time capture of the disaster area during the evacuation. For this purpose, this paper comprehensively surveys recent advances in information and communication technology-enabled disaster evacuations, with the focus on fog computation and communication services to support a massive evacuation process. A numerous variety of tools and techniques are encapsulated within a coordinated on-demand strategy of an evacuation platform, which is aimed to provide a situational awareness and response. Herein fog services appear to be one of the viable options for responsive mass evacuation because they enable low latency data processing and dissemination. They can additionally provide data analytics support for autonomous learning for both the short-term guidance supports and long-term usages. This work extends the existing data-oriented framework by outlining comprehensive functionalities and providing seamless integration. We review the principles, challenges, and future direction of the state-of-the-art strategies proposed to sit within each functionality. Taken together, this survey highlights the importance of adaptive coordination and reconfiguration within the fog services to facilitate responsive mass evacuations as well as open up new research challenges associated with analytics-embedding network and computation, which is critical for any disaster recovery activities.}

abstract = {Dykes play a major role in transporting magma through the crust to subsurface storage reservoirs or eruption sites at the surface. The geometry, connectivity, and internal textures of dykes preserve an important record of dyke emplacement, linkage, and magma flow dynamics. Unravelling these facets of dyke evolution is critical to interpreting signals of magma migration in active volcanoes as well as tectonic processes, including crust formation and continental break-up during hazard assessment. Unfortunately, our ability to develop new insights is limited by the continuity of high precision data that can be extracted from the field. The emergence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, a.k.a. drones), photogrammetry and other sensor techniques are set to greatly improve our field capabilities by collecting data at higher density and with greater precision. Here we present a workflow emphasising best-practise in UAV survey design, the construction of photogrammetric models and standardised reporting of those models. Emphasis is given to the factors that should be considered in order to resolve the geological features of interest in any study (e.g. wall rock fractures, chilled margins, magmatic breccias, dyke apertures etc.). A point-to-raster technique is documented that measures spatial error in the rasters that are derived from photogrammetric models (e.g. orthomosaics and digital elevation models). Using three case studies, we show how dyke swarms can be mapped accurately over areas approaching 1 km2, at sub-centimetre resolution. The data illustrate how questions about dyke-induced deformation, host rock controls on segmentation and aperture variation may be addressed, and we present a method for the high density, high precision measurement of dyke apertures in 3D. We also review semi-automated mapping tools and emerging UAV sensing techniques, including hyperspectral and aeromagnetic sensors, and the potentially important contributions they will make to the study of intrusive systems and volcanology more broadly.}
