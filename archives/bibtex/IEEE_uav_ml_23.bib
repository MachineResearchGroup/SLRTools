abstract={In this study, we applied reinforcement learning based on the proximal policy optimization algorithm to perform motion planning for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an open space with static obstacles. The application of reinforcement learning through a real UAV has several limitations such as time and cost; thus, we used the Gazebo simulator to train a virtual quadrotor UAV in a virtual environment. As the reinforcement learning progressed, the mean reward and goal rate of the model were increased. Furthermore, the test of the trained model shows that the UAV reaches the goal with an 81% goal rate using the simple reward function suggested in this work.},

abstract={With the promotion of economic globalization, the demand for air travel and maritime travel in all countries has increased significantly. However, the accompanying rate of accidents at sea is increasing rapidly year by year. After the accident, the survival rate of people is closely related to the speed of rescue. Artificial eyesight and radar electronic search and rescue (SAR) are limited due to inaccuracy and limited resources. The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology in recent years has made it possible to obtain stable, high-resolution images from airborne cameras. In this paper, a method of SAR using images captured by UAVs is proposed. The detection of victim is divided into two steps. First, in order to improve the system's real-time, the possible position of a victim may be located from the image through a simple feature to avoid exhaustive search. This step is called hypothesis generation (HG). Then, the pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to test the HG region to ensure the accuracy of the system. This step is called hypothesis verification (HV). The result shows that taking advantage of pre-processing + CNN has better comprehensive performance in SAR at sea.},

abstract={Vehicle detection from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery is one of the most important tasks in a large number of computer vision-based applications. This crucial task needed to be done with high accuracy and speed. However, it is a very challenging task due to many characteristics related to the aerial images and the used hardware, such as different vehicle sizes, orientations, types, density, limited datasets, and inference speed. In recent years, many classical and deep-learning-based methods have been proposed in the literature to address these problems. Handed engineering- and shallow learning-based techniques suffer from poor accuracy and generalization to other complex cases. Deep-learning-based vehicle detection algorithms achieved better results due to their powerful learning ability. In this article, we provide a review on vehicle detection from UAV imagery using deep learning techniques. We start by presenting the different types of deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and their contribution to improve the vehicle detection task. Then, we focus on investigating the different vehicle detection methods, datasets, and the encountered challenges all along with the suggested solutions. Finally, we summarize and compare the techniques used to improve vehicle detection from UAV-based images, which could be a useful aid to researchers and developers to select the most adequate method for their needs.},

abstract={In artificial intelligence applications, many sub-methods such as machine learning, artificial neural networks, classification, clustering algorithms are used. One of these methods is deep learning. Deep learning is an advanced machine learning class. Using the Deep Learning method, video analysis, image classification, speech recognition and natural language processing are very successful. The data and experiences to be provided by the projects covering Deep Learning and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles will increase the number of qualified studies on these issues and contribute to the development of high value-added products in these technologies. In this study, a control software that evaluates image data from unmanned aerial vehicles and makes various inferences (classification, positioning, marking) is created. By using the method of retraining the last layers of the pre-trained artificial neural network models with our data set, it has been tried to reduce the training time and increase the success. In these studies, 2 pre-educated models were used and as a result of training of these models, as a result of 190 thousand steps of training, 25.39 and 27.87 mAP values were reached.},

abstract={The path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is a critical component of rescue operation. As impacted by the continuity of the task space and the high dynamics of the aircraft, conventional approaches cannot find the optimal control strategy. Accordingly, in this study, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV path planning method is proposed, enabling the UAV to complete the path planning in a 3D continuous environment. The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed to enable UAV to autonomously make decisions. Besides, to avoid obstacles, the concepts of connected area and threat function are proposed and adopted in the reward shaping. Lastly, an environment with static obstacles is built, and the agent is trained using the proposed method. As has been proved by the experiments, the proposed algorithm can fit a range of scenarios.},

abstract={Cracks in concrete structure can lead to catastrophic damage if not addressed correctly at the right time. Although crack close to ground surfaces are easily addressable, however cracks on the surface of pillars of bridges, high-rise buildings and tall concrete structures are difficult to notice due to their heights and if left unaddressed can be risky and may lead to massive damage. Visual inspection is normally done to identify the cracks but it is time consuming and costly, it is also dangerous for specialists, and improper environments can cause evaluation errors. This paper proposes an efficient method of automatically detecting cracks by using Convolutional Neural Network with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle. The crack detection model was developed and trained from scratch and achieved a training accuracy of 98.60% and validation accuracy of 96.84% before transferring it to a raspberry pi 4 mounted on an Unmanned Arial Vehicle which was developed and tested with the model.},

abstract={Data traffic is increasing with the increasing number of smart devices. Also, base stations in some regions are suddenly overloaded only for a certain period (i.e., an amusement park on holiday). Thus, to handle this issue, we need to deploy more base stations, small-cell base stations. But those are not economical solutions. Hence, in this paper, we utilized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as temporary small-cell base-stations to solve the aforementioned problems. In this work, we proposed a cluster-based UAVs deployment scheme to reduce data traffic (such as video traffic) as well as service delays for the users and improve the coverage of base stations. First, we formed the user groups according to the distance of users with the help of the K-means clustering algorithm. Second, we find the optimal location to allocate the UAVs in each cluster. Third, we proposed a Long Short-Term Memory based caching scheme to cache popular contents on UAVs. Finally, the simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms than the other in terms of accessing delay and cache hit ratio.},

abstract={This paper proposes to examine the possible uses of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to aid the landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on a ship. Three distinct phases are proposed. The dataset required for training and testing was produced by simulating a ship's motion at sea using Unity. Phase 1 converts video images from a UAV on-board camera to numeric data. Phase 2 utilizes Phase 1 data and calculates the current relative orientation and distance of the UAV to the landing platform. Co-ordinate pairs representing screen positions of particular areas of a ship's landing pad were normalized and used to train the Phase 2 ANN. Orientation has been calculated to an accuracy of +/-1% and distance +/-2%. Phase 3 determines future landing windows. Phase 3 uses the orientations produced in Phase 2 and calculates future periods when a landing, within a time limit, could be attempted. This paper proposes strategies and current research into Phases 1, 2 and 3 and suggests development of an indicator of optimal landing times for Manned Aerial Vehicles (MAV).},

Firstly, the process of maximizing the average secrecy rate was modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP) without transition probability, and states, actions and reward function of UAV were defined. Secondly, UAV used the proposed algorithm to change its position through RL online learning and deep neural network offline training to find the optimal flight strategy in a battery cycle so as to maximize the average secrecy rate. Finally, the proposed algorithm was compared with the traditional algorithms, and the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the average secrecy rate when UAV is serving users and has faster convergence rate than Q-Learning algorithm.},

abstract={In this paper, we focus on the transition control of a ducted fan vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To achieve a steady transition from hover to high-speed flight, a neural-networks-based controller is proposed to learn the system dynamics and compensate for the tracking error between the aircraft dynamics and the desired dynamic performance. In prior, we derive the nonlinear system model of the aircraft full-envelope dynamics. Then, we propose a novel neural-networks-based control scheme and apply it on the underactuated aircraft system. Key features of the proposed controller consist of projection operator, state predictor and dynamic-formed adaptive input. It is proved and guaranteed that the tracking errors of both state predictor and neural-networks weights are upper bounded during the whole neural-networks learning procedure. The very adaptive input is formed into a dynamic structure that helps achieve a reliable fast convergence performance of the proposed controller, especially in high-frequency disturbance conditions. Consequently, the closed-loop system of the aircraft is able to track a certain trajectory with desired dynamic performance. Satisfactory results are obtained from both simulations and practical flight test in accomplishing the designed flight course.},

abstract={The planning of path for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is always considered to be a vital task. Path planning for UAV for avoiding the obstacle in its path can be accomplished by finding the solution for an optimization problem. Genetic Algorithm which is a global optimization tool can be of great use to solve the optimization problem for path planning of UAV. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) works well for function fitting quickly and can be used to approximate almost any function. The Genetic Algorithms are good at converging to the globally optimum solution generation by generation. Each generation is expected to be better than its previous generation. Neural Networks work faster than Genetic Algorithms for finding the solution to a given problem but may get converged to local optimum instead of global optimum. In this paper a new method for path planning for UAV to avoid obstacle coming in its path based on the combination of Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks has been proposed in which the output generated from the Genetic Algorithms is used to train the network of Artificial Neural Networks. The model for path planning is based on 3D digital map.},

abstract={Understanding the spatial patterns of plant communities is important for sustainable wetland ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV-borne hyperspectral data with high spatial resolution have become ideal for accurate classification of wetland plant communities. In this article, four dominant plant communities (Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis, Suaeda glauca, and Scirpus triqueter) and two unvegetated cover types (water and bare land) in the Momoge Ramsar wetland site were classified. This was achieved using UAV hyperspectral images and three object- and pixel-based machine-learning classification algorithms [random forest (RF), convolutional neural network (CNN), and support vector machine (SVM)]. First, spectral derivative analysis, logarithmic analysis, and continuum removal analysis identified the wavelength at which the greatest difference in reflectance occurs. Second, dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral images was conducted using principal component analysis. Subsequently, an optimal feature combination for community mapping was formed based on data transformation (spectral features, vegetation indices, and principal components). Image objects were obtained by segmenting the optimum object feature subsets. Finally, distribution maps of communities were produced by using three machine-learning classification algorithms. Our results reveal that object-based image analysis outperforms pixel-based methods, with overall accuracies (OAs) of 80.29-87.75%; RF has the highest OA of 87.75% (Kappa = 0.864), followed consecutively by CNN (OA = 83.31%, Kappa = 0.829) and SVM (OA = 80.29%, Kappa = 0.813). Phragmites australis dominates the plant community (55.9%) at the study area, followed by Typha orientalis (16.2%), Suaeda glauca (16.2%), and Scirpus triqueter (4.6%).

abstract={Renewable energies, carbon neutrality, and sustainable practices have become an important aim for many countries. Solar power generation has drawn much consideration where maintenance of solar panels is an essential task due to the natural and other mechanical circumstances. In this paper, we have proposed a deep learning (DL) approach for the detection of faults in solar panels. The proposed system uses an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a thermal camera and GPS for acquiring thermal images and localization of the fault in solar panels. An improved version of You only look once (YOLOv3-tiny) is employed as a DL model for the detection of the fault and then transmitted that information using Long-Term Evolution (LTE) to a remote server for visualization. The performance of the proposed model is compared with the current default YOLOv3-tiny, where high performance was achieved by the proposed DL model.},

abstract={The high voltage insulator requires continuous monitoring and inspection to prevent failures and emergencies. Manual inspections are costly as it requires covering a large geographical area where insulators are often subjected to harsh weather conditions. Automatic detection of insulators from aerial images is the first step towards performing real-time classification of insulator conditions using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). In this paper, we provide a cost-effective solution for detecting insulators under the conditions of an uncluttered background, varied object resolution and illumination conditions using You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep learning neural network model from aerial images. We apply data augmentation to avoid overfitting with a training set size of 56000 image samples. It is demonstrated experimentally that this method can accurately locate insulator on UAV based real-time image data. The detected insulator images are then successfully subjected to insulator surface condition assessment for the presence of ice, snow and water using different classifiers.},

abstract={Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been widely employed to support various Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile applications. By leveraging the advantages of easily deployed and flexibility of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), one of MEC primary functions is employing UAVs equipped with MEC servers to provide computation supports for the offloaded tasks by mobile users in temporally hotspot areas or some emergent scenarios, such as sports game areas or destroyed by natural disaster areas. Despite the numerous advantages of UAV carried with a MEC server, it is restricted by its limited computation resources and sensitive energy consumption. Moreover, due to the complexity of UAV-assisted MEC system, its computational resource optimization and energy consumption optimization cannot be achieved well in traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, the computational cost of the MEC system optimization is often exponentially growing with the increase of the MEC servers and mobile users. Therefore, it is considerably challenging to control the UAV positions and schedule the task offloading ratio. In this paper, we proposed a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to optimize UAV trajectory controlling and users' offloaded task ratio scheduling and improve the performance of the UAV-assisted MEC system. We maximized the system stability and minimized the energy consumption and computation latency of UAV-assisted the MEC system. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing work and has better scalability.},

abstract={Although location data of construction resources, such as materials, heavy machinery and workers, is one of the most critical keys to understand the context of construction site, most sites still rely on human-oriented observations to localize the resources. As one of techniques for collecting location data, RFID technology has been extensively studied. However, RFID requires multiple readers or a lot of manpower because RFID receiver is fixed or carried by human. It is infeasible in terms of time and cost in complex or large-scale construction sites. The aim of this study is to overcome the limitations of current approaches by proposing a localization method based on UAV-RFID integrated platform. With data from the platform, we applied a machine learning algorithm, k-nearest neighbors, to localize tags. Our method estimates the location of the tag with 94% accuracy. We have demonstrated the feasibility of the UAV-RFID integrated platform for construction site.},

abstract={Reinforcement learning brings flexibility and generality for machine learning, while most of them are mathematical optimization driven approaches, and lack of cognitive and neural evidence. In order to provide a more cognitive and neural mechanisms driven foundation and validate its applicability in complex task, we develop a basal ganglia (BG) network centric reinforcement learning model. Compared to existing work on modeling BG, this paper is unique from the following perspectives: 1) the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is taken into consideration. OFC is critical in decision making because of its responsibility for reward representation and is critical in controlling the learning process, while most of the BG centric models do not include OFC; 2) to compensate the inaccurate memory of numeric values, precise encoding is proposed to enable working memory system remember important values during the learning process. The method combines vector convolution and the idea of storage by digit bit and is efficient for accurate value storage; and 3) for information coding, the Hodgkin-Huxley model is used to obtain a more biological plausible description of action potential with plenty of ionic activities. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we apply the model to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) autonomous learning process in a 3-D environment. Experimental results show that our model is able to give the UAV the ability of free exploration in the environment and has comparable learning speed as the Q learning algorithm, while the major advances for our model is that it is with solid cognitive and neural basis.},

For actively and intelligently managing the charging towers, MADRL-based energy management system (EMS) is proposed and designed for energy trading among the energy storage systems those are equipped with charging towers. If the required energy for charging UAVs is not enough, the purchasing energy from utility company is desired which takes high consts.

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been a focus area of the academic and industrial research community. They have been used in many military and civilian applications. Emergency communication is one of the essential requirements for first responders and victims in the aftermath of natural disasters. In such scenarios, UAVs may configure ad hoc wireless networks to cover a large area. In UAV networks, however, localization and routing are challenging tasks owing to the high mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and limited energy of UAVs. Here, we propose swarm-intelligence-based localization (SIL) and clustering schemes in UAV networks for emergency communications. First, we propose a new 3-D SIL algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that exploits the particle search space in a limited boundary by using the bounding box method. In the 3-D search space, anchor UAV nodes are randomly distributed and the SIL algorithm measures the distance to existing anchor nodes for estimating the location of the target UAV nodes. Convergence time and localization accuracy are improved with lower computational cost. Second, we propose an energy-efficient swarm-intelligence-based clustering (SIC) algorithm based on PSO, in which the particle fitness function is exploited for intercluster distance, intracluster distance, residual energy, and geographic location. For energy-efficient clustering, cluster heads are selected based on improved particle optimization. The proposed SIC outperforms five typical routing protocols regarding packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and routing overhead. Moreover, SIC consumes less energy and prolongs network lifetime.},

Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which is composed of accelerometers, and gyroscopes, and separate magnetometer give data for the attitude position of the UAV to be known and maintain a steady flight. Attitude estimation can be done by various techniques such as using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to predict and estimate angular positions based on the sensor data. In this paper, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach is used to estimate the angular positions as an option for the EKF. A nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) is used to create the attitude estimation to investigate the performance compared to the EKF.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology is recognized as a promising solution to area coverage problems (ACPs) and has been extensively studied recently. In this paper, we study the 3D irregular terrain surface coverage problem with a hierarchical UAV swarm. We first build the 3D model of a random irregular terrain and propose a geometric way to project the 3D terrain surface into many weighted 2D patches. Then we develop a two-level hierarchical UAV swarm architecture, including the low-level follower UAVs (FUAVs) and the high-level leader UAVs (LUAVs). For FUAVs, we design a coverage trajectory algorithm to carry out specific coverage tasks within patches based on the star communication topology. For LUAVs, we propose a swarm deep Q-learning (SDQN) reinforcement learning algorithm to select patches. Moreover, an observation history model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the mean embedding method is integrated into SDQN to address the communication limitation problems of LUAVs. The numerical results show that FUAVs can cover the entire area of each patch with little redundancies, and the total coverage time of the SDQN is less than that of existing methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

abstract={With the development of intelligence in air confrontation, the demand for cooperative engagement of manned/unmanned aerial vehicle (MAV/UAV) is becoming more intense. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which combines the abstract representation capability of deep learning (DL) and the optimal decision-making and control capability of reinforcement learning (RL), is an appropriate application for dealing with this problem. In the case of continuous action space, the dynamics model of UAV and the basic structure of one of the most popular DRL methods called deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) are built firstly. To establish the framework of intelligent decision-making of MAV/UAV, typical intentions including Head-on attack, Fleeing, Pursuing and Energy-storing, corresponding to four optimization models, are introduced secondly. Then the neural network is trained by means of reconstructing the replay buffer of DDPG algorithm. Finally, simulation results show that UAV is able to learn intelligent decision-making throughout the intention guiding of MAV. Compared with original DDPG algorithm, the improved method can achieve a better performance in convergence and stability. Furthermore, the level of intelligent decision-making in air confrontation can be improved by self-learning.},

abstract={Nowadays, it is very important for the success of the determined missions or operations that the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which are used extensively in the performance of many civil and military tasks, follow the predetermined path with high accuracy at the determined altitude. The fact that the UAV performs its mission by adhering to the predetermined height and path enables the UAV to spend less energy and therefore fly for a longer time. Many traditional control algorithms, especially Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), are used in the attitude and altitude control of UAV for path following. Unlike other studies, in this study, metaheuristic optimization algorithms based on swarm intelligence estimate the parameters of the control algorithm proposed for UAV. Using meta-heuristic optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), both attitude and altitude control of the quadrotor have been performed for path following in routes with different geometries such as rectangle, circle, and lemniscate. The performance of each control algorithm in the study for the specified routes has been tested and the test results obtained have been compared with each other. Considering the features such as simplicity, flexibility, ability to search randomly and avoiding local optima, a new control algorithm whose KP, KI, and KD parameter values optimized by HHO, have been proposed for UAV's attitude and altitude control.},

A single UAV flight could observe the entire lake from an altitude of 100 m above the water surface with little disturbance to the roosting geese. We used a deep learning to automatically count geese in the imagery. The counting accuracy ranged from -7% to -3% in three validation cases compared with manual counts on the UAV image. We conclude that the combination of UAV and deep leaning methods can yield goose counts with an accuracy of ±15%.

abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, bringing great convenience to our lives and playing a pivotal role in future wireless networks and the Internet of things. One of the major problems associated with the UAV is the heterogeneous nature of such deployments; this heterogeneity poses many challenges, particularly in the areas of security and privacy. The key to solving these problems is to accurately identify and authenticate drones. In this article, a reliable UAV identify framework based on radio frequency fingerprint is proposed. First, we established a wireless signal label architecture and systematically collected, analyzed, and recorded the radio frequency signals of different UAVs in different flight modes and different distances in the telemetry link, and established UAV signal datasets. Then, the intelligent algorithm and anti-UAV system are designed by using the collected dataset, and the feasibility of the developed dataset for detecting and identifying UAVs is verified by using machine learning and deep learning. The simulation results show that under the condition of Gaussian white noise, the method based on deep learning achieves high reliability, and when the SNR is not less than 5dB, the model achieves more than 95% of the monitoring and recognition accuracy. Finally, we discussed the possible applications of the dataset in the future.},

abstract={Recently, Combining communication technology with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been regarding as one of the promising techniques in the future network. Various services can be served through UAV, such as information collection in disaster area or traffic monitoring in smart city. However, on-board computation resource and the battery lifetime of UAV are limited. For that reason, there is a limit to perform analysis, such as, machine learning using collected data. In this situation, UAV can get help from an adjacent Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server that has computing resources. However, the closest MEC server does not always guarantee optimal computing performance and communication efficiency. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose the overall system of machine learning based UAV to MEC computation offloading for data analyzing. First, we define the problems into two. Firstly, we define two problems 1) matching UAV and task cluster in consideration of energy efficiency. 2) Finding optimal MEC server to offload the task to minimize the total processing time and energy consumption. Then, we apply a machine-learning algorithm to solve the two problems. In the simulation section, we analyze the proposed method and greedy method in terms of total energy consumption and total processing time. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism is efficient in total energy consumption of UAV and total processing time of tasks.},

abstract={The aspect ratio of a target changes frequently during an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking task, which makes the aerial tracking very challenging. Traditional trackers struggle from such a problem as they mainly focus on the scale variation issue by maintaining a certain aspect ratio. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine deep scheme to address the aspect ratio variation in UAV tracking. The coarse-tracker first produces an initial estimate for the target object, then a sequence of actions are learned to fine-tune the four boundaries of the bounding box. The coarse-tracker and the fine-tracker are designed to have different action spaces and operating target. The former dominates the entire bounding box and the latter focuses on the refinement of each boundary. They are trained jointly by sharing the perception network with an end-to-end reinforcement learning architecture. Experimental results on benchmark aerial data set prove that the proposed approach outperforms existing trackers and produces significant accuracy gains in dealing with the aspect ratio variation in UAV tracking.},

abstract={In this paper, we consider a platform of flying mobile edge computing (F-MEC), where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serve as equipment providing computation resource, and they enable task offloading from user equipment (UE). We aim to minimize energy consumption of all the UEs via optimizing the user association, resource allocation and the trajectory of UAVs. To this end, we first propose a Convex optimizAtion based Trajectory control algorithm (CAT), which solves the problem in an iterative way by using block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Then, to make the real-time decision while taking into account the dynamics of the environment (i.e., UAV may take off from different locations), we propose a deep Reinforcement leArning based Trajectory control algorithm (RAT). In RAT, we apply the Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) to improve the convergence of the training procedure. Different from the convex optimization based algorithm which may be susceptible to the initial points and requires iterations, RAT can be adapted to any taking off points of the UAVs and can obtain the solution more rapidly than CAT once training process has been completed. Simulation results show that the proposed CAT and RAT achieve the considerable performance and both outperform traditional algorithms.},

abstract={With the rapid development of technology in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), more and more UAVs are used by power supply companies for power line inspection and maintenance. However, a large quantity of aerial images captured by UAVs are processed manually at present, which relies on prior knowledge of power towers and is not only time-consuming but also inefficient. Worse still, the geographical positions of abnormal power towers are difficult to be obtained so that the maintenance team has no direction to proceed. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based method for detecting and locating abnormal power towers from the aerial images captured by UAVs. In this method, an objection detection algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is firstly designed to identify and detect abnormal power towers from aerial images. Secondly, the geographical positions of the detected abnormal power towers are approximated by UAV metadata recorded in aerial images (e.g. pixel size, altitude, pitch angle, roll angle, yaw angle, et al.) and several coordinate transformations. Compared with the classical image processing methods, the present method is automatic and end-to-end, and can be easily applied in the UAV based inspection of power transmission lines.},

In this paper, we investigate the problem of energy efficiency (EE) for an energy-limited backscatter communication (BC) network, where backscatter devices (BDs) on the ground harvest energy from the wireless signal of a flying rotary-wing quadrotor. Specifically, we first reformulate the EE optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and then propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to design the UAV trajectory with the constraints of the BD scheduling, the power reflection coefficients, the transmission power, and the fairness among BDs. Simulation results show the proposed DRL algorithm achieves close-to-optimal performance and significant EE gains compared to the benchmark schemes.},

abstract={Employing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in localization and tracking system can bring many attractive advantages due to its high mobility, on-demand deployment and low cost. In this paper, we utilize the UAV as a mobile sensor to close up and track a mobile radiation source only based on the received signal strengths. We aim to maximize the sum of received signal strengths at the UAV receiver during a certain time interval, while taking the UAV's maximum speed and fly region constraints into account. However, it is very challenging since the positions of radiation source are unknown and dynamically changing. To address this issue, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework.

pages={1504-1517},
abstract={In this paper, the problem of joint caching and resource allocation is investigated for a network of cache-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that service wireless ground users over the LTE licensed and unlicensed bands. The considered model focuses on users that can access both licensed and unlicensed bands while receiving contents from either the cache units at the UAVs directly or via content server-UAV-user links. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which jointly incorporates user association, spectrum allocation, and content caching. To solve this problem, a distributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of liquid state machine (LSM) is proposed. Using the proposed LSM algorithm, the cloud can predict the users' content request distribution while having only limited information on the network's and users' states. The proposed algorithm also enables the UAVs to autonomously choose the optimal resource allocation strategies that maximize the number of users with stable queues depending on the network states. Based on the users' association and content request distributions, the optimal contents that need to be cached at UAVs and the optimal resource allocation are derived. Simulation results using real datasets show that the proposed approach yields up to 17.8% and 57.1% gains, respectively, in terms of the number of users that have stable queues compared with two baseline algorithms: Q-learning with cache and Q-learning without cache. The results also show that the LSM significantly improves the convergence time of up to 20% compared with conventional learning algorithms such as Q-learning.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems are vulnerable to smart attackers, who are selfish and subjective end-users and use smart radio devices to change their attack types and policies based on the ongoing UAV transmission and network states. In this paper, we apply prospect theory to formulate a subjective smart attack game for the UAV transmission, in which a smart attacker Eve makes subjective decisions to choose the attack type such as jamming, spoofing, and eavesdropping without knowing the attack detection accuracy of the UAV system, and the UAV transmit power on multiple radio channels is chosen to resist smart attacks. Reinforcement-learning-based UAV power allocation strategies are proposed to achieve the optimal power allocation against smart attacks without knowing the attack model and the channel model in the dynamic game. A deep Q-learning-based UAV power allocation strategy combines Q-learning and deep learning to accelerate the learning speed for the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes. Simulation results show that our proposed UAV power allocation strategy can suppress the attack motivation of subjective smart attackers and increase the secrecy capacity and the utility of the UAV system.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network is vulnerable to jamming attacks, which may cause severe damage like communication outages. Due to the energy constraint, the source UAV cannot blindly enlarge the transmit power, along with the complex network topology with high mobility, which makes the destination UAV unable to evade the jammer by flying at will. To maintain communication with a limited battery capacity in the UAV networks in the presence of a greedy jammer, in this paper, we propose a distributed reinforcement learning (RL) based energy-efficient framework for the UAV networks with constrained energy under jamming attacks to improve the communication quality while minimizing the total energy consumption of the network. This framework enables each relay UAV to independently select its transmit power based on historical state-related information without knowing the moving trajectory of other UAVs as well as the jammer. The location and battery level of each UAV need not be shared with other UAVs. We also propose a deep RL based anti-jamming relay approach for UAVs with portable computation equipment like Raspberry Pi to achieve higher and faster performance. We study the Nash equilibrium (NE) and the performance bounds based on the formulated power control game. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can reduce the bit error rate (BER) and reduce energy consumption of the UAV network compared with the benchmark method.},

abstract={Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising technology to unlock the full potential of UAVs in the future by reusing the cellular base stations (BSs) to enable their air-ground communications. However, how to achieve ubiquitous three-dimensional (3D) communication coverage for the UAVs in the sky is a new challenge. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by a new coverage-aware navigation approach, which exploits the UAV's controllable mobility to design its navigation/trajectory to avoid the cellular BSs' coverage holes while accomplishing their missions. To this end, we formulate an UAV trajectory optimization problem to minimize the weighted sum of its mission completion time and expected communication outage duration, which, however, cannot be solved by the standard optimization techniques due to the lack of an accurate and tractable end-to-end communication model in practice. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new solution approach based on the technique of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, by leveraging the state-of-the-art dueling double deep Q network (dueling DDQN) with multi-step learning, we first propose a UAV navigation algorithm based on direct RL, where the signal measurement at the UAV is used to directly train the action-value function of the navigation policy. To further improve the performance, we propose a new framework called simultaneous navigation and radio mapping (SNARM), where the UAV's signal measurement is used not only for training the DQN directly, but also to create a radio map that is able to predict the outage probabilities at all locations in the area of interest. This enables the generation of simulated UAV trajectories and predicting their expected returns, which are then used to further train the DQN via Dyna technique, thus greatly improving the learning efficiency.},

abstract={The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks are very vulnerable to smart jammers that can choose their jamming strategy based on the ongoing channel state accordingly. Although reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can give UAV networks the ability to make intelligent decisions, the high-dimensional state space makes it difficult for algorithms to converge quickly. This article proposes a knowledge-based RL method, which uses domain knowledge to compress the state space that the agent needs to explore and then improve the algorithm convergence speed. Specifically, we use the inertial law of the aircraft and the law of signal attenuation in free space to guide the highly efficient exploration of the UAVs in the state space. We incorporate the performance indicators of the receiver and the subjective value of the task into the design of the reward function, and build a virtual environment for pretraining to accelerate the convergence of anti-jamming decisions. In addition, the algorithm proposed is completely based on observable data, which is more realistic than those studies that assume the position or the channel strategy of the jammer. The simulation shows that the proposed algorithm can outperform the benchmarks of model-free RL algorithm in terms of converge speed and averaged reward.},

abstract={With the growing maturity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, its applications have widened to many spheres of life. The prerequisite for a UAV to perform air tasks smoothly is an accurate localization of its own position. Traditional UAV navigation relies on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for localization; however, this system has disadvantages of instability and susceptibility to interference. Therefore, to obtain accuracy in UAV pose estimation in GNSS-denied environments, a UAV localization method that is assisted by deep learning features of satellite imagery is proposed. With the inclusion of a top-view optical camera to the UAV, localization is achieved based on satellite imageries with geographic coordinates and a digital elevation model (DEM). By utilizing the difference between the UAV frame and satellite imagery, the convolutional neural network is used to extract deep learning features between the two images to achieve stable registration. To improve the accuracy and robustness of the localization method, a local optimization method based on bundle adjustment (BA) is proposed. Experiments demonstrate that when the UAV's relative altitude is 0.5 km, the average localization error of this method under different trajectories is within 15 m.},

abstract={In this article, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for controlling multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the ultimate purpose of tracking multiple first responders (FRs) in challenging 3-D environments in the presence of obstacles and occlusions. We assume that the UAVs receive noisy distance measurements from the FRs which are of two types, i.e., Line of Sight (LoS) and non-LoS (NLoS) measurements and which are used by the UAV agents in order to estimate the state (i.e., position) of the FRs. Subsequently, the proposed DRL-based controller selects the optimal joint control actions according to the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the joint measurement likelihood function to achieve high tracking performance. Specifically, the optimal UAV control actions are quantified by the proposed reward function, which considers both the CRLB of the entire system and each UAV’s individual contribution to the system, called global reward and difference reward, respectively. Since the UAVs take actions that reduce the CRLB of the entire system, tracking accuracy is improved by ensuring the reception of high quality LoS measurements with high probability. Our simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based UAV controller provides a highly accurate target tracking solution with a very low runtime cost.},

abstract={Due to the high maneuverability and flexibility, unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs) have been considered as a promising paradigm to assist mobile edge computing (MEC) in many scenarios including disaster rescue and field operation. Most existing research focuses on the study of trajectory and computation-offloading scheduling for UAV-assisted MEC in stationary environments, and could face challenges in dynamic environments where the locations of UAVs and mobile devices (MDs) vary significantly. Some latest research attempts to develop scheduling policies for dynamic environments by means of reinforcement learning. However, as these need to explore in high-dimensional state and action space, they may fail to cover in large-scale networks where multiple UAVs serve numerous MDs. To address this challenge, we leverage the idea of ‘divide-and-conquer’ and propose HT3O, a scalable scheduling approach for large-scale UAV-assisted MEC. First, HT3O is built with neural networks via deep reinforcement learning to obtain real-time scheduling policies for MEC in dynamic environments. More importantly, to make HT3O more scalable, we decompose the scheduling problem into two-layered sub-problems and optimize them alternately via hierarchical reinforcement learning. This not only substantially reduces the complexity of each sub-problem, but also improves the convergence efficiency. Experimental results show that HT3O can achieve promising performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is mobile and has the advantage of being equipped with cameras, sensors, computing resources and devices for communication. By combining the advantage of communication technology and UAV, rapid response can be made at disaster area and used as a mobile base station in place where traffic demand is high, such as concert venue and sports stadium. In addition, by using data that have been collected by mounted sensors and cameras, the UAV can provide data-based application. However, these services usually use big data processing and machine learning techniques which require high computing power and the UAV is not sufficiently capable of process those applications due to lack of computing resources and battery limitation. To overcome this problem, the UAV can offload task to near Mobile Edge Server that can provide computing resources. Mobile Edge Server can be cellular base station, Wi-Fi access point and so on. When tasks occur in a specific area, one or more UAV need to move the location to acquire data and process. If data processing is too heavy to process at local, the UAV can cooperate mobile edge server. In this situation, we can find out two problems. (i)When the tasks occur, which UAV can process occurred task (ii) When UAV is assigned a task, then a mobile edge server can cooperate with UAV. In this paper, based on Hungarian algorithm which is one of matching algorithm, we propose optimal task-UAV-edge server matching algorithm which minimizes energy consumption and processing time.},

abstract={This paper presents a method for estimating the air data parameters for a small fixed-wing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using an arrangement of low-cost Micro-electromechinal systems (MEMS)-based pressure sensors embedded in the surface of the UAV. The pressure measurements are used in a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the angle of attack, sideslip angle, and airspeed. Two ML algorithms based on artificial neural networks (NNs) and linear regression (LR) are implemented, tested, and assessed using data collected from wind tunnel experiments and a flight test, and the results are compared to a benchmark flight test. Training the ML algorithms using wind tunnel data was found to introduce several potential error sources that need to be addressed in order to provide accurate estimation on the benchmark flight test, whereas training the algorithms using flight data provides lower estimation RMSE values. The performance of the NN structures has been found to slightly outperform the LR algorithms in estimation accuracy. Finally, results from using different sensor configurations and a pseudo-Reynolds number are presented in an effort to evaluate the influence of sensor number and placement on the accuracy of the method.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide flexible network coverage services. UAVs can be applied in a large number of scenarios, such as emergency communication and network access in areas without terrestrial network coverage. However, UAVs are limited to relatively short communication range and restricted energy resources. In extreme conditions such as disasters, there may also be a problem that the communication bandwidth is limited and the UAV cannot communicate with the server with a large amount of information, so a decentralized solution is expected. In addition, the interaction between multiple objectives and multiple UAVs leads to a huge state space, which makes large-scale practical applications difficult. To simplify complex interactions, we modeled the UAV control problem with mean-field game (MFG). We propose a new UAV control method, the mean-field trust region policy optimization (MFTRPO), which uses the MFG method to construct the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman/Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation that obtains the optimal solution and solves the difficulties in the practical application through the trust region policy optimization and neural network feature embedding methods. The proposed method: 1) maximizes communication efficiency while ensuring fair communication range and network connectivity; 2) fuses the mean-field theory with deep reinforcement learning techniques; and 3) is scalable and adaptive. We conduct extensive simulations for performance evaluation. The simulation results have shown that MFTRPO significantly and consistently outperforms two commonly used baseline methods in terms of coverage, fairness, and energy consumption.},

abstract={As one of the key problems in both remote sensing and computer vision, video semantic segmentation has been attracting increasing amounts of attention. Using video segmentation technique for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data processing is also a popular application. Previous methods extended single image segmentation approaches to multiple frames. The temporal dependencies are ignored in these methods. This paper proposes a novel segmentation method to solve this problem. Combining the fully convolutional networks (FCN) and the Convolution Long Short Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) together, we segment the sequence of the video frames instead of segmenting each individual frame separately. FCN serves as the frame-based segmentation method. Conv-LSTM makes use of the temporal information between consecutive frames. Experimental results show the superiority of this method especially in some classes compared to the single image segmentation model using video dataset from UAV.},

abstract={Traditional flight controllers consist of Proportional Integral Derivates (PID), that although have dominant stability control but required high human interventions. In this study, a smart flight controller is developed for controlling UAVs which produces operator less mechanisms for flight controllers. It uses a neural network that has been trained using reinforcement learning techniques. Engineered with a variety of actuators (pitch, yaw, roll, and speed), the next-generation flight controller is directly trained to control its own decisions in flight. It also optimizes learning algorithms different from the traditional Actor and Critic networks. The agent gets state information from the environment and calculates the reward function depending on the sensors data from the environment. The agent then receives the observations to identify the state and reward functions and the agent activates the algorithm to perform actions. It shows the performance of a trained neural network consisting of a reward function in both simulation and real-time UAV control. Experimental results show that it can respond with relative precision. Using the same framework shows that UAVs can reliably hover in the air, even under adverse initialization conditions with obstacles. Reward functions computed during the flight for 2500, 5000, 7500 and 10000 episodes between the normalized values 0 and −4000. The computation time observed during each episode is 15 micro sec.},

pages={4406-4419},
abstract={Multi-Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control is one of the major research interests in UAV-based networks. Yet few existing works focus on how the network should optimally react when the UAV lineup and user distribution change. In this work, proactive self-regulation (PSR) of UAV-based networks is investigated when one or more UAVs are about to quit or join the network, with considering dynamic user distribution. We target at an optimal UAV trajectory control policy which proactively relocates the UAVs whenever the UAV lineup is about to change, rather than passively dispatches the UAVs after the change. Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based self-regulation approach is developed to maximize the accumulated user satisfaction (US) score for a certain period within which at least one UAV will quit or join the network. To handle the changed dimension of the state-action space before and after the lineup changes, the state transition is deliberately designed. To accommodate continuous state and action space, an actor-critic based DRL, i.e., deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), is applied with better convergence stability. To effectively promote learning exploration around the timing of lineup change, an asynchronous parallel computing (APC) learning structure is proposed. Referred to as PSR-APC, the developed approach is then extended to the case of dynamic user distribution by incorporating time as one of the agent states. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and superiority of PSR-APC over a passive reaction method, and its capability in jointly handling the dynamics of both UAV lineup and user distribution.},

In this paper, we collected a new thermal image dataset captured by UAV for post-disaster search and rescue (SAR) activities. After that, we employed several different deep convolutional neural networks to train the pedestrian detection models on our datasets, including YOLOV3, YOLOV3-MobileNetV1 and YOLOV3-MobileNetV3. Because the onboard microcomputer has limited computing capacity and memory, for balancing the inference time and accuracy, we find optimal points to prune and fine-tune the network based on the sensitivity of convolutional layers. We validate on NVIDIA's Jetson TX2 and achieve 26.60 FPS (Frames per second) real-time performance.},

The tree species level classification can be achieved by hyperspectral image(HSI), since the HSI has the high resolution of spectral and spatial.Classifying and mapping the forest species by HSI can be converted to classify each pixel vector of HSI. In this paper, we propose a spectral-spatial paralleled convolutional neural network(SSPCNN) to classify the forest tree species in the UAV(unmanned aerial vehicle) HSI. The SSPCNN mainly consists of one-dimensional convolutional neural network(1-D-CNN) and two-dimensional convolutional neural network(2-D-CNN). The 1-D-CNN is used to learn the spectral features , and the 2-D-CNN is applied to extract the spatial features. Finally two types features are fused to classify by the softmax classifier.The experimental result shows that the SSPCNN produced competitive performance compared with other methods.},

abstract={The consumer unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market has grown significantly over the past few years. Despite its huge potential in spurring economic growth by supporting various applications, the increase of consumer UAVs poses potential risks to public security and personal privacy. To minimize the risks, efficiently detecting and identifying invading UAVs is in urgent need for both invasion detection and forensics purposes. Aiming to complement the existing physical detection mechanisms, we propose a machine learning-based framework for fast UAV identification over encrypted Wi-Fi traffic. It is motivated by the observation that many consumer UAVs use Wi-Fi links for control and video streaming. The proposed framework extracts features derived only from packet size and inter-arrival time of encrypted Wi-Fi traffic, and can efficiently detect UAVs and identify their operation modes. In order to reduce the online identification time, our framework adopts a re-weighted ℓ1-norm regularization, which considers the number of samples and computation cost of different features. This framework jointly optimizes feature selection and prediction performance in a unified objective function. To tackle the packet inter-arrival time uncertainty when optimizing the trade-off between the detection accuracy and delay, we utilize maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to estimate the packet inter-arrival time. We collect a large number of real-world Wi-Fi data traffic of eight types of consumer UAVs and conduct extensive evaluation on the performance of our proposed method. Evaluation results show that our proposed method can detect and identify tested UAVs within 0.15-0.35s with high accuracy of 85.7-95.2%. The UAV detection range is within the physical sensing range of 70m and 40m in the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, respectively. The operation mode of UAVs can be identified with high accuracy of 88.5-98.2%.},

abstract={This paper explores the use of a UAV for power-line inspection using a Deep Learning algorithm for detection. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are versatile with the potential to revolutionize multiple business domains, with benefits being discovered both inside and outside the world of utility and energy industries. They can reduce operational costs, improve worker safety, asset reliability, and decision making, also having semiautonomous flight capability. Utility and Energy companies have successfully deployed UAVs in inspections. Power-line companies usually perform regular visual inspections to check the status of their transmission lines mainly using helicopters equipped with external gimbals housing infrared and an ultraviolet camera to detect hot spots and corona discharges. This solution is quite expensive and dangerous for the crew. To resolve this, a powerline-detection segmentation algorithm based on transfer learning and an improved mask regional convolutional neural network (Mask RCNN), Mask RCNN Powerline Detector is proposed and is deployed on an UAV. For this Draganfly XP-4 was used as the UAV platform. The power-line detection system used a Deep Learning Resnet50 architecture as the backbone network, combined with the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture for feature extraction.

This letter presents an analysis of the network weights for the automatic recognition of soybean leaf diseases applied to images taken straight from a small and cheap unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To achieve high accuracy, we evaluated four deep neural network models trained with different parameters for fine-tuning (FT) and transfer learning.

Our methodology consists of using the SLIC method to segment the plant leaves in the top-view images obtained during the flight. We tested our data set created from real flight inspections in an end-to-end computer vision approach. Results strongly suggest that the FT of parameters substantially improves the identification accuracy.},

abstract={Users in heterogeneous wireless networks may generate massive amounts of data that are delay-sensitive or require computation-intensive processing. Owing to computation ability and battery capacity limitations, wireless users (WUs) cannot easily process such data in a timely manner, and mobile edge computing (MEC) is increasingly being used to resolve this issue. Specifically, data generated by WUs can be offloaded to the MEC server for processing, which has greater computing power than WUs. However, as the location of MEC servers is fixed, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been considered a promising solution in heterogeneous wireless networks. In this study, we design an UAV-assisted computation offloading scheme in an MEC framework with renewable power supply. The proposed model considers the instability of energy arrival, stochastic computation tasks generated by WUs, and a time-varying channel state. Owing to the complexity of the state, it is difficult to use traditional Markov decision process (MDP) with complete prior knowledge for offloading optimization. Accordingly, we propose UAV-assisted computation offloading for MEC based on deep reinforcement learning (UACODRL) to minimize the total cost, which is the weighted sum of the delay, energy consumption, and bandwidth cost. We first use the K-Means algorithm for classification to reduce the dimension of the action space. Subsequently, we use UACODRL to find the near-optimal offloading scheme to minimize the total cost. Simulations demonstrate that UACODRL converges satisfactorily and performs better than four baseline schemes with different parameter configurations.},

abstract={Path planning is one of the key technologies for autonomous flight of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. Traditional path planning algorithms have some limitations and deficiencies in the complex and dynamic environment. In this article, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach for three-dimensional path planning by utilizing the local information and relative distance without global information. UAV can obtain the limited environmental information nearby in the actual scenario with limited sensor capabilities. Therefore, path planning can be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. The recurrent neural network with temporal memory is constructed to address the partial observability problem by extracting crucial information from historical state-action sequences. We develop an action selection strategy that combines the current reward value and the state-action value to reduce the meaningless exploration. In addition, we construct two sample memory pools and propose an adaptive experience replay mechanism based on the frequency of failure. The simulation experiment results show that our method has significant improvements over Deep Q-Network and Deep Recurrent Q-Network in terms of stability and learning efficiency. Our approach successfully plans a reasonable three-dimensional path in the large-scale and complex environment, and has the perfect ability to avoid obstacles.in the unknown environment.},

abstract={In this paper, a new nonlinear controller for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is proposed using neural networks (NNs) and output feedback. The assumption on the availability of UAV dynamics is not always practical, especially in an outdoor environment. Therefore, in this work, an NN is introduced to learn the complete dynamics of the UAV online, including uncertain nonlinear terms like aerodynamic friction and blade flapping. Although a quadrotor UAV is underactuated, a novel NN virtual control input scheme is proposed which allows all six degrees of freedom (DOF) of the UAV to be controlled using only four control inputs. Furthermore, an NN observer is introduced to estimate the translational and angular velocities of the UAV, and an output feedback control law is developed in which only the position and the attitude of the UAV are considered measurable. It is shown using Lyapunov theory that the position, orientation, and velocity tracking errors, the virtual control and observer estimation errors, and the NN weight estimation errors for each NN are all semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) in the presence of bounded disturbances and NN functional reconstruction errors while simultaneously relaxing the separation principle. The effectiveness of proposed output feedback control scheme is then demonstrated in the presence of unknown nonlinear dynamics and disturbances, and simulation results are included to demonstrate the theoretical conjecture.},

abstract={This study aims to implement the SWEEP cleaning protocol in a swarm of flying robots. The dynamic cleaners' problem is one of the most popular application of swarm intelligence. The swarm is tasked to cover the target area in an optimized manner. It starts with an area where in a contamination spreads.

abstract={Image and video analysis in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have been a recent interest in many applications since the images taken by UAV systems can provide useful information in many domains including maintenance, surveillance and entertainment. However, a constraint on UAVs is having limited battery power and recent developments in the artificial intelligence (AI) domain encourages many applications to run computationally heavy algorithms on the taken UAV images. Such applications drain the power from the on-board battery rapidly, while requiring strong computationally strong resources. An alternative to that approach is offloading heavy tasks such as object segmentation to a remote (edge) server and perform the heavy computation on that server. However, the effect of the communication system and the used channel introduce noise on the transferred data and the effect of the noise due to the use of such LTE communication system on pre-trained deep networks has not been previously studied in the literature. In this paper, we study one such scenario where the images taken by UAVs and (the same images) transferred to an edge server via an LTE communication system under different scenarios. In our case, the edge server runs an off-the-shelf pretrained deep learning algorithm to segment the transmitted image. We provide an analysis of the effect of the wireless channel and the communication system on the final segmentation of the transmitted image on such a scenario.},

abstract={It is feasible and safe to use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the data collection platform of the Internet of things (IoT). In order to save the energy loss of the platform and make the UAV perform the collection work effectively, it is necessary to optimize the deployment of UAV. The objective problem is to minimize the sum of the lost energy of UAV and the loss of data transmission of Internet of things devices. The key to solving the problem is to calculate the location of the docking points and the number of docking points when the UAV is working to collect data. This paper proposes a coding scheme based on swarm intelligence optimization, which encapsulates the docking position of UAV into a dimension, so the number of docking points to be calculated is the dimension number of optimization objective. This problem is considered as a dynamic dimension optimization problem. Each individual in swarm intelligence algorithm is a solution. When adjusting the dimension, the best individual is added or deleted to achieve dynamic search in the evolutionary process. Collaborative search among multiple individuals can improve the local optimal limit of search to a certain extent. Finally, the validity of the swarm intelligence-based coding approach is verified by simulation under seven IoT device distribution scenarios. The swarm intelligence algorithms we used are flower pollination algorithm (FPA), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), sine cosine algorithm (SCA). FPA and SCA perform most efficiently in three and four scenarios among the seven IoT device scenarios, respectively.},

abstract={This paper concerns the problem of trajectory design and base station (BS) association for cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To support safety-critical functions, one primary requirement for UAVs is to maintain reliable cellular connectivity at every time instant during the flight mission. Since the antenna gain of a ground BS (GBS) changes with the position of the UAV, the UAV-GBS association strategy should be jointly considered with the trajectory design, which has not been studied in the prior arts. In this paper, we first formulate the problem of joint BS association and trajectory design with the objective of minimizing the mission completion time under a connectivity outage constraint. Then, a deep learning framework is proposed to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem in a decoupled manner. For the UAV-GBS association strategy, the signal strength radio map of a given area is constructed, which is used to train a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the nonlinear mapping from the UAV position to the optimal GBS. To tackle the high complexity due to the coupled decision variables of GBS association and UAV movement, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is developed to learn the optimal trajectory, in which the UAV can learn from its own past good experiences. Our simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed DRL approach compared to the conventional DRL approaches in terms of trajectory length. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the nearest association scheme fails to provide reliable cellular connections, whereas our proposed approach can ensure strong connectivity with the GBS during the whole trajectory.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate a backhaul framework jointly considering topology construction and power adjustment for self-organizing UAV networks. To enhance the backhaul rate with limited information exchange and avoid malicious power competition, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method to construct the backhaul framework where each UAV distributedly makes decisions. First, we decompose the backhaul framework into three submodules, i.e., transmission target selection (TS), total power control (PC), and multi-channel power allocation (PA). Then, the three submodules are solved by heterogeneous DRL algorithms with tailored rewards to regulate UAVs' behaviors. In particular, TS is solved by deep-Q learning to construct topology with less relay and guarantee the backhaul rate. PC and PA are solved by deep deterministic policy gradient to match the traffic requirement with proper finegrained transmission power. As a result, the malicious power competition is alleviated, and the backhaul rate is further enhanced. Simulation results show that the proposed framework effectively achieves system-level and all-around performance gain compared with DQL and max-min method, i.e., higher backhaul rate, lower transmission power, and fewer hop.},

abstract={In this article, we study the application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for data collection with wireless charging, which is crucial for providing seamless coverage and improving system performance in the next-generation wireless networks. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to plan the route of UAV to collect sensor data from sensor devices scattered in the physical environment. Specifically, the physical environment is divided into multiple grids, where one spot for UAV hovering as well as the wireless charging of UAV is located at the center of each grid. Each grid has a spot for the UAV to hover, and moreover, there is a wireless charger at the center of each grid, which can provide wireless charging to UAV when it is hovering in the grid. When the UAV lacks energy, it can be charged by the wireless charger at the spot. By taking into account the collected data amount as well as the energy consumption, we formulate the problem of data collection with UAV as a Markov decision problem, and exploit Q-learning to find the optimal policy. In particular, we design the reward function considering the energy efficiency of UAV flight and data collection, based on which Q-table is updated for guiding the route of UAV. Through extensive simulation results, we verify that our proposed reward function can achieve a better performance in terms of the average throughput, delay of data collection, as well as the energy efficiency of UAV, in comparison with the conventional capacity-based reward function.},

abstract={This paper considers an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled uplink non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) system, where multiple users on the ground send independent messages to a UAV via NOMA transmission. We aim to design the UAV’s dynamic maneuver in real time for maximizing the sum-rate throughput of all ground users over a finite time horizon. Different from conventional offline designs considering static user locations under deterministic or stochastic channel models, we consider a more challenging scenario with mobile users and segmented channel models, where the UAV only causally knows the users’ (moving) locations and channel state information (CSI). Under this setup, we first propose a new approach for UAV dynamic maneuver design based on reinforcement learning (RL) via Q-learning. Next, in order to further speed up the convergence and increase the throughput, we present an enhanced RL-based approach by additionally exploiting expert knowledge of well-established wireless channel models to initialize the Q-table values. Numerical results show that our proposed RL-based and enhanced RL-based approaches significantly improve the sum-rate throughput, and the enhanced RL-based approach considerably speeds up the learning process owing to the proposed Q-table initialization.},

abstract={This article describes how swarm intelligence can be applied to an array of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for strategic deployment. In emergency or disaster-stricken areas, telecommunications and geospatial surveillance are strictly critical for situational control. Base stations may fail to work due to natural disasters. To be rapidly deployed, lightweight drones with multirotors that provide stability are used as mobile stations. An autonomous learning approach, “self-organizing maps (SOMs),” which can automatically and adaptively coordinate a large array of autonomous drones-self-organizing UAV array-based on requests from end users (EUs) is embedded inside the array. The size and the topology of a UAV array can be dynamically changed in response to various terrains and relocation of EUs. Moreover, with swarm intelligence, the UAV array is capable of reconfiguring its planar topology into a hierarchical one. Such a hierarchical topology divides the entire UAV array into subarrays and creates isolated heterogeneous networks. Thus, the UAV array can cope with diverse situations across geographical barriers by forming a flying ad hoc network.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted device-to-device (D2D) communications can be deployed flexibly thanks to UAVs' agility. By exploiting the direct D2D interaction supported by UAVs, both the user experience and network performance can be substantially enhanced at public events. However, the continuous moving of D2D users, limited energy and flying time of UAVs are impediments to their applications in real-time. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel model based on deep reinforcement learning in order to find the optimal solution for the energy-harvesting time scheduling in UAV-assisted D2D communications. To make the system model more realistic, we assume that the UAV flies around a central point, the D2D users move continuously with random walk model and the channel state information encountered during each time slot is randomly time-variant. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes outperform the existing solutions. The associated energy efficiency game can be solved in less than one millisecond by an off-the-shelf processor using trained neural networks. Hence our deep reinforcement learning techniques are capable of solving real-time resource allocation problems in UAV-assisted wireless networks.},

abstract={Accurate estimation of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) is vital to regional carbon balance. Currently, NEE observations at the canopy scale are mainly based on the chamber method. However, the chamber method is labor intensive, time consuming, and measures only plot-scale NEE. It cannot reflect whole-field NEE with high spatial resolution. In this article, maize daytime NEE variations in four fields under different irrigation treatments in a semiarid area was measured using the chamber method, and the spectral reflectance in the maize canopy at noon was obtained using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral system. We established a daytime NEE variation estimation model and up-scaled the level of NEE observations in maize canopy using UAV-based remote sensing. Twelve widely used vegetation indices were employed for NEE estimation. To obtain an optimal NEE variation estimation method, we compared the performance of several models, including simple linear regression, multiple stepwise regression, and four machine learning (ML) algorithms. Based on the comparison, the modified triangular vegetation index-2 is the best predictor for analyzing simple linear regression, with a coefficient of determination R2 = 0.719. Compared with the simple linear regression, there is no substantial increase in the R2 of NEE estimation based on multiple stepwise regression. However, the ML algorithms greatly improved R2 values. In particular, the gradient boosting regression model exhibits the best performance (R2 = 0.856). This article demonstrates that high-resolution UAV multispectral remote sensing shows great potential in improving the spatial and temporal estimating of maize daytime NEE variations.},

However, the efficiency still needs to be improved because the judgment of disaster damage by human is inefficient and fallible. So intelligent recognition method is considered to increase the efficiency and accuracy. For the training of intelligent recognition model based on deep learning network requires a large number of samples, a novel method is proposed in this paper. The Self Organizing Map (SOM) is introduced between the convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM), to reduce the number of training samples. Meanwhile, median filtering detection with Gaussian distribution is taken in the convolutional layer to decrease the influence of stochastic noise in the input picture. The dropout technique and multi winning neurons are introduced in the SOM to improve the clustering robust and reduce time consumption. Experimental results show that the proposed method shows good performance on the recognition of the damage images of the wire poles with complex backgrounds in the distribution network, and it is obviously superior to the traditional ways.},

abstract={With the proliferation of smart mobile devices, there is now an ever increasing craving for higher bandwidth for end user satisfaction. Increasing mobile traffic leads to congestion of backhaul networks. One promising solution to this problem is the mobile edge network and consequently mobile edge caching. There is an emerging paradigm shift toward the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist the traditional cellular networks and also to provide connectivity in places where there are no small base stations or faulty ones as a result of some natural disaster such as flooding. Hence, UAVs can be used to assist in content caching as well. This work proposes the use of human centric features, random waypoint user mobility model, and deep reinforcement learning to predict the location of the UAVs and the contents to cache at the UAVs. We formulated our problem as a Markov decision problem (MDP) and proposed a dueling reinforcement learning-based algorithm to solve the MDP problem. Our simulation results prove that our algorithm converges to an optimal solution and performs better than other baseline reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of quality of experience satisfaction, transmit power, and cache resource utilization},

abstract={In this paper, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted wireless network is investigated, where an aerial base station (ABS) is deployed for serving both ground and aerial users. The objective is to maximize the uplink sum-rate of all users by designing the trajectory of the ABS, while considering the mobility of users. Specifically, it is assumed that all aerial UAVs move individually with the random waypoint mobility model (RWM). Meanwhile, some ground users move with the reference point group mobility model, while others follow the RWM as well. Due to the mobility of both ground and aerial users, conventional reinforcement learning (such as Q-learning) is very likely to fail for the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, it is non-trivial to solve the trajectory design problem in the large-scale highly dynamic environment. By approximating the value functions with neural networks, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is proposed for the ABS to autonomously provide network services in the rapidly changing environment. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed double deep Q-network (DDQN) can learn the environment information very well with our elaborate rewards.

abstract={At present, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the primary platforms widely used for environmental monitoring. The advantage of the UAV-type surveillance system is its low-cost with high observation performance. Using this system, we can extend the workable area of the jellyfish removal system. The proposed system observes jellyfish on the surface of the sea while flying, and can recognize a herd of jellyfish using deep learning.

abstract={We have proposed a visual inspection technique for concrete structures using deep learning and a hardware ecosystem, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The UAV is a quadcopter that can fly to unreachable sections of a site which consists of a camera that captures images of the concrete surfaces via a mobile device and feed the real time images in the CNN model. The images taken from such remote locations may contain different types of surfaces, shadowed regions and surfaces with holes. The cracks are properly detected by the CNN `AlexNet' algorithm and masking with sliding window technique in such conditions due to variation in the image data set. The experimental results were simulated on a standard online data set of 40,000 images of Mendeley Data which is freely available and 3000 images have been chosen from the entire data set for this method. The classes have been divided into 2 categories of `crack' and `no crack' for the proposed method's data set. There are 1050 training images and 450 testing images for each category. Experimental results were achieved on Google Colab cloud service using Python Tensorflow API (Application Programming Interface). The proposed `AlexNet' CNN algorithm achieves 98.4 % accuracy and the model is deployed to a masking technique with sliding window to detect cracks in a 3008×2000 pixel resolution image by breaking the image into 227×227 pixel resolution image patches. The experimental results have proved that the proposed method handles noisy background such as cracks with shadows and stains, cracks on rusty and rough surfaces and minor dimension cracks with good efficiency.},

abstract={Harvesting data from distributed Internet of Things (IoT) devices with multiple autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging problem requiring flexible path planning methods. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that, in contrast to previous work, can adapt to profound changes in the scenario parameters defining the data harvesting mission, such as the number of deployed UAVs, number, position and data amount of IoT devices, or the maximum flying time, without the need to perform expensive recomputations or relearn control policies. We formulate the path planning problem for a cooperative, non-communicating, and homogeneous team of UAVs tasked with maximizing collected data from distributed IoT sensor nodes subject to flying time and collision avoidance constraints. The path planning problem is translated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which we solve through a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, approximating the optimal UAV control policy without prior knowledge of the challenging wireless channel characteristics in dense urban environments. By exploiting a combination of centered global and local map representations of the environment that are fed into convolutional layers of the agents, we show that our proposed network architecture enables the agents to cooperate effectively by carefully dividing the data collection task among themselves, adapt to large complex environments and state spaces, and make movement decisions that balance data collection goals, flight-time efficiency, and navigation constraints. Finally, learning a control policy that generalizes over the scenario parameter space enables us to analyze the influence of individual parameters on collection performance and provide some intuition about system-level benefits.},

abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have recently attracted both academia and industry representatives due to their utilization in tremendous emerging applications. Most UAV applications adopt Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) due to ongoing regulations. There is a consensus between industry for extending UAVs’ commercial operations to cover the urban and populated area controlled airspace Beyond VLOS (BVLOS). There is ongoing regulation for enabling BVLOS UAV management. Regrettably, this comes with unavoidable challenges related to UAVs’ autonomy for detecting and avoiding static and mobile objects. An intelligent component should either be deployed onboard the UAV or at a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) that can read the gathered data from different UAV’s sensors, process them, and then make the right decision to detect and avoid the physical collision. The sensing data should be collected using various sensors but not limited to Lidar, depth camera, video, or ultrasonic. This paper proposes probabilistic and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based algorithms for avoiding collisions while saving energy consumption. The proposed algorithms can be either run on top of the UAV or at the MEC according to the UAV capacity and the task overhead. We have designed and developed our algorithms to work for any environment without a need for any prior knowledge. The proposed solutions have been evaluated in a harsh environment that consists of many UAVs moving randomly in a small area without any correlation. The obtained results demonstrated the efficiency of these solutions for avoiding the collision while saving energy consumption in familiar and unfamiliar environments.},

abstract={A cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) faces several key challenges concerning connectivity and energy efficiency. Through a learning-based strategy, we propose a general novel multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithm to reduce disconnectivity time, handover rate, and energy consumption of UAV by taking into account its time of task completion. By formulating the problem as a function of UAV's velocity, we show how each of these performance indicators (PIs) is improved by adopting a proper range of corresponding learning parameter, e.g. 50% reduction in HO rate as compared to a blind strategy. However, results reveal that the optimal combination of the learning parameters depends critically on any specific application and the weights of PIs on the final objective function.},

abstract={Adapting artificial intelligence autonomous systems required a policy specification, policy enforcement and policy management on the key prioritized functions based on the inherent policy enforcement and self-definitive programmed knowledge by an autonomous system. In the current research, attempt was made to model an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system to be able to detect humans within the thickest forest region amidst the escalating tension of bokoharam and bandits abductions within the Nigeria geographic space. The autonomous artificial intelligence UAVs was designed using laser-range detectors for location evaluation and pathway finding with very accurate precision. While the UAVs hovers in the neighborhood, it establishes an individualized 3-D map of its surrounding. The central objective of this study is to explore the scientific opportunities available for artificial intelligence unmanned aerial vehicle (Drones) modeled with machine learning (convolution neural network) on Internet of Things (IoTs) framework and adapt it to revolutionize the mission on environmental & remote sensing, security surveillance, rescue and search mission. The paper established that Nigeria security forces could adopt artificial intelligence UAV to extradite terrorists within the Lake Chad Basin where bokoharam insurgency and banditry are prevalent. The paper further highlight that UAV could be very instrumental in search and rescue mission by the security forces.},
