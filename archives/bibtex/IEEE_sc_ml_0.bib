abstract={Increasing shares of renewable energy sources in combination with rising popularity of demand response applications and flexibility programs forces higher awareness for production and consumption balancing. Accurate models for forecasting are not just necessary for PV- or wind power sources in smart cities, but also the prediction of loads respectively consumption, which can be based on time series analysis or machine learning methods. Three of those methods, namely a linear regression (LM), a long short-term memory network (LSTM) and a neural network model (NN), have been selected to see their performance on predicting the load of a large smart city on the example of the Estonian electricity consumption data. Hourly data of the year 2019 was used as training data to predict the first 20 days of 2020. For this kind of prediction, the LM showed the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and had the lowest computational time. The neural network was slightly less accurate. The LSTM showed the worst performance in terms of accuracy and computational time. Thus, LSTM is not the preferred method for this kind of prediction and the recommendation for forecasting such loads would be a LM because the RMSE and computational effort needed are lower than for a NN.},

abstract={Nowadays, smart cities enhance the life style of urban people in various disciplines, viz., smart transports, smart environment, smart parking, smart health care, etc. As the cities become smarter, privacy is the major issue and the private sensitive data needs protection. To address this issue, this paper proposes an autoencoder based deep learning classifier by preserving the privacy in cloud for smart city applications. The private data is protected using homomorphic encryption and deep learning is performed in cloud servers. Experiments are conducted on three datasets, viz., Road Traffic Data, Pollution Data, and Parking Data provided by CityPulse Smart City Dataset. It is seen that the proposed approach is efficient compared to conventional classifiers as the non-disclosure of private data in cloud computing. The proposed approach is scalable and it is suitable for big data based smart city applications.},

According to change, existing urban models are emerging as smart cities. Smart City is a sustainable city that improves urban functions of various elements by applying information and communication convergence technology and environment friendly technology to urban space and solves urban problems that are occurring now. Energy, a core element of the city, enables efficient energy management of energy systems through an Internet of Things-based platform. The Internet of Things is a technology that sends and receives data by attaching sensors to various objects through a network. The goal is to use resources efficiently as the Internet of Things is spread and various industries are applied.

abstract={The application of sensor networks in control and management of smart cities are increasing rapidly. The Internet of Things (IoT) platforms are becoming a major infrastructure component of the smart cities. The requirement for development of Web of Things (WoT) architectures and patterns have significant importance for optimal management and decision support in the smart city. Due to the fact that the sensor networks in even a small city produce a very large amount of data, manual interpretation of this data is not feasible. In recent years machine learning algorithms such as deep learning give the computer systems the ability to interpret and annotate this big data stream and to produce patterns which can help decision makers. This high-level interpretation is often presented in form of dashboards in the composition layers of the WoT. In this paper a deep learning based multisensor dashboard for decision support in the smart city is presented. The proposed dashboard is capable of interpretation and decision level fusion on sensor network data. Simulation results show that the proposed model is a suitable solution for making decisions in the IoT framework for the smart city.},

abstract={Deep learning has increasingly become an essential component of many Smart City functions including smart city lightings, emergency rescues, smart drainage, and smart parking. These functions operate continuously in real-time throughout the day. Thus, excessive energy usage of deep learning computation can negatively impact economic benefits and efficiency of smart cities. The situation can escalate when dealing with resource-constrained large-scale smart cities of huge Internet-of-Things and networks with large numbers and varieties of sensors. To effectively sustain, manage and protect smart cities from failures due to energy overload, the awareness of energy consumption by deep learning computation is unavoidably necessary. Most recent research in smart cities focuses on using deep learning to perform certain tasks but does not address energy issues. This paper presents a formal approach to estimating energy consumption of deep learning and illustrates its use in smart cities. In particular, we develop a fine-grained mathematical model that extends an existing model to include the quantification of MAC (multiply-and-accumulate) operations as well as data access from a memory hierarchy. This paper focuses on deep and convolutional neural networks. We describe the proposed approach and validate the results obtained from our model by comparing them against those of existing work. The proposed approach is applied to three (deep) neural systems in smart cities, namely smart drainage, smart transportation and smart parking systems, all of which yield promising results.},

abstract={The detection and repair of the cracks in the road pavement is a very time consuming task which should be performed periodically in order to maintain the safety and quality of the road network. There are various types of road pavement cracks and each type requires different management and repair method and also each type indicates a different problem in that section of the road. In this paper, an autonomous machine learning based visual inspection system for detection and classification of the road pavement cracks is proposed. The proposed framework uses deep neural networks in order to detect and classify longitudinal, alligator and asphalt cracks. A dataset of images from different road conditions and various pavement cracks is collected. The proposed framework increases the speed and scale of road pavement analysis and repair and can be used for smart road maintenance management in the smart cities. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed framework is 95% for detection and classification of the cracks in the road pavements.},

pages={137825-137837},
abstract={Intrusion detection is an important and challenging problem that has a major impact on quality and reliability of smart city services. To this extent, replay attacks have been one of the most common threats on smart city infrastructure, which compromises authentication in a smart city network. For example, a replay attack may physically damage smart city infrastructure resulting in loss of sensitive data, incurring considerable financial damages. Therefore, towards securing smart cities from reply attacks, intrusion detection systems and frameworks based on deep learning have been proposed in the recent literature. However, the absence of the time dimension of these proposals is a major limitation. Therefore, we have developed a deep learning-based model for replay attack detection in smart cities. The novelty of the proposed methodology resides in the adoption of deep learning based models as an application for detecting replay attacks to improve detection accuracy. The performance of this model is evaluated by applying it to a real life smart city dataset, where replay attacks were simulated. Our results show that the proposed model is capable of distinguishing between normal and attack behaviours with relatively high accuracy. In addition, according to the results, our proposed model outperforms traditional classification and deep learning models. Last but not least, as an additional contribution, this paper presents a real life smart city data set with simulated replay attacks for future research.},

abstract={Smart services are an important element of the smart cities and the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems where the intelligence behind the services is obtained and improved through the sensory data. Providing a large amount of training data is not always feasible; therefore, we need to consider alternative ways that incorporate unlabeled data as well. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained great success in several application domains. It is an applicable method for IoT and smart city scenarios where auto-generated data can be partially labeled by users' feedback for training purposes. In this paper, we propose a semisupervised DRL model that fits smart city applications as it consumes both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance and accuracy of the learning agent. The model utilizes variational autoencoders as the inference engine for generalizing optimal policies. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the first investigation that extends DRL to the semisupervised paradigm. As a case study of smart city applications, we focus on smart buildings and apply the proposed model to the problem of indoor localization based on Bluetooth low energy signal strength. Indoor localization is the main component of smart city services since people spend significant time in indoor environments. Our model learns the best action policies that lead to a close estimation of the target locations with an improvement of 23% in terms of distance to the target and at least 67% more received rewards compared to the supervised DRL model.},

abstract={The smart city is an emerging concept which appears to be a promising approach not only in urban environment to accommodate the growing needs and to improve the quality of life, but also in military environment for installing and integrating network-connected sensors into the everyday operations. This demands the use of information technologies, digitization, and urban traffic planning for better mobility. Internet of Things (IoT) devices (wireless sensors, actuators, meters, etc.) come in handy to collect and analyze data. Because military bases share many of the same characteristics as small cities, this work in progress sets out to develop a machine learning model to predict the parking availability in IoT environment for smart cities. As IoT offers data nuances challenges, present work explores a recently introduced information theoretic technique, Chisini Jensen Shannon Divergence (CJSD), known for their utility to tease apart data classes with discernible differences. We found that while clustering methods were unable to detect visually identifiable clusters, family of CJSDs was able to capture underlying data regularity and give statistically significant improvement over deep learning model. This is the first application of information theoretic models in IoT environment in the research literature.},

abstract={Rapid urbanization has brought about great challenges to our daily lives, such as traffic congestion, environmental pollution, energy consumption, public safety, and so on. Research on smart cities aims to address these issues with various technologies developed for the Internet of Things. Very recently, the research focus has shifted toward processing of massive amount of data continuously generated within a city environment, e.g., physical and participatory sensing data on traffic flow, air quality, and health care. Techniques from computational intelligence have been applied to process and analyze such data, and to extract useful knowledge that helps citizens better understand their surroundings and informs city authorities to provide better and more efficient public services. Deep learning, as a relatively new paradigm in computational intelligence, has attracted substantial attention of the research community and demonstrated greater potential over traditional techniques. This paper provides a survey of the latest research on the convergence of deep learning and smart city from two perspectives: while the technique-oriented review pays attention to the popular and extended deep learning models, the application-oriented review emphasises the representative application domains in smart cities. Our study showed that there are still many challenges ahead for this emerging area owing to the complex nature of deep learning and wide coverage of smart city applications. We pointed out a number of future directions related to deep learning efficiency, emergent deep learning paradigms, knowledge fusion and privacy preservation, and hope these would move the relevant research one step further in creating truly distributed intelligence for smart cities.},

This method is to directly reduce the noise and restore the transmitted symbols, and does not add the existing channel estimation function network module. Specifically, the mathematical calculation function of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the training of OFDM signal samples are used to reduce the ser error rate (SER) through the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). In addition, The robustness of this method is proved by data sets under different modulation modes and different SNR conditions. This article introduces the preliminary research results of OFDM receivers. The experimental results of the simulation in this article show that the method we propose is better than the SER of OFDM receiver based on traditional linear least squares (LS) channel estimation, which drop by 1.6% ~ 6.7% in the conditions of different SNRs and modulation modes.},

abstract={Immense urbanization is putting tremendous pressure on policy makers, city planners and managers to render sustainable plans and designs which ensures good quality of life for the residents of the smart cities. In order to achieve this goal, a city can be made smart with the ubiquitous development and usage in hardware and software technologies, vast advancement in information and communication technologies and speedy furtherance of connected devices. The newest style of smart city initiative, in turn makes the implementation arduous and challenging. Furthermore, the standards for the design and implementation of the smart city is yet to be released. Consequently, security in this ad-hoc technology is premature and overlooked. In this paper we propose security system that offers active and planned approach to protect the smart city in four spots. Firstly, the machine learning based security system should be placed at the data collection points that has IoT enabled devices. Secondly, the data must be protected by implementing complex cryptographic technique while travelling from the collection points to the intended storage location. Thirdly, the data at rest in the storage area for analysis should be conserved by applying some intelligent intrusion detection technique. Finally, the specific machine generated action should be ensured at the target.},

abstract={In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) concept has become a promising research topic in many areas including industry, commerce and education. Smart cities employ IoT based services and applications to create a sustainable urban life. By using information and communication technologies, IoT enables smart cities to make city stakeholders more aware, interactive and efficient. With the increase in number of IoT based smart city applications, the amount of data produced by these applications is increased tremendously. Governments and city stakeholders take early precautions to process these data and predict future effects to ensure sustainable development. In prediction context, deep learning techniques have been used for several forecasting problems in big data. This inspires us to use deep learning methods for prediction of IoT data. Hence, in this paper, a novel deep learning model is proposed for analyzing IoT smart city data. We propose a novel model based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict future values of air quality in a smart city.

abstract={Smart cities and their applications have become attractive research fields birthing numerous technologies. Fifth generation (5G) networks are important components of smart cities, where intelligent access control is deployed for identity authentication, online banking, and cyber security. To assure secure transactions and to protect user's identities against cybersecurity threats, strong authentication techniques should be used. The prevalence of biometrics, such as fingerprints, in authentication and identification makes the need to safeguard them important across different areas of smart applications. Our study presents a system to detect alterations to biometric modalities to discriminate pristine, adulterated, and fake biometrics in 5G-based smart cities. Specifically, we use deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a hybrid model that combines CNN with convolutional long-short term memory (ConvLSTM) to compute a three-tier probability that a biometric has been tempered. Simulation-based experiments indicate that the alteration detection accuracy matches those recorded in advanced methods with superior performance in terms of detecting central rotation alteration to fingerprints. This makes the proposed system a veritable solution for different biometric authentication applications in secure smart cities.},

abstract={The concept of Smart Cities becomes paramount importance both to Government and Private Sectors. The increasing pressure of urbanization creates tremendous pressure to civic infrastructures like drainage, water system, electrical networks (Smart Grid), transportation etc [1] -- [3]. The use of Big Data Analytics is becoming a necessary tool to design and monitor Smart Cities. With the cost of sensors decreasing everyday, the flood of data is ubiquitous. We have designed a neural network based on cognitive algorithm for monitoring Smart Cities. Our algorithm is developed on the highly scalable distributed machine learning GraphLab Framework, embeds the deep learning features in the GraphLab Architecture to gain insight of the unstructured data through hierarchical abstraction. This is a scalable software architecture using Apache STORM. An Update Function (UF) is defined, which updates the scope of the data in the GraphLab. The Graph Rules, used by Graph Transformation, are defined to construct hidden layers in GraphLab to get more control over information flow. The "Update Function" and Graph Transformation trigger each other, which forms Hybrid GraphLab. The Hybrid GraphLab allows more flexible, fault tolerant, computational capabilities and possibilities to add more hidden multi-layers in tune with deep learning. Our algorithm can be extended to other applications like old age homes, hospitals etc for improved monitoring and management, with various sensors such as Gas Sensors, Light Sensors, Directionable Sensor Probes and Noise Sensors.},

abstract={With machine learning (ML) services now used in a number of mission-critical human-facing domains, ensuring the integrity and trustworthiness of ML models becomes all important. In this work, we consider the paradigm where cloud service providers collect big data from resource-constrained devices for building ML-based prediction models that are then sent back to be run locally on the intermittently connected resource-constrained devices. Our proposed solution comprises an intelligent polynomial-time heuristic that maximizes the level of trust of ML models by selecting and switching between a subset of the ML models from a superset of models in order to maximize the trustworthiness while respecting the given reconfiguration budget/rate and reducing the cloud communication overhead. We evaluate the performance of our proposed heuristic using two case studies. First, we consider Industrial IoT (IIoT) services, and as a proxy for this setting, we use the turbofan engine degradation simulation data set to predict the remaining useful life of an engine. Our results in this setting show that the trust level of the selected models is 0.49%-3.17% less compared to the results obtained using integer linear programming (ILP). Second, we consider smart cities services, and as a proxy of this setting, we use an experimental transportation data set to predict the number of cars. Our results show that the selected model's trust level is 0.7%-2.53% less compared to the results obtained using ILP. We also show that our proposed heuristic achieves an optimal competitive ratio in a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem.},

abstract={In smart cities and factories, robotic applications require high dexterity and security, which requires precise inverse dynamics model. However, the physical modeling methods cannot model the uncertain factors of the manipulator such as flexibility, joint clearance and friction, etc. As an alternative, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have become increasingly popular in robotics for smart cities and factories. In this paper, deep learning neural network based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is adopted to predict the manipulator inverse dynamics. This study aims to summarize the influence of the hyper-parameter settings on model performance and to explore the applicability of the LSTM model to joint torque prediction of multiple degrees of freedom series manipulator. Furthermore, the feasibility of using only joint position as input data for torque prediction is verified. Simulation result has shown that, for the proposed deep learning architecture, the effects of the number of maximum epochs on model performance should be prioritized. The effects of the number of hidden nodes on model performance are limited, while prediction accuracy will deteriorate as the number of hidden layers increases. It is proved that it is feasible to predict inverse dynamics when input data is joint position only. The experimental results show that the training time increases with the increase of hidden layers, neurons and epochs.},

abstract={Due to the need to detect and track stolen and criminal vehicles and traffic monitoring, the development of license plate recognition systems on intersection monitors system is very urgent for the development of smart cities. Unlike the traditional license plate recognition technology applied to smart parking lots to identify a single license plate in a single lane, license plate recognition applied to intersection monitors must detect multiple license plates on multiple lanes. In addition, license plate recognition applied to intersection monitors faces many challenges, including too small license plates in the picture, unstable light sources, different shooting angles, blurred license plate characters in moving vehicles, and complex road conditions, advertising signs, traffic signs and road name indicator. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a new two-stage methodology based on deep learning technology which first detects all the license plates in a picture and extracts the license plate images, and then performs character recognition on the license plate images using Convolutional Neural Networks. Through the two-stage approach, this method increases the proportion of characters in the picture, which in turn improves the character recognition accuracy. Experimental results show that the methodology achieves 98.23% of license plate detection rate and 97.38% of character recognition rate. The performance of the hierarchical methodology is about 25 fps. This methodology shows the superiority in both accuracy and performance in comparison with traditional license plate recognition systems.},

abstract={With the advancement of communication technology and location acquisition technology in the context of modern smart cities, the sharing bike systems offer users the great autonomy and convenience for the last/first-kilometer trip. Meanwhile, we can now able to collect, store, and analyze a large amount of sharing bike data. How to effectively use these massive data to provide better services is an emerging task. However, due to the skewed and imbalanced bike usages for stations located at different places, it is of great significance yet very challenging to predict the potential destinations of each individual trip beforehand so that the service providers can better schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an attention-based deep learning framework for trip destination prediction (AFTER). AFTER first learns the low-dimension representations of users and sharing bike stations via negative sampling strategies. Then, a convolution neural network with an attention mechanism is utilized to predict the future trip destination. Experimental results on a real-world dataset indicate that the proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, and F1.},

abstract={One of the major challenges faced by the humanity in the next century is the climate change and global warming. Climate change is caused by the rapid emission of greenhouse gases. Energy production industry is facing the challenge of providing the energy require by the rapidly expanding need of urbanized societies while reducing their emission. Clean and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy can gradually replace the energy sources with high emission. Smart cities can provide a major part of their energy requirements using these clean energy sources. The energy sector should be able to make decisions about the best scenarios for deployment and placement of clean energy production devices such as solar panels and wind turbines. In this paper,3D modelling of the urban environment is used for efficient placement of solar panels in the urban environment for optimum electricity production. Furthermore, a model for prediction of the speed of the wind using deep neural networks is proposed. The proposed solar panel placement framework is simulated on a part of the city of Tehran, Iran. The proposed wind energy production framework is simulated on 16 wind energy production stations in Iran. The experimental results show that the combined use of the solar and wind energy sources in the smart city environment can help the energy companies to be able to answer the energy demands of the cities while reducing their cost and emission.},

abstract={Clean air is one of the most important needs for the well-being of human being health. In smart cities, timely and precise air pollution levels knowledge is vital for the successful setup of smart pollution systems. Recently, pollution and weather data in smart city have been bursting, and we have truly got into the era of big data. Ozone is considered as one of the most air pollutants with hurtful impact to human health. Existing methods used to predict the level of ozone uses shallow pollution prediction models and are still unsatisfactory in their accuracy to be used in many real-world applications. In order to increase the accuracy of prediction models we come up with the concept of using deep architecture models tested on big pollution and weather data. In this paper, a new deep learning-based ozone level prediction model is proposed, which considers the pollution and weather correlations integrally.

abstract={The massive increase in development, deployment and usage of IoT has given rise to smart cities. These smart city devices have the ability to perform communications on their own which require free flow of data. The interconnectivity has also resulted in exponential growth of data being processed, making it susceptible to intrusion attacks. Traditional IDS systems are not designed to work efficiently in an IoT network as these devices have restricted resources and sparse functionality. To tackle the cyber security threats in IoT, MCIDS (Multi Classifier Intrusion Detection system) has been proposed which is based on deep learning algorithm. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is utilised to train and test the model. Proposed Solution can effectively detect and alert Reconnaissance, Backdoors, Analysis, DoS, Fuzzers, Generic, Worms and Shellcodes and achieve high accuracy with low false positives.},

abstract={In a smart city, effective and accurate real estate assessments governed by a local government is crucial for determining the property taxes. Such assessments have never been trivial, and inappropriate assessments may result in disputes between property owners and the local government. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning approach to smartly and effectively assessing real estate values. We propose a systematic method to derive a layered knowledge graph and design a structured Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on it. Neurons in a structured DNN are structurally connected, which makes the network time and space efficient; and thus, it requires fewer data points for training. The structured DNN model has been designed to learn from the most recently captured data points; therefore, it allows the model to adapt to the latest market trends. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we use a case study of assessing real properties in small towns. A structured DNN was designed to match with a layered knowledge graph for property assessments in the real estate domain, which results in a significant reduction of neurons and connections between them. The experimental results show that a structured DNN outperforms conventional multivariate linear regression models, fully-connected neural networks, and prediction methods used by the leading real estate companies.},

Firstly, the psychological crisis level is discriminated by using ISOMAP algorithm and K-means algorithm. Then the logistic regression is modeled to estimate the influence coefficient of each factor. Finally, the above models were used to assess each individual's psychological states. The results show that the classification performance of machine learning algorithm is better than that of the traditional norm.

The method of manually detecting a large number of resistance has the disadvantages of low efficiency and poor reliability, studies have shown that the size of the data set has a decisive impact on the performance of the deep learning-based method, and small data sets usually produce an overfitting phenomenon. In view of these problems, the paper design the overall structure of the appearance detection method of resistances with generative adversarial neural network enhanced data set, and appearance detection method of resistances based on deep learning is proposed. First, input the predicted resistance image, perform prediction through the established convolutional neural network model, and finally output its result.

abstract={Currently the availability of medical images data itself is not a challenge, but the acquisition of relevant annotations/labelling for these images is. An unsolved challenge in medical image analysis and its related radiology reports is to turn the radiology reports into an accurate annotations or structured labels in an automated manner using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Traditional rule-based Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are two approaches which were used in the extraction and annotation of radiology text reports. This paper provides a comparison of the performance of traditional rule-based machine learning to that of using deep learning algorithms in the extraction and annotation of radiology text reports using natural language processing (NLP). It presents an accurate analysis of the two discussed approaches and supports such with critical evidence related to the effects both approaches have on the issue of radiological reporting. According to the evaluation of the obtained data, the research concludes that Deep Learning (DL) models perform with higher efficiency than both the TML and validated NLP classifiers in terms of accuracy in extracting the required text information from the free-text radiology reports.},

abstract={The advancement of deep learning has facilitated rapid progress in person re-identification (re-id) task. Its applications in intelligent video surveillance made it a key component of today's smart cities infrastructure. Person re-id task is aimed to identify the person in distributed camera setup with non-overlapping views. The feature extraction process is an important part of person re-id technique. The present state of art methods mostly used ResNet as a backbone for feature extraction, which results in low geometric transformation modeling and low-resolution representation learning. We addressed these two major challenges by integrating deformable convolution module to enhance the transformation modeling capability and replaced the traditional ResNet backbone for person re-id with the novel feature extraction network named as HRNet, which is based on high-resolution representation learning without any additional supervision. The verification of our approach performance is done by conducting an experiment on a person re-id dataset named Market-1501. We achieved 90.57% Rank-1 accuracy and 75.43% mAP, outperforming the ResNet baseline results, which confirmed the effectiveness of our approach and will have a promising future in person re-id.},

abstract={In the past few years, edge computing has brought tremendous convenience to the development of smart cities, releasing computation pressure to edge compute nodes. However, a series of problems, such as the explosive growth of smart devices and limited spectrum resources, still greatly limit the application of edge computing. Different types of end devices generate and collect multimodal information, and substantial data is transmitted to upper nodes. Multimodal machine learning methods process data at edge nodes, and only high-level features are uploaded to the cloud in order to save bandwidth. In this article, we propose a novel multimodal data processing framework based on multiple attention mechanisms. Two distinct attention mechanisms are used to capture inter and intra-modality dependencies and align different modalities together. We conduct experiments on image captioning, a core research hotspot in multimodal machine learning. A unified hierarchical structure extracts features from images and natural language. Matching attention aligns visual and textual information. Besides, we propose a new attention mechanism, positional attention, which finds the relationship of each element within one sensory modality. The hierarchical structure realizes parallel computation in the training phase and speeds up the training of the model. Experiments and analysis demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, proving the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract={In smart cities, the business location is an important component of the complex decision process for the entrepreneurs. If a business such as shopping center, restau-rant, coffee shop, hospital, clothing etc. is opened in optimal location; not only the satisfaction level of the customers are enhanced with increased life quality and convenience, but also it maximizes the profit of the entrepreneurs. However, it is complex and long-term decision to find optimal location for a business. Therefore; we propose a smart business application that uses machine learning techniques to estimate the location of a business. The proposed system collects key feature values for a specific business and learns a prediction model for future data. It estimates features and suggests clusters of districts that have optimal locations for that specific business. The proposed system is evaluated on a use case that estimates the best possible locations of a restaurant according to main characteristics taken as inputs from entrepreneurs via a Web based application. These characteristics are Meal Price per customer, HouseHold Type, Gender, and Age. The first phase of decision process is estimating mentioned features such as House Price per district and local population belonging to different HouseHold type, Gender, and Age with less error rates for the consecutive years. Here; we determine an optimal regression model choosing from SMORegression (SMOReg), MultiLayerPerceptron (MLP), and multivariate Linear Regression (Linear) according to Relative Absolute Error (RAE %) parameter, for each feature. The second phase clusters districts according to these estimated features by using hierarchical tree. As a result; the estimated best suggestions for restaurant locations which have similar features, are shown to entrepreneurs via our Web based application. It should be noted that, the application can produce generic solution for the needs of entrepreneurs.},

abstract={The development of smart cities and their fast-paced deployment is resulting in the generation of large quantities of data at unprecedented rates. Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.},

abstract={Smart city communication networks hold the promise of harnessing the Internet of Things, smart devices, intelligent energy grids, autonomous cars, and many other data architectures to improve quality of life for every citizen. As time and progress have gradually shifted this concept from an idea into a reality, the possibilities for what services a smart city might provide have exploded. Along with that expansion, the number of devices that may need to be supported across a communications network has multiplied enormously. However, existing congestion control protocols are not equipped to support this higher requirement for network performance. New protocols are needed to provide higher data throughputs, reduce queuing delays and packet loss, and maintain stable and reliable communications pathways. The end-to-end congestion control protocol presented in this article does all these things. Called high throughput congestion control (HTCC), the framework takes full advantage of reinforcement learning and a fast growth algorithm to adaptively control the bytes in flight across the network's links to suit the prevailing network conditions. The result is a protocol that not only finds the optimal tradeoff between throughput, latency, and packet loss, but also significantly speeds up the learning process to avoid wasting network resources, use all free bandwidth and maximize network utilization. A comprehensive set of experiments with HTCC and six state-of-the-art protocols-Copa, PCC Vivace, PCC-Allegro, TCP Cubic, TaoVA-100x, and FillP-Sheep-demonstrate that, in most conditions, HTCC is able to make the best tradeoff between throughput, delay, and loss rate.},

abstract={The quick and accurate identification of criminal activity is paramount to securing any residence. With the rapid growth of smart cities, the integration of crime detection systems seeks to improve this security. In the past a strong reliance has been put on standard video surveillance in order to achieve this goal. This often creates a backlog of video data that must be monitored by a supervising official. For large urban areas, this creates a increasingly large workload for supervising officials which leads to an increase in error rate. Solutions have been implemented to help reduce the workload. Currently, auto regressive models have been used to better forecast criminal acts, but also have a list of shortcomings. We propose a solution of using neural networks in combination with a Hybrid Deep Learning algorithm to analyze video stream data. Our system will be able to quickly identify and assess criminal activity which will in turn reduce workloads on the supervising officials. When implemented across smart city infrastructure it will allow for a efficient and adaptable crime detection system.},

However, legacy approaches to estimating or predicting traffic flow fall short in pursuing urban-scale realtime traffic flow. In this paper, we turn to a new idea: deploying lightweight deep learning on smartphone-like mobile edge devices to achieve realtime traffic flow estimation in urban scale. Specifically, we design a cloud-free system, Deeput, which resides in mobile edge devices and listens to vehicular traffic noise along roads. Locally at these devices, Deeput maps the recorded traffic noise into spectrograms, and then, infers realtime traffic flow from these spectrograms by a novel deep learning model. We build a prototype of Deeput that can smoothly run on Android smartphone, and the experimental results show Deeput’s efficacy and efficiency. The Deeput designs are also insightful for realizing urban-scale, realtime applications that require or target on-edge intelligence.},

Many approaches that use traffic time series data to predict traffic flow have been proposed. In addition to traffic- specific parameters, some other features (called signatures) may be associated with road traffic, i.e., air and noise pollution. In this paper, we show how noise pollution and traffic time-series data were used to train Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which led to better traffic prediction on major roads in Madrid. This approach has already been used with pollution signatures. This work addresses a new potential investigation path closely related to the use of signature profiles and Artificial Intelligent techniques as a way to reduce the specialization of sensing infrastructure.},

abstract={Urban informatization applications are getting better and better, and smart cities are now taking shape because of the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, mobile Internet, and other new technologies. Smart cities allow information about a city's economic viability and culture to be shared and transmitted more rapidly. There is an increase in interconnection and communication using this method. People's living standards will rise because of the government's increased management and service capabilities. As smart cities become more common, new data sources, such as user behavior, preferences, and other insights, will be developed. A lot of data mining and analysis will be required. Urban informatization and industrialization will be achieved by implementing new information technology into a wide range of industries around the city. Efficiencies in urban management and the quality of life for residents will be enhanced by this reform. Many parts of city planning might be called “smart,” including transportation, health care, public safety, and education. Machine learning methods are being used to detect abnormalities in SMD Screen data, which includes information on all networking protocols. SMD LEDs used in LED displays are the subject of this research, which focuses on the most common causes of failure. When it comes to SMD LEDs' wet stress, antistatic capabilities, and hidden circuitry defects, we thoroughly inspect them. Following this research, we offer practical preventive solutions based on machine learning categorization models.},

abstract={Technology is being adopted by many municipalities to improve their services and operations through so-called “smart city applications”. Development of these smart city applications are increasingly looking to leverage edge and cloud computing to support these initiatives. This approach brings a number of challenges, including the allocation of tasks to that process data from sensors to computing systems, dealing with the data that may be time sensitive, handling frequently starting and finishing tasks, dynamically changing resource utilization of computing elements, etc. This paper focuses on the challenge of allocating tasks to resources to try to ensure balanced loads on processing elements in dynamic environments. A reinforcement learning approach is introduced to address this problem. The reinforcement learning agent uses a novel Multi-Observation Single-State model based on observed features from multiple sources at a single step. A model of a smart city computational infrastructure is introduced and is used to define our reinforcement learning algorithm for task allocation. We illustrate the agent behavior through simulations.},

abstract={This paper develops deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms for optimizing the operation of home energy system which consists of photovoltaics (PV) panels, battery energy storage system, and household appliances. Model-free DRL algorithms can efficiently handle the difficulty of energy system modeling and uncertainty of PV generation. However, discrete-continuous hybrid action space of the considered home energy system challenges existing DRL algorithms for either discrete actions or continuous actions. The proposed mixed deep reinforcement learning (MDRL) algorithm integrates deep Q-learning (DQL) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) that the DQL algorithm deals with discrete actions while the DDPG algorithm handles continuous actions. The MDRL algorithm learns optimal strategy by trial-and-error interactions with the environment. However, unsafe actions, which violate system constraints, can give rise to great cost. To handle such problem, a safe-MDRL algorithm is further proposed. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed MDRL algorithm can efficiently handle the challenge from discrete-continuous hybrid action space for home energy management. The MDRL algorithm reduces operational cost while maintains human thermal comfort by comparing with benchmarking methods on the test dataset. Moreover, the safe-MDRL algorithm greatly reduces the loss of thermal comfort in the learning stage by the MDRL algorithm.},

abstract={Governments around the globe are promoting smart city applications to enhance the quality of daily-life activities in urban areas. Smart cities include internet-enabled devices that are used by applications like health care, power grid, water treatment, traffic control, etc to enhance its effectiveness. The expansion in the quantity of Internet-of-things (IoT) based botnet attacks is due to the growing trend of Internet-enabled devices. To provide advanced cyber security solutions to IoT devices and smart city applications, this paper proposes a deep learning (DL) based botnet detection system that works on network traffic flows. The botnet detection framework collects the network traffic flows, converts them into connection records and uses a DL model to detect attacks emanating from the compromised IoT devices. To determine an optimal DL model, many experiments are conducted on well-known and recently released benchmark data sets. Further, the datasets are visualized to understand its characteristics. The proposed DL model outperformed the conventional machine learning (ML) models.},

abstract={Demand response management in smart cities is one of the most challenging tasks to be performed due to the continuous changes in the load profile of the home users. The existing proposals in the literature fail to observe the hidden patterns in the load profile of these users. So, to fill these gaps, the concept of deep learning has been used in this paper for smart energy management in a smart city. The consumption data from smart homes (SHs) is gathered and taken as an input to the deep learning model, convolution neural network (CNN). The CNN model learns the hidden patterns in the data and outputs different load curves. These load curves are then used to train a support vector regression (SVR) model, which predicts the overall load consumption of all SHs in the smart city. This prediction is then compared with the power generation from the grid and consequently the demand response (DR) of the connected SHs is managed so as to minimize the gap between predicted demand and supply. The proposed scheme has been evaluated on the dataset collected from PJM and open energy information with respect to load demand prediction and DR management. The results obtained prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme. The prediction errors, i.e., root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error are observed less in comparison to the cases when CNN and SVR are used individually.},

In the first level of the framework, the similarity measures of DNS queries are estimated using siamese networks based on a predefined threshold for selecting the most frequent DNS information across Ethernet connections. In the second level of the framework, a domain generation algorithm based on deep learning architectures is suggested for categorizing normal and abnormal domain names. The framework is highly scalable on a commodity hardware server due to its potential design of analyzing DNS data. The proposed framework was evaluated using two datasets and was compared with recent deep learning models. Various visualization methods were also employed to understand the characteristics of the dataset and to visualize the embedding features. The experimental results revealed substantial improvements in terms of F1-score, speed of detection, and false alarm rate.},

abstract={In smart cities, violence event detection is critical to ensure city safety. Several studies have been done on this topic with a focus on 2d-Convolutional Neural Network (2d-CNN) to detect spatial features from each frame, followed by one of the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) variants as a temporal features learning method. On the other hand, the transformer network has achieved a great result in many areas. The bottleneck for transformers is the need for large data set to achieve good results. In this work, we propose a data-efficient video transformer (DeVTr) based on the transformer network as a Spatio-temporal learning method with a pre-trained 2d-Convolutional neural network (2d-CNN) as an embedding layer for the input data. The model has been trained and tested on the Real-life violence dataset (RLVS) and achieved an accuracy of 96.25%. A comparison of the result for the suggested method with previous techniques illustrated that the suggested method provides the best result among all the other studies for violence event detection.},

abstract={Traffic congestion on urban road networks has increased substantially during the last decade, characterized by slower speeds, longer travel times, increased vehicular queuing, and increased pollution. The main pain point in traffic management is the static nature of our city structures that cannot adapt to the traffic dynamics changing throughout the day. This work focuses on a futuristic smart city design where making structural changes to the city graph is possible. These changes include modifying number of lanes, opening or closing the ramps, and changing signal timings on road segments. We also assume the local observability of the system where sensors can provide all the data needed for decision making. Under these assumptions, we propose a multi agent reinforcement learning framework for improving traffic flow in city networks. Our learning agents observe their assigned environment and find the best structural changes based on a set of features that represent the recent traffic condition, dependent road segment characteristics, recent structural modifications, etc. Our results show that the proposed framework improves the total travel time (TTT) by 31.5% during rush hours in Salt Lake City area.},

abstract={A smart city can be defined as a city that uses distributed sensors to monitor and control the urban environment by collecting real-time information. Using such smart devices improves the quality of living and facilitates the process of decision making. Smart cities provide solutions to environmental issues such as amount of wastage, energy consumption, traffic congestion, and pollution. The traffic issue is a one important concern in any city due to the increasing number of populations using vehicles which lead to traffic congestions, accidents, and delays. Traffic issues can also cause a high level of pollution and fuel consumption. To solve such issues, roads should be managed by monitoring, analyzing and predicting the traffic flow. In this research, we propose a machine learning based model for traffic flow prediction in smart cities, particularly in the context of “NEOM” megacity that is born from Saudi Arabia's vision of 2030. The proposed model combines previous methods of traffic prediction to produce robust traffic prediction model that can be used in NEOM megacity to achieve better traffic management.},

One of them is the development of techniques and services capable of contributing to the enhancement of security public policies. Finding criminal patterns from historical data would arguably help in predicting and even preventing thefts and burglaries that continuously increase in urban centers worldwide. However, accessing such history and finding patterns across the interrelated crime occurrences data are challenging tasks, particularly to underdevelopment countries. In this paper, we address these problems by combining three techniques: we collect crime data from existing crowd-sourcing systems, we automatically induce patterns with relational machine learning, and we manage the entire process using scientific workflows. The framework developed under these lines is named CRiMINaL (Crime patteRn MachINe Learning). Experimental results conducted from a popular Brazilian source of data and a traditional relational learning system shows that CRiMINaL is a promising tool to induce interpretable models that can assist police departments on crime prevention.},

Deep learning has been used to model the human driver capabilities for the autonomous taxi. A hierarchical Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture has been utilized to train various driving aspects. In first level, the proposed DNN architecture classifies the straight and turning of road. A parallel DNN is used to detect obstacle at level one. In second level, the DNN discriminates the turning i.e. left or right for steering and speed controls. Two multi layered DNNs have been used on Nvidia Tesla K 40 GPU based system with Core i-7 processor.

abstract={As a key pillar of smart transportation in smart city applications, electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular for their contribution in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One of the key challenges, however, is the strain on power grid infrastructure that comes with large-scale EV deployment. The solution to this lies in utilization of smart scheduling algorithms to manage the growing public charging demand. Using data-driven tools and machine learning algorithms to learn the EV charging behavior can improve scheduling algorithms. Researchers have focused on using historical charging data for predictions of behavior such as departure time and energy needs. However, variables such as weather, traffic, and nearby events, which have been neglected to a large extent, can perhaps add meaningful representations, and provide better predictions. Therefore, in this paper we propose the usage of historical charging data in conjunction with weather, traffic, and events data to predict EV session duration and energy consumption using popular machine learning algorithms including random forest, SVM, XGBoost and deep neural networks. The best predictive performance is achieved by an ensemble learning model, with SMAPE scores of 9.9% and 11.6% for session duration and energy consumptions, respectively, which improves upon the existing works in the literature. In both predictions, we demonstrate a significant improvement compared to previous work on the same dataset and we highlight the importance of traffic and weather information for charging behavior predictions.},

abstract={With rapid development of compelling application scenarios of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as smart cities, it becomes substantially important to strengthen the management of data traffic in IoT networks. Traffic classification is beneficial in terms of both ensuring network security and improving quality of service. Traditional IoT traffic classification methods separate the classification algorithm and the design of feature engineering, which includes feature extraction and feature selection. Then, traffic identification or classification is performed by combining both. This paper proposes an end-to-end IoT traffic classification method relying on a deep learning aided capsule network for the sake of forming an efficient classification mechanism that integrates feature extraction, feature selection, and classification model. Our proposed traffic classification method beneficially eliminates the process of manually selecting traffic features, and is particularly applicable to smart city scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that capsule networks have been used in the context of traffic classification. Experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed traffic classification mechanism, which yields high classification accuracy.},

These security threats sometime put their private information at risk. In order to prevent these security threats on websites, Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHAs) are generated, as a form of security mechanism to protect the citizens' private information. But with the advancement of deep learning, text-based CAPTCHAs can sometimes be vulnerable. As a result, it is essential to conduct performance evaluation on the CAPTCHAs that are generated before they are deployed on multimedia web applications. Therefore, this work proposed an optimal and light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical complex text-based CAPTCHAs simultaneously. The accuracy of the proposed CNN model has been accelerated based on Cyclical Learning Rates (CLRs) policy. The proposed CLR-CNN model achieved a high accuracy to solve both numerical and alpha-numerical text-based CAPTCHAs of 99.87% and 99.66%, respectively. In real-time, we observed that the speed of the model has increased, the model is lightweight, stable, and flexible as compared to other CAPTCHA solving techniques. The result of this current work will increase awareness and will assist multimedia security Researchers to continue and develop more robust text-based CAPTCHAs with their security mechanisms capable of protecting the private information of citizens in Smart Cities.},

abstract={The article is devoted to the analysis of the use of ubiquitous computing and distributed machine learning in smart cities. Smart city is characterized by the introduction of high-tech infrastructure, digital services, integrated information monitoring systems that allow to optimize the environment and processes of urban management. The most promising direction of smart cities development is the implementation of ubiquitous computing systems. Ubiquitous computing involves the introduction of a significant number of technologies, including sensors, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, network robots. Since ubiquitous computing is based on the processing of data generated by different devices, the new solutions are needed to structure and ensure data compatibility. Such solutions are the distributed machine learning methods: stochastic gradient descent and K-means method. The work separately considers the use of federated training, which has advantages in data privacy and mobile computing. The article deals with the main provisions of the concept of smart city, technologies of ubiquitous computing, features of methods of distributed machine learning and their introduction into urban systems management.},

On the one hand, depthwise separable convolution and activation function Mish are introduced to speed up the network training and recognition speed and reduce the requirements for hardware devices; on the other hand, through the improvement of network architecture and level, the size and number of convolution cores are reasonably changed to enhance the expression and transmission of image features. The experimental results on the traffic sign dataset of Belgium TSC show that the improved network significantly improves the network training speed, and the recognition accuracy is slightly higher than that of the original network, which verifies the effectiveness of the improved method. Compared with other models, this model can complete the task of traffic sign recognition more quickly and accurately, which verifies the feasibility of this method.},

abstract={The prediction of traffic excesses (traffic congestions and traffic accidents) is become a very important topic for many cities and regions. The number of cars in cities and the total traffic volumes in cities are increasing over time, and solutions will be needed to eliminate traffic accidents and prevent secondary excesses. This will ideally lead to time savings for transport users and, above all, to an increase in the safety, fluidity and environmental performance of the transport itself. The article deals with a research activity that aims to develop a separate module in the form of a traffic application that will be able to predict traffic excesses. The neural networks were the main tool for the development of traffic applications for prediction, namely multilayer neural networks with activation function sigmoidou. With regard to the focus of the conference Smart City, the article does not focus on extensive development and testing of neural network, but primarily on the description of the functionalities of the result, including a critical commentary on the problems of the current state of the application.

abstract={Smart cities endeavor to deliver safe and sustainable infrastructure services that enable individuals, organizations, and communities alike to be productive, healthy, informed, and actively involved in rapid urbanization. The widespread installation of closed-circuit television cameras and continuously generated video streams are a strategic data source that can contribute toward safety and sustainability through efficient surveillance of smart city assets and resources. Recent advances in deep learning methods are able to detect and localize salient objects in a video stream. However, a number of practical issues remain unaddressed, such as suboptimality, latency, predictive accuracy, and most importantly the contextualization of all detected salient objects for informed decisions that aligns with ethical surveillance. In this article, we propose a Generative Latent Space (GenLS) approach that overcomes these challenges, specifically in road surveillance. We demonstrate an adaptation of this approach for a prominent use-case in road surveillance, License Plate Detection. GenLS was evaluated for accuracy, robustness, computational cost, and cogency, using a state-of-the-art benchmark dataset on road traffic. Results from these experiments and the corresponding ablation study validate GenLS and confirm its suitability for real-time smart city road surveillance.},

However, with advancements in technology, automated Colourisation systems have been created. Apart from the aesthetic appeal, such capability has broad practical applications ranging from video restoration to image enhancement for improved comprehensibility. However, these current systems face some major challenges, such as - Colour inconsistency within individual objects, under/over-saturation, and green tones in bright environments.

abstract={Smart city systems are increasingly built with data analytics and machine learning techniques, basing on massive data sets. They have a heavy impact on human behavior and quality of life, and thus need to deliver a controllable and sufficiently transparent experience for the users.The aim of my work is to make smart city systems more interoperable and explainable, involving data visualization and communication techniques, sensor data processing, as well as the associated intelligent data value chain production and consumption. Here, the data and the information are shared employing Knowledge Graphs, that are becoming a key enabler for large-scale processing of massive collections of interrelated facts. Examples include the Google Knowledge Graph with dozens of billion facts, dataCommons, DBPedia, YAGO, and Knowledge Vault, a very large scale probabilistic knowledge graph created with information extraction methods for unstructured or semi-structured information. Specifically, Knowledge Graphs provide the means of development of the newest methods for data management, data fusion, data merging, and graph and network optimization and modeling, serving as a source of high quality data and a base for information integration.In particular, Knowledge Graphs help to infer new relationships out of existing facts, giving context and meaning to the content, and can be used in applications. For example, the data generated by a computer vision system could be semantically represented and shared across numerous systems, taking into account the needs and requirements of these systems, as well as the context, provenance, licensing and consent aspects of the generated data. I demonstrate Knowledge Graphs-based methods in advanced smart city applications from the domains such as automation and construction of buildings, energy efficiency, tourism, transport.},

abstract={A smart city is emerging as an application of information and communication technologies to mitigate the problems generated by the urban population growth. One of the smart city solutions is to establish an efficient fleet management relating to the use of a fleet of vehicles (e.g., ambulances and police vehicles). The most basic function in a fleet management system is the real time vehicle tracking component. This component is usually the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) or the integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). To predict the position, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is generally applied using the sensor's measures and the GPS position as a helper. However, the DGPS high cost solution still suffers from GPS satellite signals loss due to multipath errors and the INS require more complex computing. Furthermore, the EKF performance depends on the vehicle dynamic variations and may quickly diverge because of environment changes (i.e, GPS failures by obstructions from building and trees). In this paper, we present a robust low cost approach using EKF and neural networks (NN) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reliably estimate the real time vehicle position using GPS enhanced with low cost Dead Reckoning (DR) sensors. While GPS signals are available, we train the NN with GA on different dynamics and outage times to learn the position errors so we can correct the future EKF predictions during GPS signal outages. We obtain empirically an improvement of up to 95% over the simple EKF predictions in case of GPS failures.},

Hence, this paper proposes a novel deep learning algorithm called DeepVDD to facilitate vehicle-assisted data delivery. First, a theoretical analysis is presented to quantitatively reveal the correlation between vehicle mobility and the success ratio of vehicle-assisted data delivery. Based on the findings in analysis, DeepVDD adopts a novel multi-headed neural network to determine the strategies for vehicles to deliver data. Comprehensive evaluations have been executed based on the real taxi mobility data in Tokyo, Japan. The results have validated that, compared with other state-of-art algorithms, DeepVDD not only improves the success ratio of data delivery, but also significantly reduces the communication overhead of vehicular networks.},

abstract={The development of smart technology and smart cities has solved the problem of data islands, but it has also brought about information security problems. Federated learning provides solutions to information security problems, which is a new machine learning method that effectively protects the local privacy of edge devices by distributing models to edge devices for training. However, due to malicious attacks from malicious edge devices, the accuracy and efficiency of federated learning are greatly compromised. Therefore, to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a reputation-aware method based on reinforcement learning (RA-RL) to select edge devices to ensure that the federated learning process is not attacked. Specifically, we introduce a reputation measurement scheme to evaluate the reputation of edge devices and use it as one of the features of edge devices. Then extract the feature matrix of candidate edge devices as the RL training environment to calculate the probability of each edge device is selected, and finally use the greedy algorithm to determine the devices that will eventually participate in the federated learning. Simulation experiments show that the RA-RL algorithm can effectively solve the training data security problem in federated learning, and is superior to other algorithms in terms of load balance, efficiency and accuracy.},

abstract={Today’s smart city infrastructure is predominantly dependant on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. IoT technology essentially facilitates a platform for service automation through connections of heterogeneous objects via the Internet backbone. However, the security issues associated with IoT networks make smart city infrastructure vulnerable to cyber-attacks. For example, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack violates the authorization conditions in smart city infrastructure; whereas replay attack violates the authentication conditions in smart city infrastructure. Both attacks lead to physical disruption to smart city infrastructure, which may even lead to financial loss and/or loss of human lives. In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model is developed for detecting replay and DDoS attacks in a real life smart city platform. The performance of the proposed hybrid model is evaluated using real life smart city datasets (environmental, smart river and smart soil), where DDoS and replay attacks were simulated. The proposed model reported high accuracy rates: 98.37% for the environmental dataset, 98.13% for the smart river dataset, and 99.51% for the smart soil dataset. The results demonstrated an improved performance of the proposed model over other machine learning and deep learning models from the literature.},

The performance of the algorithms was assessed in terms of accuracy, trustworthy and speed. The data sets were provided by Transport for London (TfL) and the UK MetOffice. We employed a random sample of some 1,800,000 instances, comprising six individual datasets, which we analysed on the WEKA platform. The results revealed that there were a high degree of correlations between weather-based attributes and the Big Data being analysed. Notable observations were that, on average, the decision tree J48 algorithm performed best in terms of accuracy while the kNN IBK algorithm was the fastest to build models. Finally we suggest IoT Smart City applications that may benefit from our work.},

abstract={In modern manufacturing industry featured with automation and flexibility, the intelligent tool management for Computer Numeric Control (CNC) machine plays an essential role in manufacturing automation. The automatic tool recognition in terms of geometric shapes, materials and usage functions could facilitate the seamless integration with downstream process planning and scheduling processes. In this paper, a intelligent tool recognition system is proposed with a novel hybrid framework of multi-channel deep learning network with non-iterative and fast feedforward neural network to meet high efficiency and accuracy requirement in intelligent manufacturing. The combination of the fine-tuning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the random parameter assignment mechanism of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) reach a balance in accurate feature extraction and fast recognition. In the proposed hybrid framework, features extracted from efficient CNNs are aggregated into robust ELM auto-encoders (ELM-AEs) to generate the compact but rich feature information, which are then feed to the subsequent single layer ELM network for tool recognition. The performance of proposed framework is verified on several standardized 3D shape retrieval and classification dataset, as well as on a self-constructed multi-view 3D data represented tool library database. Numerical experiments reveal a promising application perspective of proposed intelligent recognition system on manufacturing automation.},

abstract={The efficient management of a smart city and the improvement of the quality of humans' every-day life are becoming challenging problems due to smart cities' increased heterogeneity and complexity. In this paper, we present a novel socio-physical human orchestration framework to deal with the aforementioned issues, by capitalizing on recent advances in game theory and reinforcement learning. Initially, each human selects, in a distributed manner, a Point of Interest (PoI) that it wants to visit, by acting as stochastic learning automaton, exploiting the socio-physical conditions of the environment while learning from its previous experiences. As a result, those humans that have selected a specific PoI to visit, "compete" with each other in order to finally perform their visit. The humans' behavior is studied as a non-cooperative game among them, via adopting the theory of minority games, while the concluding Nash equilibrium point identifies the humans that will finally visit each PoI. A low complexity algorithm is introduced to realize the overall framework, while the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through modeling and simulation under several scenarios, and its superiority is demonstrated.},
