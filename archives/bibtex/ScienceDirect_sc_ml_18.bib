abstract = {With the deployment of 5G, researchers and experts begin to look forward to 6G. They predict that 6G will be the key driving force for information interaction and social life after 2030. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), 6G will be a highly autonomous closed-loop network, and will make up for 5G's shortcomings in communications, computing and global coverage, achieving “AI of things (AIoT)”. In 6G life, vehicles may become another indispensable devices for people besides smartphones, and non-polluting, highly safe as well as full-autonomous vehicles will be the goal of vehicular development. In order to ensure the safe driving of future vehicles and meet the entertainment needs of passengers, it is necessary to investigate future 6G vehicular intelligence. In this paper, we will discuss its networking, communications, computing and intelligence, look into future technological developments and applications, and identify forthcoming challenges and research directions.}

abstract = {The paper addresses the throughput of an urban signalized intersection when the traffic flow structure varies widely. In the course of the study, data were collected from a street CCTV camera tracking traffic flows at a single intersection. At the preliminary step during the analysis of the dynamics of vehicles passing the intersection when leaving the queue that formed in front of the red light, it was found that it significantly changes for different types of vehicles. Therefore, the next step was to develop a statistically significant mathematical model of the intersection throughput as a multiple regression equation including all vehicle types under consideration. This model gave us various predictive estimates with the traffic flow structure varied. To obtain a visual representation of the results, we tested a model of category-based traffic flow at the intersection, built on the basis of fuzzy logic methods. This model allowed us to estimate the intersection throughput depending on some uncertain traffic flow factors in a graphic 3D view. The study was oriented towards the development of an algorithm to analyze the time required for a heterogeneous queue of vehicles to pass the intersection in real time. The algorithm can be used in intelligent transportation systems, in particular, in problems related to uninterrupted traffic of unmanned vehicles. The models considered may serve as a good basis for justified decisions on improving the vehicle-to-infrastructure communication (V2I).}

The identification of attacks or unknown behavior through Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has established itself as a conducive and mandatory mechanism apart from the protection by cryptographic schemes in a holistic security eco-system. In systems where resources are valuable goods and stand in contrast to the ever increasing amount of network traffic, sampling has become a useful utility in order to detect malicious activities on a manageable amount of data. In this work an algorithm – Uncoupled MAC – is presented which secures network communication through a cryptographic scheme by uncoupled Message Authentication Codes (MAC) but as a side effect also provides IDS functionality producing alarms based on the violation of Uncoupled MAC values. Through a novel self-regulation extension, the algorithm adapts it’s sampling parameters based on the detection of malicious actions. The evaluation in a virtualized environment clearly shows that the detection rate increases over runtime for different attack scenarios. Those even cover scenarios in which intelligent attackers try to exploit the downsides of sampling.}

However, detecting stress in real life with an unobtrusive wrist device is a challenging task. The objective of this study is to develop a method for stress detection that can accurately, continuously and unobtrusively monitor psychological stress in real life. First, we explore the problem of stress detection using machine learning and signal processing techniques in laboratory conditions, and then we apply the extracted laboratory knowledge to real-life data. We propose a novel context-based stress-detection method. The method consists of three machine-learning components: a laboratory stress detector that is trained on laboratory data and detects short-term stress every 2min; an activity recognizer that continuously recognizes the user’s activity and thus provides context information; and a context-based stress detector that uses the outputs of the laboratory stress detector, activity recognizer and other contexts, in order to provide the final decision on 20-min intervals. Experiments on 55days of real-life data showed that the method detects (recalls) 70% of the stress events with a precision of 95%.}

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are developed significantly from the last decades and attracted the attention of scientific and industrial domains. In WSNs, sensor nodes distributed autonomously in harsh environments are easily vulnerable to faults and attacks that cause sensor readings unreliable and inaccurate. In this scenario, sensor readings that have differed considerably from healthy behaviors will be considered abnormal data or anomalies/outliers. The inclusion of such outliers in data analytics will inevitably affect the outcome of the decision-making process. Thus, detecting outliers in WSNs using data-driven approaches becomes a novel technique among the Machine Learning (ML) communities. Meanwhile, various research issues are there in measuring the performance of the deployed ML algorithms in detecting outliers in WSNs, which generally contains minimum resources in terms of computational capability and power sources to ensure data quality. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art Statistical and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques used in WSNs to detect outliers in the view of architecture, type, degree, approach, and detection mode. Furthermore, each aforementioned outlier detection approach is presented with detailed discussions and future scope for developments.}

Specifically, the common features are firstly extracted from the lower layers of CNN. Then, based on the common features, the expression-specific features (ESF) are respectively learned for each facial expression via multi-task learning. In order to enhance the discriminability of ESF, we develop a joint loss (the combination of the center loss and a novel inter-class loss) to explicitly reduce intra-class variations while enlarging inter-class differences. Furthermore, we introduce the sample-sensitive weights and the soft-expression weights to balance the joint loss for better performance. Finally, all ESFs are combined for final classification. ETFL effectively exploits the relationship among all facial expressions, which leads to superiority feature discriminability. Experiments on public facial expression databases demonstrate the effectiveness of ETFL compared with several state-of-the-art methods.}

A promising approach to solve the RA problem is the use of learning mechanisms, specially Q-learning (QL) algorithm, where the devices learn about the best time-slot periods to transmit through rewards sent by the central node. In this work, we propose a distributed packet-based learning method of varying the reward given by the central node that favors devices having a larger number of remaining packets to transmit. The numerical results indicated that the proposed distributed packet-based QL method attains a better throughput-latency trade-off than the independent and collaborative techniques in practical scenarios, while the number of payload bits of the packet-based technique is reduced regarding the collaborative QL RA technique for achieving the same normalized throughput.}

Intelligent modeling of fake task submissions is required to enable the development of effective defense mechanisms against location-based clogging attacks with fake task submissions. An intelligent strategy for fake task submission would aim to maximize the impact on the participants of an MCS system. With this in mind, this paper introduces new algorithms exploiting the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) to identify attack locations where fake sensing tasks submitted to an MCS platform are centered around. The proposed SOFM-based model addresses issues in the previously proposed SOFM-based attack models by proposing two ways of refinement. When compared to the former models, which also use SOFM architectures, simulation results show that up to 139.9% of impact improvement can be modeled under the reconfigurable SOFM architectures.}

This decision becomes even more complex when a supplier is considered as a distinctive participant in decision making model. In the bricks and mortar mode of retailing, retailers are more powerful than suppliers in getting the required goods in the required quantity. However, this is not the case for small scale e-tailers. Such e-tailers are faced with situations where large-scale retailers indirectly force the suppliers to refuse supplying to them. In such cases, effective AP decision making approaches are needed for small scale e-tailers to get the required goods to satisfy the customers’ demand. While current advancement in smart cities provide a powerful platform and support for successful operations of online retailing, this needs to be supported by appropriated modeling approaches that assist the e-tailer in getting their required product assortment. In this paper, a game-theoretic model is developed to support the small scale e-tailer in AP decision making. Such that it has two strategies to decide from. The first strategy is that it can offer the product with supreme quality by procuring it from the main powerful supplier and the second strategy is to offer the product from a less popular brand. The first strategy is modeled as a non-cooperative Stackelberg supply chain in which the supplier plays a leader and the e-tailer is a follower and the second strategy is modeled as an assortment planning problem while considering utility degradation of providing alternative brand to the customers. Various analyses are done to find the best strategy in different scenarios before recommending the best strategy to be followed by the e-tailer in given situations.}

This Perspective Essay takes up this discussion by asking how a digital approach to UGI planning and management mediates the configuration and development of UGI and to whose benefit? This is done through a review of key issues and trends in digital approaches to UGI planning and management. We first conceptualize automation from a social, ecological, and technological interactions perspective and use this lens to present an overview of the risks and opportunities of UGI automation with respect to selected case studies. Results of this analysis are used to develop a conceptual framework for the assessment of the material and governance implications of automated UGIs. We find that, within any given perspective, the automation of UGI entails a complex dialectic between efficiency, human agency and empowerment. Further, risks and opportunities associated with UGI automation are not fixed but are dynamic properties of changing contextual tensions concerning power, actors, rules of the game and discourse at multiple scales. We conclude the paper by outlining a research agenda on how to consider different digital advances within a social-ecological-technological approach.}

Among the different challenges OEMs (i.e. the vehicle manufacturers) are facing, vehicles are evolving into systems of systems. In fact, over the last years vehicles have evolved from disconnected and “blind” systems to systems that are (i) able to sense the surrounding environment and (ii) connected with other vehicles, the city, pedestrians, cyclists, etc. Future transportation systems can be seen as a System of Systems (SoS). In an SoS, constituent systems, i.e. the units that compose an SoS, can act as standalone systems, but their cooperation enables new emerging and promising scenarios. While this trend creates new opportunities, it also poses a risk to compromise key qualities such as safety, security, and privacy. In this paper we focus on the automotive domain and we investigate how to engineer and architect cars in order to build them as constituents of future transportation systems. Our contribution is an architectural viewpoint for System of Systems, which we demonstrate based on an automotive example. Moreover, we contribute a functional reference architecture for cars as constituents of an SoS. This reference architecture can be considered as an imprinting for the implementations that would be devised in specific projects and contexts. We also point out the necessity for a collaboration among different OEMs and with other relevant stakeholders, such as road authorities and smart cities, to properly engineer systems of systems composed of cars, trucks, roads, pedestrians, etc. This work is realized in the context of two Swedish projects coordinated by Volvo Cars and involving some universities and research centers in Sweden and many suppliers of the OEM, including Autoliv, Arccore, Combitech, Cybercom, Knowit, Prevas, ÅF-Technology, Semcom, and Qamcom.}

This paper proposes two different methods for synthesizing fine-grained energy consumption data for residential households, namely a regression-based method and a probability-based method. They each use a supervised machine learning method, which trains models with a relatively small real-world dataset and then generates large-scale time series based on the models. This paper describes the two methods in details, including data generation process, optimization techniques, and parallel data generation. This paper evaluates the performance of the two methods, which compare the resulting consumption profiles with real-world data, including patterns, statistics, and parallel data generation in the cluster. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and their efficiency in generating large-scale datasets.}

abstract = {One of the main challenges for developed cities is vehicle traffic and its management. Because of physical structures and cross roads of urban intersections, traffic flows may cause time delay, congestion, traffic accidents and more fuel/time consumption. For these reasons, there are many studies on traffic management systems which are a part of smart city applications in both literature and practice. In recent years, it seems that VANET (Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks) architecture has been preferred in these studies, which enables vehicles to easily communicate with each other or devices on the edge of the road and also to transfer the related traffic data to the center. On the other hand, there are many studies on a new network paradigm called SDN (Software Defined Networks) that solves problems such as performance, programmability, scalability, security and management difficulties in today’s traditional networks. Depending on all this, in this study, we will present an architectural proposal about how to use SDN and VANET network paradigms together in traffic management systems in order to use both existing intersection management system modules more adaptively and future traffic based services to be added in desired service quality without changing the communication infrastructure. Also in this study, a 3-stage fuzzy-decision tree model was proposed for traffic signaling which is the most important problems of urban traffic by focusing environmental factors (accident situation, priority vehicle transition etc.) and activity information (road construction, meeting, train and bus schedule etc. ) not only vehicle density unlike other signaling studies in literature. The proposed model also generates/sends a dynamic flow input to SDN agent vehicles and SDN agent RSU (Road Side Unit) in intersection for making VANET routing protocols (AODV-ad hoc on-demand distance vector, DSDV-destination-sequenced distance vector) selection automatically according to traffic incident and density. In order to measure the functionality of the SDN based VANET architecture and 3 stage fuzzy-decision tree model on it for the transmission infrastructure of the traffic management, performance tests were performed on different traffic and network scenarios on Adapazarı City Centre Model. SDN based VANET architecture was compared with traditional systems according to transmission infrastructure and also proposed 3-stage fuzzy-decision model was compared with signaling techiques in literature such as fixed-time signaling, Webster equation, ant colony algorithm and particle swarm optimization under same traffic and network scenarios. The results obtained from performance tests shows that the proposed 3-stage fuzzy-decision model has %15-17 better performance than fixed-time signaling and webster equation and also %9-11 better performance that particle swarm and ant colony optimizations in low density traffic scenarios. In high density and dynamic traffic scenarios these rates reach %20-22 compared to fixed-time signaling and webster equation and %14-15 compared to particle swarm and ant colony optimizations. In addition in this study, proposed SDN based VANET architecture was compared to traditional VANET ITS architectures within the same traffic and network scenarios. According to obtained results, it is shown that the proposed SDN based VANET has %30-40 better performance than traditional systems in end-end delay, throughput and packet loss rate criteria.}

In this paper, we address the unsupervised person Re-ID with a conceptually novel yet simple framework, termed as Multi-label Learning guided self-paced Clustering (MLC). MLC mainly learns discriminative features with three crucial modules, namely a multi-scale network, a multi-label learning module, and a self-paced clustering module. Specifically, the multi-scale network generates multi-granularity person features in both global and local views. The multi-label learning module leverages a memory feature bank and assigns each image with a multi-label vector based on the similarities between the image and feature bank. After multi-label training for several epochs, the self-paced clustering joins in training and assigns a pseudo label for each image. The benefits of our MLC come from three aspects: i) the multi-scale person features for better similarity measurement, ii) the multi-label assignment based on the whole dataset ensures that every image can be trained, and iii) the self-paced clustering removes some noisy samples for better feature learning. Extensive experiments on three popular large-scale Re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that our MLC outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves the performance of unsupervised person Re-ID.}

The major challenge lies in effectively mining high-level 3D shape features. This paper presents a high-level feature learning framework for 3D object recognition through fusing multiple 2D representations of point clouds. The framework has two key components: (1) three discriminative low-level 3D shape descriptors for obtaining multi-view 2D representation of 3D point clouds. These descriptors preserve both local and global spatial relationships of points from different perspectives and build a bridge between 3D point clouds and 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). (2) A two-stage fusion network, which consists of a deep feature learning module and two fusion modules, for extracting and fusing high-level features. The proposed method was tested on three datasets, one of which is Sydney Urban Objects dataset and the other two were acquired by a mobile laser scanning (MLS) system along urban roads. The results obtained from comprehensive experiments demonstrated that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in descriptiveness, robustness and efficiency. Our method achieves high recognition rates of 94.6%, 93.1% and 74.9% on the above three datasets, respectively.}

It is essential to capture the important sets of Access Points (APs) that best defines the floor map for the positioning process. To maintain sustainable localization, the selection of APs enables scaling the solution and reducing the maintenance cost. In the present work, our contribution is twofold- the power of Particle Swarm Optimization is utilized for the selection of important APs. Then, a feature-based ensemble model is designed for the selected subsets of APs to retain the generality of localization performance. The base learners capture the different ambiance in the training and testing process. Extensive experimentation was carried out using the collected dataset from multiple smartphone devices. The proposed feature selection and training pipeline has also been tested with two popular benchmark datasets- UJIIndoorLoc and JUIndoorLoc. Results indicate that the proposed feature-based ensemble model could achieve 86%–96% accuracy with around 50%–65% reduction in APs for the datasets. The mean absolute error (MAE) indicates the distance between the predicted and actual location points. It is found to be 2.68 m, that is, neighboring location points, which is quite acceptable for user localization in indoor spaces.}

Pedestrian detection and collision avoidance are the crucial parts of AVs. The existing pedestrian detection systems don't guarantee better accuracy under complex scenarios, poor light conditions, and low complexity overhead. Moreover, these systems rely on monocular camera object detection. Hence, this paper aims to propose a stereo-vision based pedestrian detection and collision avoidance system for AVs. It uses two cameras fixed at a specific distance apart to scan the environment. Once a pedestrian is detected, the system calculates the distance. The Automatic Emergency Braking System (AEBS) controller algorithm will activate the AEB if the estimated distance is less than 3.3 m, considered safe. MATLAB is used for the implementation, and the experimental results reveal that the proposed method is promising in terms of prediction accuracy and minimizing fatalities.}

In this study, we use “Tech Mining,” a systematic analytical method based on structured texts applied to publication and patent abstract data, to analyze potential applications of TENGs. A series of applications from product scale to industry scale are identified. The findings show that when used as sensors, TENGs are mostly applicable in automation and energy-intensive industries such as automotive, medical or surgical devices, consumer electronics and household appliances. TENGs in the form of sensors can also be integrated with future-oriented and exponentially growing technologies such as robotics, drones, nanotechnology, and bioinformatics that will create enormous value for future economies. Moreover, applications of TENGs as sensors are also in line with current global trends of science and technology development, including the “Internet of Things,” big data, clean energy, and smart cities. Combined with those technologies and industries, TENGs can help in tackling challenges of global warming, environmental pollution and security systems. We suggest the TENG research community to widen interdisciplinary collaboration, pursue connections with industry, and file more patents as R&D progresses. In addition, research limitations and future development directions of TENG are pointed out.}

Wrong labels added by malicious users will affect the training effect of the model. The unreliability of labeled data has hindered the research. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a framework of Label Noise Filtering and Missing Label Supplement (LNFS). And we take location labels in Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN) as an example to implement our framework. For the problem of label noise filtering, we first use FastText to transform the restaurant's labels into vectors, and then based on the assumption that the label most similar to all other labels in the location is most representative. We use cosine similarity to judge and select the most representative label. For the problem of label missing, we use simple common word similarity to judge the similarity of users' comments, and then use the label of the similar restaurant to supplement the missing labels. To optimize the performance of the model, we introduce game theory into our model to simulate the game between malicious users and the model to improve the reliability of the model. Finally, a case study is given to illustrate the effectiveness and reliability of LNFS.}

We employ an instance selection method to query a reduced training set that reduces both the space complexity of the formed ensemble members and the time complexity to classify an instance. Additionally, we propose a guided search-based pruning schema that perfectly explores large-size ensembles and brings on a near-optimal subensemble with less computational requirements in reduced memory space and improved prediction time. We show experimentally how the proposed method could be an alternative to large-size ensembles. We demonstrate how to form less-complex, small-size, and high-accurate ensembles through our proposal. Experiments on 25 datasets show that the proposed method can produce effective ensembles better than Random Forest and baseline classifier pruning methods. Moreover, our proposition is comparable with the Extreme Gradient Boosting Algorithm in terms of accuracy.}

A collection of techniques (Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Belief Networks, Echo State Networks, Support Vector Regression, Genetic Programming and Extended Kalman Filter-Genetic Programming), partially selected from the state-of-the-art ones, are evaluated using the few publicly available datasets. The tests are performed according to two key aspects: homogeneous evaluation criteria and application of heterogeneous data.

On the contrary, the Energy Information Administration (E.I.A.) data are used for long-term prediction combining gas and temperature information. At the end, the selected approaches have been evaluated using the sole Tehran water consumption for long-term forecasts (thanks to the full availability of the dataset). The AMPds and E.I.A. natural gas results show a correlation with temperature, that produce a performance improvement.

The method utilizes the Weibull distribution and Shannon entropy to measure and link social sentiment with technological topics. Based on question-and-answer and social sentiment data from Zhihu, which is an online question and answer (Q&A) community with high-profile entrepreneurs and public intellectuals, we built an undirected weighting network and measured the centrality of nodes for technology identification. An empirical study on artificial intelligence technology trends supported by expert knowledge-based evaluation and cognition provides sufficient evidence of the method's ability to identify technology. We found that the social sentiment of hot technological topics presents a long-tailed distribution statistical pattern. High similarity between the topic popularity and emerging technology development trends appears in the online community.

abstract = {Commercial buildings consume a lot of energy and contribute a significant part of greenhouse gas emission. Many energy-saving or green-building initiatives were compromised by equipment and human-related faults under the umbrella of poor facility management. Data-driven building energy management is a cost-effective approach to improve energy efficiency of commercial buildings, and gains more and more popularity worldwide with the deployment of smart metering systems. This paper developed a systematic process of using smart metering data to quantify building daily load profiles (i.e. energy consumption patterns) with a set of statistics, e.g. base load, peak load, rising time and so on. Then prediction models of these building load statistics are constructed from historical training data consisting of energy consumption, environment and holiday information. At last residuals of the prediction models are analyzed to form statistical control charts. As a result anomaly energy consumption could be detected by comparing the predicted statistics and observed ones, which will help building managers to locate problems just in time. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is verified through real-world data analysis and computational studies.}

Distributed seismic sensors can be fully buried under the ground, sensing slight ground deformations induced by moving targets. We name these interconnected seismic acquisition systems the Internet of ground neurons (IoGN). Although the IoGN plays an important role in monitoring key territories and sensitive areas, there are few reviews covering its development and future trends. To fill this gap and inspire further research, we conduct a comprehensive survey on moving target recognition with the IoGN. In this article, we first introduce the architecture and components of the IoGN, as well as hardware systems, including two representative types of seismic sensors and corresponding data acquisition units. Next, we systematically summarize the detection and classification algorithms for target recognition. Detailed case studies of these methods are also reviewed. Finally, we present the current tasks and challenges in IoGN research and provide potential solutions for each challenge.}

The bulk of the data collected by these systems has numerous applications, or it can simply be used for general data analysis. Therefore, publishing such big data is greatly beneficial for data recipients. However, in its raw form, the collected data contains sensitive information pertaining to the individuals from which it was collected and must be anonymized before publication. In this paper, we study the problem of privacy-preserving passenger trajectories publishing and propose a solution under the rigorous differential privacy model. Unlike sequential data, which describes sequentiality between data items, handling spatio-temporal data is a challenging task due to the fact that introducing a temporal dimension results in extreme sparseness. Our proposed solution introduces an efficient algorithm, called SafePath, that models trajectories as a noisy prefix tree and publishes ϵ-differentially-private trajectories while minimizing the impact on data utility. Experimental evaluation on real-life transit data in Montreal suggests that SafePath significantly improves efficiency and scalability with respect to large and sparse datasets, while achieving comparable results to existing solutions in terms of the utility of the sanitized data.}

In this paper, we present a detailed survey of the literature, investigating the application of Big Data techniques in the construction industry. We reviewed related works published in the databases of American Association of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), and Elsevier Science Direct Digital Library.

To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive survey of Big Data techniques in the context of the construction industry. This paper fills the void and presents a wide-ranging interdisciplinary review of literature of fields such as statistics, data mining and warehousing, machine learning, and Big Data Analytics in the context of the construction industry.

abstract = {With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) target tracking recently has received lots of attention in research community. The two major research topics in UAV target tracking include loss of a tracked target and high tracking latency, especially in the case where tracking is conducted in an area of many sight-blocking obstacles that put restrictions on a UAV’s flight altitude and block its line of sight. Most recent work on these topics focuses on improving tracking accuracy through adjusting tracking algorithms based on deep learning. But the complexity of these algorithms requires a computation capacity that a regular UAV cannot afford, and therefore tracking failure probability is still non-negligible. To address this challenge, we propose a new target tracking system, referred to as an Air–Ground Surveillance Sensor Network (AGSSN). We build AGSSN by jointly optimizing the network establishment and data transmission, and we design an algorithm ARIT to achieve an optimal tracking performance. We further carry out a series of simulations by deploying our AGSSN on a university’s campus map, and our simulation results show that our proposed AGSSN system can achieve higher reliability and significantly better performance than regular tracking systems in an area with many visually blocking obstacles.}

abstract = {Traffic forecasting is a very challenging task due to the complicated and dynamic spatial–temporal correlations between traffic nodes. Most existing methods measure the spatial correlations by defining physical or virtual graphs with distance or similarity measurement, which is constructed with stable edge connections by some prior knowledge. However, the use of such graphs with stable edge connections limits the variations of spatial correlations between traffic nodes at different times, which can not capture the hidden dynamic patterns of traffic graphs. This paper proposes a Time-Variant Graph Convolutional Network (TVGCN) to overcome this limitation. Architecturally, a time-variant spatial convolutional module (TV-SCM) is developed on two graphs without any prior knowledge. One graph is learned to capture the stable spatial correlations of the traffic graph, while the other graph is evolved to model dynamic spatial correlations at different times. Such two graphs are combined hierarchically together under the framework of graph convolutional network (GCN). Moreover, a gated multi-scale temporal convolutional module (GMS-TCM) is designed to extract long-range temporal dependencies within traffic nodes, which are further supplied to the TV-SCM to mutually explore the spatial correlations between traffic nodes. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world traffic datasets indicate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.}

Three innovation concepts have been especially highlighted: Smart Manufacturing, the Industrial Internet and Industrie 4.0. In parallel, academics have employed these concepts in numerous ways to advance their work. Despite this broad interest, precise definition and delineation of the cyber-physical convergence research domain have received little attention. Also missing is systematic knowledge on the interactions of these concepts with research trajectories. This paper fills these gaps by operationalising a newly constructed definition of convergence, and delineating the associated research domain into five data-centric capabilities: Monitoring, Analytics, Modelling and Simulation, Transmission and Security. A bibliometric analysis of the domain is then performed for 2010–2019. There are three findings. First, Analytics and Security have assumed strategic positions within the domain, coinciding with a “strategic turn” in policy. Second, backed by concerted policy and funding efforts, growth in Chinese scientific output has outpaced key competitors, including the U.S. and Germany. Finally, the patterns of promoting their works in terms of the three concepts differ significantly amongst U.S.-, Germany- and China-based authors, which mirrors the different policy discourses prevalent in those countries.}

Urban functional types were derived from the fusion of Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre 5 images, points of interest, and real-time Tencent user data. A geodetector was adopted to select key environmental covariates. Random forest (RF) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were employed to model and map Zn concentrations in urban topsoil. The results showed that urban functional type, geology, NDVI, elevation, slope, and aspect were key environmental covariates. Compared with land use types, urban functional types could better reflect the spatial variation in Zn. The RF and GWR models were established using the key environmental covariates, with leave-one-out cross-validated R values of 0.68 and 0.58 and root mean square errors of 0.51 and 0.57, respectively. The results indicated that digital mapping of Zn in urban topsoil by using multisource geospatial data and RF was feasible. RF might be more suitable to fit the stochastic characteristics of Zn in urban topsoils than GWR, which considers deterministic trends in modeling.}

More recently, architecture has been proposed to use edge computing for data stream processing. This paper surveys state of the art on stream processing engines and mechanisms for exploiting resource elasticity features of cloud computing in stream processing. Resource elasticity allows for an application or service to scale out/in according to fluctuating demands. Although such features have been extensively investigated for enterprise applications, stream processing poses challenges on achieving elastic systems that can make efficient resource management decisions based on current load.

Edge computing provides an opportunity for wearable devices to access more resources without violating the constraints on weight and size. In this article, we first investigate the drawbacks of wearable devices and explore the potential of addressing such drawbacks by edge computing. Then we conduct a comprehensive survey on existing works from four aspects, i.e., computation scheduling, information perception, energy-saving, and security. Finally, we point out several future research directions worth our attention. We believe that wearable devices enhanced with edge computing technologies would bring more benefits and convenience to our life shortly.}

Representative one-class classification algorithms include the one-class support vector machine (SVM), Naive Parzen density estimation, autoencoder (AE), etc. Recently, the one-class extreme learning machine (OC-ELM) has been developed for learning acceleration and performance enhancement. But existing one-class algorithms are generally less effective in complex and multi-class classifications. To alleviate the deficiency, a multilayer neural network based one-class classification with ELM (in short, as ML-OCELM) is developed in this paper. The stacked AEs are employed in ML-OCELM to exploit an effective feature representation for complex data. The effective kernel based learning framework is also investigated in the stacked AEs of ML-OCELM, leading to a multilayer kernel based OC-ELM (in short, as MK-OCELM). The MK-OCELM has advantages of less human-intervention parameters and good generalization performance. Experiments on 13 benchmark UCI classification datasets and a real application on urban acoustic classification (UAC) are carried out to show the superiority of the proposed ML-OCELM/MK-OCELM over the OC-ELM and several state-of-the-art algorithms.}

With the rapidly increasing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, however, there is a growing need to localize these devices with LPWAN. Given the extreme battery lifetime requirements of IoT-enabled devices, we want to avoid satellite-based solutions. We use a publicly available outdoor LoRaWAN data set to evaluate Received Signal Strength fingerprint-based and range-based location estimation algorithms in terms of accuracy and computational performance. On the one hand, a fingerprint-based approach leads to 50% more accurate results when compared to a range-based approach, resulting in mean location estimation errors of 340m and 700m, respectively. On the other hand, in a range-based approach, no training database is required and the system can be deployed instantly in any environment with network coverage. Thus, when choosing a localization algorithm for any IoT application, a trade-off between accuracy, deployment cost and computational performance should be taken into account.}

Currently, sharing medical data is observed to be slow, incomplete, insecure, and provider-centric. These shortcomings prevent data interoperability and are a consequence of lack of foundational, structural, and semantic inoperability.

Content, as well as media, are shared in Big Data volumes and this poses a critical requirement for the behavior supervision and fraud protection. The detection of terrorist behavior in the social media is essential to every country, but has complexities in both the supervision of shared content and in the understanding of behavior. Therefore, in this project an artificial intelligence enabled Detection Terrorist behavior system (ALT-TERROS) as a key priority was developed. The key requirements for a terrorist behavior detection system operating in the Kingdom are: (i) Data integration, (ii) Advanced smart analysis capacity and (iii) Decision making capability. The unique value proposition is based on a sophisticated integrated approach to the management of distributed data available on social media, which uses advanced social mining methods for the detection of patterns of terrorist behavior, its visualization and use for decision making. In addition, several critical issues related to the availability of APIs to handle Arabic text as well as the need to provide an end-to-end workflow from the extraction of textual and visual data over social media to the deliverable of advanced analytics and visualizations for rating mechanisms were highlighted. The key contribution of our approach is a testbed for the application of novel scientific approaches and algorithms for the rating of harm associated to social media content. The complexity of the problem does not allow hyper-optimistic solutions, but the combination of heuristic rules and advanced decision-making capabilities is toward the right direction. We contribute to the body of the theory of Sentiment Analysis for Arabic content and we also summarize a heuristic algorithm developed for the future. In the future research directions, we emphasize on the need to develop trusted Arabic thesaurus and corpus for the use sentiment analysis.}

The classical data sampling approach is of time invariant nature. Thus, it includes in the acquisition, transmission, and processing stages a large amount of redundant data. This deficit can be eliminated by employing the event-driven sampling. It provides a real-time data compression. Therefore, a novel event-driven adaptive-rate sampling approach is utilized for the data acquisition and features extraction. The relevant features related to the appliances power consumption patterns are subsequently utilized for their identification by employing the support vector machine. Results confirm a 3.7 folds compression and processing gains of the suggested approach while achieving 96% classification accuracy.

In supervised cross-modal hashing, the learning of hash function replies on the quality of extracted features, for which deep learning models have been adopted to replace the traditional models based on handcraft features. All deep methods, however, have not sufficiently explored semantic correlation of modalities for the hashing process. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end deep cross-modal hashing framework which integrates feature and hash-code learning into the same network. We take both between and within modalities data correlation into consideration, and propose a novel network structure and a loss function with dual semantic supervision for hash learning. This method ensures that the generated binary codes keep the semantic relationship of the original data points. Cross-modal retrieval experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets show that our method yields substantial performance improvement over several state-of-the-art hashing methods.}

One method of satisfying the continuously increasing industrial, commercial, and residential electrical-energy demands of consumers in smart grids is to use an Internet-of-things (IoT) service-oriented electrical-energy management system (EMS) to intrusively monitor and manage electrical loads, which can effectively react to demand-response schemes for demand-side management (DSM). Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM), a viable cost-effective load disaggregation technique, has recently gained considerable attention as a nonintrusive alternative to EMS in the research field of smart grids. This paper presents a smart IoT-oriented home EMS founded on trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing-based NILM for DSM in a smart grid. Evolutionary computing-based NILM is considered and addressed as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed NILM technique can determine the electrical appliances based on their individual electrical characteristics extracted from composite electrical-load consumption with no intrusive deployment of smart plugs or power meters. A fully nonintrusive NILM alternative is considered and proposed. In addition, this alternative is different from conventional NILM because conventional NILM considers artificial intelligence including artificial neural networks (NNs) and deep NN as load classifiers of NILM where training and retraining stages and a hyperparameter tuning procedure are required. The proposed smart IoT-oriented home EMS was experimentally investigated with the trainingless multi-objective evolutionary computing-based NILM in a real house environment. The experimental results confirm that the proposed methodology is feasible.}

The number of online applications is increasing along with more computation, communication, and intelligent capabilities. Although current devices in use today are also getting more powerful in terms of features and capabilities, but they are still incapable of executing smart, autonomous, and intelligent tasks such as those often required for smart healthcare, ambient assisted living (AAL), virtual reality, augmented reality, intelligent vehicular communication, as well as in many services related to smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT), Tactile Internet, Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and so on. For many of these applications, we need another entity to execute tasks on behalf of the user’s device and return the results - a technique often called offloading, where tasks are outsourced and the involved entities work in tandem to achieve the ultimate goal of the application. Task offloading is attractive for emerging IoT and cloud computing applications. It can occur between IoT nodes, sensors, edge devices, or fog nodes. Offloading can be performed based on different factors that include computational requirements of an application, load balancing, energy management, latency management, and so on. We present a taxonomy of recent offloading schemes that have been proposed for domains such as fog, cloud computing, and IoT.

Various numerical simulations can be implemented on the virtual model with greatly reduced computational costs. The multi-type information from heterogeneous sources and multifarious engineering applications are supported by the proposed framework. For the virtual model aided numerical analysis with the multi-type information, fuzzy-valued probabilistic distributional characteristics of the bounds of the concerned structural responses are estimated. The capability of the modularity feature of the virtual model improves the operational flexibility which makes the implementation of such advance technique more user friendly. To demonstrate the applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed framework, three practical engineering stimulated problems (i.e., the mechanical dynamic system, multiphysics with heat transfer and gas flow interaction, and the expansion process of a biomedical stent with both material and geometry nonlinearities), involving multi-type information (i.e., random parameters and fuzzy sets), are fully investigated through the proposed virtual model architecture framework.}

It is anticipated that such informed consumers in control of their consumption patterns will contribute to reduced energy usage and thus a sustainable environment. Smart meter technology in smart homes provides real-time information to customers through devices such as in-home displays and web portals, and provide half-hourly consumption data to electricity distributors and retailers. Such data enables the profiling of consumers making it possible to understand different life styles and electricity usage behaviours to provide customised electricity billing. To obtain the anticipated benefit from such highly granular and high frequency data, it is essential to have big data technologies which can process such volumes of data in near real time. The research described in this paper focus on addressing the key requirements of large volume data processing and making use of the highly granular nature of the data. Adapting a new scalable algorithm introduced by the authors for big data processing, this work demonstrates the practicality of processing large volumes of data at multiple levels of granularity. The faster processing capacity makes it possible to continuously analyse consumption data at frequent intervals as they are collected and at a highly granular level thus providing a practical solution as a smart home application. The advantages of the technique is demonstrated using electricity consumption data for 10,000 households for a year from an Australian electricity retailer.}

Although it has been widely recognised that different infrastructure assets are highly interconnected, infrastructure management in practice such as planning, installation and maintenance are often undertaken by different stakeholders without considering these dependencies due to the lack of relevant data and cross-domain knowledge, which may cause unexpected cascading social, economic and environmental effects. In this paper, we present a knowledge based decision support system for urban infrastructure inter-asset management. By considering various infrastructure assets (e.g. road, ground, cable), triggers (e.g. pipe leaking) and potential consequences (e.g. traffic disruption) as a holistic system, we model each sub-domain using a modular ontology and encapsulate the interdependence between them using a set of rules. Moreover, qualitative likelihood is assigned to each rule by domain experts (e.g. civil engineers) to encode the uncertainty of knowledge, and an inference engine is applied to predict the potential consequences of a given trigger with location specific data and the encoded rules. A web-based prototype system has been developed based on the above concept and demonstrated to a wide range of stakeholders. The system can assist in the process of decision making by aiding data collation and integration, as well as presenting potential consequences of possible triggers, advising on whether additional information is needed or suggesting ways of obtaining such information. The work shows an intelligent approach to integrate and process multi-source data to pioneer a novel way to aid a complex decision process with a high social impact.}

However, applying the appropriate data fusion strategy to design an efficient energy efficiency system is not straightforward; it requires a priori knowledge of existing fusion strategies, their applications and their properties. To this regard, seeking to provide the energy research community with a better understanding of data fusion strategies in building energy saving systems, their principles, advantages, and potential applications, this paper proposes an extensive survey of existing data fusion mechanisms deployed to reduce excessive consumption and promote sustainability. We investigate their conceptualizations, advantages, challenges and drawbacks, as well as performing a taxonomy of existing data fusion strategies and other contributing factors. Following, a comprehensive comparison of the state-of-the-art data fusion based energy efficiency frameworks is conducted using various parameters, including data fusion level, data fusion techniques, behavioral change influencer, behavioral change incentive, recorded data, platform architecture, IoT technology and application scenario. Moreover, a novel method for electrical appliance identification is proposed based on the fusion of 2D local texture descriptors, where 1D power signals are transformed into 2D space and treated as images. The empirical evaluation, conducted on three real datasets, shows promising performance, in which up to 99.68% accuracy and 99.52% F1 score have been attained. In addition, various open research challenges and future orientations to improve data fusion based energy efficiency ecosystems are explored.}

abstract = {A novel least squares twin support vector regression method is proposed based on the robust L1-norm distance to alleviate the negative effect of traffic data with outliers. Although there is some known work for the short-term traffic flow prediction problems, their efficacy depends heavily on the collected traffic data, which are often affected by various external factors (e.g. weather, traffic jam or accident), leading to errors and missing data. This makes it difficult to pick an effective method that accurately predicts the traffic state. As a contribution of this paper, an iterative algorithm is designed to solve the non-smooth L1-norm terms of our method; its convergence also proved. Further, a comprehensive traffic flow indicator system based on speed, traffic flow, occupancy and ample degree is utilized in this paper. We also extend the proposed method to a nonlinear version by hybridizing the polynomial kernel and radial basis function kernel, where the weight coefficient of hybrid kernel is determined by the change tendency of traffic data. To promote the prediction performance, the parameters of our nonlinear method are optimized by adaptive fruit fly optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on real traffic data are performed to evaluate our model. The results indicate that the newly constructed model yields better prediction performance and robustness than other models in various experimental settings.}

The application areas of such data-driven IoT systems are numerous and their socio-economic impact of great importance as they enable the monitoring and management of processes in sectors ranging from urban management to management of the natural environment. In this work, we introduce and detail an end-to-end technological framework for data-driven IoT systems for landslide monitoring. The framework is articulated in three tiers — namely data acquisition, data curation and data presentation For each tier we present and detail its design and development aspects; from the IoT hardware design and the wireless communication technologies of choice, to how Big Data infrastructure and Machine Learning components can be combined to support a sophisticated presentation tier that delivers the true added value of a system to its final users. The framework is validated, extended and fine-tuned by means of two pilots at locations experiencing the impact of different landslide types and activity. This work qualitatively improves upon existing methods of landslide monitoring and showcases how data-driven IoT systems can pave new pathways for interdisciplinary research as well as generate positive impact on modern societies.}

Social media interactions can provide a new data-driven vantage point to explore such drivers. This study uses data from 36,000 public posts on Facebook to investigate intersectionality in EV-communication as per the Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) categories. A computational social science methodology was adopted using a mixed-method application of social network analysis and machine learning-based topic modelling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm on a 600,000-text corpus extracted from the Facebook posts. Results showed that political, economic, and legal posts had dense clusters around the technology policy of EV, the institutional discourse of electrification of the federal vehicle fleet, and tax and credit framework politics. The environmental and social dimensions had a higher discourse for social justice, clean air, and better health and well-being. A market shift towards EV as a service industry was observed in the technology and economics-related posts. These findings can help policymakers, and planners design contextualised energy policy for influencing EV adoption in the U.S. and other countries.}

Here, a summary of the already published results in these areas, which were divided into the four focused topics, is given: Collection and Logistics, Machines and waste treatment plants, Business models and Data Tools. Presented are systems and methods already used in waste management, as well as technologies that have already been successfully applied in other industrial sectors and will also be relevant in the waste management sector for the future. The focus is set on systems that could be used in waste treatment plants or machines in the future in order to make treatment of waste more efficient. In particular, systems which carry out the sorting of (mixed) waste via robotic technologies are of interest. Furthermore “smart bins” with sensors for material detection or level measurement, methods for digital image analysis and new business models have already been developed. The technologies are often based on large amounts of data that can contribute to increase the efficiency within plants.

The connection to Internet and public networks increases significantly the risk of the BAS networks being attacked, since there's a significant lack of detection and defensive mechanisms for BAS networks. In this paper, we present a framework for a context-aware intrusion detection of a widely deployed Building Automation and Control network. We developed runtime models for service interactions and functionality patterns by modeling the heterogeneous information that is continuously acquired from building assets into a novel BAS context aware data structure. Our IDS performs anomaly based behavior analysis to accurately detect anomalous events triggered by cyber-attacks or any functional failure. An attack classification and severity analysis of detected attacks allow our IDS to automatically launch protective countermeasures. We evaluate our approach in the Smart Building testbed developed at the University of Arizona Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing, by launching several cyber-attacks that exploit the generic vulnerabilities of BACnet protocol.}

Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) technique is gradually playing an important role in automation, information retrieval, decision making, intelligent recognition, monitoring and management. With the assistance of AI techniques, TES systems can become more and more reasonable and intelligent, which paves a new path for the researches on TES. In the present review, a comprehensive literature summarization and analysis on the application of AI techniques to TES is presented. Performance prediction, optimal design, control and operation by means of AI for the TES systems with various applications are discussed and compared. This review shows that AI-based prediction models, like artificial neural network and support vector machine, can accurately estimate the TES performance and the properties of TES materials in a very fast fashion. AI-based optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and teaching-learning-based optimization are able to optimize the design and operation of the TES systems towards the objectives like higher system efficiency, cost savings, more renewable energy utilization and less environmental impacts. Fuzzy logic can be utilized to properly design and control the TES systems where uncertain and imprecise factors are inevitably present. General strategies of the AI-based TES performance modelling and the completely AI-based design and control of the TES are summarized, while the main limitations are that AI cannot be used to directly unveil the unknown physical mechanism of the TES and that the lack of the comprehensive TES performance database hinders the real-world implementation. On the way to completely intelligent TES systems, further investigations on the enhancement of adaptation and self-improvement capability are necessary. In addition, the potential research topics are pointed out for the future development and deployment referring to the needs of the future smart energy system, intelligent and zero energy building, and smart home.}

Learning path were focused on: i) processes of data acquisition from social media, ii) data analysis using Machine Learning techniques and iii) data design into significant elements useful to implement communication systems in the tourism field.
Results
showed that the most of participants achieved a medium-high evaluation for the implementation of the communication systems, applying appropriately techniques and tools learned along the course. Furthermore, the high percentage of students satisfaction registered in relation to the course, revealed that students enjoyed this experience. Outcomes reflects the acquisition and the awareness of those skills that will enable students to be conscious protagonists of their role in tourism 4.0.}

It provides an integrated solution for the challenges in preprocessing Arabic text on social media in four stages: data collection, cleaning, enrichment, and availability. The preprocessed Arabic text is stored in structured database tables to provide a useful corpus to which, information extraction and data analysis algorithms can be applied. The experiment in this study reveals that the implementation of the proposed approach yields a useful and full-featured dataset and valuable information. The resultant dataset presented the Arabic text in three structured levels with more than 20 features. Additionally, the experiment provides valuable information and processed results such as topic classification and sentiment analysis.}

Processing large amount of real-time data from the diverse IoT devices is challenging. For example, in IoT environment, wireless sensor networks (WSN) are typically used for the monitoring and collecting of data in some geographic area. Spatial range queries with location constraints to facilitate data indexing are traditionally employed in such applications, which allows the querying and managing the data based on SQL structure. One particular challenge is to minimize communication cost and storage requirements in multi-dimensional data indexing approaches. In this paper, we present an energy- and time-efficient multidimensional data indexing scheme, which is designed to answer range query. Specifically, we propose data indexing methods which utilize hierarchical indexing structures, using binary space partitioning (BSP), such as kd-tree, quad-tree, k-means clustering, and Voronoi-based methods to provide more efficient routing with less latency. Simulation results demonstrate that the Voronoi Diagram-based algorithm minimizes the average energy consumption and query response time.}

Nevertheless, to the best of authors’ knowledge, there is scarcely any discussion on its design theories, which serves as the fundamental basis. To identify the limitations of current design approaches in supporting Smart PSS development and suggest some future research directions, this paper conducts a systematic literature review at existing engineering design methodologies to verify its appropriateness for the Smart PSS development. 9 typical design methods have been chosen based on the systematic review of 101 representative items published ever since the coin of PSS to date (04/05/2020) and 48 supplementary works. They are further compared and evaluated from three aspects, including “smart design” objects, enabling smart technologies and smart application fields. Not surprisingly, the investigation results indicate that none of the existing methodologies can fully meet the design characteristics of Smart PSS, while three research directions of Smart PSS design methodology are provided as the potential solution at last. It is hoped this paper can attract more open discussions and offer useful insights to both academics and industries in their development of Smart PSS.}

People tend to frequently upload images through smart devices to express different aspects of their life with connected peers using the image sharing feature facilitated by different social media services such as Facebook, Flickr, Pinterest, and Instagram, etc. The service providers of such web services are utilizing the image features and high availability of cloud storage at low cost for providing friend recommendation service to build online smart community. However, after reports of citizens surveillance by government agencies and the celebrity photo leakage incident in iCloud, users have become concerned about their photo privacy. In addition to that, the cloud services are vulnerable to security threats and an adversary capable of breaching the security would be able to access the images residing in the cloud storage. Obfuscating images before sharing can be considered as a potential solution; however, de-obfuscating and then classifying millions of images at the service provider's end does not provide privacy guarantee and it is computationally expensive. Motivated by this scenario, we propose a practical privacy-preserving image-centric friend recommendation framework compatible with smart devices which protects the privacy of images through obfuscation and classifies obfuscated images using the deep neural network to build user profiles for friend recommendation.}

In order to solve this stochastic and correlated optimization problem, a simheuristic approach is combined with an adaptive demand predictor. This predictor is based on the use of machine learning methods and Petri nets. The information on real demands, provided by the vehicles as they visit the nodes of the logistic network, allows for a real-time forecast of the demand, as well as for an updated estimate of the correlation between them. A constrained prediction is provided by our hybrid algorithm, which is able to forecast an increase of 50% in the mean value of the demands of all nodes. With a very limited amount of information and reduced computational requirements, our algorithm provides a forecast with a high degree of reliability and a balanced capacity to reject false positives as well as false negatives. To illustrate its effectiveness, the methodology is applied to a wide range of benchmarks. The results show the benefits of applying this methodology in a context of correlated variation of the demands.}

We use the term Neuro-Dominating Set to describe our approach, since it is inspired by both neural network and dominating set principles. With NDS algorithm, a robot adopts different behaviors according whether it is a dominating or a dominated robot. Our main goal is to show and demonstrate the beneficial effect of using different behaviors in the IoRT concept. The obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms an existing related technique (i.e., the Virtual Angular Force approach) and the neural network based approach presented in our previous work. As an objective, we aim to decrease the overall traveled distance and keep a low energy consumption level, while maintaining network connectivity and an acceptable convergence time.}

Thus, we organized five focus groups with 27 practitioners from 22 companies, public organizations, and research institutes. Based on the outcomes, we surveyed three cases of emerging ODE practice to further understand the concepts and to validate the initial findings. The main outcome is an initial conceptual model of ODEs’ value, intrinsics, governance, and evolution, and propositions for practice and further research. We found that ODE must be value driven.

Additionally, we present a comprehensive taxonomy in the HIoT, analyze the articles technically, and classify them into five categories, including sensor-based, resource-based, communication-based, application-based, and security-based approaches. Furthermore, the benefits and limitations of the selected methods, with a comprehensive comparison in terms of evaluation techniques, evaluation tools, and evaluation metrics, are included. Finally, based on the reviewed studies, power management, trust and privacy, fog computing, and resource management as leading open issues; tactile Internet, social networks, big data analytics, SDN/NFV, Internet of nano things, and blockchain as important future trends; and interoperability, real-testbed implementation, scalability, and mobility as challenges are worth more studying and researching in HIoT systems.}

abstract = {Vehicular networks are on the verge of deployment, thanks to the advancements in computation and communication technologies. This breed of ad hoc networks leverages vehicles as nodes with Vehicle-to-anything (V2X) communication paradigm. Clustering is considered one of the most important techniques used to enhance network stability, reliability, and scalability. Furthermore, clustering employs bandwidth optimization by reducing the overhead and transmission delay and helps in mitigating the hidden node problem. To date, extensive research has been done to address clustering issues in vehicular networks, and several surveys have also been published in the literature. However, a holistic approach towards clustering in vehicular networks is still lacking. In this regard, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the recent advancements in the clustering schemes for vehicular networks. We take a holistic approach to classify the algorithms by focusing on, (i) the objective of clustering mechanisms (i.e., reliability, scalability, stability, routing overhead, and delay), (ii) general-purpose clustering algorithms, (iii) application-based (i.e., QoS, MAC, security, etc.) clustering, and iv) technology-based clustering (machine learning-based, nature-inspired, fuzzy logic-based and software-defined networking-based clustering). We investigate the existing clustering mechanisms keeping in mind the factors such as cluster formation, maintenance, and management. Additionally, we present a comprehensive set of parameters for selecting cluster heads and the role of enabling technologies for cluster maintenance. Finally, we identify future research trends in clustering techniques for vehicular networks and their various breeds. This survey will act as a one-stop shop for the researchers, practitioners, and system designers to select the right clustering mechanism for their applications, services, or for their research. As a result of this survey, we can see that clustering is heavily dependent on the underlying application, context, environment, and communication paradigm. Furthermore, clustering in vehicular networks can greatly benefit from enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence.}

Such environments are quite stochastic, thus making power management very challenging. This paper presents the use of an asynchronous Q-learning in performing a power flow management task in a multi-source electric vehicle charging station with the integration of vehicle-to-microgrid technology. The power scheduling problem is first formulated as a Markov decision process. Asynchronous Q-learning is then used to solve it. The algorithm is tested with a typical charging station load profile over a 24-hour period and compared with a simple rule-based algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method is able to select a power schedule that reduces the energy cost with a better utilization of both the battery storage system and the vehicle to microgrid energy compared to the rule-based method.}

abstract = {Next generation communication networks are expected to accommodate a high number of new and resource-voracious applications that can be offered to a large range of end users. Even though end devices are becoming more powerful, the available local resources cannot cope with the requirements of these applications. This has created a new challenge called task offloading, where computation intensive tasks need to be offloaded to more resource powerful remote devices. Naturally, the Cloud Computing is a well-tested infrastructure that can facilitate the task offloading. However, Cloud Computing as a centralized and distant infrastructure creates significant communication delays that cannot satisfy the requirements of the emerging delay-sensitive applications. To this end, the concept of Edge Computing has been proposed, where the Cloud Computing capabilities are repositioned closer to the end devices at the edge of the network. This paper provides a detailed survey of how the Edge and/or Cloud can be combined together to facilitate the task offloading problem. Particular emphasis is given on the mathematical, artificial intelligence and control theory optimization approaches that can be used to satisfy the various objectives, constraints and dynamic conditions of this end-to-end application execution approach. The survey concludes with identifying open challenges and future directions of the problem at hand.}

abstract = {In recent years, Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) based tracking methods have achieved impressive performance in visual tracking. However, their excellent performance usually comes at the cost of sacrificing the computational speed. Furthermore, training correlation filters using high dimensional raw features may introduce the risk of severe over-fitting. To address the above issues, we propose Spatio-Temporal adaptive and Channel selective Correlation Filters (STCCF) for robust tracking. Specifically, we first select a set of target-specific features from high dimensional features via an effective channel selective scheme based on the Taylor expansion. Then, we reformulate the filter learning problem from ridge regression to elastic net regression to adaptively select the discriminative features inside the target bounding box at the spatial level. Moreover, we constrain the filters to be adaptive across temporal frames by learning a transformation matrix from the initial filters to the previous filters. In particular, with a specific spatio-temporal-channel constraint, STCCF can not only alleviate the over-fitting problem and reduce the computational cost, but also enhance the discriminability and interpretability of the learned filters. The proposed STCCF can be optimized by using a few iterations of Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Experiments on six challenging datasets show that STCCF can achieve promising performance with fast running speed.}

Nowadays, automakers are also integrating connectedness and autonomous components in their produced vehicles to reduce time of travel and increase the safety of the drivers, passengers, vehicles and the whole transportation system. The popularity of Connected and Autonomous Electric Vehicles (CAEVs) led to a growing interest in their development with a careful focus on performance and quality aspects. In modern terms, Quality of Experience (QoE) covers important system, context, and human influencing factors that can drive improvements in the field. A rigorous survey of the literature revealed that QoE influencing factors and performance indicators are neither thoroughly identified, classified, nor modeled in an embracing framework that can be embedded in applications. In addition, QoE investigations are usually focused on specific CAEV subsystems and a broad addressing is practically non-existing. In this paper, the literature is explored for important performance aspects of CAEVs. Recent advances are critically appraised, challenges and gaps are identified, and improvements are carefully proposed. To this end, a thorough taxonomy is developed for QoE in CAEVs with a rich set of quality indicators and a framework that facilitates the integration of QoE concepts in system development. The presented contributions are expected to guide, enable, support, and accelerate future developments in the field.}

Cloud Computing cannot be used for OT involving industrial applications, since it cannot guarantee stringent non-functional requirements, e.g., dependability, trustworthiness and timeliness. Instead, a new computing paradigm, called Fog Computing, is envisioned as an architectural means to realize the IT/OT convergence. In this paper we propose a Fog Computing Platform (FCP) reference architecture targeting Industrial IoT applications. The FCP is based on: deterministic virtualization that reduces the effort required for safety and security assurance; middleware for supporting both critical control and dynamic Fog applications; deterministic networking and interoperability, using open standards such as IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA); mechanisms for resource management and orchestration; and services for security, fault tolerance and distributed machine learning. We propose a methodology for the definition and the evaluation of the reference architecture. We use the Architecture Analysis Design Language (AADL) to model the FCP reference architecture, and a set of industrial use cases to evaluate its suitability for the Industrial IoT area.}

Of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the third presents the opportunity for a predictive universal digital healthcare ecosystem, capable of informing early warning, assisting in risk reduction and guiding management of national and global health risks. However, in reality, the existing technology infrastructure of digital healthcare systems is insufficient, failing to satisfy current and future data needs.
Objective
This paper systematically reviews emerging information technologies for data modelling and analytics that have potential to achieve Data-Centric Health-Care (DCHC) for the envisioned objective of sustainable healthcare. The goal of this review is to: 1) identify emerging information technologies with potential for data modelling and analytics, and 2) explore recent research of these technologies in DCHC.
Findings
A total of 1619 relevant papers have been identified and analysed in this review. Of these, 69 were probed deeply. Our analysis found that the extant research focused on elder care, rehabilitation, chronic diseases, and healthcare service delivery. Use-cases of the emerging information technologies included providing assistance, monitoring, self-care and self-management, diagnosis, risk prediction, well-being awareness, personalized healthcare, and qualitative and/or quantitative service enhancement. Limitations identified in the studies included vendor hardware specificity, issues with user interface and usability, inadequate features, interoperability, scalability, and compatibility, unjustifiable costs and insufficient evaluation in terms of validation.
Conclusion
Achievement of a predictive universal digital healthcare ecosystem in the current context is a challenge. State-of-the-art technologies demand user centric design, data privacy and protection measures, transparency, interoperability, scalability, and compatibility to achieve the SDG objective of sustainable healthcare by 2030.}

In this contribution, we propose and study an efficient and potentially effective option: Applying Disjoint Tangent Configurations (DTC), a formulation that includes discriminants such as Fisher’s, Bayes for normal distributions, Minimax Probabilistic Decision Hyperplane (MPDH), and others, to the output of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) network which has been previously designed with a moderate number of nodes to reduce the computational load, but with a high quality centroid selection algorithm, Frequency Sensitive Competitive Learning (FSCL), which allows to obtain networks with high representation capabilities.

Well-known classification methods that have been widely applied so far are no longer feasible in Big Data environments. For this reason, prototype reduction techniques (both selection and generation) come up as a candidate solution to build a reduced version of the dataset that speeds up the execution of algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors and overcome their memory constraints. However, these solutions generally have a quadratic O(N2) time complexity and share similar limitations to those encountered in data mining and machine learning algorithms in terms of time and memory requirements. In order to overcome these limitations, we introduce a new distributed MapReduce prototype generation method called CHI-PG that provides a linear O(N) time complexity and ensures constant accuracy regardless of the degree of parallelism. This approach builds prototypes by applying a simple scheme based on the rule generation process of the Chi et al. Fuzzy Rule-Based Classification System and takes advantage of the suitability of this classifier for the MapReduce paradigm. The empirical study shows that our new approach significantly improves the execution time of a state-of-the-art distributed prototype reduction algorithm (MRPR) without decreasing (and even improving) classification accuracy and reduction rates. Moreover, CHI-PG has been shown to be a candidate solution to the time and memory constraints of k-Nearest Neighbors when tackling large-scale datasets.}

Staff assignment is critical to success of construction projects, especially when responding to routine requests such as the change order and building service. However, the effectiveness is low due to manual processing by the management personnel. To improve the productivity of staff assignment, this paper creates a machine learning model that reads service request texts and automatically assigns workforce and priority through the technique of natural language processing (NLP). The dataset used for modeling in this study contains 82,106 building maintenance records for a 3-year period from over 60 buildings on a university campus. The results show a 77% accuracy for predicting workforce and an 88% accuracy for predicting priority, indicating a considerably high performance for multiclass and binary classifications. Different from existing studies, the NLP model highlights the value of stop-words and punctuation in learning service request texts. The NLP model presented in this study provides a solution for staff assignment and offers a piece of the puzzle to the information system automation in the construction industry. This study has an immediate implication for building maintenance; and, in the long term, contributes to human-building interactions in smart buildings by connecting human feedback to building control systems.}
