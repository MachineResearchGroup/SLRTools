abstract={Deep learning plays a vital role in broad spectrum of scientific fields, such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and so on. In order to support deep learning, many frameworks are created with the aim of setting up artificial neural networks as quickly as possible. Such frameworks can be run on systems including either Graphics Processing Unit or Intel Xeon Phi the second generation - Knights Landing coprocessor. However, very few deep learning frameworks can be run on legacy systems containing Intel Xeon Phi Knights Corner. For that reason, we propose and develop pyMIC-DL which is a NumPy-like library supporting deep learning frameworks run on such legacy systems. pyMIC-DL that is an extension of offloading module pyMIC implements basic functions so that it can be easily integrated into deep learning frameworks. The experimental findings show that pyMIC-DL outperforms NumPy in terms of two hardware platforms with the similar theoretical peak performance. Moreover, pyMIC-DL has shown its high effectiveness when being integrated into a well-known deep learning framework Chainer with a very impressive performance. Hence, pyMIC-DL is a fairly promising NumPy-like library to facilitate deep learning frameworks run on the legacy systems.},

abstract={The application such as video surveillance for traffic control in smart cities needs to analyze the large amount (hours/days) of video footage in order to locate the people who are violating the traffic rules. The traditional computer vision techniques are unable to analyze such a huge amount of visual data generated in real-time. So, there is a need for visual big data analytics which involves processing and analyzing large scale visual data such as images or videos to find semantic patterns that are useful for interpretation. In this paper, we propose a framework for visual big data analytics for automatic detection of bike-riders without helmet in city traffic. We also discuss challenges involved in visual big data analytics for traffic control in a city scale surveillance data and explore opportunities for future research.},

abstract={The massive growth of Smart City and Internet of Things applications enables safety and security. The data those are produced from surveillance cameras in aerial devices such as unmanned aerial networks (UAVs) are needed to be transferred to ground stations for secure data analysis. When the scale of network is relatively large compare to the wireless communication coverage of device, it is not always available to transmit the data to the ground stations, thus distributed and autonomous algorithms are essentially desired. Based on the needs, we propose a novel algorithm that is for collecting surveillance data under the consideration of mobility and flexibility of UAV networks. Due to the battery limitation in UAVs, we selectively collect data from the UAVs by setting rules under the consideration of distance and similarity. As a sequence, the UAV devices have to compete for a chance to get data processing. For this purpose, this paper designs a Myerson auction-based deep learning algorithm to leverage the UAV’s revenue compare to traditional second-price auction while preserving truthfulness. Based on simulation results, we verify that our proposed algorithm achieves desired performance improvements.},

abstract={Smart city visions aim to offer citizens with intelligent services in various aspects of life. The services envisioned have been significantly enhanced with the proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology offering real-time and ubiquitous monitoring capability. In this paper, we focus on the short-term traffic flow prediction problem based on real-world traffic data as one critical component of a smart city. In contrast to long-term traffic prediction, accurate prediction of short-term traffic flow facilitates timely traffic management and rapid response. We develop and study a novel ensemble model (EM) based on long short term memory (LSTM), deep autoencoder (DAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Our approach takes into account both temporal and spatial characteristics of the traffic conditions. We evaluate our proposal against well-known existing prediction models. We use two real traffic data (California and London roadways) with different characteristics to train and test the models. Our results indicate that our proposed ensemble model achieves the most accurate predictions (approx. 97.50% and approx. % accuracy) and is robust against high variance traffic flow.},

abstract={During the process of smart city construction, city managers always spend a lot of energy and money for cleaning street garbage due to the random appearances of street garbage. Consequently, visual street cleanliness assessment is particularly important. However, the existing assessment approaches have some clear disadvantages, such as the collection of street garbage information is not automated and street cleanliness information is not real-time. To address these disadvantages, this paper proposes a novel urban street cleanliness assessment approach using mobile edge computing and deep learning. First, the high-resolution cameras installed on vehicles collect the street images. Mobile edge servers are used to store and extract street image information temporarily. Second, these processed street data is transmitted to the cloud data center for analysis through city networks. At the same time, Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) is used to identify the street garbage categories and count the number of garbage. Finally, the results are incorporated into the street cleanliness calculation framework to ultimately visualize the street cleanliness levels, which provides convenience for city managers to arrange clean-up personnel effectively. The overall approach is illustrated and visualized using the street images of Jiangning District in Nanjing, China. The practical application shows the feasibility and usability of the approach.},

abstract={The landmark Recognition of any urban structure is a frustrating task to accomplish. This paper presents a deep learning based approach for recognition of the urban structures. Urban structures are basically the usual offices, houses, apartments etc. A generalized word for all these buildings can be urban structures. This classification problem was identified by our team while making our way into the visual positioning system, we saw that the visual landmark recognition of urban structures was an unexplored domain by using deep learning approaches. We also Identified that unlike the landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Statue Of Liberty etc, urban structures were difficult to learn by a neural network, the data requirements were quite distinct compared to the ones mentioned for all these famous landmarks around the globe. Most of all the landmark database was created, augmented, labelled and preprocessed in lab. The transfer learning based approaches were not that useful since the overall size of the model would always be so enormous and integration of a transfer learning based model would be meaningless for any deployed web app or even for a local mobile based app. By collecting and engineering our own data using a data collection app, we have proposed a neural architecture which can be configured to learn multiple number of urban landmarks while retaining its overall size under 60MBs. This was achieved by a Convolutional Neural Network based binary classification model trained on landmarks existing in our university. Later this was deployed on a web based application and further on it is being made into an app.},

abstract={Recent advancements of Industrial IoT (IIoT) have revolutionized modern urbanization and smart cities. While IIoT data contains rich events and objects of interest, processing a massive amount of IIoT data and making predictions in real-time is challenging. Recent advancements in AI allow processing such a massive amount of IIoT data and generating insights for further decision-making processes. In this paper, we propose several key aspects of AI-enabled IIoT data for smart city monitoring. Firstly, we have combined a human-intelligence-enabled crowdsourcing application with that of an AI-enabled IIoT framework to capture events and objects from IIoT data in real-time. Secondly, we have combined multiple AI algorithms that can run on distributed edge and cloud nodes to automatically categorize the captured events and objects and generate analytics, reports, and alerts from the IIoT data in real-time. The results can be utilized in two scenarios. In the first scenario, the smart city authority can authenticate the AI-processed events and assign these events to the appropriate authority for managing the events. In the second scenario, the AI algorithms are allowed to interact with humans or IIoT for further processes. Finally, we will present the implementation details of the scenarios mentioned above and the test results. The test results show that the framework has the potential to be deployed within a smart city.},

abstract={The development of sensor technologies and an explosion of the inexpensive electronic circuit, the Internet of Things (IoT) is emergent as an encouraging innovation to comprehend sustainable smart city. Smart cities can bid various intelligent applications like smart transportation, smart banking, and industry 4.0, among others, to boost citizens' life quality. However, security is one of the critical problems of a smart city. These emerging smart infrastructure and applications based on IoT can benefit users only if vital private and secure features are guaranteed. Hence, in this paper, Blockchain-enabled Privacy-Preserving Access Control System (BPACS) has been suggested for IoT data in a smart city environment. This study utilizes blockchain methods to construct a reliable and secure data-sharing policy between numerous data providers, where IoT information is encoded and then verified on disseminated ledgers. Furthermore, this study design protected construction blocks, like secure comparison and secure polynomial multiplications, by retaining cryptosystems and build a secure Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) training algorithms. Hard security analysis proves that the suggested model guarantees the privacy of the sensitive information for every data provider and the SVM and PCA model variables for data analysts.},

abstract={Typical cruise-line itineraries are planned more than a year in advance, so it is possible to know how many passengers arrive in advance months ahead, as well as when they leave and for how long they stay. Nevertheless, cruise passengers are often responsible of what is called “tourism crowding” that has a beneficial economic outcome for a destination, but often at the cost of increment of city traffic, overloading of the public transportation means and discomfort generated for residents. So, cruise tourism requires planning and management that takes into account also port city destinations factors. In this paper, we present a Deep Reinforcement Learning based planner for the onshore touristic itineraries and the intelligent distribution of cruise passengers in a city. The aim is to maximise the number of touristic attraction locations visited during a tour by avoiding the overcrowding of the touristic attraction locations. The planner is able to compose onshore touristic itineraries meeting the constraint given within the time window available for the cruise passengers, by taking into account the number of attraction locations available in the city together with dynamic parameters as their reception capacity and the time needed to go from one attraction to another.},

pages={574-588},
abstract={The success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision applications has been accompanied by a significant increase of computation and memory costs, which prohibits their usage on resource-limited environments, such as mobile systems or embedded devices. To this end, the research of CNN compression has recently become emerging. In this paper, we propose a novel filter pruning scheme, termed structured sparsity regularization (SSR), to simultaneously speed up the computation and reduce the memory overhead of CNNs, which can be well supported by various off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. Concretely, the proposed scheme incorporates two different regularizers of structured sparsity into the original objective function of filter pruning, which fully coordinates the global output and local pruning operations to adaptively prune filters. We further propose an alternative updating with Lagrange multipliers (AULM) scheme to efficiently solve its optimization. AULM follows the principle of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and alternates between promoting the structured sparsity of CNNs and optimizing the recognition loss, which leads to a very efficient solver (2.5× to the most recent work that directly solves the group sparsity-based regularization). Moreover, by imposing the structured sparsity, the online inference is extremely memory-light since the number of filters and the output feature maps are simultaneously reduced. The proposed scheme has been deployed to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN structures, including LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, and GoogLeNet, over different data sets. Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods. We further demonstrate the proposed compression scheme for the task of transfer learning, including domain adaptation and object detection, which also show exciting performance gains over the state-of-the-art filter pruning methods.},

abstract={Deep learning has shown great potential in promoting robot intelligence. However, a major obstacle to put it into practice is the huge computational complexity and memory consumption of neural networks. The onboard computers inside robots are usually of limited capability and cannot support the inference of large-scale neural networks with reasonable latency, a property essential to many tasks in the physical world. Moreover, because of the unstable or unacceptable network latency, it is hard to offload computation to powerful backend infrastructure (e.g., data centers) in many cases as well. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel "crowdsourcing" approach to enable efficient inference of large-scale deep learning models on a group of resource-constrained robots. "Crowdsourcing" means that the deep learning tasks on a single robot can exploit the idle computing power of robots in the proximity. This goal is achieved by splitting a network into several parts and distributing them to different robots with the help of the proposed latency prediction and optimal partition selection algorithms. The experiments show that our approach achieves on average 6.01X and up to 46.59X latency speedup in contrast with the approaches in which the models are executed locally on the robot or remotely on the cloud.},

abstract={With the continuous development of smart city, the task of base station traffic flow prediction has become an urgent problem to be solved. In the traffic flow prediction, historical traffic data can provide valuable and important information. However, traditional algorithms cannot allocate reasonable attention to historical traffic during model fitting and prediction. In other words, the attention capability of models is not considered. In order to handle this issue, this paper proposes a base station traffic flow prediction scheme based on Long Short-Term Memory with attention mechanism (A-LSTM). The designed A-LSTM scheme contains three steps. Firstly, the collected base station data should be cleaned up. Subsequently, feature engineering is performed. Finally, the traffic flow prediction algorithm based on the A-LSTM algorithm is realized. It is noted that missing values padding can also be performed under the framework of the A-LSTM. Experiments on real dataset show that the adopted A-LSTM can more effectively model the long term sequential relationship in the data, comparing with the LSTM and the other related algorithms, and achieve the best performance in base station traffic flow prediction for the dataset.},

This can be implemented in the city, at which it is recognized to be developed as a smart city. The proposed research work analyzes the vehicle density using python-OpenCV and YOLOv3. Real time videos are recorded in four directions from Sony HD IP cameras in a designated area. Image frames from video sequence are used to detect moving vehicles. The background extraction method is applied for each frame which is used in subsequent analysis to detect and count all the vehicles. The blobs are detected for each vehicle which helps to track the vehicle in motion. The center of each vehicle with blob gives the count of vehicle based on the lanes considered. This work not only counts the vehicle in real time but also classifies the different vehicles using deep learning technique. YoloV3(You only look once) object detection system is used along with a pretrained model called darknet to classify the vehicle into different categories (bus, car, motorcycle etc). This deep learning method showed better classification and detection rate compared to blobs and morphological method used for counting the vehicles. Classification is shown for vehicle and also person classification is considered to analyze the percentage of people and vehicles. The analysis of percentage of vehicles is shown using pie chart.},

abstract={With the rapid development of smart city and artificial intelligence technology, massive city-related information has been increased. The traditional storage strategy for big data can easily lead to hot nodes, which makes it difficult to meet requirement of big data storage efficiency. A Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) storage strategy for data based on the response time of data nodes (DNs) is proposed. Four parameters of memory utilization, network distance, bandwidth utilization and CPU utilization of DNs are token as evaluation indicators of the strategy. Then the master node evaluates the response time of each data node (DN) based on BP neural network. Finally, the DNs with shorter response time would be chosen for data storage. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can realize the distributed storage for big data and avoid the emergence of hot nodes. Furthermore, the strategy can effectively improve the response time of DNs and the load balancing of cluster.},

abstract={Smart cities are based on connected devices generating large quantities of data every instant. These data can be stored at a nearby edge location for initial processing but later sending the data to the backend data centers for storage and further analysis consumes considerable network bandwidth. In this article, we propose a large-scale data migration framework using vehicles. The framework uses a neural network to identify suitable vehicles as data mules, ones moving toward the data destination, potentially reducing the load from backend networks in terms of bandwidth usage and overall energy consumption. We compare the framework with data transfers using the traditional Internet and an approach without machine intelligence. The proposed framework performs well in terms of data loss, transfer time, energy, and CO2 emissions. From experiments, we demonstrate that the approach achieves a 67% success rate with data transfers $193\times $ faster than the average Internet bandwidth of 21.28 Mb/s. Moreover, the resulting CO2 emissions for 30-TB data transfers stood at 6.403 kg, which is significantly lower compared to 1172.8 kg for the Internet.},

abstract={The surge in energy demand over the last few decades has led to the vast depletion of natural sources of energy and calls for active research and development of effective renewable energy systems. Solar energy is the most abundant renewable source of energy available to us and thus, adoption of solar energy over other energy sources can be an efficient way to secure a sustainable future. However, the change in the sun's relative position to earth through the day varies the intensity of sunlight falling on the photo-voltaic cells of a solar panel, leading to a substantial decrease in its overall efficiency. Therefore, development should concentrate on achieving greater efficiencies using solar panel arrays in order to generate maximum solar power. This paper proposes a solution by tracking the sun's relative position to earth continuously and optimizing the tilt angle of the solar panel accordingly with deep learning. The proposed method predicts the tilt and orientation angle of the sun with a 97% accuracy, resulting in the increase of the solar output power by 10.6% when compared to other non-tracking systems.},

abstract={We introduce a new parallel computing and communication architecture, Reflex-Tree, with massive sensing, data processing, and control functions suitable for future smart cities. The central feature of the proposed Reflex-Tree architecture is inspired by a fundamental element of the human nervous system: reflex arcs, the neuromuscular reactions and instinctive motions of a part of the body in response to urgent situations. At the bottom level of the Reflex-Tree (layer 4), novel sensing devices are proposed that are controlled by low power processing elements. These "leaf" nodes are then connected to new classification engines based on machine learning techniques, including support vector machines (SVM), to form the third layer. The next layer up consists of servers that provide accurate control decisions via multi-layer adaptive learning and spatial-temporal association, before they are connected to the top level cloud where complex system behavior analysis is performed. Our multi-layered architecture mimics human neural circuits to achieve the high levels of parallelization and scalability required for efficient city-wide monitoring and feedback. To demonstrate the utility of our architecture, we present the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of a prototype Reflex-Tree. City power supply network and gas pipeline management scenarios are used to drive our prototype as case studies. We show the effectiveness for several levels of the architecture and discuss the feasibility of implementation.},

abstract={In smart cities equipped with cameras, one desirable use-case is to detect and track objects. While object detection has been implemented using various methods, object tracking poses a different problem; to track an object requires object permanence to be established between each frame of video. While many technologies have been proposed as a solution for problem, an implementation with scalability in mind has not been developed and poses many new challenges. This paper proposes e-SORT, a solution for scalable object tracking using an enhanced version of the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) algorithm. Beyond its scalability, e-SORT stores a mapping of each objects' locations such that the full path of each object is available and several metrics (such as velocity and acceleration) can be calculated. Both e-SORT's abilities and our proposed solution to scalable object tracking are tested and evaluated on Chattanooga Tennessee's live urban testbed.},

abstract={With the modernization of smart cities and the technological advancement of the Internet of Things, we are now reaching a point where technology can be weaved into the fabric of our cities. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of using machine learning to recognize the profile of pedestrians based on their gait and silhouette with the use a thermal camera (FLIR Lepton) connected to a Raspberry Pi. We present the additional challenges faced by collecting gait data in a noisy environment, and by taking human identification a level of abstraction higher and recognizing categories of people. The far reaching implications of such a system in terms of accessibility, inclusivity and social participation of semi-autonomous populations are discussed. The hardware, software and cost of the handmade prototypes used for data collection are described. In an effort to take a step towards sustainable smart cities, the possibility of powering this system using solar panels is investigated. This paper aims to share the lessons learned throughout the creation and deployment of the system and to share the promising first results obtained by the team. We have reached an accuracy of 74.63% for binary age classification (adult, elder), 93.98% for mobility recognition (mobile subject, subject with reduced mobility), 85.77% for group size estimation (one subject, two subjects or more), and 77.29% for observed gender recognition (male, female) using a 2-layer CNN without any pre-processing on very low resolution thermal images.},

abstract={The birth of AlphaGo has set off a new wave of reinforcement learning technology. Reinforcement learning has become one of the most popular directions in the field of artificial intelligence. Its essence is the continuous integration and upgrading of various machine learning methods, and the agents continue to trial and error and obtain cumulative rewards. Q-learning is the most commonly used method in reinforcement learning, but it itself has many problems such as less early information, long learning time, low learning efficiency, and repeated trial and error. Therefore, Q-learning cannot be directly applied to the real environment. In response to this problem, the reinforcement learning discussed by the author is an interactive learning method that combines voice commands and Q-learning. This method uses part of the interaction between the agent and the human voice to find a larger target range in the early stage of learning. Then narrow the search range in turn, which can guide the agent to quickly achieve the learning effect and change the blindness of learning. Simulation experiments show that compared with the standard Q-learning algorithm, the proposed algorithm not only improves the convergence speed, shortens the learning time, but also reduces the number of collisions, enabling the agent to quickly find a better collision- free path.},

abstract={Recently, deep learning based facial expression recognition (FER) methods have attracted considerable attention and they usually require large-scale labelled training data. Nonetheless, the publicly available facial expression databases typically contain a small amount of labelled data. In this paper, to overcome the above issue, we propose a novel joint deep learning of facial expression synthesis and recognition method for effective FER. More specifically, the proposed method involves a two-stage learning procedure. Firstly, a facial expression synthesis generative adversarial network (FESGAN) is pre-trained to generate facial images with different facial expressions. To increase the diversity of the training images, FESGAN is elaborately designed to generate images with new identities from a prior distribution. Secondly, an expression recognition network is jointly learned with the pre-trained FESGAN in a unified framework. In particular, the classification loss computed from the recognition network is used to simultaneously optimize the performance of both the recognition network and the generator of FESGAN. Moreover, in order to alleviate the problem of data bias between the real images and the synthetic images, we propose an intra-class loss with a novel real data-guided back-propagation (RDBP) algorithm to reduce the intra-class variations of images from the same class, which can significantly improve the final performance. Extensive experimental results on public facial expression databases demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art FER methods.},

abstract={Air pollution seriously damages human health on a large scale. Although earlier works have improved a variety of predictive models of air pollution, the ability to accurately predict air pollution indices remains elusive. Time series prediction plays an important role in many fields. Some predecessors have experimented with artificial neural networks (NNs), combining linear autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models with nonlinear NN models. The typical assumption is that time series has a long signal with no white noise. However, a real-time short signal with white noise is common. The methods in the literature also do not guarantee that the prediction error of an NN model is minimized. Therefore, we propose the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to predict future PM2.5 values. First, we use the Q-learning algorithm in RL based on its state characteristics on the NN model. Second, we select the input with different input dimensions and values of time delay, calculate the best strategy, and evaluate the computational complexity of our RL algorithm. Finally, we show that we effectively reduce the prediction error of the NN models.},

abstract={With the IoT industry undergoing a boom, Location Based Services (LBSs) are playing an essential role in constructing smart cities. Since LBSs are in the process of being ubiquitous, it is essential to find a low-cost and low energy solution for localization. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for indoor localization is a smart choice for giving economical solutions to the industry with additional advantages like trouble-free connection to other gadgets. We propose an improved RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) based fingerprinting technique in which data is first augmented and then classified using Machine Learning algorithms. This indoor localization technique facilitates us to recognize the XY-position of the user node (UN) or tag, which receives signals from the anchor nodes (ANs). The fluctuations in the RSSI values were large, because they were affected by multipath propagation and other factors in the indoor positioning environment. The fingerprinting data was augmented to overcome these drawbacks, to decrease the computational cost, to guarantee the precision of the framework by increasing the accuracy and also to be equipped for Machine Learning calculation. The augmentation strategy was actualized by utilizing accessible RSSI esteems at one location, wherein Random Forest gave the highest test accuracy of 96% surpassing all existing methods.},

abstract={Smart video based traffic monitoring and surveillance systems for improved security rely upon sophisticated deep learning based computer vision algorithms. In this paper we propose a novel deep learning model to automatically recognize cars on large-scale grand challenge CompCars dataset. Such a task for a computer is difficult due to its fine-grained nature and achieving recognition accuracy close to human experts remains a challenge due to lack of big dataset and machine learning model to detect delicate nuances. Our proposed deep CNN hybrid architecture outperforms previously published classification accuracy by 2.52%, which is a significant improvement considering the challenging nature of the dataset. Our method suggests several novelties and advantages over existing methods: First, it uses the GoogLeNet's key architecture - inception modules to efficiently exploit the inception's dimension reduction power and to lower the network cost. Second, inspired by the VGG's uniform and powerful architecture, the method replaces GoogLeNet's auxiliary classifiers into deeper networks with 3×3 convolution components to increase its recognition capability. Third, it is a powerful and efficient network in the way that it represents the ensembles of multiple short and medium depth networks. We believe our method could be useful in other domains that require finegrained recognition.},

abstract={Smart environments, such as smart cities and smart homes, are Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPSs) which are becoming an increasing part of our everyday lives. Several applications in these systems, such as energy management through home appliance identification or activity recognition, adopt Machine Learning (ML) as a practical tool for extracting useful knowledge from raw data. These applications are usually characterized by a sequential stream of data, unlike the classical ML scenario in which the entire data is available during training. For such applications, Stream-based Active Learning (SAL) has been designed as a type of supervised ML in which an expert is asked to label the most informative instances as they arrive. Previous SAL techniques assume that the expert is always available and always labels the data correctly. However, in several applications, such as those mentioned above, the SAL activity interweaves with the everyday life of regular residents, who are often not experts, and may also not always be willing to participate in the labeling process. In this paper, we discuss the importance of user-centered ML, and show how taking into account realistic models of user behavior significantly improves the accuracy and reduces the training period of smart environment applications based on SAL. We consider two use cases, namely appliance identification and activity recognition. Results based on real data sets show an improvement in terms of accuracy up to 55.38%.},

The pilot study is concerned with better understanding the interactions between citizens and urban green spaces. A field experiment was carried out in Sheffield, U.K., involving 1870 participants for two different time periods (7 and 30 days). With the help of a smartphone app, both objective and subjective data were collected. Location tracking was recorded as people entered any of the publicly accessible green spaces. This was complemented by textual and photographic information that users could insert spontaneously or when prompted (when entering a green space). By employing data science and machine learning techniques, we identify the main features observed by the citizens through both text and images. Furthermore, we analyze the time spent by people in parks as well as the top interaction areas. This paper allows us to gain an overview of certain patterns and the behavior of the citizens within their surroundings and it proves the capabilities of integrating technology into large-scale social studies.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions to create a smart, connected city that is composed of ubiquitous environmental and user sensing along with distributed, low-capacity computing. This provides ample information regarding the citizens in various smart environments. We can leverage this people-centric information, provided by the smart city infrastructure, to improve “smart health” applications: user data from connected wearable devices can be accompanied with ubiquitous environmental sensing and versatile actuation. The state-of-the-art in smart health applications is black-box, end-to-end implementations which are neither intended for use with heterogeneous data nor adaptable to a changing set of sensing and actuation. In this paper, we apply our modular approach for IoT applications - the context engine - to smart health problems, enabling the ability to grow with available data, use general-purpose machine learning, and reduce compute redundancy and complexity. For smart health, this improves response times for critical situations, more efficient identification of health-related conditions and subsequent actuation in a smart city environment. We demonstrate the potential with three sets of interconnected context-aware applications, extracting health-related people-centric context, such as user presence, user activity, air quality, and location from IoT sensors.},

abstract={Accurate traffic flow prediction plays a crucial role in designing Ad hoc vehicular mobile networks in modern Internet of things (IoT) based intelligent systems. Several deep learning techniques have been deployed to predict traffic conditions to make vehicular communication more reliable. However, not all these approaches deal with complex road networks and spatial temporal dependencies of traffic data. In this paper, we analyze this problem using long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and hybrid CNN-LSTM models. We trained our models using actual traffic flow data provided by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) over a 6 month duration and showed that our deep learning models outperform the traditional linear regression method. Moreover, an architectural study of deep learning models is carried out for the traffic flow prediction problem. The performance of these models is evaluated using MSE and MAE metrics. It is observed that the GRU model is the best to handle the complex vehicular traffic mechanisms. Also, that a complex hybrid model like CNN-LSTM does not always outperform the much simpler architectures such as LSTM and GRU.},

A comparative analysis was conducted on each machine learning model, examining the prediction accuracy and time-horizon sensitivity. Furthermore, we examined different input parameter settings (various classes of vehicles such as motorcycles, cars, vans, rigid goods lorries, articulated heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), and buses) to investigate how heterogeneous traffic flow can affect prediction. The experimental results show that the Artificial Neural Network Model outperforms other models at predicting short-term traffic flow on an urbanised arterial road based on the standard performance indicator: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Additionally, it is found that different classes of vehicles can aid the improvement prediction.},

abstract={Urban resource scheduling is an important part of the development of a smart city, and transportation resources are the main components of urban resources. Currently, a series of problems with transportation resources such as unbalanced distribution and road congestion disrupt the scheduling discipline. Therefore, it is significant to predict travel demand for urban resource dispatching. Previously, the traditional time series models were used to forecast travel demand, such as AR, ARIMA and so on. However, the prediction efficiency of these methods is poor and the training time is too long. In order to improve the performance, deep learning is used to assist prediction. But most of the deep learning methods only utilize temporal dependence or spatial dependence of data in the forecasting process. To address these limitations, a novel deep learning traffic demand forecasting framework which based on Deep Spatio-Temporal ConvLSTM is proposed in this paper. In order to evaluate the performance of the framework, an end-to- end deep learning system is designed and a real dataset is used. Furthermore, the proposed method can capture temporal dependence and spatial dependence simultaneously. The closeness, period and trend components of spatio-temporal data are used in three predicted branches. These branches have the same network structures, but do not share weights. Then a linear fusion method is used to get the final result. Finally, the experimental results on DIDI order dataset of Chengdu demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional models with accuracy and speed.},

abstract={In developing effective public security policies, two aspects are essential: intelligence and information. In this context, the classification of Macrocauses can help governments better understand some aspects of public security related to the analysis of violent crimes in a state. In the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), these analyses are currently done by analyzing raw data done by an expert without any specific auxiliary system, known as traditional approaches. It is a time-consuming task, and different experts may have different views on the same case. With this in mind, in this work, we intend to assist these criminal experts by providing a predictive model that classifies the Macrocauses of crimes into a set of pre-defined types to guide the work of the experts and, as a consequence, to speed up the analysis and management processes. Thus, a feature preprocessing was performed in which three different classification techniques are analyzed. The results show that when using XGBoost, the model accuracy reached 0.932378, which is considered excellent for this application.},

GraphComm takes the explicit relations (e.g., agent types), which can be provided through some knowledge background, into account to better model the relationships among agents. Besides explicit relations, GraphComm considers implicit relations, which are formed by agent interactions. GraphComm use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the relational information, and use GNNs to assist the learning of agent communication.

abstract={Rear-end collision prediction has gained an increasing attention for safety improvement in smart cities. It is urgent to design efficient warning strategies for rear-end collisions which is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. The existing researches have been conducted to predict the collisions. Learning-based methods are proposed to solve this complicated issue, which the traditional methods are difficult to solve. However, due to some limitations in terms of the feature extraction and prediction performance, back-propagation learning methods are facing challenge. In this paper, we proposed a novel Rear-end Collision Prediction Mechanism with deep learning method (RCPM), in which a convolutional neural network model is established. In RCPM, the dataset is smoothed and expanded based on genetic theory to alleviate the class imbalance problem. The preprocessed dataset is divided into training and testing sets as the input to train our convolutional neural network model. The experimental results show that compared with the Honda, Berkeley and multi-layer perception neural-network-based algorithms, RCPM effectively improves performance to predict rear-end collisions.},

abstract={There is a common understanding that cleanliness is somehow proportional to the economic development of a country. Thus, in order to become clean, a country needs to have an efficient garbage monitoring system. One important component of such a system is garbage collection time because if we delay emptying the bins, the trash ends up to putting public health at risk. This paper is about creating a Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) based model for classifying a waste container as full or not, so that can be later on used by real-time garbage monitoring systems to process images acquired by cameras installed nearby the trash bins or smartphones. To achieve this, we trained and tested different well-known DCNNs architectures, namely, ResNet34, ResNet50, Inception-v4 and DarkNet53. The models were trained and tested using Repeated K-Fold Cross-Validation, running 5-Fold Cross-Validation 6 times. The results have showed that Inception-v4 outperformed the other models, with near-perfect results: PR-AUC =0.994, F1=0.988, Precision =0.989, Recall =0.987 and ACC =0.987. With these results can be said: a high Precision DCNNs based model was built.},

The study of criminal behavior is significant to the formulation of new law enforcement strategies for crime prevention and control. In addition, some governments have implemented projects in a smart cities context to make available some databases related to various phenomena that occur inside their cities, including those associated with criminal acts. Medellin, Colombia, has several public databases where it is possible to get information about mobility, education, infrastructure, health, and security. In this work, some Machine Learning models are developed and evaluated for crime hotspots prediction using available geographical, temporal and demographic information available in Medellin for a period between 2015 and 2019. The work analyzes the implications of selecting geographic divisions and the separation of time intervals in the models. As a result, it was found that the models based on Decision Trees present an F1-Score of 88.2 % and have better performance than models based on Logistic Regression and Neural Networks (MLP).},

abstract={The measurement and provision of precise and up-to-date traffic-related key performance indicators is a key element and crucial factor for intelligent traffic control systems in upcoming smart cities. The street network is considered as a highly-dynamic Cyber Physical System (CPS) where measured information forms the foundation for dynamic control methods aiming to optimize the overall system state. Apart from global system parameters like traffic flow and density, specific data, such as velocity of individual vehicles as well as vehicle type information, can be leveraged for highly sophisticated traffic control methods like dynamic type-specific lane assignments. Consequently, solutions for acquiring these kinds of information are required and have to comply with strict requirements ranging from accuracy over cost-efficiency to privacy preservation. In this paper, we present a system for classifying vehicles based on their radio-fingerprint. In contrast to other approaches, the proposed system is able to provide real-time capable and precise vehicle classification as well as cost-efficient installation and maintenance, privacy preservation and weather independence. The system performance in terms of accuracy and resource-efficiency is evaluated in the field using comprehensive measurements. Using a machine learning based approach, the resulting success ratio for classifying cars and trucks is above 99%.},

The proposed Energy-Net stack comprises multiple stacked spatiotemporal modules, where each module consists of a temporal transformer (TT) submodule and a spatial transformer (ST) submodule. The TT models the temporal relationships in load data; and the ST submodule extracts hidden spatial information by integrating convolutional layers and includes an improved self-attention mechanism. The experimental evaluation on IHPEC and independent system operator New England (ISO-NE) data set demonstrates the superiority of Energy-Net over recent cutting-edge DL models with root mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.354 and 0.535, respectively. The computational complexity of Energy-Net is appropriate for dependable resource-constrained IoT devices (i.e., fog nodes or edge nodes) linked to a joint IoT-cloud server that interacts with connected smart grids to handle EM tasks.},

abstract={Nowadays, a large number of sensors are equipped on mobile or stationary platforms, which continuously generate geo-tagged and time-stamped readings (i.e., geo-sensory data) that contain rich information about the surrounding environment. These data have irregular space and time coordinates. To represent geo-sensory data, there have been extensive research efforts using time sequences, grid-like images, and graph signals. However, there still lacks a proper representation that can describe both the mobile and stationary geo-sensory data without the information-losing discretization in spatial and temporal dimensions. In this paper, we propose to represent massive geo-sensory data as spatio-temporal point clouds (STPC), and present STPC-Net, a novel deep neural network for processing STPC. STPC leverages the original irregular space-time coordinates, and STPC-Net captures intra-sensor and inter-sensor correlations from STPC. In this way, STPC-Net learns the key information of STPC, and overcomes challenges in data irregularity. Experiments using real-world datasets show that STPC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in different tasks on both mobile and stationary geo-sensory data.

abstract={Traffic control and management is an important factor in related with development of urban. A smart city comprises of smart health care, smart environment, smart home and smart road transportation system. For all these modernizations both artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) take major parts in smart operation. By using hybrid sensors, the traffic light systems can be triggered depending on the measured volume of traffic, including temporary deactivation of the traffic lights when roads are quiet. The traffic data collected with the hybrid technology is then used to analyse and control traffic volumes. The radar technology for traffic monitoring applications include traffic light controls, speed enforcement, traffic monitoring and traffic classification. Therefore, this proposal suggests exploring design and prototype model and utilize the model for appropriate road traffic monitoring and management system. The objectives of the proposed system are to reduce traffic congestion, to count traffic flow, to classify the traffic, to provide green environment by reducing air-pollution generated by vehicles, to provide safety for stakeholders (pedestrians and driver and passengers) and to forecast traffic flow.},

abstract={With the rapid development of smart city and 5G, user demand for Internet services has increased exponentially. Through collaborative content sharing, the storage limitation of a single edge server (ES) can be broken. However, when mobile users need to download the whole content through multiple regions, independently deciding the caching content for ESs in different regions may result in redundant caching. Furthermore, frequent switching of communication connection during user movement also causes retransmission delay. As a revolutionary approach in the artificial intelligence field, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has earned great success in solving high-dimensional and network resource management related problems. Therefore, we integrate collaborative caching and DRL to build an intelligent edge caching framework, so as to realize collaborative caching between cloud and ESs. In this caching framework, a fed-erated-machine-learning-based user behavior prediction model is first designed to characterize the content preference and movement trajectory of mobile users. Next, to achieve efficient resource aggregation of ESs, a user-behavior-aware dynamic collaborative caching domain (DCCD) construction and management mechanism is devised to divide ESs into clusters, select cluster heads, and set the re-clustering rules. Then a DRL-based content caching and delivery algorithm is presented to decide the caching content of ESs in a DCCD from a global perspective and plan the transmission path for users, which reduces redundant content and transmission delay. Especially when a user request cannot be satisfied by the current DCCD, a cross-domain content delivery strategy is presented to allow ESs in other DCCDs to provide and forward content to the user, avoiding the traffic pressure and delay caused by requesting services from cloud. The simulation results show that the proposed collaborative caching framework can improve user satisfaction in terms of content hit rate and service delay.},

pages={613-619},
abstract={Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been widely used in a large number of application scenarios. However, DNN models are generally both computation-intensive and memory-intensive, thus difficult to be deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. Most previous studies focus on local model compression or remote cloud offloading, but overlook the potential benefits brought by distributed DNN execution on multiple edge devices. In this paper, we propose EdgeLD, a new framework for locally distributed execution of DNN-based inference tasks on a cluster of edge devices. In EdgeLD, DNN models' time cost will be firstly profiled in terms of computing capability and network bandwidth. Guided by profiling, an efficient model partition scheme is designed in EdgeLD to balance the assigned workload and the inference runtime among different edge devices. We also propose to employ layer fusion to reduce communication overheads on exchanging intermediate data among devices. Experiment results show that our proposed partition scheme saves up to 15.82% of inference time with regard to the conventional solution. Besides, applying layer fusion can speedup the DNN inference by 1.11-1.13X. When combined, EdgeLD can accelerate the original inference time by 1.77-3.57X on a cluster of 2-4 edge devices.},

abstract={Smart Cities and Smart Industries are the flagships of the future IoT due to their potential to revolutionize the way in which people live and produce in advanced societies. In these two scenarios, a robust and ubiquitous communication infrastructure is needed to accommodate the traffic generated by the 10 billion devices that are expected by the year 2020. Due to its future world-wide presence, 5G is called to be this enabling technology. However, 5G is not a perfect solution, thus providing IoT nodes with different Radio Access Technologies (RATs) would allow them to exploit the various benefits offered by each RAT (such as lower power consumption or reduced operational costs). By making use of the mathematical framework of Reinforcement Learning, we have formulated the problem of deciding which RAT should an IoT node employ when reporting events. These so-called transmission policies maximize a predefined reward closely related to classical throughput while keeping power consumption and operational costs below a certain limit. A set of simulations are performed for IoT nodes provided with two RATs: LoRa and 5G. The results obtained are compared to those achieved under other intuitive policies to further highlight the benefits of our proposal.},

abstract={In this paper, we study an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless secure communication system, where an IRS is deployed to adjust its reflecting elements to secure the communication of multiple legitimate users in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. Aiming to improve the system secrecy rate, a design problem for jointly optimizing the base station (BS)'s beamforming and the IRS's reflecting beamforming is formulated considering different quality of service (QoS) requirements and time-varying channel conditions. As the system is highly dynamic and complex, and it is challenging to address the non-convex optimization problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based secure beamforming approach is firstly proposed to achieve the optimal beamforming policy against eavesdroppers in dynamic environments. Furthermore, post-decision state (PDS) and prioritized experience replay (PER) schemes are utilized to enhance the learning efficiency and secrecy performance. Specifically, a modified PDS scheme is presented to trace the channel dynamic and adjust the beamforming policy against channel uncertainty accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep PDS-PER learning based secure beamforming approach can significantly improve the system secrecy rate and QoS satisfaction probability in IRS-aided secure communication systems.},

abstract={Deep learning systems have been growing in prominence as a way to automatically characterize objects, trends, and anomalies. Researchers have been investigating techniques to optimize such systems. An area of particular interest has been using supercomputing systems to quickly generate effective deep learning networks, a phase referred to as “training” of the deep neural network. As we scale deep learning frameworks-such as Caffe-on large-scale systems, we notice that parallelism can help improve the computation tremendously, leaving data I/O as the major bottleneck limiting the overall system scalability. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the performance bottlenecks of Caffe on large supercomputing systems. The analysis shows that Caffe's I/O subsystem-LMDB-relies on memory-mapped I/O, which can be highly inefficient on large-scale systems because of its interaction with the process-scheduling system and the network-based parallel filesystem. Based on this analysis, we present LMDBIO, an optimized I/O plugin for Caffe that takes into account the data access pattern in order to vastly improve I/O performance. Experimental results show that LMDBIO can improve the overall execution time of Caffe by nearly 20-fold in some cases.},

LoRa is one such technology, which provides energy efficiency and wide-area coverage. This article explores the use of intelligent machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines, spline models, decision trees, and ensemble learning, for received signal strength indicator (RSSI)-based ranging in LoRa networks on a training dataset collected in two different environments: indoors and outdoors. The suitable ranging model is then used to experimentally evaluate the accuracy of localization and tracking using trilateration in the studied environments. Later, we present the accuracy of a LoRa-based positioning system (LPS) and compare it with the existing ZigBee, WiFi, and Bluetooth-based solutions. In the end, we discuss the challenges of satellite-independent tracking systems and propose future directions to improve accuracy and provide deployment feasibility.},

abstract={Recently, Combining communication technology with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been regarding as one of the promising techniques in the future network. Various services can be served through UAV, such as information collection in disaster area or traffic monitoring in smart city. However, on-board computation resource and the battery lifetime of UAV are limited. For that reason, there is a limit to perform analysis, such as, machine learning using collected data. In this situation, UAV can get help from an adjacent Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server that has computing resources. However, the closest MEC server does not always guarantee optimal computing performance and communication efficiency. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose the overall system of machine learning based UAV to MEC computation offloading for data analyzing. First, we define the problems into two. Firstly, we define two problems 1) matching UAV and task cluster in consideration of energy efficiency. 2) Finding optimal MEC server to offload the task to minimize the total processing time and energy consumption. Then, we apply a machine-learning algorithm to solve the two problems. In the simulation section, we analyze the proposed method and greedy method in terms of total energy consumption and total processing time. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism is efficient in total energy consumption of UAV and total processing time of tasks.},

abstract={Mobile Internet of things (MIoT) applications serving smart cities bring the promise of innovative and enhanced public services such as air pollution monitoring, enhanced road safety and city resources metering and management. These applications rely on a number of energy-constrained MIoT units (MUs) (e.g., robots and drones) to continuously sense, capture and process data and images from their environments to produce immediate adaptive actions. In this paper, we consider a scenario where a battery constrained MU executes a number of time- sensitive data processing tasks whose arrival times and sizes are stochastic in nature. We first formulate the problem of making optimal offloading decisions that minimize the cost of current and future tasks as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) that accounts for the constraints of the MU battery and the limited reserved resources on the MEC infrastructure by the application providers. Next, we show how the CMDP problem can be relaxed using Lagrangian primal-dual optimization. We then develop a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based algorithm to train the MU to solve the relaxed problem. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the achieved performance improvement.},

We set three goals for our strategies: not to stop too late, nor too early, and get relatively cheap gas. To satisfy these goals, we relate our problem to the Gusein-Zade's version of the secretary problem and provide a solution framework where we divide the distance a vehicle can travel from a full tank to an empty tank into Density Observation Section, Secretary Section, and the Critical Section. To predict the number of gas stations a vehicle will encounter in the future, we use the Constant Density Approximation (CDA) method and the Machine Learning (ML) method.

abstract={Pedestrian recognition is a key problem for a number of application domains namely autonomous driving, search and rescue, surveillance and robotics. Real-time pedestrian recognition entails determining if a pedestrian is in an image frame. State-of-art pedestrian detection convolution neural networks(CNN) such as Fast R-CNN depend on computationally expensive region detection algorithms to hypothesize pedestrian locations. This paper presents a simple, fast and very accurate approach by cascading fast regional detection and deep convolution networks. Convolution networks have been shown to excel at image classification. However, convolution networks are notoriously slow at inference time. In this work, we introduce a fast regional detection cascaded with deep convolution networks that enables real-time pedestrian detection that could be used to alert a driver if a pedestrian is on the roadway. The classification CNN has given an accuracy of 95.7%, with a processing rate of about 15 frames per second on a low performance system without a graphical processing unit (GPU).},

abstract={People around the world are trending to the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. A large number of IoT devices are installed every day to enhance the sophistication and sustainability of smart cities. Besides, a smart city needs a smart energy management system including a smart grid, smart building. Also, a smart energy distribution system is important to reduce energy and manage it efficiently. The IoT devices are installed in various buildings in the city, they use a lot of energy, and produce energy usage information. In the existing cloud system, it is difficult to analyze and transfer the data quickly, similarly impossible to receive the analysis result immediately. However, edge computing has the advantage of fast data analysis and supply analyzed results to the field. In this process, data is processed in the edge environment, where data has been collected, analyzed, and processed in the edge nodes. In this study, we presented an energy prediction model based on the edge computing technique. We used a dataset where various environmental and energy use information has been considered. Also, we have used five different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to classify the prediction model and assess the prediction performance. This study presents an energy prediction model using various ML classifiers in an edge computing environment.},

The recent developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) opened vast opportunities for researchers and developers to implement various systems and applications in the field of Smart Cities and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). It is a diverse topic of discussion with several application areas such as smart traffic management, smart street lights or gas and water leak detection. Among these applications, Efficient Waste Collection (WC) is considered a fundamental service for helping maintain a healthier environment for the citizens while reducing operating costs. This paper proposes a new architecture for a smart wastes management system based on artificial intelligence techniques and focuses on the combined use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and surveillance systems as an assistive technology for high Quality of Service (QoS) in waste collection.

abstract={Although deep learning takes researchers out of complicated feature engineering, designing practical deep learning models is still a complicated process. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is famous for automating the design of deep learning models. While the fundamental problem of NAS methods is time-consuming, parallel computing is an encouraging way to relieve this problem. We designed a two-level hierarchical parallel system called ParallelNAS, comprising a parallel explorer and parallel evaluators. For the parallel explorer, a general-purposed distributed search framework is built on virtualized, massively-parallel, asynchronous infrastructure. For parallel evaluators, we integrate a segment-balanced sparsity scheme into a mainstream data-parallel architecture. The overall experiment results demonstrate that our distributed and parallel system can reach near-linear speedups on a cluster of 64 GPUs.},

abstract={Deep learning has recently been applied to automatically classify the modulation categories of received radio signals without manual experience. However, training deep learning models requires massive volume of data. An insufficient training data will cause serious overfitting problem and degrade the classification accuracy. To cope with small dataset, data augmentation has been widely used in image processing to expand the dataset and improve the robustness of deep learning models. However, in wireless communication areas, the effect of different data augmentation methods on radio modulation classification has not been studied yet. In this paper, we evaluate different data augmentation methods via a state-of-the-art deep learning-based modulation classifier. Based on the characteristics of modulated signals, three augmentation methods are considered, i.e., rotation, flip, and Gaussian noise, which can be applied in both training phase and inference phase of the deep learning-based classifier. Numerical results show that all three augmentation methods can improve the classification accuracy. Among which, the rotation augmentation method outperforms the flip method, both of which achieve higher classification accuracy than the Gaussian noise method. Given only 12.5% of training dataset, a joint rotation and flip augmentation policy can achieve even higher classification accuracy than the baseline with initial 100% training dataset without augmentation. Furthermore, with data augmentation, radio modulation categories can be successfully classified using shorter radio samples, leading to a simplified deep learning model and a shorter classification response time.},

abstract={Cloud computing enables enterprises to deploy Web applications on elastically rented Virtual Machines (VMs). In order to minimize VM rental costs while fulfilling Service Level Agreements (SLAs), it is crucial to design effective VM provisioning algorithms. Queueing and control theories based methods are widely used in existing works. However, complex nonlinear system characteristics restrict these methods from getting well performance and most of them are tailored for homogeneous resources. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning method is proposed for provisioning heterogeneous multi-type VMs which takes advantage of the deep-learning-network's nonlinear modeling ability, incremental-VM-capacity-based action space definition and Integer Linear Programming based mapping from the incremental capacity to the multi-type VM renting plan. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the fastest convergence speed and highest total rewards.},

abstract={The Internet of things is widely used to provide a lot of useful services such as human health care, security systems and green energy monitoring. It contributes to the sustainable development of smart cities in order to manage and integrate renewable energies. The swift growth of Home Solar Power Systems (HSPS) has enabled a large-scale collection of time series data. As advanced tools, smart meters can ensure the timely reading of HSPS data, automating metering and producing fine-grained data. However, to ensure the dynamic data management and a better understanding of HSPS operations, it is crucial to analyze and forecast these digital records for decision-making and smart control. Up to now, deep learning algorithms have only been applied sparsely in the field of renewable energy power forecasting. In this paper, we apply an auto-configurable middleware based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model for several forecasting time dimensions to choose the significant timescale for learning setting. The results show that our deep-learning model has good performances compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for the whole proposed learning timescale. However, the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) seems better than our proposed auto-LSTM algorithm, but it takes much execution time for 15 min and 30 min-ahead forecasting. Thus, the day-ahead forecasting is the most efficient timescale in our case.},

abstract={Millions of battery-powered sensors deployed for monitoring purposes in a multitude of scenarios, e.g., agriculture, smart cities, industry, etc., require energy-efficient solutions to prolong their lifetime. When these sensors observe a phenomenon distributed in space and evolving in time, it is expected that collected observations will be correlated in time and space. This paper proposes a () based scheduling mechanism capable of taking advantage of correlated information. The designed solution employs () algorithm. The proposed mechanism can determine the frequency with which sensors should transmit their updates, to ensure accurate collection of observations, while simultaneously considering the energy available. The solution is evaluated with multiple datasets containing environmental observations obtained in multiple real deployments. The real observations are leveraged to model the environment with which the mechanism interacts as realistically as possible. The proposed solution can significantly extend the sensors’ lifetime and is compared to an idealized, all-knowing scheduler to demonstrate that its performance is near-optimal. Additionally, the results highlight the unique feature of proposed design, energy-awareness, by displaying the impact of sensors’ energy levels on the frequency of updates.},

Our idea is inspired by multiple instance learning (MIL) techniques based on common share features with reinforcement learning. We consider normal and abnormal videos as bags and the selection of videos clips as actions. In our DQN architecture we will design a fully connected layer, which compute probability for each video segment in both positive (anomalous) and negative(normal) bags indicating how likely a clip is containing an anomaly. Our method is applied to a new large-scale dataset of 128 hours of videos called UCF-Anomaly-Detection-Dataset, it is about of 1900 long and untrimmed real-world surveillance videos, with 13 cases of realistic anomalies.},

abstract={Smart cities are a complicated blend of Information and communications technology (ICT) as well as Internet of Things (IoT) from physical (such as sensors and actuators) and non-physical (such as external databases) data sources. The smart physical data sources contribute to developing the level of safety and security of citizens' daily life through different smart solutions such as optimization for autonomous power grids and human health applications. Those physical devices generate a massive amount of data that is necessary for analytic applications to be applied in user services. Cloud computing technologies utilize as a centralized ICT architecture to collect the massive amount of data from all scale of the city and build the citizens' services by developers. However, several challenges in cybercrime and cybersecurity exist in Cloud computing technologies as well as large scale IoT environments and smart cities. Those challenges are i) the new generation of the attack on an IoT network is to create a problem with the availability of IoT data for the Cloud applications by overwhelming devices with information requests; ii) complex communication and computation resource constraints has a big concern to moving forward to detect attack at the edge of networks. Therefore, heading off the threat of cybercrime in large scale IoT and smart cities calls for a new study on designing cybersecurity models for ICT architecture. In this paper, we first present our fully hierarchal Distributed-to-Centralized ICT (D2C-ICT) architecture for the Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZEN) center in the context of the smart cities. Second, we propose two different novel anomaly detection models by using the contribution of Fog to cloudlet and Cloud technologies through our presented D2C-ICT Architecture in the context of the smart city. Finally, we discuss two different use cases for attack detection. We envisage that we can enhance the level of attack detection techniques through different technologies of the D2C-ICT from edge to Cloud networks.},

abstract={Wildfires are the most deadly and dangerous accidents across the United States, especially in California. Many lives are lost, and billions of dollars’ worth of property damages occur in wildfire every year. Wildfires are fueled and accelerated by several different factors, such as weather, climate, vegetation types, land cover, and human activities. This research aims to develop a machine learning and big data-based fire risk prediction model considering the different geographical factors outlined above. We propose a systematic way to make fire risk prediction and detection models that analyzes satellite data, weather data, and historical fire data to predict fire. We got an accuracy of 100% using ensemble model and 93% using Faster R-CNN for wildfire risk prediction and fire detection, respectively, using machine learning models.},

abstract={Road transportation is the backbone of modern societies, yet it costs annually over a million deaths and trillions of dollars to the global economy. Social media such as Twitter have increasingly become an important source of information in many dimensions of smart societies. Automatic detection of road traffic events using Twitter data mining is one such area of a great many applications and enormous potential, albeit facing major challenges concerning the management and analysis of big data (volume, velocity, variety, and veracity). Various approaches on the subject have been proposed in recent years, but the methods and outcomes are in their infancy. This paper proposes a method for automatic detection of road traffic related events from tweets in the Saudi dialect using machine learning and big data technologies. Firstly, we build and train a classifier using three machine learning algorithms, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and logistic regression, to filter tweets into relevant and irrelevant. Subsequently, we train other classifiers to detect multiple types of events including accident, roadwork, road closure, road damage, traffic condition, fire, weather, and social events. The results from the analysis of one million tweets show that our method is able to detect road traffic events, as well as their location and time, automatically, without any prior knowledge of the events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on traffic event detection from Arabic tweets using machine learning and the Apache Spark big data platform.},

abstract={In recent years, with the rapid development in IP camera usage, massive video surveillance data are produced at an unprecedented speed. IP camera is one of the most important elements in In Internet of things (IoT) and smart cities, in this era. IoT Based Smart Surveillance provides resources over the Internet and allows a plethora of applications to be deployed to provide services for different applications. Traditional solutions to deal with the big video data would require a large amount of computing and storage resources. one of the major bottleneck being faced the computational cost of spatio-temporal deep neural networks making them run as fast as their 2D counterparts while preserving accuracy on video recognition benchmarks. To this end, we present the new model-based human action recognition design. In this method we use fixed dimensional representation for actions in video clips of varying lengths to decrees computational complexes. This representation, simplify clustering and comparing between videos. In addition, the methods based on CNN usually need manual annotation at the beginning and the meaning of characteristics is an abstract wonder and subjective phenomenon and hence a manual annotation of attributes is highly inconsistent [1]. Anyhow our proposed smart surveillance system is unsupervised and don't need inconsistent manual annotation of video clips attributes. Many researchers believe smart surveillance system is a critical component of smart cities and can be a solid foundation for future applications in intelligent surveillance systems focuses on human action Recognition.},

abstract={Due to the big variance between infrared images in day and night, the detection of infrared pedestrians in full-time has been a difficult point and has great significance both in theory and practice. Based on the deep learning method, we proposed three full-time infrared pedestrian detection models based on CSP (Center and Scale Prediction) network, namely, night model, daytime model, full-time model. Then, the performance of the three models are analyzed and compared quantitatively, and the results show that the performance of the full time model is the optimal one, the detection accuracy rate in day and night reach 83.86% and 80.22% respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, the miss rate in day and night detection of the full time model in this paper is 12.23% and 4.56% lower respectively, thus the performance of the full-time model in our work is more effective.},
