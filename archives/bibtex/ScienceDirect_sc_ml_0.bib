abstract = {Nanogenerators have attracted particular attention during the last decade. A nanogenerator harness mechanical or thermal energy to produce electricity without any need for battery. In this paper, general descriptions of different types of nanogenerators, including piezoelectric, triboelectric, and pyroelectric, are presented. Next, bibliometric analysis and unsupervised machine learning–based analysis (principle component analysis) are carried out to determine the trends in this field of science. The current developments and directions for technology commercialization are briefly discussed. Additionally, the output performance and environmental consequences of active materials used in nanogenerators are analyzed by principle component analysis. The analysis reveals China’s sensible investment in the nanogenerator field during the last five years. The number of articles published by Chinese scholars is over 1000 during 2015–2020 with a considerable distance from the USA. It is also deduced that European countries need to pay more attention to this field if they want to compete with the USA, China, and South Korea. Overall, due to the huge amount of waste thermal energy worldwide, more efforts and resources have to be focused and invested in developing pyroelectric nanogenerators. Moreover, there is a need to find low-cost materials having a favorable environmental profile to fabricate nanogenerators.}

abstract = {Substantial population growth, increasing urbanization, overloaded infrastructure, more energy consumption, environmental impacts, and investment in technological developments are major challenges in city management and development. Municipalities seek to improve their citizens’ wellbeing and quality of life, but the need to find a balance between these complex factors makes decision-making processes more difficult. Experts must analyze the determinants of smart cities, which are urban centers intended to be socially involved, habitable, and economically and environmentally sustainable, and that rely strongly on technology and innovation. Based on multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) principles, this study combines cognitive mapping techniques and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to develop a multicriteria model that can help managers analyze smart city determinants in a collaborative manner. The research included identifying these determinants and their respective cause-and-effect relationships using an expert panel’s experience and knowledge related to the subject under analysis. The results were validated by both the panel and the city councilor responsible for mobility and municipal projects within Évora City Council, Portugal, which has implemented smart city strategies. The latter specialist verified that the proposed evaluation system can be used as a tool to facilitate smart city collaborative decision-making processes. The study’s main advantages and limitations are also analyzed and discussed.}

Although Wi-Fi 6 is already in the market designed for IoT applications. New Smart City applications based on Big Data will depend on 5G as a mobile Internet service provider therefore eliminating the need to deploy additional private network infrastructure or mobile networks. The benefits due to the expanded network access and enhanced connectivity between devices also intrinsically increase cybersecurity risks. Cyber attackers will be provided with additional digital targets; in addition, wireless and mobile network including the access channel infrastructure will be shared between independent services. To address these cybersecurity issues, this article presents the Blockchain Random Neural Network for Cybersecurity applications in a holistic digital and physical cybersecurity user and channel authentication methods. The user identity is kept secret as the neural weights codify the user information, although in case of cybersecurity breach, the confidential identity can be mined and the attacker identified. The proposed method therefore enables a decentralized authentication method. The validation results prove that the addition of the Blockchain Random Neural Network provides a user access control algorithm with increased cybersecurity resilience and decentralized user access and connectivity.}

We describe the system architecture and its typical application scenarios of distributed environment perception for city roads, parking lots, as well as for commercial and residential buildings. PVs are motivated to assist in deep learning model inference for the captured image data in such applications.

A central administrator appointed by the government manages and maintains the security of each node. Smart City relies upon millions of sensors that are heterogeneous and do not support standard security architecture. Different manufacturers have weak protection protocols for their products and do not update their firmware upon newly identified operating systems’ vulnerabilities. Adversaries using brute force methods exploit the lack of inbuilt security systems on IoT devices to grow their bot network. Smart cities require a standard framework combining soft computing and Deep Learning (DL) for device fleet management and complete control of sensor operating systems for absolute security. This paper presents a real-world application for IoT fleet management security using a lightweight container-based botnet detection (C-BotDet) framework. Using a three-phase approach, the framework using Artificial Intelligence detects compromised IoT devices sending malicious traffic on the network. Balena Cloud revokes API keys and prevents a compromised device from infecting other devices to form a more giant botnet. VPN (Virtual Private Network) prevents inter-device communication and routes all malicious traffic through an external server. The framework quickly updates the standard Linux-based operating system IoT device fleet without relying on different manufacturers to update their system security individually. The simulation and analysis of the C-BotDet framework are presented in a practical working environment to demonstrate its implementation feasibility.}

While the literature is ripe with descriptions of those projects and pioneering cities, there is far less systematic research on why some cities are more advanced than others. As single locating entities, cities are posited to have strong geographic rootedness. Hence, spatial and socio-economic context, considered as the main stimulant of organizational innovation, can be particularly important for cities. We investigate 22 Swiss cities with smart city projects and use fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to determine the configuration of conditions that make some cities more advanced than others in their smart city development. Results indicate that a configuration of high share of service sector, presence of research institutions and high urban density is sufficient for the outcome, whereas population size, new residential development and participation to international networks appear as less important. By providing insights into the spatial and socio-economic underpinnings of smart city development, the study contributes to the understanding of the geographies of smart cities.}

However, challenges such as security, privacy, trust, scalability, verifiability, and centralization prevent faster adaptations of IoT-driven smart cities. Thus, in this paper, a Trustworthy Privacy-Preserving Secured Framework (TP2SF) for smart cities is presented. This framework includes three modules namely: a trustworthiness module, a two-level privacy module, and an intrusion detection module. In trustworthiness module, address-based blockchain reputation system is designed. In the two-level privacy module, a blockchain based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is simultaneously applied with Principal Component analysis (PCA) to transform data into a new reduced shape for preventing inference and poisoning attacks. In the intrusion detection module, an optimized gradient tree boosting system (XGBoost) is deployed. Finally, due to inherited strengths and weaknesses of Fog–Cloud architecture, we present a blockchain-IPFS integrated Fog–Cloud infrastructure namely, CloudBlock and FogBlock to deploy proposed TP2SF framework in smart city. The TP2SF framework is evaluated using two realistic IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. The findings indicate the superiority of TP2SF framework over other state-of-the-art techniques in both nonblockchain and blockchain systems.}

Digital twins were originally designed to improve manufacturing processes using simulations that have highly accurate models of individual components. However, with increasingly large and accurate building information models (BIM) combined with big data generated from IoT sensors in a smart city, it is now possible to create digital twin smart cities. An accurate 3D model of a city can be published online and walked around by the public to view proposed changes in urban planning and policy. This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning. In this paper, we demonstrate a public and open digital twin of the Docklands area in Dublin, Ireland and show how this model can be used for urban planning of skylines and green space allowing users to interact and report feedback on planned changes.}

It integrates Information and Communication Tools (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and other technologies to resolve urban challenges. The key goal is to make the most acceptable use of available resources and technologies to develop smart cities. An IoT-enabled application plays a crucial role here, but it has various security, privacy, latency, and reliability issues with a single-point-of-failure problem. The evolving technology blockchain can handle the aforementioned security and privacy issues and provide high-quality services due to several features like transparency, trust-free, decentralization, immutability, and others. The 6G communication network takes care of latency and reliability issues in the smart city with their unique characteristics such as latency (10–100 μs) and reliability (99.99999%). Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present a comprehensive review for blockchain technology and IoT together functional to smart cities. First, state-of-art-the works and contextual information are introduced. Then, we proposed a blockchain-based decentralized architecture for IoT-integrated smart cities covering different application perspectives, such as smart grid, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), and healthcare 5.0 underlying 6G communication networks. Next, we describe the challenges of the proposed architecture respective to each application, as mentioned above. Finally, we collated the open research issues and future direction to efficiently integrate blockchain into IoT-envisioned smart cities.}

Smart cities are composed of complex systems that usually process and analyse big data from the Cyber, Physical, and Social worlds. Traffic event detection is an important and complex task in smart transportation modelling and management. We address this problem using semi-supervised deep learning with data of different modalities, e.g., physical sensor observations and social media data. Unlike most existing studies focusing on data of single modality, the proposed method makes use of data of multiple modalities that appear to complement and reinforce each other. Meanwhile, as the amount of labelled data in big data applications is usually extremely limited, we extend the multi-modal Generative Adversarial Network model to a semi-supervised architecture to characterise traffic events. We evaluate the model with a large, real-world dataset consisting of traffic sensor observations and social media data collected from the San Francisco Bay Area over a period of four months. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in extracting and classifying traffic events.}

Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) can be considered key elements for today's Intelligent Transportation Systems. A small number of research investigations is found to aim at exploiting the resources of CAVs for services provisioning within a smart city. Moreover, and to the best of our knowledge, no research investigations have yet investigated exploiting the computational capabilities of CAVs to become an added value to the computational power of smart cities. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Vehicle as a Computational Resource (VaCR) and develop a system that enables vehicles to share their computational resources within smart cities. Users rely on Service Provider (SP) to acquire the required services that meet their Quality of Experience (QoE) preferences. The device capabilities of VaCR are one of the main indicators in QoE preferences. To that end, evaluation models are developed based on aggregate statistics and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the discovery and selection of the appropriate VaCRs to participate in the provisioning of services. The deployment is modeled using a multiagent system. Then, game theory is used to model the recruitment that aims at optimizing QoE for Connected Vehicles (CVs). Thorough simulations, analyses, and evaluations of the proposed VaCR system are carried out. The performed validations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system in optimizing QoE and the successful VaCR system operation, while attaining appealing performance characteristics.}

By adopting this perspective, this paper queries the existing smart city surveillance systems to identify their key limitations and sources of frequently justified controversies. It is argued that to bypass these – first – the value of mesh-technology should be explored. It is also argued that – second – it is necessary not only to bring citizens back in the discussion on smart city, but also to highlight the mechanisms by means of which they might be involved in the co-design of smart city solutions and in urban decision-making. To bridge these two imperatives, smart city is conceptualized as a smart service system and, consequently, a wireless integrated mesh-technology enhanced (WIMTE) smart city surveillance system is elaborated.}

In view of the above challenges, a mobile edge server is taken as the focus, and the available resources around the mobile edge server are used for collaborative computing to further improve the computing performance of a mobile edge computing (MEC) system. The alternating direction multiplier method is used to solve the problem. First, the relevant techniques and theories of MEC, Stackelberg principle-subordinate game theory, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are introduced. Then, the problem description and model construction of distributed task scheduling in MEC and machine learning task-based device coordination computing are introduced, and machine learning is applied in the distributed task scheduling algorithm and distributed device coordination algorithm. Finally, the distributed task scheduling algorithm and distributed device coordination algorithm are tested by experiments.}

abstract = {As the globally increasing population drives rapid urbanization in various parts of the world, there is a great need to deliberate on the future of the cities worth living. In particular, as modern smart cities embrace more and more data-driven artificial intelligence services, it is worth remembering that (1) technology can facilitate prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice, but only when it has the right analog complements (such as well-thought out policies, mature institutions, responsible governance); and (2) the ultimate objective of these smart cities is to facilitate and enhance human welfare and social flourishing. Researchers have shown that various technological business models and features can in fact contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In the light of these observations, addressing the philosophical and ethical questions involved in ensuring the security, safety, and interpretability of such AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities assumes paramount importance. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-centered. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical (data and algorithmic) challenges to a successful deployment of AI in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these concepts/challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges. The paper also advises on the current limitations, pitfalls, and future directions of research in these domains, and how it can fill the current gaps and lead to better solutions. We believe such rigorous analysis will provide a baseline for future research in the domain.}

Aiming at the multi-source data collected in the smart city, the study introduces the deep learning (DL) algorithm while using BDA, and puts forward the distributed parallelism strategy of convolutional neural network (CNN). Meantime, the digital twins (DTs) and multi-hop transmission technology are introduced to construct the smart city DTs multi-hop transmission IoT-BDA system based on DL, and further simulate and analyze the performance of the system. The results reveal that in the energy efficiency analysis of model data transmission, the energy efficiency first increases and then decrease as the minimum energy collected α0 increases. But a more suitable power diversion factor ρ is crucial to the signal transmission energy efficiency of the IoT-BDA system. The prediction accuracy of the model is analyzed and it suggests that the accuracy of the constructed system reaches 97.80%, which is at least 2.24% higher than the DL algorithm adopted by other scholars. Regarding the data transmission performance of the constructed system, it is found that when the successful transmission probability is 100% and the exponential distribution parameters λ is valued 0.01∼0.05, it is the closest to the actual result, and the data delay is the smallest, which is maintained at the ms level. To sum up, improving the smart city’s IoT-BDA system using the DL approach can reduce data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and offer actual efficacy, providing experimental references for the digital development of smart cities in the future.}

An active surveillance system capable of monitoring and enforcing social distancing between people can effectively slow the spread of this deadly virus. In this paper, we propose a data-driven deep learning-based framework for the sustainable development of a smart city, offering a timely response to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through mass video surveillance. To implementing social distancing monitoring, we used three deep learning-based real-time object detection models for the detection of people in videos captured with a monocular camera.

In the last few years, several techniques and models are used for retrieving significant information from urban big data of smart cities. This research work aims at developing a data fusion-based traffic congestion control system in smart cities using a deep learning model.
Methodology
A hybrid model based on the convolution neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) architectures are used for region-based traffic flow predictions in smart cities. CNN is used for the classification of spatial data while LSTM for temporal data.
Conclusion
The experiments used the CityPulse Traffic and CityPulse Pollution datasets, and measured root mean square error (RMSE), time consumption and accuracy. A small RMSE value of 49 and highest accuracy of 92.3% compared to other baseline models depicts the applicability of the proposed model in the region-based traffic flow prediction problems in the smart cities.}

Autonomous driving will play an import role in the future smart cities, reduce the time and economic cost of the whole society, and be helpful for the sustainability of the city and society. A significant task for autonomous driving is to detect surrounding objects accurately in real-time, including car, pedestrian, cyclist, etc. In this paper, we propose one end-to-end three dimensional (3D) object detection method based on voxelization, sparse convolution, and feature fusion. The proposed method exploits only point cloud as input, and it has two key components—small voxels and efficient feature fusion. Instead of utilizing extra networks to transform voxels, we directly average the points within each voxel as their feature representation. To enrich features for prediction, we have designed a two-step feature fusion method called fusion of fusion network that can combine information of multiple scales and 3D space. We have submitted to the official test server of the 3D detection benchmark—KITTI, and achieved state-of-the-art performance especially in the Cyclist class. Besides, detection speed of our method achieves 0.05 s/frame with a 2–4 fold runtime improvement against state-of-the-art methods due to its simple and compact architecture.}

In particular, without appropriate strategies that support inclusion, persons with disabilities and seniors may experience social and digital exclusion in communities. This study explored current progress toward building an “Inclusive Smart City (ISC)” through the 2015 U.S. DOT Smart City Challenge. It examined the range and frequency of inclusive strategies that were proposed by cities in their applications and the differences between successful and unsuccessful proposals. After reviewing and analyzing documentation from both rounds, we conclude: (1) insufficient attention was given to these underrepresented population groups in the proposals; (2) more ISC strategies are needed to address these groups’ needs and guarantee their rights; (3) government policies to support ISCs are needed to insure that the implementation of Smart City ideas addresses the needs of these groups; and, (4) universal design practices could be used to address the needs of many underrepresented populations.}

More sustainable Bike-sharing systems (BSS) have become an indispensable part of the transport offer by world's major metropolis. Like any computerized service system, they generate voluminous and complex data that the use of which is essentially limited to the management and operation of the system. The movements made by system users can provide valuable information on many aspects of urban life including the spatial and temporal dynamics of travel in the city, on the place of the bicycle among other modes of transport, or on the distribution of territorial and social inequalities in geographical space. In this paper, we study the problem of intelligent management of shared bicycle systems. Indeed, the management of these systems faces many optimization problems in its procession. Thus, to improve the BSS user's satisfaction, it's useful to inform the actors/users in this system about the state of bike sharing for a station. For this, we propose an approach that integrates in these systems both the new IoT for smart city technologies and machine learning in order to facilitate the task of management, availability and profitability. In addition, we propose an automatic management system capable of predicting the number of bikes shared per hour, day or month by taking several dynamic parameters. Simulation results carried out on real data from London's bike sharing system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.}

In CR, the PU detection methods are mostly based on statistical models, and their detection performance heavily relies on the accuracy of assumed models. In this paper, we design a novel detector, dubbed as PU-Net, that dynamically learns the PU activity patterns in a cognitive 5G smart city, where a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is deployed as flying base stations to serve the Internet-of-Things (IoT) users. Unlike the traditional schemes, the PU-Net is free from signal-noise model assumptions and is leveraged through deep residual learning integrated with atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to sense the PU's transmitted signal patterns in the network. The PU-Net detects and classifies the active and idle PU states by exploiting the multilevel spatial-temporal features in the signal and noise frames. The proposed model is trained using locally synthesized Rayleigh channel-impaired data with large variability of modulated signals and different noise floor regimes. Additionally, the PU-Net model is blind-tested and evaluated on real-world over-the-air signals and with variable-length frames and varying channel effects at secondary users (SUs). With extensive experiments, it is shown that PU-Net outperforms other benchmark detectors, obtaining an accuracy of 0.9974, with 0.9978 recall and 0.9970 precision in detecting and classifying the PU transmitted signal patterns. Correspondingly, the proposed PU-Net can be adopted for IoT/UAV-assisted communication systems in optimizing spectrum efficiency and resolving the coexistence issues in 5G and beyond networks.}

The paper provides a perspective regarding the opportunity available in addressing the urban air quality management (UAQM) issues using smart city framework in the context of ‘urban computing’. Traditionally, UAQM has been built on sparse regulatory monitoring, enhanced with satellite data and forecast models. The ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ (4IR) technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, smartphones, social and cloud computing are reshaping urban conglomerates, worldwide. Cities can harness these ubiquitous technologies in concert with traditional methods for betterment of air quality governance and to improve quality of life. This paper discusses the role of urban computing in UAQM through a review of scientific publications and ‘grey literature’ from technical reports of governments, international organizations and institutional websites. It provides an interdisciplinary knowledge repository on urban computing applications for air quality functions. It highlights the potential of integrated technologies in enabling data driven, strategic and real-time mitigation governance actions and helping citizens to take informed decisions. It recommends ‘fit for the purpose’ multitechnology framework for UAQM services in emerging smart cities.}

Knowledge graphs help to provide semantic and interconnectivity capabilities to the intelligent transportation system. In this paper, we propose a graph-based method for detecting outliers in the trajectory. Normal and outlier graphs are constructed using directed weighted graphs. Then, comparison with source and target graphs leading to vectors is performed. The similarity measure is used, which measures common nodes and edges. The features are then used by the machine learning based algorithm to classify the trajectory. Instead of a manually tuned parameter, the tree-based pipeline optimization method selects the best classifier and its hyperparameter. Then, the tuned model is compared with the traditional algorithms, i.e., random forest, decision tree, Naïve Bayes, and KNN. To evaluate the system under real conditions, an experiment is performed on a real dataset of trajectories. The results show that the graph-based method performs well and achieves an F-value of 0.81, while the optimization model achieves an F-value of 0.87. The graph-based model matched with the learning method helps to detect outliers and deviation points of the trajectory with high precision.}

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the most widespread threats to smart city infrastructure. In this paper, a smart city intrusion detection framework based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) is proposed. RBMs are applied due to their ability to learn high-level features from raw data in an unsupervised way and handle real data representation generated from smart meters and sensors. On top of these extracted features, different classifiers are trained. The performance of the proposed methodology is tested and benchmarked using a dataset from a smart water distribution plant. The results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology in attack detection with high accuracy.

Computational offloading provides assisted means of processing large amounts of data generated by abundant IoT devices, speed up processing of intensive tasks and save battery life. In this paper, we propose a secure computation offloading scheme in Fog-Cloud-IoT environment (SecOFF-FCIoT). Using machine learning strategies, we accomplish efficient, secure offloading in Fog-IoT setting. In particular, we employ Neuro-Fuzzy Model to secure data at the smart gateway, then the IoT device selects an optimal Fog node to which it can offload its workload using Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) via the smart gateway. If the fog node is not capable of handling the workload, it is forwarded to the cloud after being classified as either sensitive or non-sensitive. Sensitive data is maintained in private cloud. Whereas non-sensitive data is offloaded using dynamic offloading strategy. In PSO, the availability of fog node is computed using two metrics; i) Available Processing Capacity (APC), and ii) Remaining Node Energy (RNE). Selection of cloud is based on Reinforcement Learning. Our proposed approach is implemented for smart city applications using NS-3 simulator with JAVA Programming. We compare our proposed secure computation offloading model with previous approaches which include DTO-SO, FCFS, LOTEC, and CMS-ACO. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme minimizes latency as compared to selected benchmarks.}

Energy consumption has been increasing due to the growing population and intensified in dense metropolitan centres.

This paper looks at energy-related work on smart city models and planning by classifying their spectrum based on active and passive approaches and infrastructure management models. The purpose of this paper is to examine economic performance determinants and to determine the energy protection requirements of smart cities for efficient energy management based on active and passive models. Further, the paper’s principal approaches include the economic study of upgrades to infrastructure, leading to a decline in the smart cities' energy demand identified by the street lighting intelligent diode (LED).

There has been the unprecedented increase in annual installation of wind turbines reaching 60 GW for the first time in history from 51.7 GW of wind energy installation in 2014. Most of the high-power installations utilized double-fed induction generators (DFIG) due to low power losses, which reduced the cost of power converters required in the circuit. Nevertheless, natural factors, such as varying wind speed, influence the output of generators which results in the unsteady generation of power thus affecting the stability of the system.

In smart cities, low-frequency oscillations are a serious concern to the power system as they adversely affect system’s stability. Moreover, power system stabilizers are inefficient due to their fixed-parameter architecture. Flexible ac transmission system controller performs effective damping of low-frequency oscillations when provided with suitable supplementary damping control like a Static synchronous series compensator. In this context, the paper proposes an adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control for smart cities that uses the recurrent Gaussian membership function and recurrent wavelet neural network in antecedent and consequent parts respectively. The paper applies the gradient descent optimization with a back-propagation algorithm to update the parameters of suggested adaptive neuro-fuzzy recurrent wavelet control. Simulations are performed on two test systems, both showing the effectiveness of the recommended control scheme as compared to traditional lead-lag control and artificial neuro-fuzzy Takagi Sugeno Kang control. Calculations of performance index for various fault scenarios lead to the conclusion that the control scheme can damp oscillations effectively and enhances the power system’s transient stability.}

Results show that, at the planning stage, little interprofessional communication occurs between smart city experts and ‘women-friendly city’ experts. At the implementation stage, this leads to incomplete gender-mainstreaming of the district. Post-occupancy survey results reveal, however, that despite these shortcomings, both women and men perceive the ‘Specially Designed Zone for Women’ to be safe. Even so, there is a gender difference in the perception regarding smart installations. CCTVs are more important to men than women, while on-site emergency bells are more significant to women than men. This indicates that women need more active safety systems than passive surveillance systems. This paper argues that a gendered perspective is needed for the more inclusive planning of smart cities.}

abstract = {A massive challenge for future cities is being environmentally sustainable by incorporating renewable energy resources (RES). At the same time, future smart cities need to support resilient environments against cyber-threats on their supported information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, the cybersecurity of future smart cities and their smart grids is of paramount importance, especially on how to detect cyber-attacks with growing uncertainties, such as frequent topological changes and RES of intermittent nature. Such raised uncertainties can cause a significant change in the underlying distribution of measurements and system states. In such an environment, historical measured data will not accurately exhibit the current network’s operating point. Hence, future power grids’ dynamic behaviors within smart cities are much more complicated than the conventional ones, leading to incorrect classification of the new instances by the current attack detectors. In this paper, to address this problem, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is carefully designed by embedding the dynamically time-evolving power system’s characteristics to accurately model the dynamic behaviors of modern power grids that are influenced by RES or system reconfiguration to distinguish natural smart grid changes and real-time attacks. The proposed framework’s performance is evaluated using the IEEE 14-bus system using real-world load data with multiple attack cases such as attacks to the network after a line outage and combination of RES. Results confirm that the developed LSTM-based attack detection model has a generalization ability to catch modern power grids’ dynamic behaviors, excelling current traditional approaches in the designed case studies and achieves accuracy higher than 90% in all experiments.}

The characteristics of dynamic evolution and complexity are key issues for megacity planners and require a new systematic and modeling approach. Multiscale models involved in smart cities and megacities have recently become a popular topic because they can understand complex adaptive systems and efficiently solve complex problems at multiple scales (i.e., micro, meso, and macro) to improve system efficiency and reduce computational complexity and cost. However, there are numerous opportunities to improve this interdisciplinary field considering the lack of applicability of the multiscale modeling approach in megacities and smart cities, and the potential of multiscale modeling in various complex systems within smart cities. Therefore, a review that summarizes the state-of-art researches and opens opportunities around the theme of multiscale modeling participating in megacities and smart cities is warranted. This study, therefore, provides a comprehensive review covering the introduction of megacities, their current challenges, and their emergence in smart cities. Then, the introduction of the smart city along with its characteristics and different generations is disclosed. Moreover, we shed light on multiscale modeling, its categories (i.e., sequential multiscale modeling and concurrent multiscale modeling), and the need for multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities along with its emerging applications. Finally, based on a literature review, the study highlights the current challenges and future directions related to multiscale modeling in megacities and smart cities, which provide a roadmap for the optimized operation of megacities and smart city systems.}

To achieve the required quality of the IoT communication system, performance prediction is necessary; it is beneficial for fault avoidance through the dynamic and continuous adaptation of network behavior, which helps achieve sustainable improvement of IoT communication systems in smart cities. Herein, a deep-learning (DL) model to evaluate and predict the performance of an IoT communication system is proposed. In the proposed model, the number of dynamic neural networks is equal to the number of networks in the IoT system. Each neural network predicts the performance of a given IoT network. Subsequently, the performance of the entire IoT communication system can be predicted from the outputs of individual networks, which will be considered the inputs for another dynamic neural network. The proposed IoT DL model was tested using network simulator (ns-3) to construct a simulated IoT environment. The simulation results verify that the proposed DL model predicted and improved the performance of an entire simulated IoT system highly accurately.}

abstract = {Nowadays, deep neural networks are widely applied in sustainable smart cities and societies, including smart manufacturing, healthcare, industries, agriculture, surveillance, and various artificial intelligence-based real-life applications. In this regard, the human detection system has gained notable attention since it is recognized as a crucial task in intelligent surveillance applications. Researchers practiced a variety of computer vision and deep neural networks-based techniques for human detection-based applications; however, they often focused on the frontal view camera perspective. Thus, in this work, we have introduced a human detection system for intelligent surveillance in smart cities and societies with a completely distinct perspective, i.e., an overhead perspective that can provide sufficient visibility and coverage of a scene in congested and obstructed environments. However, human appearance can be difficult from such an extreme point of view, as there are significant variations in humans’ poses and appearances. Therefore, in this work, leveraging the deep neural network-based object detection technique, the Gaussian YOLOv3 algorithm is used for human detection. The algorithm determines the bounding box uncertainty by modeling its coordinates as a Gaussian parameter, improving accuracy and reducing false positives. A Gaussian YOLOv3 is combined with channel attention and feature intertwine modules to improve specific feature maps. The channel attention module is combined with the feature map to learn each channel's weight autonomously, improve the key features, and enhance the network's ability to discriminate between humans and background. At the same time, different channels of the feature map are intertwined to obtain more representative features. Finally, the features obtained from the attention and feature intertwine modules are fused to form an improved feature map. In addition, to further increase the detection accuracy of the algorithm for human detection, transfer learning is adopted. The experimental outcomes reveal that training improves the Gaussian YOLOv3 algorithm's potential for human detection with an overall detection accuracy of 94%.}

abstract = {Given a scale expansion of Internet of Things for sustainable resource management in smart cities, proper design of an intrusion detection system (IDS) is critical to safeguard the future network infrastructure from intruders. With the growth of connected things, the most-widely used centralized (cloud-based) IDS often suffers from high latency and network overhead, thereby resulting in unresponsiveness to attacks and slow detection of malicious users. In this paper, we address the limitation of centralized IDS for resource-constrained devices by proposing two methods, namely semi-distributed and distributed, that combine well-performing feature extraction and selection and exploit potential fog-edge coordinated analytics. In order to distribute the computational tasks, we individually develop parallel machine-learning models corresponding to a partitioned attack dataset. In the semi-distributed case, the parallel models, running on the edge side, are applied for side-by-side feature selections, which are then followed by a single multi-layer perceptron classification running on the fog side. In the distributed case, the parallel models individually perform both the feature selection and multi-layer perceptron classification after which the outputs are combined by a coordinating edge or fog for final decision making. Based on the comparative study of existing works, the numerical results demonstrate the promise of the proposed methods, giving a comparable detection accuracy to the superior centralized IDS as well as exemplify their inherent trade-offs between the accuracy and building time performance.}

This study aims to evaluate the electrical energy consumption in Mashhad, Iran, based on machine learning tools and present the dynamic strategies for promoting citizens’ willingness for renewable energy generation based on the experts’ knowledge. The main novelty of this research is simultaneous application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and statistical analysis for creating a Decision Support System (DSS). Then, the solar energy potential is appraised by the PV system simulation tool during one year in our case study in Mashhad, Iran. Furthermore, a Classical Delphi (CD) method is applied for motivational strategies and further TP implementation. In particular, the motivational strategies are suggested by 45 experts and then are prioritized in sequential expert meetings. The outcomes of this research indicate that the ANN model can successfully forecast the electrical energy consumption in summer and winter periods with a 99% accuracy. Then, based on the solar energy computations in the PV system, the peak of electrical energy consumption can be controlled in the hottest and coldest months. Last but not least, the superposition of experts’ and citizens’ opinions reveal A4 (sharing benefits of optimized costs with the citizens by solar energy generation), B2 (reducing the electrical energy cost for solar energy generation, especially in peak times) and C1 (creating the energy coin in the city with credits instead of spending money in urban activities fits to solar energy generation) as the main motivational strategies for solar energy generation in short, middle and long-term planning horizons.}

SCM encloses both physical and digital models which highlight smart buildings in particular. First, the proposed solution identifies and models SCM components including their appropriate architectures that are responsible for communication, extension, information flow, and protection.

The obtained results, in Uppaal, showed that the different implemented scenarios are satisfying the functional correctness and security policies. Moreover, the simulation through Cooja showed that how different obstacles and positions of nodes affect the communication coverage and the energy consumption regarding the deployed nodes.

Big data have been identified as a key enabler in the development of smart cities. However, our understanding of how different data sources should be managed and integrated remains limited. By analyzing data applications in the development of a sustainable smart city, this case study identified three phases of development, each requiring a different approach to orchestrating diverse data sources. A framework identifying the phases, data-related issues, data orchestration and its interaction with other resources, focal capabilities, and development approaches is developed. This study benefits both researchers and practitioners by making theoretical contributions and by offering practical insights in the fields of smart cities and big data.}

Recently, the research community in the field of IoT Security endeavor hard to build anomaly, intrusion and cyber attacks traffic identification model using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for IoT security analysis. However, the critical and significant problem still not studied in depth that is how to select an effective ML algorithm when there are numbers of ML algorithms for cyber attacks detection system for IoT security. In this paper, we proposed a new framework model and a hybrid algorithm to solve this problem. Firstly BoT-IoT identification dataset is applied and its 44 effective features are selected from a number of features for the machine learning algorithm. Then five effective machine learning algorithm is selected for the identification of malicious and anomaly traffic identification and also select the most widely ML algorithm performance evaluation metrics. To find out which ML algorithm is effective and should be used to select for IoT anomaly and intrusion traffic identification, a bijective soft set approach and its algorithm is applied. Then we applied the proposed algorithm based on bijective soft set approach. Our experimental results show that the proposed model with the algorithm is effective for the selection ML algorithm out of numbers of ML algorithms.}

abstract = {In smart cities, region-based prediction (e.g. traffic flow and electricity flow) is of great importance to city management and public safety, and it remains a daunting challenge that involves complicated spatial-temporal-related factors such as weather, holidays, events, etc. Region-based forecasting aims to predict the future situation for regions in a city based on historical data. In the existing literature, the state-of-the-art method solve region-based problems with long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms that extract the temporal view and local convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms that extract the spatial view (local spatial correlation via local CNN). In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based method for region-based prediction for smart cities. First, we divide the cities into regions based on the space dimension and model the situation of the cities in 3D volumes. Based on the constructed 3D volumes, we design a model called multiple local 3D CNN spatial-temporal residual networks (LMST3D-ResNet) for region-based prediction in smart cities. LMST3D-ResNet can extract multiple temporal dependencies (including trend, period and closeness) for local regions and then predict the future citywide activities according to the learned multiple spatial-temporal features. LMST3D-ResNet can also combine the spatial-temporal features with external factors. LMST3D-ResNet includes 3D CNNs and ResNet mechanisms for processing spatial-temporal information. In particular, 3D CNNs have the ability to model 3-dimensional information due to 3D convolution and 3D pooling operations, while ResNet enables the connection of the convolutional neural network across layers to obtain a deeper network structure. Specifically, in our proposed model, a novel region-based information extraction mechanism and an end-to-end multiple spatial-temporal dependency learning structure are designed for local regions. Extensive experimental results on two datasets, i.e., MLElectricity and BJTaxi demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the exisiting state-of-the-art methods.}

Past few years, the concept behind the Internet of Things has been a major research topic in the development of smart cities, education, industry, and commerce. Services and applications of IoT are the major factors for creating a sustainable urban life that is employed by smart cities. The stakeholders of smart cities become more aware, efficient, and interactive using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in IoT. The applications of smart cities based on IoT have been increased in number which leads to production and increase in the amount of data and its processing. Moreover, the city stakeholders and governments take prior actions/precautions for processing the collected data from the IoT devices and predicting the future consequences for securing a sustainable environment. Artificial Intelligence is one of the key research techniques which several researchers have analysed and proved to be the best in improving the performance of detecting fire hazard in smart cities. In this research, a Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Recurrent LSTM Neural Network (R-LSTM-NN) is proposed for prediction of big data that are collected from smart cities based on IoT. Moreover, the proposed model mainly concentrates in predicting the fire hazard values that gathered from smart cities using IoT devices. The simulation results show that the proposed technique proves to be better when compared with other existing techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. The proposed model detects the fire outbreak with a 98.4% of accuracy that having 0.14% of minimal error rate. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used for various prediction problems that are faced by smart cities.}

However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities. Such digital transformation of energy management can increase energy efficiency of public administration, its higher quality of service and healthier environment.}

First, we have highlighted the ability of Songdo to generate energy data. Second, we used those data to predict its evolution. As a result, we develop a short-term stacking ensemble model for energy consumption in Songdo, focusing on a three-months-ahead prediction problem. To obtain this result, first we design a baseline regressors for the prediction, second, we apply a three-combination of each best model of the base regressors, and finally, a weighted meta-regression model was applied using meta-XGBoost. We call the resulting model stacking ensemble model. The proposed stacking ensemble model combines the best ensemble networks to improve performance prediction, yielding an R2 value of 97.89 %. The results support the effectiveness of the ensemble networks, which use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), CatBoost and Gradient Boosting. This study also shows that the weighted meta model outperforms several machine learning models in terms of R2, MAE and RSME.}

The IoT-supported devices capacitate, embedded with sensors, enabled numerous context-aware applications to recognize physical activities. There are some activity recognition applications; however, they are still deficient in recognizing activities accurately. In this paper, a novel framework for human activity recognition (HAR) is proposed using raw readings from a combination of fused smartphone sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and Google Fit activity tracking module. The proposed framework applies deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) to an extensive training dataset. The latter consists of five activity classes from 12 individuals using a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN). An extensive training dataset is used consisting of five activity classes from a group of 12 individuals. The designed android application (runs in the background) collects data from the smartphone's embedded sensors fused with the Google Fit API to validate the results proposed framework. The proposed framework shows promising results in recognizing human activities compared to other similar studies and achieves an accuracy of 99.43% for activity recognition using DRNN.}

abstract = {In energy sectors, power utilities face financial losses due to Electricity Theft (ET). It happens when electricity is consumed without billing. Several methods are developed to detect ET automatically. Most of these methods only assess Electricity Consumption (EC) records. However, it is challenging to detect fraudulent consumers by only observing EC records because of diverse theft strategies (line tapping, meter tampering, etc.) and the irregularity of ET behavior. Furthermore, many methods have poor classification accuracy due to imbalanced data. This work proposes two novel methods to resolve the above-mentioned issues: Tomek Link Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique with Support Vector Machine (TBSSVM) and Temporal Convolutional Network with Enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (TCN-EMLP). The former resamples the data by balancing the majority and minority class instances. Whereas, the latter classifies normal and fraudulent consumers. Moreover, deep learning models suffer from high variance in their final results due to the assignment of different weights. Therefore, an averaging ensemble strategy is applied in this work to reduce the high variance. Furthermore, State Grid Cooperation of China (SGCC) and Pakistan Residential Electricity Consumption (PRECON) datasets are used in this paper for performing the simulations. SGCC is an imbalanced and labeled dataset while PRECON is an unlabeled dataset comprised of normal consumers' EC records (sequential) and auxiliary (non-sequential) data. Simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines, i.e., wide and deep convolutional neural network, extreme gradient boosting, long short-term memory with multi-layer perceptron, etc., in terms of ET detection.}

Smart cities’ paradigm has resulted in improved quality of life and better services to citizens, like smart healthcare, smart parking, smart transport, smart buildings, smart homes, and so on. One of the major challenges of IoT devices is the limited capacity of their battery because the devices consume a large amount of energy once they communicate with each other. Furthermore, the IoT-based smart systems would contain sensitive data about network systems, introducing serious privacy and security issues. IoT-based smart systems are highly exposed to botnet attacks. Examples of such attacks are Mirai and BASHLITE malware launched from compromised surveillance devices, which are common in smart cities, resulting in paralysis of Internet-based services through distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such DDoS attacks on IoT devices and their networks further threaten the emerging concept of sustainable smart cities. To discover such cyberattacks, this paper proposes a novel statistical learning-based botnet detection framework, called IoTBoT-IDS, which protects IoT-based smart networks against botnet attacks. IoTBoT-IDS captures the normal behavior of IoT networks by applying statistical learning-based techniques, using Beta Mixture Model (BMM) and a Correntropy model. Any deviation from the normal behavior is detected as an anomalous event. To evaluate IoTBoT-IDS, three benchmark datasets generated from realistic IoT networks were used. The evaluation results showed that IoTBoT-IDS effectively identifies various types of botnets with an average detection accuracy of 99.2%, which is higher by about 2–5% compared with compelling intrusion detection methods, namely AdaBoost ensemble learning, fuzzy c-means, and deep feed forward neural networks.}

In this study the coordination between home energy management systems (HEMSs) and EV parking lot management systems (PLEMS) is proposed, modeled, and simulated, as a new contribution to earlier studies. The EMSs coordinate through partially sharing individual EV schedules and without sharing private information. Missing information is completed through public cloud repositories and services. The HEMS and PLEMS are implemented using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The proposed coordination framework is computationally implemented and simulated based on a real-life case study. The results show that the proposed EMS coordination framework is both technically beneficial for power grids and economically beneficial for EV owners.}

This data is relayed to the Cloud for processing and analysis due to its large-scale infrastructural capabilities. However, the key goal of the drone deployment in smart city scenarios or urban environments is to provide timely and quick response alongside providing an energy-efficient service delivery. Thus, we need a sustainable solution that can be deployed locally (closer to the data source) in a smart city, to process or analyze the data (generated from smart city sources) and provide timely decision making for smart city applications. Edge computing, popularly known as the “cloud close to the ground”, can provide computational and processing facilities at edge of the network in a smart city. Hence, Edge computing act as an effective alternative solution to process and analyze the data closer to the point of it’s generation. Looking into the above discussion, We propose a novel drone-edge coalesce that provides an energy-aware data processing mechanism for sustainable service delivery in the multi-drone smart city networks. In this model, the edge computing layer is deployed to process and store the data sensed and collected by drones in a smart city. In this context, an adaptive edge node selection mechanism has been designed on the basis of decision tree approach. In this coalesce, we have to deal with the conventional problems related to the collision and congestion while providing low-latency and sustainable data transmission in a smart city. So, We have designed an energy-aware multi-purpose algorithm that avoids collisions and provides a congestion free data transmission. The proposed coalesce is validated in a simulated environment on the basis of several performance metrics such as, throughput, end-to-end delay and energy consumption.}

abstract = {On the one hand, smart cities have brought about various changes, aiming to revolutionize people's lives. On the other hand, while smart cities bring better life experiences and great convenience to people's lives, there are more hidden dangers of cyber security, including information leakage and malicious cyber attacks. The current cyber security development cannot keep up with the eager adoption of global smart city technologies so correct design based on deep learning methods is essential to protect smart city cyber. This paper summarizes the knowledge and interpretation of Smart Cities (SC), Cyber Security (CS), and Deep Learning (DL) concepts as well as discussed existing related work on IoT security in smart cities. Specifically, we briefly reviewed several deep learning models, including Boltzmann machines, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and generative adversarial networks. Then we introduced cyber security applications and use cases based on deep learning technology in smart cities. Finally, we describe the future development trend of smart city cyber security.}

abstract = {In recent years, smart cities have grown in popularity, both in research and in practice. The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communication technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustainability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastructure, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data. Finally, we highlight future directions that we believe the research on smart cities needs to focus on, based on the results from our literature review. These include infrastructure and disaster resilience, public health and social equity, and sustainability.}

The system was simulated, and then the quality performance of image and video obtained by using industrial visual perception technology was processed and analyzed. The results show that in the analysis of image local optimization effect, it is found that the classification performance of all algorithms decreases with the increase of noise, and the performance of local anisotropic mode (LAP) is superior, which has strong robustness to rotation, illumination, and noise. In the analysis of image feature similarity effect, it is found that the chi square distance between Log Gabor features is positively correlated with the degree of image distortion, and the validity of the measurement method is verified. Further analysis of the video processing effect of industrial visual perception technology shows that the video processing effect of test algorithm is significantly better than that of HM16.8 by comparing the distortion performance of the two algorithms with different sequences, with low distortion and significantly improved performance. Therefore, through the research, it is found that the improved CNN algorithm is superior to other algorithms in image and video processing.}

However, the use of any technology raises new issues and challenges. In a smart city, the vulnerable action of an individual or organization can put the entire city at risk. Due to the reliance of various components of smart cities on information and communication technology, cyber-security challenges (such as information leakage and malicious cyber-attacks) in this field affect smart cities behavior. Therefore, in order to respond to the enthusiastic acceptance of global smart city technologies, cyber security must develop in same direction. The aim of this paper is survey and discus on explanation of cyber security, smart cities, and survey of available relevant literature on security in that technology. For this purpose, the present study focuses on the four main components of a smart city, i.e. smart grid, Smart building, Smart transportation system, and Smart healthcare. In particular, summary of two deep learning method and cyber-security programs as well as technology correlation in smart cities are discussed. Furthermore, effective functional solutions in maintaining cyber-security and user privacy in smart cities are explained. The next progress trends of smart city with cyber security are described. Solutions need to be devised to address each of the security issues. The research in this study showed that meeting these challenges depends on the hard work of governments, developers of equipment and software and companies providing IT security services. In addition, designing flexible systems with high information protection capabilities is essential to prevent serious security incidents as these incidents can lead to disastrous financial, data, credit and loss of public trust.}

abstract = {Now-a-days, with the ever increasing number of vehicles, getting parking space at right place and on time has become an inevitable necessity for all across the globe. In this context, finding an unoccupied parking slot by the interested vehicle owners with least overhead becomes an NP-Hard problem bounded by various constraints. In-advance availability of information regarding parking occupancy plays a major role in hassle free trip optimization for motorists. It also facilitates services-cum-profit management for the parking owners. It further helps in curbing congestion by reducing cruising time and hence, helps in controlling pollution of the smart cities. Thus, accurate and timely information regarding parking occupancy and availability has become the basic need in the evolution of the smart cities. Motivated by these facts, an occupancy-driven machine learning based on-street parking pricing scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme uses machine learning based approaches to predict occupancy of parking lots, which in turn is used to deduce occupancy driven prices for arriving vehicles. In order to train, test, and compare different machine learning models, on-street parking data of Seattle city has been used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that parking occupancy prediction system is used to generate occupancy based parking prices for on-street parking system of the Seattle city. Results obtained using the proposed occupancy driven machine learning based on-street parking pricing scheme demonstrate its effectiveness over other existing state-of-the-art schemes.}

The idea of a smart city allows to interact directly with urban infrastructure and monitoring whatever that happens and is in progress. A smart city is a city, based on information and communication technology. In this paper, optimal operation of electrical transportation system and energy distribution resources has been studied. The major energy consumption systems in a smart city are electrical transportation systems such as Electric Vehicles in power systems and Electric Railway systems. Analyses the interaction of an interconnected systems using a linear model for co-optimization planning and operation of subway system. For optimal operation of the smart city, an optimization problem that minimizes the total cost of all the energy systems and maximizes the Regenerative Braking energy to recover subway is solved. In this paper, considering the electric vehicles such as vehicle to Grid and Subway technology located in the special depot, the traffic and length of the routes are modeled. Based on degradation model has been presented to rise battery life of Electric vehicles. Also, a machine learning technique based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to forecast the hourly solar radiation and wind speed. To depict the uncertain behavior of electric vehicles, electric transportation system and loads in smart city, Point Estimate Method, as a stochastic framework is suggested.

The influx of health-related queries and the volume of answers within the medical forums is a testimony to this adaption. The scalability, natural interaction and dynamism of the continuously collected and connected user-generated social big data can support health assessment, intervention and provisioning to produce the best kind of cognitive smart city. On the flip side the use of social media for healthcare communication suffers from data deluge, lack of reliability and quality, confidentiality and privacy (location/personal) issues. Duplicate questions, that is, queries with similar semantics (meaning) corrupt the filtering mechanism, increase the response time and compromise with the quality of the answer too. This research puts forward solutions to resolve the key challenge of duplicacy within the medical community Question-Answering sites (Medical CQAs). We propose to solve the semantic question matching problem for duplicate question pair detection, using a hybrid deep learning model, which combines a Co-attention based Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Siamese neural network and a Multi-layer perceptron classifier to output the probability of a similarity match between the two questions. Euclidean distance function is then used to compute the similarity between questions. The proposed model is validated on 100 question pairs which are scrapped from three featured groups, namely, ‘Irritable Bowel Syndrome’, ‘Anxiety Disorder’ and ‘Menopause’ of Patient.info community forum and an accuracy of 86.375% is observed. The results obtained are comparable to that of the Quora’s state-of-the-art results for duplicate detection.}

UAV path planning deals with finding the most optimal or shortest path for UAVs such that minimum energy and resources are utilized. This paper examines the path planning algorithms for UAVs through a literature survey conducted on 139 systematically retrieved articles published in the last decade that are narrowed down to 36 highly relevant articles. As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning’s key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness. Accordingly, a holistic IoT-powered UAV-based smart city management system has been recommended in the current study where all the smart city key components are integrated to address disasters like floods, earthquakes, and bush fire. The proposed holistic system can help prepare for disasters and mitigate them as soon as these arise and help enhance the smart city governance.}

In order to further optimize the smart city system, aiming at the sparsity of scoring data and the difficulty of two-way decisions to deal with uncertain decisions in the recommendation algorithm, a three-way Naive Bayesian Collaborative Filtering Recommendation model (3NBCFR) for smart city is constructed by integrating Naive Bayesian, three-way decisions and collaborative filtering algorithm. Firstly, we consider the influence of item attributes on user scoring. Naive Bayesian classifier is used to score unrated items, which can effectively fill in the missing values in the score matrix and solve the problem of data sparsity. Secondly, to ensure sustainable recommendations for uncertain goals, the three-way decisions is introduced into the collaborative filtering recommendation system, three-way recommendation rules are formulated, and 3NBCFR is constructed. Finally, the model is applied to the movie recommendation system. The experiment on Movielens shows that compared with the traditional collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, 3NBCFR algorithm reduces the recommendation cost and improves the recommendation quality. At the same time, it lays a foundation for promoting the construction of smart city.}

Conventional methods of air pollution forecasting primarily use low-level simulations, and these models generate disappointing results that have led us to factors that influence air pollution measurement based on a thorough design of the structure. Furthermore, in this paper, Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) assisted Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) (LSTM-SAE) model has been proposed for predicting the air quality in smart environment design planning in the smart cities. Long Short- Term Memory is used to evaluate air pollution quality prediction in smart cities. Staked Auto-Encoder (SAE) is modeled and prepared gently to extract the intrinsic components that occur due to air pollution. Furthermore, the findings indicate that classification accuracy of 91.22% and the overall Error rate of 0.46 has been validated, and LSTM-SAE addresses the different aspects of smart city and effective method when compared to other existing methods.}

Nevertheless, the lack of national knowledge and time-various IOVs make it extremely difficult for the roadside unit long-term energy restrictions to take successful offloading or discharging. Hence in this paper, the Optimized energy-efficient sensible edge processing (OEE-SEP) model for IoV in smart cities has been proposed for vehicle activity discharging with the estimated amount of time with less energy consumption. The sensible edge processing model comprises undirected activity discharging and similar activity discharging protocol, concerning the number of duties per unit time and the estimated time of completion for the same amount of information imported. An optimized energy-efficient model is formulated to reduce the total transmission delay and reduce the energy consumed during discharge. OEE-SEP leads to less energy consumption during activity discharging when the IoV processes and information loading activities are considered. The experimental results show that the suggested model enhances the performance rate of 97.45% with less transmission delay, less energy consumption for vehicle automation systems in smart cities.}

abstract = {Nowadays, an increasing amount of literature acknowledges that smart cities’ core aspect is not technology per se but how organizational characteristics and capabilities influence the technology enactment. However, the extant studies primarily focus on business-led smart city projects. Little attention is paid to the causal relations between organizational conditions and technology enactment in government-led projects. Therefore, there is a research gap concerning what conditions of governmental organizations, singly or jointly, drive technology enactment in smart city projects. To fill the gap, this article establishes three increasing levels of smartness and formulates four government conditions. Based on this conceptual framework, this article explores different configurations of organizational conditions that lead to varying levels of smartness. It uses the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) method to study 11 smart city projects in Hangzhou, China. The results generate three configurations of organizational conditions that lead to decisional intelligence, indicating that multiple pathways exist to achieve the highest level of smartness. These configurations often emphasize the significant role of human resource pressure in driving decisional intelligence. But no single condition is necessary because when human resource pressure is absent, strong financial capacity, good information-sharing, and facilitative leadership can work together as a substitution.}

abstract = {Sustainable smart cities are confronted by technological, organisational and external risks, making their governance difficult and susceptible to manipulation. Based on a comprehensive literature review of 796 systematically retrieved articles, the current study proposes a multilayered technology-organisation-environment (TOE-based) risk management framework for sustainable smart city governance. A total of 56 risks are identified and grouped into TOE categories. There are 17 technological risks, including IoT networks, public internet management and user safety concerns, with a 38.7% contribution to smart city governance risks. With a 15.6% share, there are 11 organisational risks, including user data security and cloud management. There are 28 external risks with a contribution of 46.7% to the smart city governance and consist of smart city's environment, governance, integration and security risks. A multilayered TOE-based risk management framework is proposed to identify and manage the risks associated with smart city governance in the current study. The framework links smart citizens to each other through the smart city governance team and the integrated TOE layers. The iterative risk management process of identification, analysis, evaluation, monitoring and response planning is carried out in the TOE layers, both at the external layer levels and internal management levels. The proposed framework operationalises the risk management process for smart city governance by presenting the collection of pertinent risks and their thematic TOE categorisation. The criticality of the identified risks in line with the study's rankings can help researchers and practitioners understand the top risks of smart city governance. These risks present investment opportunities for city governance bodies to develop critical and effective responses as well as provide safety, security and enhanced privacy for citizens.}
