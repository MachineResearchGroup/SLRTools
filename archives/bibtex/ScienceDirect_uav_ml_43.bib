abstract = {In large industrial greenhouses, plants are usually treated following well established protocols for watering, nutrients, and shading/light. While this is practical for the automation of the process, it does not tap the full potential for optimal plant treatment. To more efficiently grow plants, specific treatments according to the plant individual needs should be applied. Experienced human gardeners are very good at treating plants individually. Unfortunately, hiring a crew of gardeners to carry out this task in large greenhouses is not cost effective. In this work we present a cognitive system that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for decision-making with robotics techniques for sensing and acting to autonomously treat plants using a real-robot platform. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to decide the amount of water and nutrients each plant needs according to the history of the plant. Robotic techniques for sensing measure plant attributes (e.g. leaves) from visual information using 3D model representations. These attributes are used by the AI system to make decisions about the treatment to apply. Acting techniques execute robot movements to supply the plants with the specified amount of water and nutrients.}

abstract = {Heavy duty gas turbines have long played an important role in energy production. Advanced turbine designs are expected to be highly efficient, able to quickly ramp the output power up and down and promptly tolerate loading variations without breaching emissions regulations. Control design plays an important role in ensuring high efficiency and performance of gas turbines. This paper proposes a fractional order fuzzy-PID approach for a heavy-duty gas turbine. The controller gains are optimized using a Firefly algorithm enhanced with a dynamic parameter selection. This latter is used to speed up the convergence rate of the Firefly algorithm, optimize the gains of the fractional order fuzzy-PID and enhance the performance and efficiency of the gas turbine. The proposed approach is implemented to the speed loop of a gas turbine in order to maintain the output temperature and the turbine’s speed within their desired values during either a sudden change in loading or a drop in frequency. A comparison analysis with a standard Firefly algorithm-based approach was carried out to further assess the performance of the proposed evolved firefly algorithm-based approach.}

abstract = {Early-season crop type mapping could provide important information for crop growth monitoring and yield prediction, but the lack of ground-surveyed training samples is the main challenge for crop type identification. Although reference time series based method (RBM) has been proposed to identify crop types without the use of ground-surveyed training samples, the methods are not suitable for study regions with small field size because the reference time series are mainly generated using data set with low spatial resolution. As the combination of Landsat data and Sentinel-2 data could increase the temporal resolution of 30-m image time series, we improved the RBM by generating reference normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)/enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series at 30-m resolution (30-m RBM) using both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, then tried to estimate the potential of the reference NDVI/EVI time series for crop identification at early season. As a test case, we tried to use the 30-m RBM to identify major crop types in Hengshui, China at early season of 2018, the results showed that when the time series of the entire growing season were used for classification, overall classification accuracies of the 30-m RBM were higher than 95%, which were similar to the accuracies acquired using the ground-surveyed training samples. In addition, cotton, spring maize and summer maize distribution could be accurately generated 8, 6 and 8 weeks before their harvest using the 30-m RBM; but winter wheat can only be accurately identified around the harvest time phase. Finally, NDVI outperformed EVI for crop type classification as NDVI had better separability for distinguishing crops at the green-up time phases. Comparing with the previous RBM, advantage of 30-m RBM is that the method could use the samples of the small fields to generate reference time series and process image time series with missing value for early-season crop classification; while, samples collected from multiple years should be further used so that the reference time series could contain more crop growth conditions.}

The geometrical optimization has been applied for a mini-centrifugal compressor by using the design of experiments technique.

With the fitting of the regression functions from the least-squares estimator, three compressor geometrical parameters are selected as the input factors. The ideal targets of the optimization problem are for a higher efficiency, a higher pressure ratio and a lower input power. The simulations are conducted in a fully three-dimensional (3D) CFD software – Axcent. The multiple objective optimization problems are solved by an evolutionary algorithm using a Matlab program. Multiple Pareto front solutions can be determined, and the specific optimal solution is selected with the weighted metric methods. The experimental test for the optimal compressor shows a 7.5% increase in pressure ratio. The two-factorial interactions are generated in 3D plots to estimate the effects of different input parameters. The flow analysis for the relative Mach number distribution and the entropy distribution is carried out to explain the changes of the compressor efficiency and pressure ratio.}

The topics covered in this Review Paper include the state of the art of IVHM tools and how their characteristics match the requirements of legacy aircraft, a summary of problems faced in the past trying to retrofit IVHM tools both from a technical and organisational perspective and the current level of implementation of IVHM in industry. Although the technology has not reached the level necessary to implement IVHM to its full potential on every kind of component, significant progress has been achieved on rotating equipment, structures or electronics. Attempts to retrofit some of these tools in the past faced both technical difficulties and opposition by some stakeholders, the later being responsible for the failure of technically sound projects in more than one occasion. Nevertheless, despite these difficulties, products and services based on IVHM technology have started to be offered by the manufacturers and, what is more important, demanded by the operators, providing guidance on what the industry would demand from IVHM on legacy aircraft.}

abstract = {Fast and efficient global localization is a critical problem for autonomous systems. Existing sequence-based visual place recognition requires a storage-intensive image database for robust localization, while more storage-efficient odometry-based place recognition approaches can require a long travel distance to obtain an accurate localization. In this paper, we present a novel particle filter-based localization system that adapts to varying degrees of map image densities, road layout ambiguity and visual appearance change. The base system combines a geometric place recognition capability utilizing odometry and roadmaps with a visual place recognition system. When using a sparse image database, particles could exist at visually unknown places, which introduces difficulties in performing sequential visual place recognition. To address this challenge, we propose to make use of effective visual observations to enable the system to accumulate visual belief sequentially, even when reference images are very sparse. Furthermore, we develop a vision reliability estimation method, which analyses the relationship between the visual component and the particle filter convergence, to calibrate the optimal contribution of vision to particle weighting in different visual environments and conditions. To evaluate our approach, we perform extensive experiments using four benchmark localization datasets, and control the reference image density by subsampling these datasets. Results show that the proposed technique is able to consistently and correctly localize the vehicle over a range of reference image densities, and to consistently outperform a particle filter-enhanced version of an existing state-of-the-art SeqSLAM system, which fails when image spacing exceeds 30 m. In particular, for a 600% increase in database image sparsity (from 10 m to 70 m), we show that the proposed method is able to maintain localization performance with only a 40% increase in localization latency (from 250 m to 350 m). We also provide an analysis of the results and a characterization of the system’s computational requirements.}

The motion primitives generate simple motions like ‘crawl-forward’ or ‘turn-left’ and the motion planner constructs a plan using these primitives. To preserve the efficiency and robustness of the planner on varying terrains, a novel schema called RRT-AMP (Rapidly Exploring Random Trees with Adaptive Motion Primitives) for adapting the motion primitives is introduced. The adaptation procedure is integrated into the planning process, which allows the planner simultaneously to adapt the primitives and to use them to obtain the final plan. Besides adaptation in changing environments, RRT-AMP can adapt motion primitives if some module fails. The methods is experimentally verified with robots of different morphologies to show its adaptation and planning abilities in complex environments.}

However, on-ground land uses/land covers (LULC) characterization is a time-consuming task, often limited to small land areas, which can be solved using remote sensing technologies. The objective of this work is to investigate how the different MODIS NDVI seasonal parameters responded to the main land processes observed in Europe in the 2000-2018 period; characterizing their temporal trend; and evaluating which one reflected better each specific land process. NDVI time-series were evaluated using TIMESAT software, which extracted eight seasonality parameters: amplitude, base value, length of season, maximum value, left and right derivative values and small and large integrated values. These parameters were correlated with the LULC changes derived from COoRdination of INformation on the Environment Land Cover (CLC) for assessing which parameter better characterized each land process. The temporal evolution of the maximum seasonal NDVI was the parameter that better characterized the occurrence of most of the land processes evaluated (afforestation, agriculturalization, degradation, land abandonment, land restoration, urbanization; R2 from 0.67-0.97). Large integrated value also presented significant relationships but they were restricted to two of the three evaluated periods. On the contrary, land processes involving CLC categories with similar NDVI patterns were not well captured with the proposed methodology. These results evidenced that this methodology could be combined with other classification methods for improving LULC identification accuracy or for identifying LULC processes in locations where no LULC maps are available. Such information can be used by policy-makers to draw LULC management actions associated with sustainable development goals. This is especially relevant for areas where food security is at stake and where terrestrial ecosystems are threatened by severe biodiversity loss.}

A nonlinear adaptive visual servo guidance law is presented for a bank-to-turn (BTT) missile airframe that achieves near zero miss distance interception of a target undergoing unknown evasive maneuvers. The controller is developed assuming unknown missile linear velocity and target depth measurements; hence can be regarded as a pure vision-based guidance law. By approximating the unknown, scaled relative velocity via power series expansion, a continuous adaptive parameter update law is developed to compensate for the unknown missile-target relative velocity and the depth measurements. In addition, robust elements are included in the guidance law to compensate for external disturbances and parameter identification errors. A rigorous Lyapunov-based stability analysis is utilized to prove uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the system states, and high-fidelity numerical simulation results are provided to verify the performance of the proposed missile guidance law.}

abstract = {The tracking control problem of a network-based unmanned marine vehicle (UMV) system is investigated in this paper. The whole system consist of an UMV, a communication network and a ground-based control station. The measurement data collected by sensor is transmitted to the control station through communication network, and an adaptive event-triggering mechanism is introduced in this paper, which can greatly reduce the communication burden. Moreover, the aperiodic DoS attack is considered that occurs in the channel between the control station and the actuator, and no data can be transmitted when the attack occurs. The main goal is to design a Dynamic Output Feedback Control (DOFC) algorithm to track the given yaw velocity in presence of event-triggering mechanism and DoS attack. By constructing a specific Lyapunov function, the sufficient condition of global exponential stability of system with an expected H∞ disturbance attenuation index is given, and the controller gains can be obtained by solving some inequalities. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed control scheme is demonstrated by a simulation study on the networked UMV system.}

As opposed to other services running on smart cities, a major challenge of eHealth services on the fog is that they typically span multiple computational activities performing big data processing over sensible information that must be protected. Using the capacities of current processors can improve the servicing of remote patient nodes. This paper presents the design and validation of a framework that improves the service time of selected activities at the fog servers; precisely, of those activities requested by remote patients. It exploits the capacities of current processors to parallelize specific activities that can be run on reserved cores, and it relies on the quality of service guarantees of data distribution platforms to improve communication and response times to mobile patients. The proposed approach is validated on a prototype implementation of simulated computationally-intensive eHealth interactions, decreasing the response time by 4x when core reservation is activated.}

Second, further analysis of the initial condition is performed to preclude the undesired equilibrium. It indicates that at least 2 orthogonal inertial vectors are required. Third, the fully distributed attitude synchronization control strategy with adaptive gains is developed. Moreover, the control algorithm is implemented without any global information of the graph.

In this paper we demontrate our Modulation based Non Orthogonal Multiple Access (M-NOMA) technique support for Ultra-Reliable and Low Latencey Communication (URLLC) user case of 5G. Then we present it as a user case for ITS. M-NOMA guarantees reliability and low latency of the system due to its minimum symbol error rate (SER), reduced interference, better data rate and hence the Quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we derive SER for M-NOMA with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and fading channel. We also optimized the derived SER, data rate with Lagrange optimization. The proposed system supports the low latency and high reliability requirements. Simulation result confirmed the added benefits offered by our M-NOMA scheme over the traditional schemes.}

We exploit natural stochastic motion models and controlled locomotion of biobots in conjunction with an aerial leader to explore and map a domain of interest. A sliding window strategy is adopted to construct local maps from coordinate free encounter information of the agents by means of local metric estimation. Robust topological features from these local representations are extracted using topological data analysis and a classification scheme. These maps are then merged into a global map which can be visualized using a graphical representation, that integrates geometric as well as topological features of the environment. Simulation and experimental results with biologically inspired robotic platform are presented to illustrate and verify the correctness of our approach, which provides building blocks for SLAM with biobotic insects.}

abstract = {This paper presents the results of an investigation into attitudes towards and willingness to fly in pilotless aircraft (PAs) among a sample of 711 UK people known to fly at least occasionally. A problem with past studies in the area is that attitudes have only been measured explicitly, using questionnaire items drawn from literature in the field. Also, distinctions between attitude strength and attitude structure have not been considered. The present investigation employed an implicit measure of attitudes and examined attitudes via (i) a structural topic modelling procedure (in order to measure the structure of attitudes within the sample) and (ii) an Implicit Association Test (to evaluate attitude strength). Outcomes to the Implicit Association Test contributed significantly and substantially to the explanation of the sample members' degrees of willingness to fly in PAs. These are important matters considering the need for airlines, government agencies and aircraft manufacturers to induce public acceptance of PAs. Determinants of attitudes were posited to include self-image congruence, fear of flying, general anxiety syndrome, interest in new technologies, age, gender, and exposure to information about pilotless aircraft. A model containing these variables was assembled and estimated, the results providing a good fit (R2 = 0.58) with data obtained from the sample. Three primary components of attitude emerged from the investigation: risk, excitement and innovation. Four variables exerted the greatest effects on attitude structure, namely self-congruence, interest in new technologies, prior knowledge of PAs, and the age of the participant. Fear of flying and generalised anxiety impacted on the risk element of attitude structure, but not on excitement, innovation or attitude strength. Neither the fear of flying variable nor generalised anxiety had significant influences on attitude strength, although they did have significantly negative effects on willingness to fly in a pilotless airplane. Thirty-one per cent of the sample members disagreed or strongly disagreed with a question (five-point scale) asking whether a person was willing to fly in a pilotless aircraft. The results of the study have important implications for public information campaigns initiated by state agencies and for the marketing activities and promotional messages of airlines that will need to seek public acceptance of pilotless aircraft.}

To achieve this, flying the least-probability-of-detection path from A to B through a field of detectors is a fundamental strategy. While most of the previous optimization models aim to minimize the cumulative radar exposure, this paper derives a model that can directly minimize the probability of being detected. Furthermore, a variational dynamic programming method is applied to this model which allows one to find a precise locally optimal path with low computational complexity, even when Doppler effects increase the dimension of this problem. In addition, a homotopy method with exceptionally low computational complexity is derived to adjust the optimal path when the detection rate function changes due to the removal of detectors, the addition of detectors or other changes of detectors. Finally, the paper also shows how to apply a convex optimization method to find optimal positions of detectors when vehicles can do path planning.}

As soon as the thrown ball is recognized by the visual system, the camera carried by the robot end-effector is forced to follow a baseline in the space so as to acquire an initial dataset of visual measurements from several points of view, providing a first estimate of the catching point through a linear estimation algorithm. Hereafter, additional measurements are acquired to constantly refine the previous estimate by exploiting a nonlinear estimation algorithm. During the robot trajectory, the translational components of the camera are controlled in such a way as to follow the planned path to intercept the ball, while the rotational components are forced to keep the ball into the field of view. Experimental results performed on a common industrial robotic system prove the effectiveness of the presented solution.}

Despite noted simplifications, risks, and uncertainties of mapping the impacts of mining, the cases included in our overview illustrate that there are clearly beneficial applications. At a local level, these include environmental and socioeconomic risk assessments, disaster mitigation, and adjudication on mine-related conflicts. At a regional level, spatial analyses can support cumulative and strategic impact assessments. At a global level, spatial analyses can reveal industry-wide land use trends, and provide key land use data for comparative analyses of mining impacts between commodities, locations, and mine configurations.

Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) approaches are comprehensive, structured and logical methods widely used for this purpose. PRA approaches include, but not limited to, Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Event Tree Analysis (ETA). Growing complexity of modern systems and their capability of behaving dynamically make it challenging for classical PRA techniques to analyse such systems accurately. For a comprehensive and accurate analysis of complex systems, different characteristics such as functional dependencies among components, temporal behaviour of systems, multiple failure modes/states for components/systems, and uncertainty in system behaviour and failure data are needed to be considered. Unfortunately, classical approaches are not capable of accounting for these aspects. Bayesian networks (BNs) have gained popularity in risk assessment applications due to their flexible structure and capability of incorporating most of the above mentioned aspects during analysis. Furthermore, BNs have the ability to perform diagnostic analysis. Petri Nets are another formal graphical and mathematical tool capable of modelling and analysing dynamic behaviour of systems. They are also increasingly used for system safety, reliability and risk evaluation. This paper presents a review of the applications of Bayesian networks and Petri nets in system safety, reliability and risk assessments. The review highlights the potential usefulness of the BN and PN based approaches over other classical approaches, and relative strengths and weaknesses in different practical application scenarios.}

The three-axis detumbling mode control approach is designed to deal with the unwanted angular rates of the system to be zero, while the saturations of the actuators are taken into consideration. Moreover, the three-axis pointing mode control approach is designed in the similar state to deal with the rotational angles of the system to be desirable. The contribution of the research is mathematically made to propose a control law in connection with a new candidate of Lyapunov function to deal with the rotational angles and the related angular rates of the present autonomous space system with respect to state-of-the-art. A series of experiments are carried out to consider the efficiency of the proposed control strategy, as long as a number of benchmarks are realized in the same condition to verify and guarantee the strategy performance in both modes of control approaches.}

This study presents a novel method aimed to improve the identification of macroplastics through remote sensing over beaches, combining AMD hyperspectral laboratory characterization and digital supervised classification in high spatial resolution imagery. Several samples were collected from the Chiloé Island beaches, Chile. Spectral signature samples and physical properties were assessed through laboratory work. HyLogger3® (CSIRO), PS-300 Apogee and ASD Field Spec hyperspectral systems were used to characterize each sample. Using those measurements, a spectral library was generated by processing, filtering and sorting the spectral data gathered, determining distinctive spectral bands for digital classification. By using this spectral library, a digital classification method was implemented over World-View 3 imagery, covering the three beaches selected as test sites. Distinct classification methods and geospatial analyses were applied to determine land cover composition, aimed for the detection of Styrofoam and the rest of anthropogenic marine debris. Four field campaigns were carried out to validate the AMD classification and mass retrievals, performed on >300 ground based points. The AMD hyperspectral library was successfully applied for an AMD digital classification in satellite imagery. Support Vector Machine method showed the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy equivalent to 88% and over 50 tons of debris estimated on the pilot beaches. These results prove the feasibility of quantifying macro-AMD through the integration of hyperspectral laboratory measurements and remote sensing imagery, allowing to estimate anthropogenic influence on natural ecosystems and providing valuable information for further development of the methodology and sustainable AMD management.}

Then, a command filter is applied to avoid repeatedly differentiating virtual control signals and reduce the computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed method can guarantee that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin in the finite time. Finally, the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated via simulation results.}

Rosie is a tabletop robot implemented in the Soar architecture that learns new tasks from online interactive language instruction. In the past, the features of each task’s goal were explicitly described by a human instructor through language. In this work, we develop and study additional techniques for learning representations of goals. For game tasks, the agent can be given visual demonstrations of goal states, refined by human instructions. For procedural tasks, the agent uses information derived from task execution to determine which state features must be included in its goal representations. Using both approaches, Rosie learns correct goal representations from a single goal example or task execution across multiple games, puzzles, and procedural tasks. As expected, in most cases, the number of words required to teach the task is reduced when visual goal demonstrations are used. We also identify shortcomings of our approach and outline future research.}

abstract = {Mobile ad hoc networks (manets) can be useful for providing network coverage in harsh and adversarial environments in many commercial and military applications where nodes may become randomly or systematically disabled. For these networks to be reliable and scalable, robust topology control algorithms must be developed to guide the deployment and geometric configuration of mobile nodes without a priori knowledge of the terrain. This article studies a disruption tolerant topology control mechanism based on differential evolution, called tcm-y, that directs the movements of autonomous vehicles to efficiently and dynamically deploy themselves into a uniformly dispersed configuration. tcm-y uses a Yao graph inspired fitness function to maintain a minimum desired number of connections for a node with its neighbors while uniformly dispersing autonomous vehicles over an unknown terrain. We present a formal analysis of tcm-y to show that it provides a disruption tolerant node spreading mechanism since any node will have at least k neighbors at all times. The performance of our tcm-y was tested in hostile environments where nodes systematically or randomly experience hostility and become disabled. The results from simulation experiments show that mobile nodes running tcm-y perform well in the face of neighbor losses with respect to nac, adt, and average connectivity, while limiting the number of network partitions that may occur as a result of node failures. The effectiveness of tcm-y was evaluated by comparing it with a popular non-deterministic node spreading mechanism that has similar objectives as tcm-y. The assessment shows that tcm-y performs significantly better with respect to average connectivity, pre-defined minimum number of neighbor connections, and average distance traveled at the expense of lower normalized area coverage. We also developed a testbed to perform real-time experiments with our tcm-y implemented in laptops to guide the movements of human operators towards a uniform distribution of mobile nodes. Real-time experiments performed on the testbed verified the results from our simulation experiments.}

abstract = {Disasters are usually managed through a four-phase cycle including mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. The first two phases happen before a disaster and the last two after it. This survey focuses on casualty management (CM), which is one of the actions taken in the response phase of a disaster. Right after a severe disaster strikes, we may be confronted with a large number of casualties in a very short period of time. These casualties are in need of urgent treatment and their survival depends on a rapid response. Therefore, managing resources in the first few hours after a disaster is critical and efficient CM can significantly increase the survival rate of casualties. Uncertainty in the location of a disaster, disruption to transportation networks, scarcity of resources and possible deaths of rescue and medical teams due to the disaster in such situations make it hard to manage casualties. In this survey, we focus on CM for disasters where the following five steps are taken, respectively: (i) Resource dispatching/search and rescue, (ii) on-site triage, (iii) on-site medical assistance, (iv) transportation to hospitals and (v) triage and comprehensive treatment. With a special focus on Operations Research (OR) techniques, we categorize the existing research papers and case studies in each of these steps. Then, by critically observing and investigating gaps, trends and the practicality of the extant research studies, we suggest future directions for academics and practitioners.}

Such technologies do not suffice on their own; rather they must be judiciously combined to deliver meaningful information in near real-time. Decision-support tools incorporating models of disparate farming activities, either on their own or in combination with other models, offer one popular approach; exemplars include GPFARM, APSIM, GRAZPLAN amongst many others. Such models tend to be generic in nature and their adoption by individual farmers is minimal. Smart technologies offer an opportunity to remedy this situation; farm-specific models that can reflect near real-time events become tractable using such technologies. Research on the development, and application of farm-specific models is at a very early stage. This paper thus presents an overview of models within the farming enterprise; it then reviews the state-of the art in smart technologies that promise to enable a new generation of enterprise-specific models that will underpin future smart farming enterprises.}

Traffic control in congested waterways has recently become a challenging task demanding higher accuracy in ship navigation and advanced methods for collision or grounding avoidance. Modern ship control systems call for new technologies to be applied to ship steering which involves station-keeping and course-changing maneuvers. Uncertain cargo ship dynamics require robust steering control design techniques potentially reducing the effects of external conditions and minimizing path deviations in case particularly strong lateral wind or wave forces are experienced. Among additional issues to be addressed are the possible conflicts between input limitations and controller performance. We present an adaptive steering control design for uncertain ship dynamics subject to input constraints while avoiding performance compromises under changing environmental conditions. An adaptive law is combined with a control design including a Linear Quadratic (LQ) controller and a Riccati based anti-windup compensator using Certainty Equivalence Principle for asymptotically stable plants with saturation limits imposed on the control input. If the desired linear performance can be recovered for nominal systems subject to input saturation by implementing an LQ control augmented with an anti-windup compensator, our analysis on its adaptive counterpart reveals that the perturbation terms due to plant parameter errors in the adaptive scheme do not cause any unbounded signals in the closed-loop, and the system remains stable. Continuous-time lumped Hurwitz systems with input saturation nonlinearities and unknown plant parameters can benefit from the resulting indirect adaptive control design. Several ship maneuvering scenarios are simulated to verify the effectiveness of our approach.}

A discrete robust control strategy based on the sliding mode approach and a leader-follower scheme is proposed to achieve the desired flight performances while assuming realistic information constraints. A predictive reaching law is compared to a linear reaching law. This predictive discrete sliding mode control (PDSMC) strategy allows taking into account hard actuator constraints by solving an optimization problem at each time step. Also, this paper presents a meaningful study and comparison of the two discrete sliding mode control designs and time sampling continuous sliding mode control (TSCSMC). Here, the comparison focuses on the effect of discrete sampling on the control error analytically and in simulation. Effects on mesh stability are evaluated in simulation. Simulation results of a flight scenario with two different sampling frequencies demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control strategy and show clearly the effect of the sampling time on the formation flight performance of the UAS obtained by the considered control strategies.}

In some cases, it is preferable sacrificing the flexibility of such methods for an increase in speed and robustness by using artificial landmarks. The recent work [1] proposes an off-line method to obtain a map of squared planar markers in large indoor environments. By freely distributing a set of markers printed on a piece of paper, the method estimates the marker poses from a set of images, given that at least two markers are visible in each image. Afterwards, camera localization can be done, in the correct scale. However, an off-line process has several limitations. First, errors can not be detected until the whole process is finished, e.g., an insufficient number of markers in the scene or markers not properly spotted in the capture stage. Second, the method is not incremental, so, in case of requiring the expansion of the map, it is necessary to repeat the whole process from start. Finally, the method can not be employed in real-time systems with limited computational resources such as mobile robots or UAVs. To solve these limitations, this work proposes a real-time solution to the problems of simultaneously localizing the camera and building a map of planar markers. This paper contributes with a number of solutions to the problems arising when solving SLAM from squared planar markers, coining the term SPM-SLAM. The experiments carried out show that our method can be more robust, precise and fast, than visual SLAM methods based on keypoints or texture.}

A fuzzy theory based feedforward compensator will be used to calculated the reagent dosage in advance to eliminate the influence of large disturbances according to ore grade and handling capacity. Since the bubble size is believed to be closely related to flotation performance and responds to changes in the reagent dosage, using BSD based feedback predictive control calculates the reagent dosage to stabilize the flotation running. Instead of simple statistic feature, the bubble size with non-Gaussian feature is characterized to be probability density function (PDF) by using B-spline. A multi-output least square support vector machine (MLS-SVM) based is then applied to establish a dynamical relationship between the weights of B-spline and the reagent dosage since the weights are interrelated and related to the reagent dosage. A multiple step based optimization algorithm is finally proposed to determine the reagent dosage. Experimental results can show the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

The aim is to approach the problem of creating an artificial nose that can be incorporated into a real working system, while considering the environmental model and odor behavior, the perception system, and algorithm for tracking the odor plume. Current algorithms try to emulate animal behavior in an attempt to replicate their capability to follow odors. Nevertheless, odor perception systems are still in their infancy and far from their biological counterpart. This paper presents a proposal in which a real-working artificial nose is tested as a perception system within a mobile robot. Genetic programming is used as the learning technique platform to develop odor source localization algorithms. Experiments in simulation and with an actual working robot are presented and the results compared with two algorithms. The quality of results demonstrates that genetic programming is able to recreate chemotaxis behavior by considering mathematical models for odor propagation and perception system.}

Geospatial Scientists aim to help in mitigating or managing such hazards by computational modeling of these complex events, while Information Communication Technology (ICT) supports the execution of various models addressing different aspects of disaster management. The execution of natural hazard models using traditional ICT foundations is not possible in a timely manner due to the complex nature of the models, the need for large-scale computational resources as well as intensive data and concurrent-access requirements. Cloud Computing can address these challenges with near-unlimited capacity for computation, storage, and networking, and the ability, to offer natural hazard modeling systems as end services, has now become more realistic than ever. However, researchers face several open challenges in adopting and utilizing Cloud Computing technologies during disasters. As such, this survey paper aggregates all these challenges, reflects on the current research trends and outlines a conceptual Cloud-based solution framework for more effective natural hazards modeling and management systems using Cloud infrastructure in conjunction with other technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) networks, fog, and edge computing.

The first algorithm is based on the co-polar correlation coefficient, ρ, and the scattering matrix decomposition parameters, Cloud entropy (H), mean scattering angle (α) and anisotropy (A). While each of these parameters has oil spill signature in it, we find that combining these parameters into a new parameter, F, is a more effective way for oil slick detection. The second algorithm uses the total power of four polarimetric channels image (SPAN) to find the optimal representation of the oil spill signature. Otsu image segmentation method can then be applied to the F and SPAN images to extract the oil slick features. Using the L-band fully polarimetric Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle – synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) data acquired during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster event in the Gulf of Mexico, we are able to successfully extract the oil slick information in the contaminated ocean area. Our result shows that both algorithms perform well in identifying oil slicks in this case.}

The IDSE was developed incrementally, adding functionality relating to the provision of organisational decision support (DS) with the performance evaluation after each development stage. A scenario and associated case-study were developed within the NECTISE project and presented here, which allowed the demonstration and evaluation of the first prototype IDSE within four separate live simulations.

As configurations in different domains are commonly generated separately while their complex inter-relationships are ignored, extra vulnerabilities would be introduced. This paper proposes a novel risk assessment framework named MDC-Checker to help network administrators to assess the risk involved. Firstly, the framework extracts the semantics from multiple domain configurations and network documents. Then, the Multiple Domain Semantics Graph (MDSG) and the Privilege Dependency Graph (PDG) are established in sequence to reason user actual privileges from their initial privileges. Finally, the differences between user deserved privileges and user actual privileges are used to measure the impact of multiple domain configurations on network security. A simulated network scenario with different sets of configurations is employed to validate the effectiveness and scalability of our framework and approach. The experimental results show that the framework captures the influences of multiple domain configurations on network security successfully and the approach is scalable to different sizes of the network.}

Past efforts to map these resources at regional scales have not achieved consistently high accuracies as they are spatially variable in both ecology and management. In particular, Agriculture and Agri-food Canada needs to distinguish these land use classes from each other and from cropland in its annual national agricultural land cover inventory. Given the potential to distinguish these classes based on seasonal phenological differences, this study used multi-season Landsat 8 top-of-atmosphere reflectance data and derived vegetation and phenological indices, as well as mid-summer RADARSAT-2 data in random forest classification of two ecoregions in Alberta and Manitoba. Classification accuracy was compared for single and multi-date Landsat 8 variables, the vegetation index and phenological variable groups, RADARSAT-2 VV and VH backscatter intensity, and combined datasets. Variable importance analysis showed that spring Landsat 8 reflectance generally contributed most to class discrimination, but accuracy improved with the addition of Landsat 8 data from the other seasons. Vegetation indices and phenological variables produced similar accuracies and were deemed to not warrant the additional processing effort to derive them. RADARSAT-2 VH backscatter was the most important variable for the Manitoba study area, which is wetter with more vegetation structure variability than the Alberta study area. Backscatter intensity significantly increased overall accuracy when it was combined with one or two-season Landsat 8 data. The best overall accuracy was achieved using the three seasons of Landsat 8 and mid-summer RADARSAT-2 data, but it was not significantly better than that for two season Landsat 8 + RADARSAT-2. The methods presented in this paper provide a process for accurate and efficient classification of seeded forage, rangeland and cropland that can be applied over large areas in operational agricultural land cover inventory.}

In this work, we propose a new efficient convex optimization-based approach, i.e. the mesh-based continuous max-flow method, which can be easily implemented and accelerated upon a modern parallel computing platform, e.g. GPU. Particularly, an Markov Random Fields (MRF) based model, i.e. Potts model, is introduced to mathematically formulate the key specific view selection problem; we show that the challenging combinatorial optimization problem can be efficiently solved by resolving its convex relaxation, which recovers textures from images with the proposed duality-based continuous max-flow approach. In addition, visual effects of sharpness and deformation are utilized to define a criterion of evaluating texture quality effectively, and a large 3D triangular mesh is partitioned into structural components so as to reduce memory consumption of the proposed algorithm. The proposed mesh-based continuous max-flow approach for large-scale texture mapping demonstrates its outperformance over state-of-the-art methods, over large-scale public datasets, in both numerical efficiency and visual quality; meanwhile, our GPU-accelerated algorithm can yield 3D textured models with high quality from complex large-scale scenes in minutes.}

abstract = {The ability of drones to access disaster areas has been proven powerful and flexible for acquiring first-hand optical imagery data for environmental observation. However, such imagery data usually undergo postprocessing, and the three-dimensional (3D) products are mainly for accurate land surveys. The postprocessing procedure is too time-consuming to meet instant decision support and rescue response requirements. Therefore, this paper intends to develop a systematic workflow that is able to achieve on-the-fly 3D reconstruction in disaster areas by optical imagery sequentially acquired by drones. This study proposes a strategy to spatially link sequential images (SLSI) for image localization and suitable stereopair selection. In addition, the criteria for valid epipolar stereoapair determination are developed to make the 3D dense reconstruction more automatic and effective. The 3D digital land surface can be gradually reconstructed and expanded in the computer system while the drone is capturing new images. This paper utilizes the imagery dataset of collapsed buildings induced by the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake in Japan to simulate the more effective 3D reconstruction. Although the accuracy of the consequence is reported to be closely one meter, the mean data processing time for every image can achieve the level by approximately ten seconds while performing the proposed scheme on an iMac with Intel Core i5 and 16 GB random access memory (RAM). As a result, the efficiency and computational power needed are significantly reduced to support emergency applications soon after a disaster occurs.}

Several motion-detection models have been proposed on the basis of insect visual system studies. Here, we examine two models, the Hassenstein–Reichardt (HR) model and the two-detector (2D) model. We analytically obtain the mean and variance of the stationary responses of the HR and the 2D models to white noise, and we derive the signal-to-fluctuation-noise ratio (SFNR) to evaluate encoding abilities of the two models. Especially when analyzing the 2D model, we calculate higher-order cumulants of a rectified Gaussian. The results show that the 2D model robustly works almost as well as the HR model in several sets of parameters estimated on the basis of experimental data.}

In order to eliminate the singularity, I propose a new full order sliding mode control method in this article, which has been firstly applied to load frequency control. The full order sliding mode control method includes the terminal sliding mode control (TSM) and the linear sliding mode control (LSM). TSM has the good characteristic of eliminating the singularity due to the avoidance of derivative of terms with fractional power factors. While the LSM is easy to design and has fast time convergence comparing to TSM. The model is based on the system with different kinds of turbine or the same kind of turbine, which contains the nonlinearities. The control purpose is to adjust the frequency deviation to zero. Through the simulation results, it is shown that the frequency deviation can be kept to zero in the condition of different load disturbances by the two approaches, which approves the robustness of the proposed methods. In addition, we compare the two methods with the traditional sliding mode control (SMC), which proves the superiority of the two methods in terms of chattering and response time.}

abstract = {Network softwarisation introduces flexibility in network management by enabling the deployment of network functions as software modules running on virtual machines. However, this creates new concerns for service availability and reliability due to multiple sources of failures at both software and hardware levels, potentially resulting in service degradations and penalties due to Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. The survivability of critical services can best be guaranteed by pro-actively provisioning dedicated backup resources for these services, but at the cost of a high resource consumption. Aware of the divergent requirements of future services, a promising alternative is envisaged, allowing non-critical users to use the unused backup resources of high priority users. However, this approach poses a stringent challenge if a critical service disruption occurs, requiring the computation of a traffic rerouting solution for the non-critical requests when preempted from their borrowed resources. In this paper we first propose a generic multi-stage graph based algorithm as an alternative algorithm for Service Function Chain (SFC) deployments. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is optimized in terms of resource utilization, resulting in a 10% improvement in terms of acceptance ratio compared to a given state of the art algorithm, and within a 4% margin of the optimal solution. Based on the mentioned algorithm, we propose a new migration-aware algorithm for the mapping of non-critical services, enabling the non-critical services to borrow the unused backup resources from the critical services while minimizing the probability of preemption they could experience. The migration-aware algorithm results in more than an 8% resource saving, in most scenarios, compared to a dedicated backup strategy, and more than a 70% performance improvement in terms of the number of service preemptions, compared to a cost based algorithm. Additionally, whenever low priority users are preempted from their borrowed resources, we propose a new QoS-aware global-rerouting algorithm for remapping those users, reducing the impact of the service interruption thanks to avoiding the migration of surviving VNFs and virtual links when feasible. The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform a service restoration strategy based on local rerouting, in terms of successful service restoration and resource consumption.}

Such an approach yields a set of optimal solutions (the Pareto set) which has both advantages and disadvantages. The primary benefit is that a set of solutions provides a picture of the optimal solution space that a single solution cannot. The primary difficulty is making use of a potentially infinite set of solutions. Therefore, a significant part of this approach is the development of a method to model the solution set with a finite number of points allowing the architect to intelligently choose a subset of optimal solutions based on criteria outside of the given objectives. The approach developed incorporates a meta-architecture, multi-objective genetic algorithm, and a corner search to identify points useful for modeling the solution space. This approach is then applied to a network centric warfare problem seeking the optimum selection of twenty systems. Finally, using the same problem, it is compared to a hybrid approach using single-objective optimization with a fuzzy logic assessor to demonstrate the advantage of multi-objective optimization.}

A comparative analysis of the new proposed hybrid algorithm is performed through various benchmark functions. Various test cases to analyze the algorithm’s performance like influence of population size, effect of dimensionality, effect of iterative count is performed and compared. The proposed algorithms are compared with modern-meta-heuristics and variants of WOA and SGO to justify its performance. The performance is evaluated statistically through the Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test and Friedman’s non-parametric test while the convergence curves and acceleration rates are provided to demonstrate the convergence capabilities of the proposed hybrid algorithms and the computational times are recorded to showcase the computational speeds of all the algorithms used in comparison. Composite benchmarking functions are considered to analyze the exploratory prowess and the algorithms’ capability to avoid local entrapment. To assess and evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms with real world optimization tasks, four standard engineering problems with penalty constraints are added to the test bench. Further, a multi-unit production planning problem with correction constraints is deployed through the proposed algorithms. The benchmarking results prove that HS-WOA and HS-WOA+ s’ performance is competitive and better than the various algorithms tested against and had a statistically significant performance with lower computational times. The algorithms performed well for both standard engineering problems and the multi-unit production planning problem outperforming the various algorithms in the literature.}

To achieve this goal, the study is stepwise carried out as follows: the physical and dynamic model together with control architecture of AUVs are firstly adapted for developing entirely an AUV controller. The use-case model combined with the realization hypotheses of hybrid automata and the EKF algorithm are then specialized to closely gather the requirement analysis of control. The specializations of real-time UML/MARTE’s features such as the ‘capsules, ports and protocols’ notation combined with the timing concurrency of evolution are next realized to precisely design structures and behaviors for the controller. The detailed design model is then converted into the implementation model by using object-oriented and open-source platforms in order to quickly simulate and realize this controller. Finally, a planar trajectory-tracking controller, which permits a miniature unmanned submarine to autonomously reaches and follows a planar reference trajectory, was deployed and tested with good reliability.}

abstract = {Geometric quality assessment (QA) of buildings and civil structures is an essential process in a construction project. Timely geometric QA is able to prevent construction delays and cost overruns, maintain the performance of in-service facilities, and extend their service life. Geometric QA based on manual measurement has been proven to be time-consuming, unreliable and costly. Therefore, non-contact sensing technologies have been widely deployed for more efficient and accurate geometric QA. While a large number of techniques and algorithms have been developed in previous studies for non-contact sensing-based geometric QA, relatively little work has been done to systematically study and review their performance. This study reviews recent research on non-contact sensing-based geometric QA of buildings and civil structures in three project phases: 1) manufacturing, 2) assembly/construction, and 3) operation/maintenance phase. For each phase, the geometric QA is further categorized based on different QA purposes, including dimensional QA, surface QA, and deflection/deformation QA. Based on collected papers, two parts of analysis, consisting of 1) the adoption of different sensors for different project phases and 2) the performance of the QA algorithms/methods, are discussed in detail. Following the literature review and in-depth discussions, research gaps and future research directions are suggested, including improvement of QA techniques in each project phase, improvement of QA techniques applicability, and improvement of photogrammetry accuracy. This technical review is expected to have not only academic value by suggesting technical research directions based on the research gaps, but also practical values that allow contractors and subcontractors to automate and improve their current geometric QA practice.}

Mission complexity is compounded for each vehicle added to the mission. In practice, fleet operations are formulated as separate temporal problems by the operator and solved using a temporal planner. This paper proposes a planning method that uses energy as the base planning resource instead of time. Unlike temporal planners, energy planners account for physical loads endured by the vehicles. The extent of uncertainty in the vehicle loads is clarified by using the vehicle dynamics model and Monte Carlo simulation on the model parameters. The planning method is a multistage procedure to decompose operator specified task, obstacle, and vehicle data into an energy formulation of the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) which is then solved using Discrete Strengthened PSO (DStPSO). The DStPSO algorithm has been modified to include a selective swarm size decay method that allows for larger initial swarm sizes to promote early exploration and preserves a percentage of the best performing particles on each iteration to save computational resources. The planner produces near-optimal routes containing feasible trajectories for individual vehicles that maximise tasks completed according to individual vehicle energy constraints. A case-study mission for long-term, large-scale, underwater inspection of a wind turbine array was converted into input data to evaluate the planner. Energy planning presents the opportunity for vehicles to actively monitor the feasibility of their individual plan against their current energy consumption, allowing for advanced reasoning and fault handling to occur in situ without operator assistance.}

abstract = {Recently, tracking models based on bounding box regression (such as region proposal networks), built on the Siamese network, have attracted much attention. Despite their promising performance, these trackers are less effective in perceiving the target information in the following two aspects. First, existing regression models cannot take a global view of a large-scale target since the effective receptive field of a neuron is too small to cover the target with a large scale. Second, the neurons with a fixed receptive field (RF) size in these models cannot adapt to the scale and aspect ratio changes of the target. In this paper, we propose an adaptive ensemble perception tracking framework to address these issues. Specifically, we first construct a per-pixel prediction model, which predicts the target state at each pixel of the correlated feature. On top of the per-pixel prediction model, we then develop a confidence-guided ensemble prediction mechanism. The ensemble mechanism adaptively fuses the predictions of multiple pixels with the guidance of confidence maps, which enlarges the perception range and enhances the adaptive perception ability at the object-level. In addition, we introduce a receptive field adaption model to enhance the adaptive perception ability at the neuron-level, which adjusts the RF by adaptively integrating the features with different RFs. Extensive experimental results on the VOT2018, VOT2016, UAV123, LaSOT, and TC128 datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed.}

The rapid proliferation of EVs will introduce an unprecedented load on the existing electric grid due to the charging/discharging behavior of the EVs, thus motivating the need for novel approaches for routing EVs across the grid. In this paper, a novel distributed control framework based on noncooperative game theory for routing of EVs within the smart grid is proposed. The goal of this framework is to control and balance the electricity load in a distributed manner across the grid while taking into account the traffic congestion and the waiting time at charging stations. The EV routing problem is formulated as a repeated game, and it is shown that the selfish behavior of EVs will result in a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with the price of anarchy upper bounded by the ratio of the variance of the ground load to the total number of EVs in the grid. In particular, it is shown that any achieved Nash equilibrium substantially improves the load balance across the grid. Moreover, the results are extended to capture the stochastic nature of induced ground load as well as the subjective behavior of the EV owners using the behavioral framework of prospect theory. Simulation results provide new insights on efficient energy pricing at charging stations and under realistic grid conditions.}

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been shown to be sensitive to surface soil moisture, and is therefore a promising alternative to field data campaigns. However, the presence of spatially-variable vegetation and surface roughness also affect SAR backscatter. In this research, empirical models were developed to both predict soil moisture from SAR and assess the relationship between LiDAR-derived vegetation and surface conditions, and polarimetric SAR parameters in a vegetated peatland environment. Importantly, the low predictive strength of soil moisture models was only evident through a process of model cross-validation (bivariate regression R2 ranged from 0.14 to 0.66 for fitted models and 0.05 to 0.41 for independently cross-validated models). The LiDAR-derived vegetation density was found to explain a large amount of variance in the SAR data, and models to predict soil moisture from SAR from only the least vegetated sites within the peatland demonstrated much higher predictive strength (R2=0.11 to 0.71). Soil moisture within the vegetated and least-vegetated sites was not significantly different. Therefore, non-vegetated areas may be useful as representative imaging locations for remotely monitoring surface moisture conditions in large peatland complexes with heterogeneous vegetation.}

abstract = {To achieve more powerful task processing capabilities, the smart embedded systems (SES) are interconnected via wireless network to form a collaboration system. However, due to the limitations on system hardware, the SES device are usually built with the consideration of software functions instead of enough security mechanisms, that exposes the SESs under the security threats from malware or malicious users, such as software or data tampering. To address this issue, a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is brought in the SES device to guarantee the integrity of the system, with which any unauthorized modifications towards the SES system can be detected by measurement operations of TPM. However, from the perspective of the external visitors, a SES collaboration network performs as a complete system. Thus, to unify the root-of-trust of the network, all the TPMs need to be integrated into a logical one, which can provide more efficient way to attest the external visitors. This brings two distinct advantages: (1) any nodes of the network can be the access node for the visitor, and (2) once a visitor has been successfully attested, it can access the network via any nodes without extra attestation. To achieve TPM integration, we have proposed five protocols to orchestrate the distributed TPMs, including Synchronization Protocol (SYNP), Node Accessing Protocol (NAP), Crossing-Node Access Protocol (CNAP), Updating Protocol (UPDP) and Node-Removing Protocol (NRP). We have built a prototype system composed of Raspberry Pis and Infineon TPM2.0 chips, in which these protocols are implemented and deployed. Then, we evaluate the protocols’ performance on time consumption, and the results show the feasibility and availability of these protocols. Finally, our analysis on experimental results gives the guidance for appropriate use of these protocols.}

Many advanced flash-aware data management techniques have been developed to exploit the full potential of flash storage devices. It is then reasonable to adopt flash storage devices to deliver high I/O performance for on-board remote sensing image processing tasks, which pose particular challenges in data storage and I/O management. In this work, we focus on caching issues and propose a page-mapping cache management approach based on a page-level flash translation layer (FTL) to accommodate various types of workloads presented by different remote sensing image processing operations. The adaptability is achieved by three major techniques: 1) separating mapping cache into hot and cold regions according to access frequency; 2) a probability-based locality-aware cache replacement priority model to balance high hit ratio and low write/erase costs; and 3) adaptive mapping cache replacement algorithms that are seamlessly integrated with 1) and 2) to handle complicated I/O patterns efficiently. Combining these above three techniques, the proposed FTL-based cache management approach is superior to several existing methods, as demonstrated by extensive experiments running on realistic on-board remote sensing processing I/O traces.}

The stabilization analysis is presented via the Lyapunov function and sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Then the result is extended to disturbance-attenuated case where the leader has bounded control input which is only known by a portion of followers.

Uncertainties that affect aircraft motions cause difficulty in an accurate prediction of the trajectory, especially in the context of four-dimensional (4D) Trajectory-Based Operation (4DTBO), which brings the uncertainty of pilot intent. This study draws on the idea of time geography, and turns the research focus of CD&R from TP to an analysis of the aircraft reachable space constrained by 4D waypoint constraints. The concepts of space–time reachability of aircraft and space–time potential conflict space are proposed. A novel pre-CD&R scheme for multiple aircraft is established. A key advantage of the scheme is that the uncertainty of pilot intent is accounted for via a Space-Time Prism (STP) for aircraft. Conflict detection is performed by verifying whether the STPs of aircraft intersect or not, and conflict resolution is performed by planning a conflict-free space–time trajectory avoiding intersection. Numerical examples are presented to validate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.}

The finite-time synchronization is a popular topic from a practical point of view in engineering, which has many applications in the areas like chaos-based communication, image and voice encryptions. The present chaotic system scrolls (up to five) are incorporated with the help of hyperbolic tangent functions (sigmoid non-linearity), but in real applications, there is no limit of multi-scroll in a chaotic system. Finite-time synchronization is achieved with the help of Lyapunov stability using some lemmas and definitions. The Lyapunov exponents are also calculated for multi-scroll chaotic systems with uncertainties and it confirms that the multi-scroll system is chaotic with uncertainties. A drive has been taken to achieve finite-time synchronization of multi-scroll chaotic systems with uncertain parameters, where the multi-scrolls are generated by nonlinear functions.}

This paper presents a novel switching method for achieving immediate and smooth manual-automatic vehicle control transitions. An open-loop dynamic initial conditioning module is added to the existing closed-loop automatic steering control to provide suitable references to the automatic steering controller. This open-loop dynamic initial conditioning is designed as a vehicle regulation control with gains and bandwidth lower than the automatic steering controller so as to achieve immediate, smooth transitions. Moreover, as the reference converges to zero, the overall automatic steering control system naturally becomes the original automatic steering control without any explicit transition. The proposed method was implemented in a test vehicle and test runs with over 250 switches in 300 seconds up to 140 km/h were conducted. The test results demonstrate that the proposed design has achieved immediate and smooth transitions between manual control and automated control.}

However, little research has modelled the distribution of this disease at a fine spatial resolution from geospatial surfaces using advanced non-parametric methods. This study uses an extensive national dataset (n = 6276 observations) that describes the severity of DNB on plantation grown P. radiata with measurements expressed as a percentage of foliage within the stand affected by the disease (range 0–90%). Using these data the objectives of this research were to (i) compare the predictive precision of models of disease severity constructed using parametric and non-parametric approaches, (ii) determine whether the use of regression kriging is able to improve model fit, (iii) identify the key environmental determinants of disease severity using the most precise modelling methods and (iv) develop a fine scale map showing variation in disease severity throughout New Zealand. All predictions were made on a test dataset (n = 1883) that was not used for model fitting. Disease severity was most precisely predicted by the two non-parametric models eXtreme Gradient Boosting (RMSE = 11.37%, R2 = 0.231) and random forest (RMSE = 11.28%, R2 = 0.246) which both markedly outperformed the parametric multiple regression model (RMSE = 12.17%, R2 = 0.120). The use of regression kriging considerably increased the precision for the multiple regression (RMSE = 11.88%, R2 = 0.161) but did not improve model precision for the two non-parametric models. Random forest was the most precise model and included 14 variables, of which the time of the observation, stand age, relative humidity and solar radiation had the strongest influence on disease severity. A fine resolution map (25 m) created using random forest showed disease severity to be highest in northern and western areas of New Zealand, where relative humidity and rainfall are high. Low disease severity was predicted on the drier east coast of New Zealand and values were particularly low in the far south, where mean annual solar radiation is relatively low. This surface will assist forest managers in narrowing the search radius for the disease and prioritising areas for targeted deployment of disease resistance clones, provenances or alternative species.}

To solve this problem, an early fault feature extraction method based on the Teager energy operator, combined with optimal variational mode decomposition (VMD) is presented in this study. First, the Teager energy operator was used to strengthen the weak shock component of the original signal. Next, a logistic–sine complex chaotic mapping with variable dimensions was constructed to enhance the global search ability and convergence speed of the pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) algorithm, which is named the variable dimension chaotic pigeon-inspired optimization (VDCPIO) algorithm. Then, the VDCPIO algorithm is used to search for the optimal combination value of key parameters of VMD. The enhanced vibration signal is decomposed into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by the optimized VMD, and then kurtosis for every IMF and mean kurtosis of all IMFs are extracted. According to the average kurtosis, several IMFs, whose kurtosis value is greater than the average kurtosis value, are selected to reconstruct a new signal. Then, envelope spectrum analysis of the reconstructed signal is carried out to extract the early fault features. Finally, experimental verification of the method was performed using the simulated signal and measured signal from a rolling bearing; the experimental results indicate that the method presented in this paper is more effective to extract the early fault features of this kind of mechanical equipment.}

The VV and VH polarized backscattering coefficients of Sentinel-1B, the polarimetric decomposition parameters of Sentinel-1B, and Sentinel-2A multi-spectral images from June and September were selected to construct 18 multi-dimensional data sets. A highly correlated variable elimination algorithm, a recursive feature elimination variable selection algorithm (RFE-RF), and an optimized random forest algorithm (RF) were used to construct a marsh vegetation identification model. In this study, we searched for an RF model to achieve the accurate classification of marsh vegetation and find the best feature for identifying various types of vegetation. Additionally, the applicability of different optimized RF models to the task of the identification of wetland vegetation and the stability of the identification of marsh vegetation using different classification models were quantitatively analyzed. The results show the following: (1) RFE-RF variable selection and RF parameter optimization can reduce the data dimensionality, improve the accuracy and stability of the wetland vegetation classification model, and achieve a training accuracy of up to 85.39%. (2) The RF model integrating multi-spectral data, backscattering coefficients, and polarimetric decomposition parameters for June and September can obtain the highest overall accuracy (91.16%), and the model has the strongest applicability. (3) The importance of multi-spectral variables in wetland vegetation classification is higher than that of backscattering coefficients and polarimetric decomposition parameters. The visible bands and vegetation index are the most important variables, while the cross-polarized backscattering coefficient (Mean_VH), polarimetric decomposition eigenvalue (Mean_l1, Mean_l2), and calculated eigenvalues of the matrix (Mean_lambda) are the backscattering coefficient features and polarimetric decomposition parameters with the highest contributions. (4) The modified normalized difference water index in June (MNDWI_ Jun), blue band in September (Mean_B_Sep), location feature pixel coordinates (Y_Max_Pxl), and ratio vegetation index in September (RVI_Sep) have the highest contribution to the identification and classification of deep-water marsh vegetation, shallow-water marsh vegetation, forest, and shrubs, respectively. (5) The identification of forest is the strongest, and the classification accuracy for shrubs and deep-water marsh vegetation is greatly affected by the combination of time phase and data sources.}

In this type of simulations, the main contributions of our work are: a) we showed that distributed time-driven simulations do not always improve the performance when using synchronous communication strategies, b) we show asynchronous communications strategies are more efficient.

We assume that the probability of the events occurring at the geographical points of interest follow known Poisson processes. We tie a utility function to the probability of detecting an event in each point of interest and use it to incentivize the agents to visit the geographical nodes with higher probability of event occurrence. We show that the design of an optimal monitoring policy that specifies the sequence of the geographical nodes and time of visit of those nodes for each mobile agent so that the utility of event detection over a mission horizon is maximized is an NP-hard problem. To reduce the time complexity of constructing the feasible set of the optimal approach and also to induce robustness to changes in event occurrence and other operational factors, we consider a receding horizon approach. We note that, with the number of agents growing, the cost of finding the optimal path grows exponentially even with shortened horizon. To overcome this issue, we introduce a sub-modular optimization approach that has a polynomial time complexity and also comes with a known sub-optimality lower bound. We demonstrate our results through simulations.}

Breeding water–stress resistant crop varieties is one of the effective ways to handle this problem. The surface temperatures of the crop are essential for assessing their water stress resistance. Thermal imaging has been widely used to acquire the crop surface temperatures. However, most studies focus on 2D measurement. A 3D thermal imaging system is designed, and a method is developed by using the thermal and RGB-D data to acquire 3D thermal information of maize under water stress conditions. First, thermal and RGB-D cameras were used to collect the thermal and color images, and depth data of maize at the jointing stage and the thermal and color images were processed to extract the edge images of maize. Second, the KAZE feature was selected to register the edge images. Testing results showed that the KAZE feature has better performance than the SURF and BRISK features in the thermal and color image registration of maize. On the basis of the thermal and color image registration, the depth data of maize were assigned with temperature values. Third, the depth data of maize were further processed with denoising, maize extraction, amplification, smoothing, and temperature correction steps to improve the data qualities. Finally, the crop water stress index and canopy–air temperature difference values of each point were calculated. The results demonstrated that the system and the proposed method can effectively detect the water stress characteristics of maize in 3D, which can be combined with the morphological traits of leaves to synthetically analyze the water stress resistance of the crop.}

abstract = {Online communities, where lead users openly share their experiences and knowledge on product and technology in the form of a post, have become a fruitful source of innovation. While efforts have been made to provide a way of data-driven case-based reasoning (CBR), existing studies have limitations in reflecting lead users’ characteristics into the CBR process. Current research has emphasized the retrieval and adaptation phase only, which retrieves, reuses, and revises cases. However, what is at the core of lead user characteristics is to find out the problem, and solve the problem by themselves before mass customers. This means CBR needs to focus on uncovering and defining problems and finding relevant solutions for designated problems. In response, this research suggests a novel approach for problem-oriented CBR approach to reflect lead user characteristics. First, this study defines problems, by extracting problem–solution sets related to the specific function using sentiment analysis. Second, this study improves case representation and case retrieval using subject-action-object (SAO) analysis and technology tree respectively. This study demonstrates the approach through a case of drone technology using lead user communities (diydrones.com), and our findings suggest that the approach can help firms broaden the knowledge of existing products to make an improvement.}

First, both fixed and time-varying input delays are taken into consideration of tracking consensus protocol design due to the network transmission delay among agents, respectively. Correspondingly, a new delay-dependent triggering mechanism is proposed, by which the protocols of agent are only updated at the violation of the pre-defined triggering mechanism. One of its advantages is that the triggering instant can not be affected by its neighbours’ state of last triggering instant, which can reduce effectively the frequency of control updates. Then, the co-design method of the control protocol gains and the triggering parameters are developed and delay-dependent event-triggered tracking consensus criteria are obtained by Lyapunov stability theory, respectively. Moreover, the Zeno-behavior of event-triggered mechanisms is excluded effectively by showing the existence of the strictly positive consecutive triggering interval. Last, two comparison examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method.}

First, an impact FE model has been formulated for a typical airbag landing buffer system. We use the independence of the structure FE model from the full impact FE model to develop a hierarchical updating scheme for the recovery module FE model and the airbag system FE model. Second, we define impact responses at key points to compare the computational and experimental results to resolve the inconsistency between the experimental data sampling frequency and experimental triggering. To determine the typical characteristics of the impact dynamics response of the airbag landing buffer system, we present the impact response confidence factors (IRCFs) to evaluate how consistent the computational and experiment results are. An error function is defined between the experimental and computational results at key points of the impact response (KPIR) to serve as a modified objective function. A radial basis function (RBF) is introduced to construct updating variables for a surrogate model for updating the objective function, thereby converting the FE model updating problem to a soluble optimization problem. Finally, the developed method has been validated using an experimental and computational study on the impact dynamics of a classic airbag landing buffer system.}

As we have known, the combination of several feature units into a whole feature vector is broadly adopted for effective object representation, which may inevitably includes some irrelevant/redundant feature units or feature dimensions. Most of the traditional feature selection models can only select the feature dimensions without concerning the intrinsic relationship among different feature units. By taking into consideration the group sparsity of feature dimensions and feature units based on an ℓ2,1 minimization, we propose a new unsupervised feature selection model, unsupervised deep sparse feature selection (UDSFS) in this paper. In comparison with the state-of-the-arts, our UDSFS model can not only select the most discriminative feature units but also assign proper weight to the useful feature dimensions concurrently; moreover, the efficiency and robustness of our UDSFS can be also improved without extracting the discarded irrelevant feature units. For model optimization, we introduce an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the non-smooth, convex model and obtain a global optimization with the convergence rate as O(1/K2) (K is the iteration number). For the experiments, a new medical endoscopic image dataset, Abnormal Endoscopic Image Detection dataset (AEID), is built for evaluation; we also test our model using two public UCI datasets. Various experiments and comparisons with other state-of-the-arts justified the effectiveness and efficiency of our UDSFS model.}

This algorithm consists of a cascade architecture which employs a measurement feedback nonlinear H∞ algorithm in the outer-loop to track the reference trajectory via noisy measurements, and a state-feedback nonlinear H∞ in the inner-loop to stabilize the attitude dynamics. The obtained structure for the outer-loop includes a robust controller-estimator combination which satisfies the stability and convergence of both parts. Analytical results show the asymptotic stability and output boundedness for both inner and outer loops and consequently the cascade system. The Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to numerically examine the robust performance and the region of attraction of the overall system. Different environmental disturbances and modeling uncertainties are considered in 1000 simulations to verify the robust performance and boundedness of all states. Moreover, to quantify the performance of the algorithm, two numerical indexes; Integrated Square error (ISE), and Integral of the Absolute value of the control Derivative (IADU) are suggested and utilized for statistical analysis of the state tracking performance and control effort, respectively. Finally, a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) test is performed using PX4-FMU open source autopilot and Raspberry-Pi 3 as an auxiliary processor to show the capability of the algorithm for hardware implementation.}

This is the first step required for reducing water losses due to drainage and for minimizing the risk of underground water contamination. In addition, on-farm water productivity can be optimized by employing several irrigation scheduling protocols, and this review mainly focuses on commercial applications based on previous scientific findings. New advancements in remote sensing technologies, data processing, and management offer opportunities for optimizing decision making in terms of watering regime, particularly under the absence of water quality restrictions. For reducing deep percolation of water, it is important not only to properly determine the water requirements but also to tailor the frequency of irrigation to the soil characteristics and the growth of plant roots. Soil sensors are appropriate tools for achieving this goal, and several technologies are available and compared by considering their advantages and drawbacks. Current knowledge on models for computing water requirement is also considered for an integrated irrigation scheduling that combines data from different sources from the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. The best irrigation technologies for on-farm water application should be combined with irrigation scheduling programs based on the knowledge of soil characteristics and water requirements of local crops to minimize water contamination risks.}

Such data can, however, be associated with large uncertainties, particularly for beaches experiencing a large tidal range (>2 m) and energetic incident waves. We use a decade of bi-monthly topographic surveys at the high-energy meso-macrotidal beach of Truc Vert, southwest France, and concurrent wave and water-level hindcast to investigate the uncertainties associated with satellite-derived time series of the shoreline position. We show that consideration of the water level and wave runup elevation is critical for accurately estimating waterline position and, in turn, shoreline position. At Truc Vert, including non-tidal water level residuals (e.g. wind-driven surge) and accounting for time- and elevation-varying beach slope for horizontal correction did not improve satellite-derived shoreline position. A new total water level threshold is proposed to maximize the number of usable images while minimizing errors. Accounting for wave runup and the new water level threshold at Truc Vert, the number of usable satellite images is doubled and shoreline position errors are at least halved compared to previous work at this site. Using the 1984–2019 reconstructed shoreline, we also show that the satellite-derived shoreline trends and interannual variability are in better agreement with field measurements. Although the approach proposed here needs to be tested on other sites in different tidal/wave forcing environments with different morphological and sediment characteristics, we anticipate that it will improve the temporal and spatial description of shoreline change on most surf tidal beaches where accurate continuous water level and wave hindcasts and/or observations are available.}

The assessment of the contamination is particularly difficult on vegetated sites, but promising advances in reflectance spectroscopy have recently emerged for this purpose. This study aimed to exploit vegetation reflectance for estimating low concentrations of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) in soils. A greenhouse experiment was carried out for 42 days on Cenchrus alopecuroides (L.) under realistic tropical conditions. The species was grown on oil-contaminated mud pit soils from industrial sites, with various concentrations of TPH. After 42 days, a significant decrease in plant growth and leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid contents was observed for plants exposed to 5–19 g kg−1 TPH in comparison to the controls (p < 0.05). Conversely, pigment contents were higher for plants exposed to 1 g kg−1 TPH (hormesis phenomenon). These modifications proportionally affected the reflectance of C. alopecuroides at leaf and plant scales, especially in the visible region around 550 and 700 nm. 33 vegetation indices were used for linking the biochemical and spectral responses of the species to oil using elastic net regressions. The established models indicated that chlorophylls a and b and β-carotene were the main pigments involved in the modifications of reflectance (R2 > 0.7). The same indices also succeeded in estimating the concentrations of TPH using random forest regression, at leaf and plant scales (RMSE = 1.46 and 1.63 g kg−1 and RPD = 5.09 and 4.44, respectively). Four out of the 33 indices contributed the most to the models (>75%). This study opens up encouraging perspectives for monitoring the cessation of oil activities in tropical regions. Further researches will focus on the application of our approach at larger scale, on airborne and satellite imagery.}

Cognitive radio networks opportunistically utilize the spectrum holes, i.e., spectrum not in use by Primary Users (or PUs or licensed users) and allocate the spectrum dynamically. For every network including cognitive radio networks, routing is very important. Routing is the backbone of communication for transferring data from one machine to another in a multi-hop fashion. A good routing protocol is required for efficient communication and a good routing protocol is based on channel selection strategy. Therefore, a good channel selection strategy is required for efficient routing protocol so that routes should be stable and exist for longer time. In this paper, we focus on joint channel selection and routing from the perspective of cognitive radio networks. In this context, we provide a comprehensive survey on routing and channel selection in CRNs. More specifically, the importance of joint channel selection and routing for cognitive radio networks is first highlighted. Then classification and challenges of channel selection and routing are discussed in details. Routing with efficient channel selection in cognitive radio networks is then discussed by describing many routing strategies for cognitive radio networks, routing metrics, performance parameters, primary user activity modeling and spectrum aware strategies. Then guidelines for the development of efficient routing protocols are discussed. Subsequently, in last, a case study for channel selection strategy ‘Spectrum Aware Dynamic Channel Assignment’ (SA-DCA) is presented and illustrated that how routing can get benefit from it.}

Clustering performance is mostly dependent on the text features' characteristics. The Arabic language has a complex morphology and is highly inflected. Thus, selecting appropriate features affects clustering performance positively. Many studies have addressed the clustering problem in Web pages with Arabic content. There are three main challenges in applying text clustering to Arabic Web page content. The first challenge concerns difficulty with identifying significant term features to represent original content by considering the hidden knowledge. The second challenge is related to reducing data dimensionality without losing essential information. The third challenge regards how to design a suitable model for clustering Arabic text that is capable of improving clustering performance. This paper presents an overview of existing Arabic Web page clustering methods, with the goals of clarifying existing problems and examining feature selection and reduction techniques for solving clustering difficulties. In line with the objectives and scope of this study, the present research is a joint effort to improve feature selection and vectorization frameworks in order to enhance current text analysis techniques that can be applied to Arabic Web pages.}
