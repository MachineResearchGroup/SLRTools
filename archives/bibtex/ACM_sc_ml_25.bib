abstract = {The applicability and usefulness of agent technology for real world problems is still a matter of discussion - even within the AAMAS community. While theoretical models have significantly matured and led to an exciting variety of results, there were only few attempts to validate these models in reality. In this paper we aim to report on challenges that occurred when agent theory was used to approach real world problems. In doing so, we focus on the concept of planning, since planning currently appears to be one of the most relevant concepts for distributed real world applications. We examine four agent-based applications and emphasise problems that occurred when agent theory was practically applied. We also show how these problems were countered and propose more general solutions based on these tailored and context-specific approaches. The aim of this paper is to bring the two diverging branches of agent theory and practice back together in order to better adapt agent technology to the requirements of professional software.},

abstract = {Digital archives of memory institutions are typically concerned with the cataloguing of artefacts of artistic, historical, and cultural value. Recently, new forms of citizen participation in cultural heritage have emerged, producing a wealth of material spanning from visitors’ experiential feedback on exhibitions and cultural artefacts to digitally mediated interactions like the ones happening on social media platforms. Citizen curation is proposed in the context of the European project SPICE (Social Participation, Cohesion, and Inclusion through Cultural Engagement) as a methodology for producing, collecting, interpreting, and archiving people’s responses to cultural objects, with the aim of favouring the emergence of multiple, sometimes conflicting, viewpoints and motivating users and memory institutions to reflect upon them. We argue that citizen curation urges to rethink the nature of computational infrastructures supporting data management of memory institutions, bringing novel challenges that include issues of distribution, authoritativeness, interdependence, privacy, and rights management. To approach these issues, we survey relevant literature toward a distributed, Linked Data infrastructure, with a focus on identifying the roles and requirements involved in such an infrastructure. We show how existing research can contribute significantly in facing the challenges raised by citizen curation and discuss challenges and opportunities from the socio-technical standpoint.},

abstract = {Internet of things systems are increasingly common nowadays. They feature spatially-distributed, mobile entities with an arising collective behavior. Such entities bear radionavigation sensors that produce positioning information, then used by the (software-enabled) device to produce positioning information over time, referred to as trajectories. However, software applications built on top of this require composite models of space to be in place; such models can provide adaptive behaviors by observing, evaluating, and reacting to a constantly changing spatial environment. This is typically achieved by monitoring for changes, analyzing requirements violations and then planning and executing adequate countermeasures. We are concerned with the fact that model representations of space are highly pertinent to requirements reasoning of internet of things systems, and such spatial models can be very useful for engineering adaptation. To this end, we provide and implement a technique to infer analyzable models from general trajectories of spatially-distributed systems, which may be used for engineering analysis or planning facilities for the overall self-adaptive systems. Moreover, we illustrate how such spatial models are used for evaluation of requirements predicating about the structure of space, the spatial distribution of devices, temporal as well as quantitative aspects through formal spatio-temporal verification.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the development and use of smart home technologies. Besides being used in private homes, these and other wireless Internet of Things (IoT) technologies may also complement classical building automation to retrofit existing stock. Especially public and commercial buildings in Germany and Europe have the potential to become more energy-efficient and to provide a healthier environment for their users. This paper introduces an ongoing feasibility study on Smart Public Buildings at the University of Applied Sciences Stuttgart. The study addresses the special requirements of public institutions for the utilization of smart home and other IoT technologies. To explore and validate these requirements, different use cases and prototypes based on an open-source platform for the home automation have been developed. Firstly, a preceding analysis of the special requirements of public buildings in Germany is outlined. Secondly, the basic installation of a smart building system at the university campus is introduced. Finally, some of the prototypes and use cases that have been carried out are presented.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel cognitive architecture and game-theoretic model for resource sharing among netizens, thus improving their quality of experience (QoE) in multi-layer social sensing environments. The underlying approach is to quantify micro-rewards and inequalities derived from social multi-layer interactions. Specifically, we model our society as a social multi-layer network of individuals or groups of individuals (nodes), where the layers represent multiple channels of interactions (on various services). The weighted edges correspond to the multiple social relationships between nodes participating in different services, reflecting the importance assigned to each of these edges and are defined based on the concepts of awareness and homophily. Heterogeneity, both interactions-wise on the multiple layers and related to homophily between individuals, on each node and layer of a weighted multiplex network produces a complex multi-scale interplay between nodes in the multi-layer structure. Applying game theory, we quantify the impact of heterogeneity on the evolutionary dynamics of social sensing through a data driven approach based on the propagation of individual-level micro-affirmations and micro-inequalities. The micro-packets of energy continuously exchanged between nodes may impact positively or negatively on their social behaviors, producing peaks of extreme dissatisfaction and in some cases a form of distress. Quantifying the evolutionary dynamics of human behaviors enables the detection of such peaks in the population and enable us design a targeted control mechanism, where social rewards and self-healing help improve the QoE of the netizens.},

Thus, integrated simulations of many parts of the entire urban ecosystem are needed to create and evaluate the effects of policies. Many existing models target a single urban system - land use models, transportation models, water system models, etc. - however coupling them to create interconnected systems often requires great effort and resources. In this work we propose a common object model for integrated transportation and land use models (ITLUMs) using the High Level Architecture Standard (IEEE 1516) (IEEE 2010). This object model is the first step in a longer term effort to develop new simulation models that can be readily integrated through common data abstractions. Finally, the proposed object model is designed to be extendable to capture the elements from other models of the urban environment.},

abstract = {Network monitoring is an important part of network management that collects valuable metadata describing active communication protocols, network transmissions, bandwidth utilization, and the most communicating nodes. Traditional IP network monitoring techniques include the SNMP system, flow monitoring, or system logging. The environment of the Internet of Things (IoT) networks, however, shows that these approaches do not provide sufficient visibility of IoT communication which would allow network administrators to identify possible attacks on IoT nodes. The reason is obvious: IoT devices lack sufficient computational resources to fully implement monitoring agents, LAN IoT data communication is often directly over data link layers rather than IP, and IoT sensors produce an endless flow of small packets which can be difficult to process in real-time. To tackle these limitations we propose a new IoT monitoring model based on extended IPFIX records. The model employs a passive monitoring probe that observes IoT traffic and collects metadata from IoT protocols. Using extended IPFIX protocol, flow records with IoT metadata are sent to the collector where they are analyzed and used to provide a global view on the whole IoT network and its communication. We also present two statistical approaches that analyze IoT flows data in order to detect security incidents or malfunctioning of a device. The proof-of-concept implementation is demonstrated for Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) traffic in the smart home environment.},

However, cloud computing cannot handle rapidly emerging smart applications with latency-sensitive, high throughput, and high availability and reliability requirements, such as virtual reality and autonomous vehicles. The fog and mobile edge computing paradigms have been proposed to bring the cloud capacity along the network to end devices to address the above concerns. A key development aspect of fog systems is their programming models. Fog programming models and frameworks face challenges that originated from the unique characteristics of fog systems, such as heterogeneity, scalability, and mobility. In this paper, we first study the main characteristics of fog programming, as well as the design requirements of fog programming models with respect to the fog architecture and application types. Then, we survey fog programming models both from research and industry perspectives. Finally, we point out the issues and future challenges in fog programming. The survey framework, presented in this paper, provides useful insights and outlook for the fog programming research and development, inspires further research on fog programming models, and sheds light on the future of programming in this fast-growing computing paradigm.},

abstract = {Implantable medical devices are safety-critical systems whose incorrect operation can jeopardize a patient's health, and whose algorithms must meet tight platform constraints like memory consumption and runtime. In particular, we consider here the case of implantable cardioverter defibrillators, where peak detection algorithms and various others discrimination algorithms serve to distinguish fatal from non-fatal arrhythmias in a cardiac signal. Motivated by the need for powerful formal methods to reason about the performance of arrhythmia detection algorithms, we show how to specify all these algorithms using Quantitative Regular Expressions QREs. QRE is a formal language to express complex numerical queries over data streams, with provable runtime and memory consumption guarantees. We show that QREs are more suitable than classical temporal logics to express in a concise and easy way a range of peak detectors in both the time and wavelet domains and various discriminators at the heart of today's arrhythmia detection devices. The proposed formalization also opens the way to formal analysis and rigorous testing of these detectors' correctness and performance, alleviating the regulatory burden on device developers when modifying their algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by executing QRE-based monitors on real patient data on which they yield results on par with the results reported in the medical literature.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) must often self-adapt to respond to changes in their operating environment. However, using formal verification techniques to provide assurances that critical requirements are satisfied can be computationally intractable due to the large state space of self-adaptive CPSs. In this paper we propose a novel language, Adaptive CSP, to model self-adaptive CPSs modularly and provide a technique to support compositional verification of such systems. Our technique allows system designers to identify (a subset of) the CPS components that can affect satisfaction of given requirements, and define adaptation procedures of these components to preserve the requirements in the face of changes to the system's operating environment. System designers can then use Adaptive CSP to represent the system including potential self-adaptation procedures. The requirements can then be verified only against relevant components, independently from the rest of the system, thus enabling computationally tractable verification. Our technique enables the use of existing formal verification technology to check requirement satisfaction. We illustrate this through the use of FDR, a refinement checking tool. To achieve this, we provide an adequate translation from a subset of Adaptive CSP to the language of FDR. Our technique allows system designers to identify alternative adaptation procedures, potentially affecting different sets of CPS components, for each requirement, and compare them based on correctness and optimality. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a substantive example of a smart art gallery. Our results show that our technique reduces the computational complexity of verifying self-adaptive CPSs and can support the design of adaptation procedures.},

Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, as advocated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, requires rapid, far-reaching, and unprecedented changes in how governments, industries, and societies function by 2030. Computer Science plays an important role in these efforts, both in providing tools for greater understanding of climate science and in reducing the environmental costs of computing. It is vital for Computer Science students to understand how their chosen field can both exacerbate and mitigate the problem of climate change.We have reviewed the existing literature, interviewed leading experts, and held conversations at the ITiCSE 2019 conference, to identify how universities, departments, and CS educators can most effectively address climate change within Computer Science education. We find that the level of engagement with the issue is still low, and we discuss obstacles at the level of institutional, program and departmental support as well as faculty and student attitudes. We also report on successful efforts to date, and we identify responses, strategies, seed ideas, and resources to assist educators as they prepare their students for a world shaped by climate change.},

Numerous easy-to-access and easy-to-use tools have streamlined the prototyping of interactive and embedded devices for experts and led to a remarkable growth in non-expert builders. However, there has been little exploration of challenges associated with moving beyond a prototype and creating hundreds or thousands of exact replicas - a process that is still challenging for many. We interviewed 25 individuals with experience taking prototype hardware devices into low volume production. We systematically investigated the common issues faced and mitigation strategies adopted. We present our findings in four main categories: (1) gaps in technical knowledge; (2) gaps in non-technical knowledge; (3) minimum viable rigor in manufacturing preparation; and (4) building relationships and a professional network. Our study unearthed several opportunities for new tools and processes to support the transition beyond a working prototype to cost effective low-volume manufacturing. These would complement the aforementioned tools and materials that support design and prototyping.},

While the users are benefiting from richer and more personalized apps, the growing number of sensors introduces new security and privacy risks to end users, and makes the task of sensor management more complex.In this paper, first, we discuss the issues around security and privacy of mobile sensors. Second, we reflect the results of a workshop which we organized on mobile sensor security. In this workshop, the participants are introduced to mobile sensors by working with sensor-enabled apps. We evaluate the risk levels perceived by the participants for these sensors after they learn their functionalities. The results show that knowing sensors by working with sensor-enabled apps would not immediately improve the users' security inference of the actual risks of these sensors. Finally, we provide recommendations for educators, app developers, and mobile users to contribute toward awareness and education on this topic.},

abstract = {Location-based services are one of the most important services offered by mobile social networks. Offering this kind of service requires accessing the physical position of users together with the access authorizations, i.e., who is authorized to access what information. However, these physical positions and authorizations are sensitive information that have to be kept secret from any adversary, including the service providers. As far as we know, the problem of offering location-based services in mobile social networks with a revocation feature under collusion assumption, i.e., an adversary colludes with the service provider, has not been studied. In this article, we show how to solve this problem in the example of range queries. Specifically, we guarantee any adversary, including the service provider, is not able to learn (1) the physical position of the users, (2) the distance between his position and that of the users, and (3) whether two users are allowed to learn the distance between them. We propose two approaches, namely, two-layer symmetric encryption and two-layer attribute-based encryption. The main difference between them is that they use, among other encryption schemes, symmetric and attribute-based encryption, respectively. Next, we prove the secrecy guarantees of both approaches, analyze their complexity, and provide experiments to evaluate their performance in practice.},

abstract = {In China, 260 million people migrate to cities to realize their urban dreams. Despite that these migrants play an important role in the rapid urbanization process, many of them fail to settle down and eventually leave the city. The integration process of migrants thus raises an important issue for scholars and policymakers. In this paper, we use Shanghai as an example to investigate migrants' behavior in their first weeks and in particular, how their behavior relates to early departure. Our dataset consists of a one-month complete dataset of 698 telecommunication logs between 54 million users, plus a novel and publicly available housing price data for 18K real estates in Shanghai. We find that migrants who end up leaving early tend to neither develop diverse connections in their first weeks nor move around the city. Their active areas also have higher housing prices than that of staying migrants. We formulate a churn prediction problem to determine whether a migrant is going to leave based on her behavior in the first few days. The prediction performance improves as we include data from more days. Interestingly, when using the same features, the classifier trained from only the first few days is already as good as the classifier trained using full data, suggesting that the performance difference mainly lies in the difference between features.},

We conducted a survey with 40 urban knitters to identify the roles technologies play in their practices. The results illustrate how the participants use digital tools for personal inspiration, global collaboration, individual self-expression and collective meaning-making around their craft. Through discussing how technologies can re-contextualise creative craft practices, we contribute insights into how a wider understanding of hybrid craft is needed to embrace new design opportunities within this hybrid realm of urban citizenship.},

Our relationships to virtual realities, artificial intelligence, neuro-implants or pervasive, cyberphysical systems generate ontological uncertainties, epistemological diffusion and ethical conundrums that require us to consider evolving the current research paradigm. I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement HCI in response. I review selected theories—Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism—and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.},

abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a networking architecture where promising, intelligent services are designed via leveraging information from multiple heterogeneous sources of data within the network. However, the availability of such information in a timely manner requires processing and communication of raw data collected from these sources. Therefore, the economic feasibility of IoT-enabled networks relies on the efficient allocation of both computational and communication resources within the network. Since fog computing and 5G cellular networks approach this problem independently, there is a need for joint resource-provisioning of both communication and computational resources in the networks. As the solution to this problem, we propose a novel three-dimensional matching based resource provisioning algorithm that minimizes average service latency in the presence of various resource constraints, task deadlines and non-identical preferences at IoT devices, fog access points (FAPs) and small-cell access points (SAPs) in 5G networks. We prove the stability and termination of the proposed algorithm and also demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms through both, simulation and real-world experiments on the laboratory test-bed.},

abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are more and more integrated into everyday lives, both scholarly and popular discourses on AI's often revolve around charting the various risks that may be associated with them. The manner and magnitude of risk that various researchers identify and foresee varies; however, what is common between them is, undoubtedly, the concept of risk itself. This concept, we argue, has been largely taken for granted by the fields involved in the research on AI's; in other words, "risk" has been employed with an everyday sensibility without due critical examination. In this paper, we address risk as a concept directly, by examining interdisciplinary theories and literatures on risk to discuss examples of AI technologies. Through this work, we aim to begin a critical discussion of the importance of theorising risk within design research and practice, and within the development of emerging technologies.},

abstract = {The search for parking space in busy urban districts is one of those routine human activities that can benefit from the widespread adoption of pervasive sensing and radio communication technologies. Proposed parking assistance solutions combine sensors, either as fixed infrastructure or onboard vehicles, wireless networking technologies and mobile social applications running over smartphones to collect, share and present to drivers real-time information about parking availability and demand. One question that arises is how does (and should) the driver actually use such information to take parking decisions, e.g., whether to search for on-street parking space or drive to a parking lot and, in the latter case, which one. The paper is, hence, a performance analysis study that seeks to capture the highly behavioral and heuristic dimension of drivers' decisions and its impact on the efficiency of the parking search process. To this end we model drivers as agents of bounded rationality and consider lexicographic heuristics, an instance of the fast and frugal heuristics developed in behavioral sciences such as psychology and biology, as the mechanisms for their decisions.We analyze the performance of the search process under these heuristics and compare it against the predictions of normative game-theoretic models assuming fully rational strategically acting agents. We derive conditions under which the simpler heuristic decision-making rules outperform the complex norms and show their satisfaction under a broad range of scenarios concerning the fees charged for the parking resources and their distances from drivers' destinations. The practical implications of these results for parking assistance solutions are identified and thoroughly discussed.},

Specifically, we describe an end-to-end workflow that involves the collection of large numbers of timestamped (position, depth) measurements from "internet of floating things" devices on leisure vessels; the communication of data to cloud resources, via a specialized protocol capable of dealing with delayed, intermittent, or even disconnected networks; the integration of measurement data into cloud storage; the efficient correction and interpolation of measurements on a cloud computing platform; and the creation of a continuously updated bathymetric database. Our prototype implementation of this workflow leverages the FACE-IT Galaxy workflow engine to integrate network communication and database components with a CUDA-enabled algorithm running in a virtualized cloud environment.},

abstract = {A growing number of visual computing applications depend on the analysis of large video collections. The challenge is that scaling applications to operate on these datasets requires efficient systems for pixel data access and parallel processing across large numbers of machines. Few programmers have the capability to operate efficiently at these scales, limiting the field's ability to explore new applications that leverage big video data. In response, we have created Scanner, a system for productive and efficient video analysis at scale. Scanner organizes video collections as tables in a data store optimized for sampling frames from compressed video, and executes pixel processing computations, expressed as dataflow graphs, on these frames. Scanner schedules video analysis applications expressed using these abstractions onto heterogeneous throughput computing hardware, such as multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and media processing ASICs, for high-throughput pixel processing. We demonstrate the productivity of Scanner by authoring a variety of video processing applications including the synthesis of stereo VR video streams from multi-camera rigs, markerless 3D human pose reconstruction from video, and data-mining big video datasets such as hundreds of feature-length films or over 70,000 hours of TV news. These applications achieve near-expert performance on a single machine and scale efficiently to hundreds of machines, enabling formerly long-running big video data analysis tasks to be carried out in minutes to hours.},

In our second experiment, algorithmic decisions were perceived to be less fair than discussion-based decisions, dependent on participants' interpersonal power and computer programming knowledge. Our work suggests that for algorithmic mediation to be fair, algorithms and their interfaces should account for social and altruistic behaviors that may be difficult to define in mathematical terms.},

abstract = {The investigation in this article makes the following important contributions to combinatorial optimization of computation offloading in fog computing. First, we rigorously define the two problems of optimal computation offloading with energy constraint and optimal computation offloading with time constraint. We do this in such a way that between execution time and energy consumption, we can fix one and minimize the other. We prove that our optimization problems are NP-hard, even for very special cases. Second, we develop a unique and effective approach for solving the proposed combinatorial optimization problems, namely, a two-stage method. In the first stage, we generate a computation offloading strategy. In the second stage, we decide the computation speed and the communication speeds. This method is applicable to both optimization problems. Third, we use a simple yet efficient greedy method to produce a computation offloading strategy by taking all aspects into consideration, including the properties of the communication channels, the power consumption models of computation and communication, the tasks already assigned and allocated, and the characteristics of the current task being considered. Fourth, we experimentally evaluate the performance of our heuristic algorithms. We observe that while various heuristics do exhibit noticeably different performance, there can be a single and simple heuristic that can perform very well. Furthermore, the method of compound algorithm can be applied to obtain slightly improved performance. Fifth, we emphasize that our problems and algorithms can be easily extended to study combined performance and cost optimization (such as cost–performance ratio and weighted cost-performance sum optimization) and to accommodate more realistic and complicated fog computing environments (such as preloaded mobile edge servers and multiple users) with little extra effort. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no similar study in the existing fog computing literature.},

abstract = {Network navigation is a promising paradigm for enabling location awareness in dynamic wireless networks. A wireless navigation network consists of agents mobile with unknown locations and anchors possibly mobile with known locations. Agents can estimate their locations based on inter-and intra- node measurements as well as prior knowledge. With limited wireless resources, the key to achieve high navigation accuracy is to maximize the benefits of agents’ channel usage. Therefore, it is critical to design scheduling algorithms that adaptively determine with whom and when an agent should perform inter-node measurements to achieve both high navigation accuracy and efficient channel usage. This paper develops a framework for the design of distributed scheduling algorithms in asynchronous wireless navigation networks, under which the algorithm parameters are optimized based on the evolution of agents’ localization errors. Results show that the proposed algorithms lead to high-accuracy, efficient, and flexible network navigation.},

abstract = {Cloud computing has long been the main backbone that Internet of Things (IoT) devices rely on to accommodate their storage and analytical needs. However, the fact that cloud systems are often located quite far from the IoT devices and the emergence of delay-critical IoT applications urged the need for extending the cloud architecture to support delay-critical services. Given that fog nodes possess low resource capabilities compared to the cloud, matching the IoT services to appropriate fog nodes while guaranteeing minimal delay for IoT services and efficient resource utilization on fog nodes becomes quite challenging. In this context, the main limitation of existing approaches is addressing the scheduling problem from one side perspective, i.e., either fog nodes or IoT devices. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a multi-criteria intelligent IoT-Fog scheduling approach using game theory. Our solution consists of designing (1) preference functions for the IoT and fog layers to enable them to rank each other based on several criteria latency and resource utilization and (2) centralized and distributed intelligent scheduling algorithms that capitalize on matching theory and consider the preferences of both parties. Simulation results reveal that our solution outperforms the two common Min-Min and Max-Min scheduling approaches in terms of IoT services execution makespan and fog nodes resource consolidation efficiency.},

abstract = {As robots increasingly enter our everyday life, we envision a future in which robots are ubiquitous and interact with both ourselves and our environments. This paper introduces the concept of ubiquitous robotic interfaces (URIs), multi-robot interfaces capable of mobility, manipulation, sensing, display and interaction. URIs interact directly with the user and indirectly through surrounding objects. A key aspect of URIs is their ability to display information to users either by collectively forming shapes or through their movements. In this paper, we focus on the use of URIs to display information in ubiquitous settings. We first investigate the use of abstract motion as a display for URIs by studying human perception of abstract multi-robot motion. With ten small robots, we produced 42 videos of bio-inspired abstract motion by varying three parameters (7 x 2 x 3): bio-inspired behavior, speed and smoothness. In a crowdsourced between-subjects study, 1067 subjects were recruited to watch the videos and describe their perception through Likert scales and free text. Study results suggest that different bio-inspired behaviors elicit significantly different responses in arousal, dominance, hedonic and pragmatic qualities, animacy, urgency and willingness to attend. On the other hand, speed significantly affects valence, arousal, hedonic quality, urgency and animacy while smoothness affects hedonic quality, animacy, attractivity and likeability. We discuss how these results inform URI designers to formulate appropriate motion for different interaction scenarios and use these results to derive our own example applications using our URI platform, UbiSwarm.},

abstract = {In the last months, the market for personal wearable devices has been booming significantly, and, in particular, smartwatches are starting to assume a fundamental role in the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) arena as well as in the more general Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, by acting both as sensitive data sources and as user identity proxies. These new roles, complementing the more traditional personal assistance and telemetry/tracking ones, open new perspectives in their integration in complex IoT-based critical infrastructures such as e-payment, health care monitoring, and emergency systems, as well as in their usage as remote control facilities in smart services. Users can access their IoT devices at any time from any place through smartwatches. We argue that this new scenario calls for a strengthened and more resilient authentication of users on these devices, despite their limitations in terms of dimensions and hardware constraints that may considerably affect the usability of security mechanisms. In this article, we present an innovative authentication scheme targeted at smartwatches, namely CirclePIN, that provides both resilience to most common attacks and a high level of usability in tests with real users.},

abstract = { Born from a need for a pure “pay-per-use” model and highly scalable platform, the “Serverless” paradigm emerged and has the potential to become a dominant way of building cloud applications. Although it was originally designed for cloud environments, Serverless is finding its position in the Edge Computing landscape, aiming to bring computational resources closer to the data source. That is, Serverless is crossing cloud borders to assess its merits in Edge computing, whose principal partner will be the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This move sounds promising as Serverless brings particular benefits such as eliminating always-on services causing high electricity usage, for instance. However, the community is still hesitant to uptake Serverless Edge Computing because of the cloud-driven design of current Serverless platforms, and distinctive characteristics of edge landscape and IoT applications. In this paper, we evaluate both sides to shed light on the Serverless new territory. Our in-depth analysis promotes a broad vision for bringing Serverless to the Edge Computing. It also issues major challenges for Serverless to be met before entering Edge computing.},

abstract = {A biotic game integrates real biological materials and processes into digital/video gaming platforms. Given its relatively recent introduction to the field of game design, there are limited examples and discussions around biotic games to help designers to explore this genre in depth. This paper introduces a new type of biotic game called Mould Rush. It is a part-tangible, part-digital, online multiplayer strategy game, mostly driven by real-time growth of living micro-organisms. By outlining the design process of Mould Rush, the paper aims to use the game as a case study to highlight the opportunities and challenges that need to be addressed in creating games of this nature, speed, and scale. In particular, we suggest that the slowness of microbial growth may not necessarily compromise playing experience, but rather, enhance it instead. We also highlight the complexity of human, biology and computer interaction pathways that are involved in biotic gaming. And finally, we acknowledge the potential value of designing formal evaluation models that would help in meaningful evaluation of a 'biotic' gaming experience.},

abstract = {A Point of Interest (POI) refers to a specific location that people may find useful or interesting. While a large body of research has been focused on identifying and recommending POIs, there are few studies on characterizing the life cycle of POIs. Indeed, a comprehensive understanding of POI life cycle can be helpful for various tasks, such as urban planning, business site selection, and real estate evaluation. In this paper, we develop a framework, named POLIP, for characterizing the POI life cycle with multiple data sources. Specifically, to investigate the POI evolution process over time, we first formulate a serial classification problem to predict the life status of POIs. The prediction approach is designed to integrate two important perspectives: 1) the spatial-temporal dependencies associated with the prosperity of POIs, and 2) the human mobility dynamics hidden in the citywide taxicab data related to the POIs at multiple granularity levels. In addition, based on the predicted life statuses in successive time windows for a given POI, we design an algorithm to characterize its life cycle. Finally, we performed extensive experiments using large-scale and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the feasibility in automatic characterizing POI life cycle and shed important light on future research directions.},

abstract = {Neural machine translation NMT has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many translation tasks. However, because the computational cost increases with the size of the search space for predicting the target words, the translation quality of NMT is constrained by the limited vocabulary. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel dynamic hierarchical decoder for NMT to utilize all of the target words in the training and decoding process. In the proposed model, a target word is represented by two latent attribute vectors rather than a word vector.&nbsp;The model is trained to dynamically put together those words that share similar linguistic attributes. The prediction of a target word is, therefore, turned into the prediction of attribute vectors, where the $mathrm{softmax}$ functions are performed at the attribute level. This greatly reduces the model size and the decoding time.&nbsp;Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the NMT baselines in both Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks.},

In particular, an intrinsic Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is implemented in the peripheral network module of a tri-band commercial off-the-shelf router. Subsequently, we demonstrate the robustness of this PUF to ambient temperature variations and to limited natural aging, and examine in detail its potential for securing the next generation of IoT networks and other applications. Finally, the security of the proposed PUF-based schemes is briefly assessed and discussed.},

abstract = {Governments around the world are investing many resources to develop ubiquitous governance networks and information systems; this is seen as the advent of Digital Era Governance (DEG). Government websites or service platforms are replacing the physical offices of government department and in-person state-citizen interactions. It is a transformative shift in not only the workings of the State but also a change in the overall governance ecosystem. Citizens' role as co-creators and participants in policy and initiative design is increasing, and there is a general push for collaborative e-governance.With this study, we attempt to explore how governments can ensure accountability by design and policy, i.e., Digital Accountability in these websites or platforms that are going to act as a one-stop shop for citizens regarding government services. We have taken a multi-method approach to explore the various constituent factors that help build up accountability in any e-government process or websites delivering web services. Best Worst Method (BWM) is employed to find the relative weights of these factors in the chosen context. These are validated using qualitative techniques of Total Interpretative structural modelling, and the Matrix of Cross Impact Multiplications Applied to Classification (TISM-MICMAC). We have also attempted to explore the contextual relationships between these factors and how do they help conceptualise and operationalise digital accountability for e-governance.},

abstract = {Early fusion techniques have been proposed in video analysis tasks as a way to improve efficacy by generating compact data models capable of keeping semantic clues present on multimodal data. First attempts to fuse multimodal data employed fusion operators at low-level feature space, losing data representativeness. This drove later research efforts to evolve simple operators to complex operations, which became, in general, inseparable of the multimodal semantic clues processing. In this paper, we investigate the application of early multimodal fusion operators at the mid-level feature space. Five different operators (Concatenation, Sum, Gram, Average and Maximum) were employed to fuse mid-level multimodal video features. Fused data derived from each operator were then used as input for two different video analysis tasks: Temporal Video Scene Segmentation and Video Classification. For each task, we performed a comparative analysis among the operators and related work techniques designed for these tasks using complex fusion operations. The efficacy results reached by the operators were very close to those reached by the techniques, pointing out strong evidence that working on a more homogeneous feature space can reduce known low-level fusion drawbacks. In addition, operators make data fusion separable, allowing researchers to keep the focus on developing semantic clues representations.},

abstract = {The diffusion of heterogeneous smart devices capable of capturing and analysing data about users, and/or the environment, has encouraged the growth of novel sensing methodologies. One of the most attractive scenarios in which such devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, or activity trackers, can be exploited to infer relevant information is human activity recognition (HAR). Even though some simple HAR techniques can be directly implemented on mobile devices, in some cases, such as when complex activities need to be analysed timely, users’ smart devices can operate as part of a more complex architecture. In this article, we propose a multi-device HAR framework that exploits the fog computing paradigm to move heavy computation from the sensing layer to intermediate devices and then to the cloud. As compared to traditional cloud-based solutions, this choice allows to overcome processing and storage limitations of wearable devices while also reducing the overall bandwidth consumption. Experimental analysis aims to evaluate the performance of the entire platform in terms of accuracy of the recognition process while also highlighting the benefits it might bring in smart environments.},

abstract = {The localness inference problem is to identify whether a person is a local resident in a city or not and the likelihood of a venue to attract local people. This information is critical for many applications such as targeted ads of local business, urban planning, localized news and travel recommendations. While there are prior work on geo-locating people in a city using supervised learning approaches, the accuracy of those techniques largely depends on a high quality training dataset, which is difficult and expensive to obtain in practice. In this study, we propose to exploit spatial-temporal-social constraints from noisy online social media data to solve the localness inference problem using an unsupervised approach. The spatial-temporal constraint represents the correlations between people and venues they visit and the social constraint represents social connections between people. In particular, we develop a Spatial-Temporal-Social-Aware (STSA) inference framework to jointly infer i) the localness of a person and ii) the local attractiveness of a venue without requiring any training data. We evaluate the performance of STSA scheme using three real-world datasets collected from Foursquare. Experimental results show that STSA scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques by significantly improving the estimation accuracy.},

abstract = {The field of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is experiencing rapid strides in the use of Industry 4.0 technologies and the conceptualization of new supply chain configurations for online retail, sustainable and green supply chains, and the Circular Economy. Thus, there is an increasing impetus to use simulation techniques such as discrete-event simulation, agent-based simulation, and hybrid simulation in the context of SCM. In conventional supply chain simulation, the underlying constituents of the system like manufacturing, distribution, retail, and logistics processes are often modelled and executed as a single model. Unlike this conventional approach, a distributed supply chain simulation (DSCS) enables the coordinated execution of simulation models using specialist software. To understand the current state-of-the-art of DSCS, this paper presents a methodological review and categorization of literature in DSCS using a framework-based approach. Through a study of over 130 articles, we report on the motivation for using DSCS, the modelling techniques, the underlying distributed computing technologies and middleware, its advantages and a future agenda, and also limitations and trade-offs that may be associated with this approach. The increasing adoption of technologies like Internet-of-Things and Cloud Computing will ensure the availability of both data and models for distributed decision-making, which is likely to enable data-driven DSCS of the future. This review aims to inform organizational stakeholders, simulation researchers and practitioners, distributed systems developers and software vendors, as to the current state-of-the art of DSCS, and which will inform the development of future DSCS using new applied computing approaches.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications, systems and services are subject to law. We argue that for the IoT to develop lawfully, there must be technical mechanisms that allow the enforcement of specified policy, such that systems align with legal realities. The audit of policy enforcement must assist the apportionment of liability, demonstrate compliance with regulation, and indicate whether policy correctly captures legal responsibilities. As both systems and obligations evolve dynamically, this cycle must be continuously maintained.This poses a huge challenge given the global scale of the IoT vision. The IoT entails dynamically creating new services through managed and flexible data exchange. Data management is complex in this dynamic environment, given the need to both control and share information, often across federated domains of administration.We see middleware playing a key role in managing the IoT. Our vision is for a middleware-enforced, unified policy model that applies end-to-end, throughout the IoT. This is because policy cannot be bound to things, applications, or administrative domains, since functionality is the result of composition, with dynamically formed chains of data flows.We have investigated the use of Information Flow Control (IFC) to manage and audit data flows in cloud computing; a domain where trust can be well-founded, regulations are more mature and associated responsibilities clearer. We feel that IFC has great potential in the broader IoT context. However, the sheer scale and the dynamic, federated nature of the IoT pose a number of significant research challenges.},

The increasing level of automation in vehicles introduces novel challenges and opportunities for pedestrian-vehicle interaction, e.g external displays attached to automated vehicles. However, these approaches are hardly scalable and fail to provide clear information in a multi-user environment. We investigate whether a smartphone app could provide individual guidance to enhance pedestrian safety in future traffic. To this end, we tested three app concepts in a user study (N=24) and found that on-screen guidance increases the frequency of successful crossing decisions significantly. In addition, all participants indicated that they would use the proposed system, preferably with an unobtrusive colored bar indicating the safest crossing decision in real-time. Integrating smartphones into the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians could increase situational awareness while crossing roads, solve the scalability problem and thus foster pedestrian safety in future traffic scenarios.},

The transportation mode will be inferred from the structured hierarchical contexts associated with human activities. Through our mobile context recognition system, an accurate and robust solution can be obtained to infer transportation mode, human activity and their associated contexts (e.g. whether the user is in moving or stationary environment) simultaneously. There are many challenges in analysing and modelling human mobility patterns within urban areas due to the ever-changing environments of mobile users. For instance, a user could stay at a particular location and then travel to various destinations depending on the tasks they carry within a day. Consequently, there is a need to reduce the reliance on location-based sensors (e.g. GPS), since they consume a significant amount of energy on smart devices, for the purpose of intelligent mobile sensing (i.e. automatic inference of transportation mode, human activity and associated contexts). Nevertheless, our system is capable of outperforming the simplistic approach that only considers independent classifications of multiple context label sets on data streamed from low-energy sensors.},

abstract = {Some of the most widely deployed IoT devices in urban areas are smartphones in the possession of urban individuals. Their proliferation has led to the emergence of crowdsensing/crowdsourcing services, where humans collect data about their environment (using phones), and servers aggregate the data for various application purposes of interest. With the emergence of social media, a common alternative form of human data entry has become media posts (e.g., on Twitter). This leads to the prospect of building crowdsensing services on top of social media content, exploiting humans as "sensors". In this paper, we develop one such service, called StoryLine. The service detects and tracks physical urban events of interest to the user, such as car accidents, infrastructure damage (in the aftermath of a natural disaster), or instances of civil unrest. It offers an interface to client-side software that allows browsing such events in real time, as well as an interface for software applications to a structured representation of the events and their related statistics. The service embodies novel algorithms for real-time detection, demultiplexing, and tracking of physical events using social media data. In our evaluation with Twitter feeds, we show that our service outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines in event detection and demultiplexing. We also conduct two case-studies to show the effectiveness of the real-time event detection capability and event tracking performance of our system.},

abstract = {Geo-distributed systems ranging from databases to cyber-physical applications increasingly rely on a shared and precise notion of time to achieve coordination. This is especially true for cyber-physical applications ranging from local-scale robotic-coordination and city-scale traffic management to regional/planetary-scale smart grids. Each of these applications utilizes event orderings and timing offsets to make real-time decisions, so as to perform coordinated action at their distributed endpoints. The emergence of edge computing, specifically to facilitate low-latency decision-making, is leveraging the trend where multiple cyber-physical and software applications with different timing requirements will coexist in both the cloud and at the edge. To enable such fault-tolerant time-based coordinated applications running on multi-tenant geo-scale infrastructure, we introduce the Quartz framework, which exposes Time-as-a-Service. Quartz allows geo-distributed application components to each specify its timing requirements, while it autonomously orchestrates the underlying infrastructure to meet them. Centered around a shared virtualized notion of time, based on the time-line abstraction [1], Quartz provides an API which makes it easy to develop time-based geo-distributed applications. Using this API, Quartz feeds back the timing uncertainty, i.e., the delivered Quality of Time (QoT) [1] back to each application, enabling it to be fault-tolerant in the face of clock-synchronization failure. Quartz is designed for containerized applications, features a distributed architecture and is implemented using containerized micro-services. Experimental evaluations on real-world embedded, edge and cloud platforms highlight the performance and scalability of our architecture.},

abstract = {As mobile devices and location-based services become increasingly ubiquitous, the privacy of mobile users' location traces continues to be a major concern. Traditional privacy solutions rely on perturbing each position in a user's trace and replacing it with a fake location. However, recent studies have shown that such point-based perturbation of locations is susceptible to inference attacks and suffers from serious utility losses, because it disregards the moving trajectory and continuity in full location traces. In this paper, we argue that privacy-preserving synthesis of complete location traces can be an effective solution to this problem. We present AdaTrace, a scalable location trace synthesizer with three novel features: provable statistical privacy, deterministic attack resilience, and strong utility preservation. AdaTrace builds a generative model from a given set of real traces through a four-phase synthesis process consisting of feature extraction, synopsis learning, privacy and utility preserving noise injection, and generation of differentially private synthetic location traces. The output traces crafted by AdaTrace preserve utility-critical information existing in real traces, and are robust against known location trace attacks. We validate the effectiveness of AdaTrace by comparing it with three state of the art approaches (ngram, DPT, and SGLT) using real location trace datasets (Geolife and Taxi) as well as a simulated dataset of 50,000 vehicles in Oldenburg, Germany. AdaTrace offers up to 3-fold improvement in trajectory utility, and is orders of magnitude faster than previous work, while preserving differential privacy and attack resilience.},

abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has engendered a new paradigm of integrated sensing and actuation systems for intelligent monitoring and control of smart homes and buildings. One viable manifestation is that of IoT-empowered smart lighting systems, which rely on the interplay between smart light bulbs (equipped with controllable LED devices and wireless connectivity) and mobile sensors (possibly embedded in users’ wearable devices such as smart watches, spectacles, and gadgets) to provide automated illuminance control functions tailored to users’ preferences (e.g., of brightness, color intensity, or color temperature). Typically, practical deployment of these systems precludes the adoption of sophisticated but costly location-aware sensors capable of accurately mapping out the details of a dynamic operational environment. Instead, cheap oblivious mobile sensors are often utilized, which are plagued with uncertainty in their relative locations to sensors and light bulbs. The imposed volatility, in turn, impedes the design of effective smart lighting systems for uncertain indoor environments with multiple sensors and light bulbs. With this in view, the present article sheds light on the adaptive control algorithms and modeling of such systems. First, a general model formulation of an oblivious multisensor illuminance control problem is proposed, yielding a robust framework agnostic to a dynamic surrounding environment and time-varying background light sources. Under this model, we devise efficient algorithms inducing continuous adaptive lighting control that minimizes energy consumption of light bulbs while meeting users’ preferences. The algorithms are then studied under extensive empirical evaluations in a proof-of-concept smart lighting testbed featuring LIFX programmable bulbs and smartphones (deployed as light sensing units). Lastly, we conclude by discussing the potential improvements in hardware development and highlighting promising directions for future work.},

abstract = {To protect under-represented and marginalized workers from the upcoming automation boom, it is imperative to critically examine the past technological breakthroughs and their impacts on workers. In the last two decades of the twentieth century, computer-aided newspaper production technology gradually started becoming popular in Bangladesh, making the traditional hot metal typesetting technology obsolete. The typesetters, who relied on manual labor and a very basic level of literacy, experienced mass layoffs and had to adapt to new technology to survive in their profession. In this work, we interviewed 17 typesetters from that period to understand their technology adoption dynamics. Our findings reveal that despite a few success stories, most of the typesetters failed to adopt and gradually went into oblivion, mainly because of local infrastructural issues. We connect our findings to broader issues of culture, politics, and economics and provide concrete suggestions and policy recommendations to protect more than six million workers who are vulnerable to technology-induced job displacement in the next 20 years in Bangladesh.},
